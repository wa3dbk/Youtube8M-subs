00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
the game and it makes it look like it's

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:41.199 
the game and it makes it look like it's
really<00:02:38.120> fast<00:02:38.359> pace<00:02:38.659> I<00:02:39.250> hope<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.760> game<00:02:41.030> is

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
really fast pace I hope this game is

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.410 
really fast pace I hope this game is
fast<00:02:41.450> paced<00:02:41.650> that's<00:02:42.650> really<00:02:42.980> what<00:02:43.579> I<00:02:43.849> want<00:02:44.390> a

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
fast paced that's really what I want a

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.569 
fast paced that's really what I want a
decent<00:02:44.629> balance<00:02:45.049> but<00:02:45.440> even<00:02:45.680> like<00:02:45.890> model<00:02:46.400> 42

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:46.579 
decent balance but even like model 42

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:48.009 
decent balance but even like model 42
wasn't<00:02:46.970> balanced<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:47.420> game<00:02:47.569> was<00:02:47.690> still<00:02:47.840> fun

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
wasn't balanced that game was still fun

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.479 
wasn't balanced that game was still fun
to<00:02:48.049> me<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:48.440> balanced<00:02:48.769> really<00:02:48.980> isn't<00:02:49.250> even<00:02:49.430> that

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
to me so balanced really isn't even that

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.490 
to me so balanced really isn't even that

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.390 
but I I want fun more than I want simple
so<00:03:23.959> if<00:03:24.019> it's<00:03:24.169> fun<00:03:24.379> in<00:03:24.530> it<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:24.919> it's<00:03:25.099> crazy

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
so if it's fun in it and it's crazy

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.170 
so if it's fun in it and it's crazy
that's<00:03:25.669> that's<00:03:26.030> good<00:03:26.239> enough<00:03:26.419> for<00:03:26.480> me<00:03:26.780> and<00:03:28.180> so

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
that's that's good enough for me and so

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.720 
that's that's good enough for me and so
there<00:03:29.480> is<00:03:29.629> the<00:03:29.870> the<00:03:30.590> jetpack<00:03:31.069> jumping<00:03:31.579> the

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
there is the the jetpack jumping the

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.970 
there is the the jetpack jumping the
boosted<00:03:32.239> jumping<00:03:32.720> there's<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.560> know<00:03:33.620> laser

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
boosted jumping there's you know laser

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.909

weapons and there's crazy kill streaks

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.699 
weapons and there's crazy kill streaks
and<00:03:37.569> it's<00:03:38.569> definitely<00:03:38.900> very<00:03:39.169> futuristic

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
and it's definitely very futuristic

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.430 
and it's definitely very futuristic
sci-fi<00:03:40.310> looking<00:03:40.970> that<00:03:41.660> doesn't<00:03:41.989> really<00:03:42.139> scare

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
sci-fi looking that doesn't really scare

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.710 
sci-fi looking that doesn't really scare
me<00:03:42.650> away<00:03:42.709> because<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:44.120> made<00:03:44.389> me<00:03:44.540> nervous

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
me away because that made me nervous

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.150

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
titanfall and one of the things I said

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.280 
titanfall and one of the things I said
about<00:03:48.889> titanfall<00:03:49.400> could<00:03:50.329> not<00:03:50.540> do<00:03:50.720> the<00:03:50.840> piece<00:03:51.079> I

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
about titanfall could not do the piece I

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
can't believe his knife worked one of

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.710 
can't believe his knife worked one of
the<00:03:55.190> things<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:55.549> said<00:03:55.790> about<00:03:55.819> titanfall<00:03:56.329> was<00:03:56.569> I

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
the things I said about titanfall was I

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.000 
the things I said about titanfall was I
actually<00:03:56.870> wished<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.409> had<00:03:57.530> a<00:03:57.560> little<00:03:57.709> bit<00:03:57.889> more

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
actually wished it had a little bit more

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.580 
actually wished it had a little bit more
cod<00:03:58.310> in<00:03:58.519> it<00:03:58.609> and<00:03:58.760> its<00:03:58.909> pacing<00:03:59.419> the<00:04:00.230> pace<00:04:00.409> was

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
cod in it and its pacing the pace was

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.039 
cod in it and its pacing the pace was
fast<00:04:00.889> for<00:04:01.159> titanfall<00:04:01.489> but<00:04:01.790> sometimes<00:04:02.269> I<00:04:02.540> just

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
fast for titanfall but sometimes I just

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.990 
fast for titanfall but sometimes I just
wish<00:04:03.349> like<00:04:03.409> you<00:04:03.889> had<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.129> smaller<00:04:04.430> maps<00:04:04.699> and

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
wish like you had the smaller maps and

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.539

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
and apparently there are customizable

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.800 
and apparently there are customizable
killstreaks<00:04:41.700> that<00:04:42.120> you<00:04:42.240> can<00:04:42.390> make<00:04:42.510> stronger

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
killstreaks that you can make stronger

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.990 
killstreaks that you can make stronger
over<00:04:43.110> time<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.710> can<00:04:43.740> share<00:04:44.280> killstreaks<00:04:44.880> with

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
over time you can share killstreaks with

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.120 
over time you can share killstreaks with
people<00:04:45.270> so<00:04:45.420> if<00:04:45.480> I'm<00:04:45.660> up<00:04:45.870> in<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.680> know<00:04:46.710> the<00:04:46.950> low

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
people so if I'm up in you know the low

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.340 
people so if I'm up in you know the low
key<00:04:47.310> i<00:04:47.370> think<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.730> Loki's<00:04:48.060> coming<00:04:48.360> back<00:04:48.510> you

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
key i think the Loki's coming back you

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:50.870 
key i think the Loki's coming back you
can<00:04:49.530> actually<00:04:49.680> jump<00:04:50.010> up<00:04:50.160> in<00:04:50.310> one<00:04:50.460> of<00:04:50.490> the<00:04:50.670> the
