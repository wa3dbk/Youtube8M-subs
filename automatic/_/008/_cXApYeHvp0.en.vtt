00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
organize it um yeah so they're basically

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.920 
organize it um yeah so they're basically
the<00:00:34.239> right<00:00:34.570> sign<00:00:34.989> is<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:36.309> bottom<00:00:36.910> check<00:00:37.180> so<00:00:37.839> as

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
the right sign is the bottom check so as

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.200 
the right sign is the bottom check so as

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
you see i have wood wood stuff so this

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.119 
you see i have wood wood stuff so this
would<00:00:40.360> be<00:00:40.799> logs<00:00:41.799> planks<00:00:42.460> doors<00:00:43.470> signs<00:00:44.470> ladders

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
would be logs planks doors signs ladders

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.000
