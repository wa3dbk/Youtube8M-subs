00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
chassis to get the kind of heat sink in

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.160 
chassis to get the kind of heat sink in
here<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.800> it's<00:00:56.460> been<00:00:56.610> working<00:00:56.760> pretty<00:00:57.120> well<00:00:57.270> I

that's<00:01:23.400> pretty<00:01:23.729> much<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.500> ended<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.650> locking

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
that's pretty much it I ended up locking

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.580 
that's pretty much it I ended up locking
the<00:01:26.460> diff<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.270> show<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.689> guys<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.409> I

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
ended up locking the rear diff but not

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350 
ended up locking the rear diff but not
the<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.500> in<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> front<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the one in the front so the one in the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.960 
the one in the front so the one in the
front<00:01:33.540> still<00:01:34.020> works<00:01:34.259> like<00:01:34.530> normal<00:01:34.979> but<00:01:35.369> I

tinted<00:03:25.979> these<00:03:26.129> windows<00:03:26.549> myself<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.329> use<00:03:27.510> this

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
tinted these windows myself I use this

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.589 
tinted these windows myself I use this
to<00:03:28.260> me<00:03:28.409> a<00:03:28.440> paint<00:03:28.859> so<00:03:29.729> that<00:03:29.760> they<00:03:30.239> would<00:03:30.419> be<00:03:30.449> a

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 
to me a paint so that they would be a

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:34.309 
to me a paint so that they would be a
little<00:03:30.690> bit<00:03:31.079> see-through<00:03:31.379> in<00:03:31.859> the<00:03:32.639> light<00:03:33.319> but

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
little bit see-through in the light but

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:40.009 
little bit see-through in the light but
not<00:03:34.530> too<00:03:34.979> see-through<00:03:37.250> yeah<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.699> that's<00:03:39.690> the

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
not too see-through yeah so that's the

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.640 
not too see-through yeah so that's the
body<00:03:40.549> for<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.699> Tamiya<00:03:42.120> then<00:03:42.930> we<00:03:43.079> have<00:03:43.260> here

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
body for the Tamiya then we have here

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.699 
body for the Tamiya then we have here
the<00:03:43.949> Rustler<00:03:44.519> bows<00:03:44.940> wrestler<00:03:45.540> it's<00:03:46.409> in<00:03:46.500> really

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
the Rustler bows wrestler it's in really

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.969 
the Rustler bows wrestler it's in really
rough<00:03:46.859> condition<00:03:47.099> there's<00:03:47.909> no<00:03:47.970> sirvo<00:03:48.840> in<00:03:49.139> here

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:49.979 
rough condition there's no sirvo in here

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.379 
rough condition there's no sirvo in here
the<00:03:50.250> esc<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.269> once<00:03:51.540> again<00:03:51.690> broken<00:03:52.699> I<00:03:53.699> think

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
the esc is once again broken I think

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.819 
the esc is once again broken I think
there's<00:03:54.569> some<00:03:54.690> other<00:03:54.810> problems<00:03:55.290> with<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.620> too

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829

the<00:04:39.539> Badlands<00:04:39.960> in<00:04:40.169> the<00:04:40.259> back<00:04:40.470> and<00:04:40.710> then<00:04:40.830> the

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
the Badlands in the back and then the

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.820 
the Badlands in the back and then the
stock<00:04:41.310> in<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.639> front<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.560> here<00:04:43.560> in<00:04:43.800> the

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
stock in the front and here in the

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.510 
stock in the front and here in the
basement<00:04:44.750> we<00:04:45.750> had<00:04:45.990> a<00:04:46.020> drift<00:04:46.470> track<00:04:46.800> going<00:04:47.340> on

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
basement we had a drift track going on

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.930 
basement we had a drift track going on
so<00:04:48.150> what<00:04:49.050> we<00:04:49.169> actually<00:04:49.350> did<00:04:49.830> was<00:04:50.250> tape<00:04:50.669> up<00:04:50.910> the

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
so what we actually did was tape up the

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.590 
so what we actually did was tape up the
tires<00:04:51.360> and<00:04:51.810> drift<00:04:52.259> these<00:04:52.759> until<00:04:53.759> we<00:04:54.030> got<00:04:54.240> the

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
tires and drift these until we got the

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.620 
tires and drift these until we got the
tamiya<00:04:55.440> ones<00:04:55.770> so<00:04:56.639> it<00:04:56.880> was<00:04:57.000> a<00:04:57.030> lot<00:04:57.210> of<00:04:57.270> fun<00:04:57.389> to

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
tamiya ones so it was a lot of fun to

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.719 
tamiya ones so it was a lot of fun to
just<00:04:57.810> drift<00:04:58.080> them<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.590> play<00:04:59.070> around<00:04:59.220> and

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
just drift them and play around and

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.420 
just drift them and play around and
stuff<00:05:00.000> but<00:05:00.530> now<00:05:01.530> we<00:05:01.590> want<00:05:01.919> to<00:05:02.039> look<00:05:02.190> into

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
stuff but now we want to look into

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.249 
stuff but now we want to look into
fixing<00:05:02.940> this<00:05:03.300> up<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.750> getting<00:05:03.930> it<00:05:04.110> working

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
fixing this up and getting it working

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.379 
fixing this up and getting it working
again<00:05:04.620> because<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.220> haven't<00:05:05.550> driven<00:05:05.849> it<00:05:06.210> in

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:06.389 
again because I haven't driven it in

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.170 
again because I haven't driven it in
quite<00:05:06.780> a<00:05:06.840> long<00:05:06.990> time<00:05:07.520> so<00:05:08.520> I'm<00:05:08.729> going<00:05:08.910> to<00:05:08.970> have

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
quite a long time so I'm going to have

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.439 
quite a long time so I'm going to have
to<00:05:09.210> make<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.020> parts<00:05:10.590> two<00:05:10.889> parts<00:05:11.820> list<00:05:12.090> to<00:05:12.270> see

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
to make a parts two parts list to see

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:18.460 
to make a parts two parts list to see
what<00:05:12.630> I<00:05:12.660> can<00:05:12.810> fix<00:05:13.229> and<00:05:15.139> yeah<00:05:16.139> so<00:05:16.970> that's<00:05:17.970> just

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
what I can fix and yeah so that's just

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.790 
what I can fix and yeah so that's just
normal<00:05:19.470> /<00:05:20.220> I<00:05:20.669> actually<00:05:21.360> ended<00:05:21.960> up<00:05:22.320> and<00:05:22.560> I<00:05:22.620> don't

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
normal / I actually ended up and I don't

know<00:05:22.860> how<00:05:23.009> I<00:05:23.039> did<00:05:23.310> this<00:05:23.520> but<00:05:24.180> I<00:05:24.979> managed<00:05:25.979> to

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
know how I did this but I managed to

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:28.909 
know how I did this but I managed to
somehow<00:05:26.370> crack<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.880> chassis<00:05:27.690> right<00:05:28.349> here<00:05:28.770> and
