that<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.720> think<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.320> like<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.470> five<00:02:14.740> year<00:02:15.070> or

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
that I think it's like a five year or

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.730 
that I think it's like a five year or
something<00:02:15.640> and<00:02:18.480> that's<00:02:19.480> an<00:02:19.990> external<00:02:20.440> hard

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
something and that's an external hard

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.620 
something and that's an external hard
drive<00:02:20.800> you're<00:02:21.280> gonna<00:02:21.400> use<00:02:21.610> it<00:02:21.760> for<00:02:21.790> backup

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
drive you're gonna use it for backup

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.050 
drive you're gonna use it for backup
I<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:24.400> would<00:02:24.910> not<00:02:25.800> want<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:27.700> going<00:02:27.910> out

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
I really would not want to going out

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.490 
I really would not want to going out
period<00:02:28.690> like<00:02:29.500> at<00:02:29.770> all

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
period like at all

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
period like at all
it's<00:02:32.500> got<00:02:32.710> to<00:02:32.830> be<00:02:32.920> a<00:02:32.950> little<00:02:33.160> bit<00:02:33.370> more

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
it's got to be a little bit more

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.460 
it's got to be a little bit more
dependable<00:02:36.840> and<00:02:37.840> if<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:37.990> check<00:02:38.200> out<00:02:38.290> my

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
dependable and if you check out my

videos<00:02:41.020> where<00:02:41.670> we<00:02:42.670> talk<00:02:42.880> about<00:02:43.000> different

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
videos where we talk about different

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.780 
videos where we talk about different
ways<00:02:43.780> of<00:02:44.530> backing<00:02:44.920> up<00:02:45.010> data<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.370> stuff<00:02:45.640> like

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
ways of backing up data and stuff like

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.230 
ways of backing up data and stuff like
that

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
that

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.470 
that
alright<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.470> hence<00:02:48.070> the<00:02:48.250> name<00:02:48.430> technology<00:02:49.270> Big

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
alright so hence the name technology Big

00:02:49.480 --> 00:03:00.230 
alright so hence the name technology Big
John<00:02:49.780> technology<00:02:50.560> all<00:02:51.130> right<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:58.180> we<00:02:58.630> have

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
John technology all right so we have

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.830 
John technology all right so we have
assuming<00:03:01.240> this<00:03:01.390> is<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.780> adapter<00:03:02.560> I<00:03:03.840> think

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
assuming this is the adapter I think

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.750 
assuming this is the adapter I think
this<00:03:05.020> is<00:03:05.170> one<00:03:05.380> of<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:05.560> reasons<00:03:06.010> why<00:03:06.280> it<00:03:06.700> was

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
this is one of the reasons why it was

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.370 
this is one of the reasons why it was
recommended<00:03:07.690> for<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.990> WiiU<00:03:09.660> this<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:10.930> USB

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
recommended for the WiiU this is the USB

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.000 
recommended for the WiiU this is the USB
3.0<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.100> it's<00:03:12.220> not<00:03:12.370> a<00:03:12.400> basic<00:03:12.850> USB<00:03:13.270> 3.0<00:03:13.840> or<00:03:14.170> is

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
3.0 and it's not a basic USB 3.0 or is

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.180 
3.0 and it's not a basic USB 3.0 or is
it<00:03:15.959> not<00:03:16.959> entirely<00:03:17.350> sure<00:03:19.800> I'm<00:03:20.800> not<00:03:20.950> entirely

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
it not entirely sure I'm not entirely

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.030 
it not entirely sure I'm not entirely
sure<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.580> USB<00:03:21.910> 3.0<00:03:22.470> cables<00:03:23.470> look<00:03:23.680> this<00:03:23.830> way

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
sure the USB 3.0 cables look this way

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.090 
sure the USB 3.0 cables look this way
I've<00:03:24.160> never<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:25.800> don't<00:03:26.800> know<00:03:26.860> if<00:03:26.950> I've<00:03:27.070> ever

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
I've never I don't know if I've ever

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.160 
I've never I don't know if I've ever
seen<00:03:27.580> one

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
seen one

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.380 
seen one
alright<00:03:29.170> so<00:03:29.890> one<00:03:30.340> of<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.490> main<00:03:30.850> reasons<00:03:31.300> is

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
alright so one of the main reasons is

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.390 
alright so one of the main reasons is
recommended<00:03:31.959> for<00:03:31.990> the<00:03:32.140> Wii<00:03:32.290> U<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.740> because<00:03:33.190> it

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
recommended for the Wii U is because it

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.440 
recommended for the Wii U is because it
has<00:03:33.520> its<00:03:34.030> own<00:03:34.360> power<00:03:34.990> source<00:03:35.910> if<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:36.970> use<00:03:37.420> a

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
has its own power source if you use a

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.000 
has its own power source if you use a
hard<00:03:38.230> drive<00:03:38.500> on<00:03:38.860> the<00:03:39.190> original<00:03:40.090> we've<00:03:41.010> you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
hard drive on the original we've you

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.310 
hard drive on the original we've you
notice<00:03:42.400> that<00:03:42.610> only<00:03:43.120> one<00:03:43.510> of<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.720> ports<00:03:44.110> in<00:03:44.290> the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
notice that only one of the ports in the

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.979 
notice that only one of the ports in the
back<00:03:44.520> actually<00:03:45.520> provides<00:03:46.060> enough<00:03:46.390> power<00:03:46.420> for

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
back actually provides enough power for

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.830 
back actually provides enough power for
a<00:03:47.050> hard<00:03:47.320> drive<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:49.030> I'll<00:03:49.239> be<00:03:49.360> making<00:03:49.510> another

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
a hard drive and I'll be making another

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.390 
a hard drive and I'll be making another
video<00:03:50.050> about<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.830> if<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.100> want<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.280> check

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
video about that if you want to check

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.690 
video about that if you want to check
that<00:03:51.550> out<00:03:51.670> on<00:03:51.700> my<00:03:51.880> channel<00:03:53.459> when<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:54.520> hooked

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
that out on my channel when I hooked

00:03:54.700 --> 00:04:00.830 
that out on my channel when I hooked
this<00:03:54.820> up<00:03:56.580> alright<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:57.820> you<00:03:57.940> have<00:03:58.239> your

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.580 

guarantee<00:04:01.840> there<00:04:03.540> just<00:04:04.540> quick<00:04:04.840> startup<00:04:05.350> guide

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
guarantee there just quick startup guide

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.890 
guarantee there just quick startup guide
which<00:04:06.070> is<00:04:06.250> as<00:04:06.700> I'm<00:04:07.030> assuming<00:04:07.450> it's<00:04:07.570> pretty

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
which is as I'm assuming it's pretty

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.110 
which is as I'm assuming it's pretty
simple<00:04:08.560> oh<00:04:08.820> look<00:04:09.820> at<00:04:09.940> that

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
simple oh look at that

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.420 
simple oh look at that
I<00:04:12.180> don't<00:04:13.180> warm<00:04:13.840> with<00:04:14.020> that<00:04:14.200> ok<00:04:14.709> so<00:04:14.770> let's<00:04:15.280> take

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
I don't warm with that ok so let's take

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.910 
I don't warm with that ok so let's take
a<00:04:15.489> look<00:04:15.670> at<00:04:15.850> it<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.060> looks

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
a look at it it looks

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.490 
a look at it it looks
feels<00:04:17.550> really<00:04:17.880> solid<00:04:18.150> I'm<00:04:18.840> not<00:04:19.020> sure<00:04:19.200> exactly

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
feels really solid I'm not sure exactly

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.120 
feels really solid I'm not sure exactly
how<00:04:19.770> many<00:04:19.800> drives<00:04:20.310> are<00:04:20.580> in<00:04:20.790> there<00:04:21.530> how<00:04:22.530> they

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
how many drives are in there how they

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.450 
how many drives are in there how they
set<00:04:23.370> this<00:04:23.490> up<00:04:23.810> huh<00:04:24.810> really<00:04:25.200> nice<00:04:25.380> okay<00:04:26.040> so<00:04:26.220> it's

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
set this up huh really nice okay so it's

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.390 
set this up huh really nice okay so it's
covered<00:04:26.880> in<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.390> little<00:04:28.230> plastic<00:04:28.500> deal<00:04:29.070> so<00:04:29.310> it

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
covered in the little plastic deal so it

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.680 
covered in the little plastic deal so it
doesn't<00:04:29.670> get<00:04:29.760> scratched<00:04:30.030> up<00:04:30.330> and<00:04:30.480> looks

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
doesn't get scratched up and looks

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.990 
doesn't get scratched up and looks
pretty<00:04:30.930> glossy<00:04:31.170> I'll<00:04:32.100> probably<00:04:32.370> be<00:04:32.580> leaving

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
pretty glossy I'll probably be leaving

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.380 
pretty glossy I'll probably be leaving
it<00:04:33.150> on<00:04:33.330> there<00:04:33.630> just<00:04:33.930> because<00:04:34.230> I<00:04:34.670> like<00:04:35.670> that<00:04:36.060> you

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
it on there just because I like that you

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.680 
it on there just because I like that you
know<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.660> glossiness<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.380> be<00:04:37.500> intact<00:04:38.690> through

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
know the glossiness to be intact through

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.610 
know the glossiness to be intact through
the<00:04:39.840> life<00:04:40.080> of<00:04:40.440> the<00:04:41.010> hard<00:04:41.460> drive<00:04:42.410> got<00:04:43.410> the

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
the life of the hard drive got the

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.420 
the life of the hard drive got the
little<00:04:43.770> rubber<00:04:44.760> feet<00:04:45.270> at<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.990> bottom<00:04:46.140> and<00:04:46.710> it
