 This video provides instructions for installation, maintenance and cleaning of 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.469
 technical fiber pools 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.869
 the installation must be done by a person injured of the indicated by the reseller 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.329
 where the product was purchased 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.989
 make sure your swimming pool is installed in accordance with the procedures 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:31.419
 below so as not to lose the right to guarantee for this demonstration 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.559
 a swimming pool shall be installed, the amount of which f 710 with a capacity of 35 thousand 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.559
 liters 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.040
 make the excavation 40 centimeters larger than the width and length of the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.450
 pool if the run is 20 centimeters bring another 20 centimeters 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.450
 To play from now on 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.010
 do the staking to get the height of the edge of the pool 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.019
 bia marques than the crusaders to check the level 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.740
 with the bottom of the excavation only a layer of stone powder or sand with 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.340
 thickness of five to seven centimeters 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.240
 this layer should have santana finish of idt lament have done 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.600
 please call the swimming pool on site 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.700
 here is a crane was needed to raise the figures on the network 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.700
 electrical 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.860
 with the decision the right place 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.120
 I had a level in the four corners 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.560
 a maximum difference of up to 5 mm is acceptable 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.360
 after placing the pool of the place and leveled 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.840
 makes hydraulic connections with 50 mm pipe 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.840
 after the hydraulic installation 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 I am here water of 30 in 30 cm putting clay or powder 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.310
 surrounding stone until it reaches the same level as the 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.390
 to pack better 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.499
 moisten clay or stone powder with machine 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.060
 repeat the procedure 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.890
 until complete compaction around the pool is completed without forcing the wall 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:15.809
 inside 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:20.049
 however clay may all stone must be loose and without stones or 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:20.820
 clods 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.820
 not to damage the walls of the city 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.879
 hey 'special attention' there is cover the support of the steps 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.969
 hydraulic and risky piping should be reinforced with a mixture of 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:36.969
 sand and cement in the ratio of three to one 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.979
 and this ensures better fixing of the game plans 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:45.939
 then install the engine room which should be about two meters from 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.359
 distance from the vaccine 

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.950
 the subfloor shall be constructed only when the ground is 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.079
 fully compacted 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.329
 make a drop out of the pool of at least 2 percent 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.959
 do not leave empty space without concrete under the door 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.789
 when compacting the soil to receive the subfloor 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:11.079
 be careful with the underground piping so as not to break any 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.129
 avoiding possible leaks. 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:18.339
 these instructions are for terrain under normal conditions 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:25.619
 in cases of pedro bay of the active water table 

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:27.079
 require retaining wall 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.379
 apartments and other situations ask for an appointment 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.379
 prior to installation 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.299
 joão cahúlla
