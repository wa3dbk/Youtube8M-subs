00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
maybe I shouldn't be surprised this is

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.080

just<00:01:03.750> something<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.439> I<00:01:04.769> had<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.369> my<00:01:05.519> head<00:01:05.790> as

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
just something that I had in my head as

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.600 
just something that I had in my head as
to<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.740> price<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.130> expansion

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
would be and you know maybe maybe I'm

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.130

just<00:01:11.820> completely<00:01:12.000> off<00:01:12.390> base<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.960> just

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
just completely off base but it just

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.420
