00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.320
 web access mayte 7 so as usual 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.170
 a quick turn of the box on the face 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.480
 before there is not much you 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.420
 have the brilliant written the name of the 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.789
 mark to you have 7 also brilliant on 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.130
 the right side where there is nothing on the 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.130
 left side 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:28.890
 you have the model on the bench nothing of the 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:33.059
 everything and on the back virtually nothing 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:36.010
 here we go on the phone side 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.719
 are then controls as soon as we 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.949
 directly opens the box to find 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:41.109
 you have a small pouch 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.359
 directly there and the mobile is going 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.960
 linger little seconds on the 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.609
 mobile so we remove to find out what 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.019
 mobile 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:52.090
 I am no creatures prefer unpacking 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:54.489
 which makes the plastics the English 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.550
 there were plastics on the front and on 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.550
 the rear 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.460
 whereas we count directly the small 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:11.040
 pick up simply to remove the card 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.040
 sim a sim card slot 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:30.070
 so there is nothing left in the box 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:32.010
 hop then and we do not expect more 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:37.380
 on it 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.380
 his long and me little piece of cardboard 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.210
 what we find 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.470
 directly a small carton so this is 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:54.420
 very clear in this case is in the box 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:02:03.810
 to we will start with that so the 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:04.860
 USB charger for those who 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:15.000
 want to know I'm trying to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:20.130
 filming with my iphone 6 1 that's it 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.340
 go right after so usb micro usb level 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.760
 wiring the finish a very moment 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.760
 good hands 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.530
 very flexible in the box there is more 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:53.790
 nothing and I want to also makes us 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:57.660
 earphones one can he pedestrian know 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:05.490
 that wiring and rounding to a wiring 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:07.650
 flat like a small remote with 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.660
 a microphone so that's a good 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.290
 remote control is well pressed approached 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:23.810
 catch the cat 3.5 is not blows 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:25.470
 dice and so right here and it's gone 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:27.570
 on the right side 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.220
 we climb a little bit so what we 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.440
 directly find the button turn on 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.630
 extinguish exit had to enter there had to 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:40.440
 y so more stolen volumes - on the top 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.780
 you have the 3.5 jack a little mic on 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.860
 the left side 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.100
 you simply promise a 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.070
 sim card and a micro sd 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.220
 we go down there's nothing on the bottom 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.390
 you have the micro USB 2.0 or whatever 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.640
 simply to charge your device 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.190
 or connect it directly to a computer 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.770
 to transfer files 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:06.510
 you have a microphone then on the device 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.890
 on the back the device you have a 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.910
 3 megapixel sensor a flash 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.110
 there you have the opportunity to put 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.360
 your fingerprint 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.510
 as on the last as on the 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.180
 latest samsung products or the iphone and 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:24.300
 from an apple products to know that 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.710
 this one takes in 360 so it works 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.450
 that you put your back like this as 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.790
 that etc 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:31.560
 we go down a little further down 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.790
 so have the brand of the product you have 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.200
 here speakers that are 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:34.850
 frankly very light I could 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.910
 try 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:40.860
 I'm not here it's not so good 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.940
 know that there is not currently this 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.040
 which makes that if you listen to the music 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.129
 and you're actually just asking the 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.539
 his will be crushed 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:51.689
 that's what's on the front 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:53.789
 of the phone you have a frontal apn of 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.879
 5 megapixels to let son can 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:57.409
 to be not bad you have a screen of 6 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:05:01.889
 inch 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:04.189
 you have sensors by that it's not 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.779
 where he may be right there directly 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:08.899
 to know that the buttons inscribe 

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:13.229
 directly in the west 

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:14.909
 you have a big screen full hd 2 6 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.449
 inches so it's really a very beautiful 

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.259
 phone 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.259
 it's a fable is
