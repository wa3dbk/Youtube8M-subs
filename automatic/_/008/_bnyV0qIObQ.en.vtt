00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
this weapon and I have to say right now

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.119 
this weapon and I have to say right now
that<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.329> gun<00:00:54.600> only<00:00:54.899> took<00:00:55.199> me<00:00:55.379> about<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.829> good

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
that this gun only took me about a good

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.299 
that this gun only took me about a good
4<00:00:56.579> hours<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.629> playing<00:00:57.899> time<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.230> actually<00:00:58.739> get

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
4 hours of playing time to actually get

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.729 
4 hours of playing time to actually get
diamond<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.899> definitely<00:01:01.289> wasn't<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
diamond so it definitely wasn't one of

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.979 
diamond so it definitely wasn't one of
the<00:01:01.920> hardest<00:01:02.460> guns<00:01:02.730> or<00:01:03.059> one<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.629> easiest

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
the hardest guns or one of the easiest

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.950 
the hardest guns or one of the easiest
guns<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.439> get<00:01:04.589> Dimond<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.189> game<00:01:05.510> but<00:01:06.510> there

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
guns to get Dimond in the game but there

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.750 
guns to get Dimond in the game but there
we<00:01:07.170> go<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> diamond<00:01:07.799> camo<00:01:07.950> looks<00:01:08.280> pretty<00:01:08.520> good

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
just came out like a week ago or

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.520 
just came out like a week ago or
something<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:39.150> camo<00:01:39.840> looks<00:01:40.110> better<00:01:40.290> than

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
something that camo looks better than

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.210 
something that camo looks better than
the<00:01:40.680> diamond<00:01:41.159> gold<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.820> royalty<00:01:42.420> camo<00:01:42.869> so<00:01:43.860> I'm

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the diamond gold and royalty camo so I'm

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.160 
the diamond gold and royalty camo so I'm
a<00:01:44.280> little<00:01:44.520> bit<00:01:44.759> disappointed<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
a little bit disappointed that that you

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.050 
a little bit disappointed that that you
can<00:01:46.350> actually<00:01:46.710> buy<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.009> better<00:01:47.399> looking<00:01:47.759> camo

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
can actually buy a better looking camo

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.149 
can actually buy a better looking camo
then<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.570> can<00:01:48.720> like<00:01:48.869> earn<00:01:49.200> from<00:01:49.680> doing<00:01:49.979> head

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
then you can like earn from doing head

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.560 
then you can like earn from doing head
shots<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.670> stuff<00:01:51.619> but<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:52.770> know<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.189> mean<00:01:53.570> it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
shots and stuff but you know I mean it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.929 
shots and stuff but you know I mean it
doesn't<00:01:54.750> look<00:01:54.899> too<00:01:55.200> bad<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:55.829> wish<00:01:56.460> that

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
doesn't look too bad but I do wish that

they had the camo on the sights of the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.190 
they had the camo on the sights of the
weapon<00:01:59.310> already<00:02:00.180> guys<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:00.570> now<00:02:00.719> I<00:02:00.750> wanted<00:02:01.110> to

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
weapon already guys so now I wanted to

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.109 
weapon already guys so now I wanted to

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
give you a few tips on how you can get

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.749 
give you a few tips on how you can get
this<00:02:03.299> thing<00:02:03.540> diamond<00:02:04.049> a<00:02:04.200> bit<00:02:04.469> faster<00:02:05.159> now

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
this thing diamond a bit faster now

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.969 
this thing diamond a bit faster now
overall<00:02:06.540> what<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.869> would<00:02:07.140> use<00:02:07.380> for<00:02:07.409> all<00:02:07.770> the

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
overall what I would use for all the

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.800 
overall what I would use for all the
challenges<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.440> thermal<00:02:10.440> sight<00:02:10.800> and

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
challenges is a thermal sight and

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.510 
challenges is a thermal sight and
advanced<00:02:12.200> rifling<00:02:12.890> I'm<00:02:13.040> pretty<00:02:13.220> sure<00:02:13.370> that's

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
advanced rifling I'm pretty sure that's

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.630 
advanced rifling I'm pretty sure that's
what<00:02:13.640> it's<00:02:13.880> called<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.690> laser<00:02:15.640> attachment

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
what it's called and a laser attachment

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.720 
what it's called and a laser attachment
the<00:02:17.000> laser<00:02:17.300> is<00:02:17.750> for<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.440> hipfire<00:02:18.860> kills<00:02:19.220> so

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
the laser is for the hipfire kills so

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.330 
the laser is for the hipfire kills so
you'll<00:02:20.030> be<00:02:20.900> more<00:02:21.110> likely<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.709> get<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.950> hipfire

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
you'll be more likely to get the hipfire

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.720 
you'll be more likely to get the hipfire
kills<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.910> also<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.870> thermal<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.680> for<00:02:25.400> the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
kills and also the thermal is for the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.490 
kills and also the thermal is for the
skeet<00:02:26.000> shooter<00:02:26.240> medals<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:26.780> the<00:02:26.870> long<00:02:27.140> shots

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
skeet shooter medals and the long shots

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.710 
skeet shooter medals and the long shots
because<00:02:27.860> I<00:02:28.069> found<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.760> thermal<00:02:29.180> helps<00:02:29.540> a

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
because I found that the thermal helps a

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.320 
because I found that the thermal helps a
lot<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.380> advanced<00:02:31.250> rifling<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.910> know<00:02:32.030> it

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
lot and advanced rifling you know it

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.930 
lot and advanced rifling you know it
like<00:02:33.050> increases<00:02:33.620> your<00:02:33.770> range<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.459> damage<00:02:34.610> and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
like increases your range and damage and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.840 
like increases your range and damage and
stuff<00:02:35.300> so<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:35.780> would<00:02:36.260> use<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.620> for<00:02:37.280> the<00:02:37.520> long

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
stuff so I would use that for the long

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.570 
stuff so I would use that for the long
shots<00:02:38.709> already<00:02:39.709> guys<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.130> we<00:02:40.250> hope<00:02:40.400> you

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
shots already guys so we hope you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.340 
shots already guys so we hope you
