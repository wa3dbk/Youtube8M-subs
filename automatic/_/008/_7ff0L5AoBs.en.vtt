00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910

there are about a hundred and forty

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.019 
there are about a hundred and forty
dollars<00:00:19.080> new<00:00:19.640> this<00:00:20.640> one<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.000> new<00:00:21.949> everything

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
dollars new this one is new everything

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.240 
dollars new this one is new everything
came<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.240> boxes<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.869> said<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.170> would<00:00:25.380> so

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
came in the boxes it said it would so

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.650 
came in the boxes it said it would so
far<00:00:26.490> I'm<00:00:26.640> pretty<00:00:26.820> happy<00:00:27.000> with<00:00:27.300> it

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
far I'm pretty happy with it

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.169 
far I'm pretty happy with it
I<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:28.560> put<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.830> up<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.160> in<00:00:29.429> my<00:00:29.519> garage<00:00:29.580> you

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
I just put it up here in my garage you

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.110 
I just put it up here in my garage you
can<00:00:30.210> see<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.480> behind<00:00:30.599> me<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:31.170> live<00:00:31.800> in<00:00:31.920> Wyoming

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
can see it behind me I live in Wyoming

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.299 
can see it behind me I live in Wyoming
you<00:00:33.120> know<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.390> have<00:00:33.540> about<00:00:33.780> 45<00:00:34.320> 55<00:00:34.860> miles<00:00:35.130> per

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
you know we have about 45 55 miles per

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.430 
you know we have about 45 55 miles per
hour<00:00:35.399> sustained<00:00:35.850> wind<00:00:36.120> going<00:00:36.930> on<00:00:37.200> right<00:00:37.410> now

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
hour sustained wind going on right now

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.139 
hour sustained wind going on right now
so<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.920> figured<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.309> crotch<00:00:38.550> was<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.969> best

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
so I figured the crotch was the best

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.810 
so I figured the crotch was the best
place<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.829> make<00:00:40.829> sure<00:00:40.890> everything<00:00:41.430> was<00:00:41.550> there

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
place to make sure everything was there

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.410 
place to make sure everything was there
and<00:00:42.000> put<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.239> up<00:00:42.390> uh<00:00:43.070> process<00:00:44.070> probably<00:00:44.820> you

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and put it up uh process probably you

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.049 
and put it up uh process probably you
know<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.690> took<00:00:45.870> me<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.520> think<00:00:47.520> probably<00:00:47.760> about

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
know it took me I think probably about

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.010 
know it took me I think probably about
fifteen<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.660> twenty<00:00:48.719> minutes<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.320> get<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.559> up<00:00:49.739> a

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
fifteen to twenty minutes to get it up a

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.100 
fifteen to twenty minutes to get it up a
few<00:00:52.020> pickups<00:00:52.829> doing<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.460> top<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:54.149> really

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
few pickups doing the top this really

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.540 
few pickups doing the top this really
didn't<00:00:55.559> look<00:00:55.680> at<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:55.890> instructions<00:00:56.430> or

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
didn't look at the instructions or

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.209 
didn't look at the instructions or
anything<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:57.530> they<00:00:58.530> kind<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.800> threw<00:00:59.039> me<00:00:59.070> off

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
anything so they kind of threw me off

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.069 
anything so they kind of threw me off
for<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.670> second<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.149> once<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.449> had<00:01:00.660> everything

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
for a second but once I had everything

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.990 
for a second but once I had everything
in<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.590> right<00:01:01.739> place<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.219> all<00:01:02.340> went<00:01:02.550> together

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
in the right place it all went together

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.479 
in the right place it all went together
I<00:01:03.180> just<00:01:03.629> at<00:01:04.350> first<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.769> felt<00:01:04.949> like<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.250> was<00:01:05.400> gonna

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
I just at first I felt like I was gonna

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.210 
I just at first I felt like I was gonna
rip<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> fabric<00:01:06.330> or<00:01:06.840> break<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> pole<00:01:07.590> but<00:01:07.920> I

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
rip the fabric or break a pole but I

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.630 
rip the fabric or break a pole but I
just<00:01:09.060> clip<00:01:09.630> something<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.110> too<00:01:10.680> soon<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.310> once

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
just clip something on too soon and once

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.190 
just clip something on too soon and once
I'm<00:01:11.790> clip<00:01:12.060> did<00:01:12.240> everything<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.780> good<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.080> go

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
I'm clip did everything was good to go

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.649 
I'm clip did everything was good to go
so<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.860> would<00:01:14.369> say<00:01:14.610> it's<00:01:14.760> fairly<00:01:14.970> easy<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.479> set

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
so I would say it's fairly easy to set

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.270 
so I would say it's fairly easy to set
up<00:01:15.689> with<00:01:15.780> one<00:01:16.020> person<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:17.220> did<00:01:18.000> not<00:01:18.180> have<00:01:18.420> it

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
up with one person I did not have it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.310 
up with one person I did not have it
stake<00:01:20.280> down<00:01:20.580> either<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> imagine<00:01:21.750> once

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
stake down either so I imagine once

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.950 
stake down either so I imagine once
you're<00:01:22.830> out<00:01:23.119> camping<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.509> you're<00:01:24.689> able<00:01:24.780> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
you're out camping and you're able to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.440 
you're out camping and you're able to
stake<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.350> down<00:01:25.610> it'll<00:01:26.610> be<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:26.970> easy<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
stake it down it'll be really easy to

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.380 
stake it down it'll be really easy to
put<00:01:27.689> up<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:28.290> person

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
put up with one person

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.530 
put up with one person
it's<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.450> Gander<00:01:30.810> Mountain<00:01:30.860> shower<00:01:31.860> tent

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
make your own I thought about making my

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.729 
make your own I thought about making my
own<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.649> just<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.989> think<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.020> paid<00:02:10.229> 26

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
own but just really think I paid 26

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.730 
own but just really think I paid 26
bucks<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:11.580> right<00:02:11.849> now<00:02:12.030> they're<00:02:12.239> also

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
bucks for it so right now they're also

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.070 
bucks for it so right now they're also
winter<00:02:13.310> kind<00:02:13.820> of<00:02:13.940> hard<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.150> find<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.600> think<00:02:14.630> just

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
winter kind of hard to find I think just

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.360 
winter kind of hard to find I think just
saw<00:02:15.230> themselves<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:15.740> making<00:02:15.860> them<00:02:16.040> anymore<00:02:16.190> I

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
saw themselves and making them anymore I

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.910 
saw themselves and making them anymore I
think<00:02:16.490> most<00:02:16.730> places<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:17.390> have<00:02:17.600> back<00:02:18.560> stock

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
think most places just have back stock

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.580 
think most places just have back stock
so<00:02:19.580> but<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.030> should<00:02:20.240> better<00:02:21.080> find<00:02:21.350> one<00:02:21.560> I
