00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.490
 description away from the video link 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.070

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.379

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.800

 Orio to open and has already submitted 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.500
 folder first copy this we copy it 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.500
 let's start 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:19.120
 percent app data 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:22.080
 then point minecraft mod 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.670
 and of course we stick 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.360
 good and the other 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.820
 we copy it 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.230
 but let's fall in the most point 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.460
 intense here outside is now in 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:38.440
 we 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:42.190
 let's paste the texture of 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.880
 the boxer and the soloist 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.939
 well, now 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:52.520
 come back you will not be able to minecraft well with 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.520
 qantas already so it becomes 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:02:03.399
 good, I have installed the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.700
 options and I do not know why the 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.700
 mold yards 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.129
 this is not 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.720
 well let's go to options and as in all 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:15.260
 the options and others 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:20.330
 well I have selected the dexeus 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:22.340
 now you have ourense and accept 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.670
 to accept 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.730
 a single player says world grain to 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.160
 to see if 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.900
 if it were put 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.069
 is the texture that 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.069
 by hope 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.490
 will improve 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.030
 or I do not believe that 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.360
 and if certain 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.080
 as you can see I do not have as much my pc 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.080
 it's bullshit 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.510
 it is good to fight 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.510
 the clouds all that 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.810
 the water also makes it from the water that 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.460
 style 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.110
 of realistic 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.110
 well then also 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.940
 now the sun is reflected in the water 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.650
 in my shadow 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.400
 well I'll tell you I think it moves 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.400
 the cgt also 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.540
 if they move 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.280
 I will see if I find pastors and says 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.280
 move on 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.140
 good vale 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.160
 good finds 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.640
 let's fix as the explosion of the 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.640
 Lieutenant, I think that changed this or not 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.040
 well I can not 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.709
 that puts a stone and that speaks 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:20.430
 well now yes 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:24.109
 I'm going to see the explosion of iu 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.109
 and I think it 's the same 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:33.129
 All this 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:36.060

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:36.060
