00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.640
 in fact we watched a lot of video 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.870
 this team 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.880
 since everyone knows that 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.160
 in portuguese spanish teams likes 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.200
 good to keep the ball good to attack not 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.529
 so easy we just managed we 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.760
 played well on the counter as well 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.910
 analyzed the opponent and gave 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.220
 we are able to adequately enough 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.720
 play against them already when you see 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.890
 these conditions, the yield on the field 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.949
 Naturally need to beat when you go 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.960
 This position has two options for development 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.320
 events either take the game by yourself and beat 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.879
 or if your partner is in a better position 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.920
 are giving him a pass so here I am 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:46.289
 threw the ball saw space I 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.969
 decided to punch yesterday yesterday for example on 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.000
 training since it started raining yesterday 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.520
 the field was terribly dry the ball was jumping now 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.070
 it was wetter, respectively, the ball 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.070
 better rolled so not so bad 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.460
 competition depends solely on 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.439
 we know that there is still a lot ahead 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.280
 urine so we need to give maxim 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.720
 on the football field 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.540
 so that we do not have those direct 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.180
 competitors was the game episode pushed 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:20.270
 knee pain beams 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:25.160
 asked not well of course jitters 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.200
 some well gone on the field too and we also 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.110
 when we scored the first goal somehow 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.480
 gone and already sure if feels well 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.210
 Of course, Sergei Stanislavovich 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.520
 supported prompted what to do 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.039
 on the football field and 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.939
 how could this give me confidence 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:49.159
 such but I would not say that it is easy well 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:51.140
 that they scored two goals at once quickly and they 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.619
 calmed down a little and we feel better 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.819
 This we well prepared two days 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.340
 viewed them not games and standard 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:04.130
 position in principle knew that from them 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.679
 expect well yes and the coach asked ourselves 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.959
 did you see what a terrible field 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:12.680
 I know how to allow on such fields 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:15.560
 play and more and there was a wind the first half 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.550
 we played the wind so we understood 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.400
 the trainers asked us to 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.160
 I turn around then I think of ours 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.480
 Fans probably today would have been 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.060
 more than they are, and our weather is not 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.730
 intimidate so they came supported 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.870
 Thanks to them, I didn't even feel that 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.870
 we played new
