00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
well I mean kind of like last year in

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.049 
well I mean kind of like last year in
Detroit<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.670> in<00:00:38.719> vegas<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:40.520> at<00:00:41.520> southpoint

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
Detroit here in vegas at at southpoint

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.340 
Detroit here in vegas at at southpoint
there<00:00:42.239> seems<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> lot<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.079> friction

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
there seems to be a lot of friction

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.380 
there seems to be a lot of friction
built<00:00:43.620> into<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.980> line<00:00:44.129> surface<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:44.789> we're

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
built into the line surface so we're

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.930 
built into the line surface so we're
finding<00:00:45.660> ourselves<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.440> lot<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.620> water<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
finding ourselves in a lot of water you

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.430 
finding ourselves in a lot of water you
know<00:00:48.030> some<00:00:48.210> older<00:00:48.480> products<00:00:48.930> I'm

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
know some older products I'm

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.260 
know some older products I'm
particularly<00:00:50.190> if<00:00:50.370> don't<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.640> grand<00:00:50.850> illusion

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
particularly if don't a grand illusion

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.360 
particularly if don't a grand illusion
which<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> ball<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.739> was<00:00:52.860> made<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> couple

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
which is a ball that was made a couple

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.700 
which is a ball that was made a couple
years<00:00:53.489> ago<00:00:53.609> for<00:00:53.969> roto<00:00:54.120> grip<00:00:54.530> it's<00:00:55.530> just

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
years ago for roto grip it's just

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.229 
years ago for roto grip it's just
something<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:56.039> gets<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> front<00:00:56.910> but<00:00:57.120> yet

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
something that gets to the front but yet

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.020 
something that gets to the front but yet
still<00:00:57.449> smooth<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:58.800> newer<00:00:58.920> covers<00:00:59.340> are<00:00:59.520> just

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
still smooth the newer covers are just

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.689 
still smooth the newer covers are just
not<00:01:00.480> getting<00:01:00.690> through<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> midline<00:01:01.699> enough

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
not getting through the midline enough

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.670 
not getting through the midline enough
it's<00:01:03.329> obviously<00:01:03.660> not<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:03.989> bad<00:01:04.140> as<00:01:04.260> last<00:01:04.410> year

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
it's obviously not as bad as last year

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.720 
it's obviously not as bad as last year
where<00:01:04.800> a<00:01:04.830> lot<00:01:04.980> of<00:01:05.010> guys<00:01:05.190> are<00:01:05.220> having<00:01:05.550> to<00:01:05.610> throw

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
where a lot of guys are having to throw

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.460 
where a lot of guys are having to throw
urethane<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.710> you<00:01:07.710> know<00:01:07.830> doubles<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.790> film<00:01:09.360> it

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
urethane but you know doubles I film it

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.220 
urethane but you know doubles I film it
all<00:01:10.470> day<00:01:11.030> what<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.150> last<00:01:12.300> 15<00:01:12.660> games<00:01:12.690> and<00:01:13.140> I

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:13.230 
all day what the last 15 games and I

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.860 
all day what the last 15 games and I
don't<00:01:13.680> pretty<00:01:13.770> well<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.580> as<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
don't pretty well with it so as the

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.480 
don't pretty well with it so as the
patterns<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.350> longer<00:01:16.590> we'll<00:01:17.070> probably<00:01:17.280> have

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
patterns get longer we'll probably have

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.920 
patterns get longer we'll probably have
to<00:01:17.550> start<00:01:17.850> stepping<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.330> up<00:01:18.390> into<00:01:18.630> some<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.870> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
to start stepping it up into some of the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.830 
to start stepping it up into some of the
newer<00:01:19.080> stuff<00:01:19.350> and<00:01:19.590> hopefully<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.730> can<00:01:20.910> get<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
newer stuff and hopefully we can get you

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.860 
newer stuff and hopefully we can get you
know<00:01:21.930> maybe<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.010> Nomad<00:01:23.460> dagger<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.330> that

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:24.870 
know maybe the Nomad dagger out and that

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.570 
know maybe the Nomad dagger out and that
one<00:01:24.990> looks<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.590> real<00:01:25.890> close<00:01:26.190> so<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.460> just

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
one looks it's real close so we just

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.280 
one looks it's real close so we just
need<00:01:26.730> a<00:01:26.760> little<00:01:27.030> bit<00:01:27.240> more<00:01:27.360> oil<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.080> think

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
need a little bit more oil and I think

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
need a little bit more oil and I think
