00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 what's up youtube like it's so you guys 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.540
 I hope you are very good guys 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.950
 today we are going to see a 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.010
 new feature that was added 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.049
 recently at 0.12 to what they are 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.940
 the eaves well guys good many people 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.740
 he was commenting on twitter and I 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.720
 from that time what will be the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.340
 characteristic and the truth is you 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.859
 sorry they have not recorded it since 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.910
 a long time ago but good as I entered 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.529
 the school and all this well 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.090
 recently, all the videos that 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.580
 they have been - they are videos that I already had 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.619
 pre-recorded want to go on vacation 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.370
 that now we are going to be the most 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.020
 long and good the villagers I started this 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.600
 feature obviously they already had it 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.860
 but good what is it that makes 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.930
 villagers can are farmers in a few 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.930
 words to play the farmers the 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:53.610
 forgiveness villagers can replant and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.309
 remove good can see remove it what 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.469
 already grew and replant it and the 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.720
 truth that is a function quite is 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.950
 good but can be both useless 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.230
 the habitat I do not know why it is not 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.800
 running in fact from gm throw to these 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:11.810
 villagers because there are times that works 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.250
 so well let's throw them have 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.860
 to be trying with several 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.860
 villagers because I do not know exactly who 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.120
 it's the villager that good 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.620
 he provides it and he was a villager who 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.620
 he was simply dressed 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.409
 of coffee but now they are coming out 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.720
 coffee villagers and they are not the farmers 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.330
 as you can see as soon as I get out of 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.600
 full farmer the villager alone gets 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.689
 to which this one is small the villager 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.670
 alone is going to get to pick up the 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.750
 plantations that we're not going to try 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.390
 ok this is not let's see this little one 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.280
 it is this me what is supposed to be 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.899
 I should catch me the plantations guys 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.720
 but as you can see right now I do not know why 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.080
 what does not want to work on the damn 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.080
 Useless 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.759
 ok there you have it guys I do not know why not 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.439
 I was dating but as you can see 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.869
 at the end what can make it work I had to 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.090
 do it down here and as you can see well 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.619
 is sometimes has a few ones 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.290
 how many failures but how could they see 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.940
 right now they saw that the villager alone 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.069
 I plan those three that are here to me 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.590
 right and in fact I remove some 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.150
 wheats that were already grown the truth 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.900
 which is a function as I say can 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.780
 be useless because I plan another 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.239
 the function may be useless because of 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.579
 done you can not believe there's no way 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.829
 open the villager's inventory as 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.260
 so that they see there is 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.599
 planting is a little slow the villager 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.010
 come is there planted a seed but 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.650
 as I tell you there is no way I think of 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.189
 open the inventory and you can pick up 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.840
 all that wheat that he has got 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:50.310
 because, well, no, you can not, you can not 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.340
 you can open the inventory to the villager 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.980
 but maybe in some future version 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.349
 or with some mode something because this one 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.239
 better they do it but for the moment 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.470
 I leave there guys how to get a function 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.879
 I say that very curious and excellent 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.430
 because then in fact if it can serve us 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:10.050
 although not completely for example because 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.730
 let's do 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.960
 that we reframed more or be first 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.910
 what would my plan be for example me 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.360
 first I would raise all this would fill it 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.400
 full wheat not since I grabbed all the 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.560
 possible seeds the villager because as 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.140
 can see no longer obviously grabs wheat 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.760
 and seed well the joke is that when 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.370
 I already have many seeds in the day 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.340
 Well, like to lock it in, I'll go 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.370
 pick up the wheat and then he'll 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.190
 I reconsidered and well wait for it again 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.980
 to make like the same move wait 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.990
 that the good villager is pelagic that 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.370
 the wheat I remember the wheat and then 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:51.780
 that the altea the villager entered 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.490
 replanting to be able to see well is it works 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.320
 very good but I tell you at the moment 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.420
 we can open the inventory the villager 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.130
 which is a bit bad in fact I do not know 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.960
 you can always open the inventory 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.150
 the villager but good as I say is 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.220
 a curious function simply more than 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.470
 nothing is not like a thing that 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.770
 they will help themselves to their game of 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.200
 minecraft and or their worlds but then as 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.600
 I tell them that little thing already explains 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.020
 right now they can serve you 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.240
 maybe not at all but yes so not 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.060
 I know to make it a little faster 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.890
 harvest or something like that and so nothing guys 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.110
 I hope you liked this video 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.120
 the truth is that I did not plan to record 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.530
 something like that but as I say I thought 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.920
 in the very interesting all 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.750
 villagers and very funny because it 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.490
 parents the elderly 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.760
 up even as a collation with the 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.490
 head come see as in the head every kg 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.990
 as yes sir I already did every one that takes away 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.840
 in a wheat like that they make him doing 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.340
 weird but it's father guys and good 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.400
 as you can see, they obviously live 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.320
 he was a villager he obviously already has a 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.340
 bunch of seeds and we can do by 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.949
 example this 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.500
 open more space and the villager then 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.110
 there is how you can see if it goes and 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.060
 plant plus seeds is that of guys 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:11.880
 so far I leave the video if I find him 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.880
 another good function to this then 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.310
 I 'll give you another video or something like that 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.530
 I tell them at the moment there is not what 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.750
 tell a wow what a good thing this is that 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.910
 you are brought 12 but as I say it is 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.610
 something funny and funny about the villagers 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.069
 good something new funny and curious in 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.690
 crespi line if you are somehow 4 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.490
