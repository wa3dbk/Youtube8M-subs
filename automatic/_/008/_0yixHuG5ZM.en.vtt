00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:07.560
 welcoming to the apples today I will tell 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.389
 to you about the cleanmymac program which 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.490
 allows you to quickly get rid of unnecessary 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.900
 garbage on your computer is not for anyone 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.120
 It is no secret that with active use 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.699
 any operating system in it 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.609
 accumulates unnecessary garbage cache and others 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.350
 files that require removal given 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.900
 the utility best allows 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.300
 look into every corner of your system and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.220
 remove all unnecessary application from there 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.679
 allows you to produce multiple levels 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.450
 cleaning automatic cleaning which 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.030
 uses all included options 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.800
 just cleaning the system which allows 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.300
 delete cache and unnecessary files with 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.579
 unused applications 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.620
 large files this section allows 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.539
 track all your large files 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.030
 system and, if necessary, delete them 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.010
 The iPhoto section allows you to clear the disk from 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.739
 unnecessary pictures and their copies 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.690
 Duplicate recycle bin allows 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.760
 completely erase files placed there 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 go installer correctly remove all 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.989
 applications including their tails which 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.480
 sometimes remain after some programs 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.250
 made extensions meant for 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.960
 advanced users and allows 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.900
 remove some standard modules 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.700
 I personally do not recommend anything to applications 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.650
 remove from this section without much 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.630
 it may lead to 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.729
 inoperability of some applications 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.439
 or systems in general the last section 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.689
 shredder is designed to be irrevocable 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.659
 remove confidential information 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.369
 data photos and the like as 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.850
 you know with the help of specialized 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.770
 utilities 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.079
 can recover deleted data 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.909
 so that this does not happen with what 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.770
 then certain types of documents you 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.990
 You can specifically wipe the nickname in the shredder 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.540
 then this fragment or file 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.430
 it will be impossible to recover 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.470
 start cleaning in each section 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.049
 separately and you can turn on automatic 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.950
 cleaning up the system it turns on itself first 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.070
 four sections 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.380
 from the program after analyzing cleanmymac 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.899
 will show how much data can be deleted when 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.180
 cleaning aid with all options when 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.210
 clicking delete will clear 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.890
 system immediately after the procedure 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.439
 the program will offer to share 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.630
 result with your friends besides 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.849

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.459
 cleared space by cleaning 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:13.020

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.650

 allows you to set the time period through 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.549

 automatic program start 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.540
 the schedule can also enable cleaning 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.079
