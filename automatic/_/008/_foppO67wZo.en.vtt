your head in which I hope to discuss
five<00:00:17.140> different<00:00:17.609> primary<00:00:18.609> contributors<00:00:19.330> to

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
five different primary contributors to

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.220 
five different primary contributors to
psychiatric<00:00:20.740> diagnoses<00:00:21.580> that<00:00:21.910> have

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
psychiatric diagnoses that have

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.259 
psychiatric diagnoses that have
physiologic<00:00:23.339> explanations<00:00:24.339> so<00:00:24.669> I<00:00:24.699> call<00:00:25.029> these

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:25.269 
physiologic explanations so I call these

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.319 
physiologic explanations so I call these
the<00:00:25.900> psychiatric<00:00:26.560> pretenders<00:00:27.310> and<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:28.150> first

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
the psychiatric pretenders and the first

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.909 
the psychiatric pretenders and the first
one<00:00:28.509> that<00:00:28.630> I<00:00:28.689> want<00:00:28.900> to<00:00:28.990> talk<00:00:29.169> about<00:00:29.349> is<00:00:29.650> near

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:29.919 
one that I want to talk about is near

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:31.829 
one that I want to talk about is near
and<00:00:30.039> dear<00:00:30.070> to<00:00:30.220> my<00:00:30.460> heart<00:00:30.490> and<00:00:30.939> is<00:00:31.269> a<00:00:31.300> big<00:00:31.599> focus

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:31.839 
and dear to my heart and is a big focus

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:34.670 
and dear to my heart and is a big focus
in<00:00:32.140> my<00:00:32.259> practice<00:00:32.370> which<00:00:33.370> is<00:00:33.400> thyroid<00:00:34.180> function

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
in my practice which is thyroid function

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.520 
in my practice which is thyroid function
so<00:00:35.680> I<00:00:35.710> will<00:00:36.340> use<00:00:37.170> postpartum<00:00:38.170> thyroiditis

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
so I will use postpartum thyroiditis

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.939 
so I will use postpartum thyroiditis
which<00:00:39.370> I<00:00:40.329> encounter<00:00:40.870> in<00:00:40.960> about<00:00:41.140> 80%<00:00:41.739> of<00:00:41.800> my

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:41.949 
which I encounter in about 80% of my

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.110 
which I encounter in about 80% of my
patients<00:00:42.550> as<00:00:42.699> an<00:00:43.480> example<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.440> illustrate<00:00:44.469> how

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
patients as an example to illustrate how

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.509 
patients as an example to illustrate how
fibroid<00:00:46.120> can<00:00:46.359> really<00:00:46.840> masquerade<00:00:47.620> as<00:00:47.980> a

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:48.519 
fibroid can really masquerade as a

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:51.330 
fibroid can really masquerade as a
psychiatric<00:00:48.789> condition<00:00:49.780> and<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:51.160> the

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
psychiatric condition and in the

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.819 
psychiatric condition and in the
postpartum<00:00:51.579> period<00:00:51.879> what<00:00:52.449> happens<00:00:52.840> is<00:00:53.289> the

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
postpartum period what happens is the

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.459 
postpartum period what happens is the
immune<00:00:54.100> system<00:00:54.579> undergoes<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.449> shift<00:00:55.899> after

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
immune system undergoes a shift after

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:58.290 
immune system undergoes a shift after
the<00:00:56.620> birth<00:00:56.800> of<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.160> baby<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:57.699> it<00:00:57.789> really<00:00:58.089> sort

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
the birth of the baby and it really sort

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.450 
the birth of the baby and it really sort
of<00:00:58.449> comes<00:00:58.719> back<00:00:58.870> with<00:00:59.230> a<00:00:59.320> vengeance<00:00:59.469> in<00:01:00.129> some

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
of comes back with a vengeance in some

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.660 
of comes back with a vengeance in some
patients<00:01:00.730> and<00:01:01.589> you'll<00:01:02.589> see<00:01:02.949> that<00:01:03.309> there's<00:01:03.579> a

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
patients and you'll see that there's a

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.230 
patients and you'll see that there's a
pattern<00:01:04.239> of<00:01:05.250> hyperthyroidism<00:01:06.250> over<00:01:06.970> a<00:01:07.000> couple

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
pattern of hyperthyroidism over a couple

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.810 
pattern of hyperthyroidism over a couple
of<00:01:07.390> months<00:01:07.600> followed<00:01:08.200> by<00:01:08.380> hypo<00:01:09.310> or<00:01:09.340> low

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
of months followed by hypo or low

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.870 
of months followed by hypo or low
functioning<00:01:10.090> thyroid<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.920> this<00:01:12.100> pattern<00:01:12.579> is

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
functioning thyroid and this pattern is

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.980 
functioning thyroid and this pattern is
really<00:01:13.600> exactly<00:01:14.470> by<00:01:14.799> the<00:01:15.520> immune<00:01:15.759> system<00:01:16.180> it's

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
really exactly by the immune system it's

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.770 
really exactly by the immune system it's
it's<00:01:17.320> attack<00:01:17.650> on<00:01:17.979> the<00:01:18.220> on<00:01:18.430> the<00:01:18.549> gland<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:19.570> what

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
it's attack on the on the gland so what

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.569 
it's attack on the on the gland so what
happens<00:01:20.170> in<00:01:20.320> those<00:01:20.439> early<00:01:20.860> months<00:01:21.009> is<00:01:21.340> the

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
happens in those early months is the

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.940 
happens in those early months is the
patient<00:01:22.210> will<00:01:22.420> typically<00:01:23.020> feel<00:01:23.350> actually

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
patient will typically feel actually

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.310 
patient will typically feel actually
like<00:01:24.670> they've<00:01:24.880> bounced<00:01:25.149> back<00:01:25.479> really<00:01:25.540> easily

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
like they've bounced back really easily

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.020 
like they've bounced back really easily
they've<00:01:26.619> lost<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.220> weight<00:01:27.399> they<00:01:27.579> have<00:01:27.610> a<00:01:27.759> ton

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
they've lost the weight they have a ton

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.310 
they've lost the weight they have a ton
of<00:01:28.060> energy<00:01:28.270> even<00:01:28.780> though<00:01:28.840> there's<00:01:29.079> only

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
of energy even though there's only

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.730 
of energy even though there's only
sleeping<00:01:29.680> two<00:01:29.829> three<00:01:30.399> hours<00:01:30.729> a<00:01:30.759> night<00:01:31.740> but

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
sleeping two three hours a night but

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.440 
sleeping two three hours a night but
there<00:01:33.009> may<00:01:33.159> be<00:01:33.189> a<00:01:33.340> little<00:01:33.549> bit<00:01:33.759> of<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.970> dark<00:01:34.210> edge

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
there may be a little bit of a dark edge

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.810 
there may be a little bit of a dark edge
where<00:01:34.869> they're<00:01:35.530> agitated<00:01:35.920> or<00:01:36.310> irritable

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
where they're agitated or irritable

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.350 
where they're agitated or irritable
having<00:01:37.329> racing<00:01:37.810> hard<00:01:38.079> and<00:01:38.320> insomnia<00:01:38.969> and<00:01:39.969> if

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
having racing hard and insomnia and if

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.969 
having racing hard and insomnia and if
you<00:01:40.509> were<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.810> check<00:01:41.079> their<00:01:41.320> blood<00:01:41.469> work<00:01:41.710> then

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
you were to check their blood work then

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.459 
you were to check their blood work then
you<00:01:42.219> would<00:01:42.369> find<00:01:42.579> the<00:01:43.329> presence<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:44.020> these

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:44.469 
you would find the presence of these

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:46.620 
you would find the presence of these
antibodies<00:01:44.799> that<00:01:45.430> are<00:01:45.610> very<00:01:45.850> easily<00:01:46.060> testable

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
antibodies that are very easily testable

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.749 
antibodies that are very easily testable
they<00:01:46.899> have<00:01:47.110> three<00:01:47.409> different<00:01:47.500> names<00:01:47.950> although

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
they have three different names although

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.940 
they have three different names although
usually<00:01:48.969> there's<00:01:49.539> a<00:01:49.659> specific<00:01:50.409> pattern<00:01:50.619> we're

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
usually there's a specific pattern we're

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.969 
usually there's a specific pattern we're
only<00:01:51.100> one<00:01:51.490> or<00:01:51.610> two<00:01:51.640> of<00:01:51.939> them<00:01:52.119> are<00:01:52.270> present

actually be low or normal but we have a
harbinger<00:02:08.530> of<00:02:08.740> what's<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.369> come<00:02:09.399> which<00:02:09.970> is

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
harbinger of what's to come which is
