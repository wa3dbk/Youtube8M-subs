thing the control is better in Custer's
revenge<00:06:36.840> and<00:06:37.380> that<00:06:37.620> fact<00:06:37.920> alone<00:06:38.070> makes<00:06:38.550> it<00:06:38.700> a

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:38.760 
revenge and that fact alone makes it a

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.420 
revenge and that fact alone makes it a
better<00:06:38.880> game<00:06:39.030> I<00:06:39.210> have<00:06:39.690> to<00:06:39.840> say<00:06:40.020> it<00:06:40.140> at<00:06:41.040> least<00:06:41.250> in

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
better game I have to say it at least in

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.270 
better game I have to say it at least in
one<00:06:41.610> in<00:06:42.480> one<00:06:42.990> area<00:06:43.620> I<00:06:43.680> guess<00:06:43.919> you<00:06:44.100> could<00:06:44.250> say

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:44.280 
one in one area I guess you could say

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:46.730 
one in one area I guess you could say
the<00:06:45.150> control<00:06:45.660> quality<00:06:46.140> is<00:06:46.260> better<00:06:46.500> in

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
the control quality is better in

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.190 
the control quality is better in
Custer's<00:06:47.130> revenge<00:06:47.160> a<00:06:47.760> lot<00:06:48.540> more<00:06:48.720> smoother<00:06:49.169> I
