00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
has some sort of microphone looking LED

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.800 
has some sort of microphone looking LED
indicator<00:00:48.350> looking<00:00:48.860> thing<00:00:49.130> right<00:00:49.730> above<00:00:50.270> the

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
indicator looking thing right above the

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.380 
indicator looking thing right above the
speaker<00:00:51.410> at<00:00:51.620> the<00:00:51.890> top<00:00:52.250> right<00:00:52.640> next<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.180> the

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
speaker at the top right next to the

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.170 
speaker at the top right next to the
facetime<00:00:53.900> camera<00:00:54.170> so<00:00:54.920> it<00:00:55.250> does<00:00:55.610> look<00:00:55.880> a<00:00:56.030> little

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
facetime camera so it does look a little

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.940 
facetime camera so it does look a little
bit<00:00:56.420> like<00:00:56.630> a<00:00:56.660> microphone<00:00:57.110> that<00:00:57.320> you<00:00:57.590> would<00:00:57.740> see

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
bit like a microphone that you would see

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.100 
bit like a microphone that you would see
on<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.100> macbook<00:00:58.640> or<00:00:58.820> something<00:00:59.210> like<00:00:59.330> that<00:00:59.390> but

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
on a macbook or something like that but

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.260 
on a macbook or something like that but
we<00:01:00.440> are<00:01:00.590> thinking<00:01:01.010> that<00:01:01.220> it's<00:01:01.400> more<00:01:01.700> like<00:01:02.030> an

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
we are thinking that it's more like an

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.689 
we are thinking that it's more like an
LED<00:01:02.840> notification<00:01:03.680> light<00:01:03.830> as<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:04.100> saw<00:01:04.519> with

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
LED notification light as you saw with

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.840 
LED notification light as you saw with
iOS<00:01:05.269> 5<00:01:05.600> where<00:01:06.259> the<00:01:06.470> LED<00:01:06.920> flash<00:01:07.220> on<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.520> back

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
iOS 5 where the LED flash on the back

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.270 
iOS 5 where the LED flash on the back
can<00:01:08.390> notify<00:01:08.720> you<00:01:08.900> if<00:01:09.140> you<00:01:09.290> have<00:01:09.380> new<00:01:09.590> calls<00:01:09.920> new

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
can notify you if you have new calls new

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.490 
can notify you if you have new calls new
messages<00:01:10.760> anything<00:01:11.240> like<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.420> so<00:01:12.080> it<00:01:12.260> seems

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
messages anything like that so it seems

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.110 
messages anything like that so it seems
like<00:01:12.770> they<00:01:12.920> put<00:01:13.160> this<00:01:13.280> on<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.520> front<00:01:13.790> now

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
like they put this on the front now

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.110 
like they put this on the front now
right<00:01:14.780> next<00:01:15.260> to<00:01:15.410> your<00:01:15.740> proximity<00:01:16.220> sensor<00:01:16.910> and

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
right next to your proximity sensor and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.630 
right next to your proximity sensor and
that's<00:01:17.870> great<00:01:18.200> if<00:01:18.410> they<00:01:18.680> have<00:01:19.070> some<00:01:19.370> sort<00:01:19.550> of
