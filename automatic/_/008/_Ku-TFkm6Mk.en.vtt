00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170 
TV I wondered if Darwin had only come up
with<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> theory<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.070> evolution<00:00:53.219> because<00:00:54.030> he

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
with the theory of evolution because he

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.529 
with the theory of evolution because he
really<00:00:54.690> really<00:00:55.079> looks<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.590> monkey<00:00:56.539> check

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539
