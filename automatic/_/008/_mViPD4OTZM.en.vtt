00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.139
 the safety level of modern cars has 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.969
 clearly in recent years 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:14.709
 improved 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.429
 crash tests continue to europe 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:17.740
 at 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.539
 Although almost all manufacturers have gone through 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.880
 Impact protection and gossip elements for 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:25.440
 increased occupant safety worried after all 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.090
 These do not work optimally in every case 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.220
 is now another vehicle type 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.050
 An accident can be involved through the 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.360
 different height and size of 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.290
 construction of the protection elements 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.120
 This effect will be fatal 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.250
 the adac has a special one 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.110
 crash test demonstrated with two 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.420
 above-average safe vehicles 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.750
 the lower middle class the ford fiesta 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.160
 and the peugeot 308 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.250
 Both scored five stars in the 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.989
 euroncap crash test before a survey 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.880
 of these two vehicles has shown that 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.360
 The vehicle did not work well together 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.480
 fit 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.040
 the supporting structures the longitudinal members 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.920
 miss when impact 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.780
 although these vehicles are similarly heavy 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.299
 they are not very good 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.680
 compatible that means the vehicle front 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.510
 do not fit together 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.750
 the vehicle occupants are elevated 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.680
 exposed to injury risk 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.950
 a frontal is simulated 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:25.110
 clash with 56 km / h where the 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.110
 reconsider vehicles to 40% 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.380
 the problem is clearly the 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.610
 safety elements of the vehicles 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.530
 do not meet well 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.570
 ask forwards from the vehicle 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.310
 miss one another and the crumple zone 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.780
 can not fully develop its effect 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.100
 the accident severity is therefore clear 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.320
 higher than they should be 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.479
 doors were no longer or only 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.250
 very difficult to open the drank 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.080
 structures of these vehicles that is 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.960
 the longitudinal and transverse carriers are located 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.570
 at different heights of the fiesta 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.060
 drives under the structure of the peugeot 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.979
 Through the vehicles drive far 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.470
 into each other the passenger cells become 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:11.200
 on impact overloads the claim 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.760
 of the adac is that the longitudinal members of the 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.830
 often in front like a lance from the 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.870
 Stand out with the vehicle 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.320
 connected to a stable cross-connection 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.270
 become 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.790
 The cross-link must also be high enough 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.959
 be at different vehicle heights 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.880
 to be able to compensate 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.230
 only then is it ensured that the 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.890
 energy of the extra price in the crumple zone 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.940
 is reduced and the occupants so little 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.940
 be hurt as possible
