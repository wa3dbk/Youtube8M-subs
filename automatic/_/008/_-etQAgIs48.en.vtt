hockey sticks now a lot of people have a

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.070 
hockey sticks now a lot of people have a
little<00:00:12.520> confusion<00:00:12.850> as<00:00:13.000> far<00:00:13.150> as<00:00:13.240> what<00:00:13.510> exactly

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
little confusion as far as what exactly

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.900 
little confusion as far as what exactly
is<00:00:14.289> lie<00:00:14.680> so<00:00:15.219> I'm<00:00:15.279> going<00:00:15.400> to<00:00:15.430> be<00:00:15.549> going<00:00:15.789> over

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
is lie so I'm going to be going over

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.220 
is lie so I'm going to be going over
that<00:00:16.059> as<00:00:16.390> well<00:00:16.420> as<00:00:16.630> giving<00:00:16.900> you<00:00:16.960> a<00:00:17.019> little

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
that as well as giving you a little

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.200 
that as well as giving you a little
information<00:00:17.560> to<00:00:17.890> help<00:00:18.189> you<00:00:18.369> choose<00:00:18.580> what<00:00:18.970> lie

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
information to help you choose what lie

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.910 
information to help you choose what lie
is<00:00:19.269> best<00:00:19.750> for<00:00:19.930> your<00:00:20.050> style<00:00:20.349> play<00:00:20.619> in<00:00:20.800> your

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
is best for your style play in your

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.840 
is best for your style play in your
skiing<00:00:21.220> style

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:21.850 
skiing style

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.660 
skiing style
okay<00:00:22.480> so<00:00:22.539> lie<00:00:23.050> is<00:00:23.110> actually<00:00:23.800> the<00:00:24.220> angle

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:24.670 
okay so lie is actually the angle

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.490 
okay so lie is actually the angle
between<00:00:24.880> your<00:00:25.240> hockey<00:00:25.539> shaft<00:00:25.960> and<00:00:26.230> your

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
between your hockey shaft and your

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.109 
between your hockey shaft and your
hockey<00:00:26.710> blade<00:00:27.070> so<00:00:27.580> it's<00:00:27.699> going<00:00:27.789> to<00:00:27.880> be<00:00:27.940> this

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
hockey blade so it's going to be this

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.880 
hockey blade so it's going to be this
angle<00:00:28.449> right<00:00:28.660> here

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
angle right here

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.159 
angle right here
well<00:00:30.310> ice<00:00:30.460> will<00:00:30.670> range<00:00:30.910> from<00:00:31.270> four<00:00:31.869> on<00:00:32.079> the

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
well ice will range from four on the

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.470 
well ice will range from four on the
lower<00:00:32.349> side<00:00:32.680> all<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:33.699> way<00:00:33.730> up<00:00:33.850> to<00:00:33.969> a<00:00:34.000> seven<00:00:34.420> or

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
lower side all the way up to a seven or

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.750 
lower side all the way up to a seven or
eight<00:00:34.660> most<00:00:35.260> commonly<00:00:35.859> you'll<00:00:36.100> see<00:00:36.280> a<00:00:36.309> four<00:00:36.729> or

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
eight most commonly you'll see a four or

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.259 
eight most commonly you'll see a four or
five<00:00:36.969> or<00:00:37.390> a<00:00:37.420> six<00:00:37.479> lie<00:00:38.079> and<00:00:38.550> they<00:00:39.550> do<00:00:39.609> have<00:00:40.030> seven

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
five or a six lie and they do have seven

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:41.790 
five or a six lie and they do have seven
and<00:00:40.390> eights<00:00:40.569> but<00:00:40.780> it's<00:00:40.929> definitely<00:00:41.170> not<00:00:41.589> as

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
and eights but it's definitely not as

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.059 
and eights but it's definitely not as
common<00:00:42.159> to<00:00:42.219> see<00:00:42.370> those<00:00:42.960> roughly<00:00:43.960> alive<00:00:44.829> five

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:45.069 
common to see those roughly alive five

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:47.129 
common to see those roughly alive five
which<00:00:45.370> this<00:00:45.579> stick<00:00:45.819> is<00:00:45.969> here<00:00:46.269> will<00:00:46.569> correspond

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:47.139 
which this stick is here will correspond

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:49.739 
which this stick is here will correspond
to<00:00:47.319> about<00:00:47.469> 135<00:00:48.370> degrees<00:00:48.879> between<00:00:49.179> these<00:00:49.539> two

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:49.749 
to about 135 degrees between these two

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:52.739 
to about 135 degrees between these two
pieces<00:00:49.989> as<00:00:50.409> you<00:00:50.469> move<00:00:51.399> upward<00:00:51.940> down<00:00:52.239> on<00:00:52.539> the

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
pieces as you move upward down on the

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:54.989 
pieces as you move upward down on the
lies<00:00:52.960> scale<00:00:53.409> you'll<00:00:53.979> be<00:00:54.159> roughly<00:00:54.519> adding

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
lies scale you'll be roughly adding

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:57.899 
lies scale you'll be roughly adding
about<00:00:55.149> to<00:00:55.479> or<00:00:55.780> subtracting<00:00:56.469> two<00:00:56.709> degrees<00:00:57.129> so

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
about to or subtracting two degrees so

00:00:57.909 --> 00:00:59.099 
about to or subtracting two degrees so
say<00:00:58.059> like<00:00:58.179> we're<00:00:58.299> out<00:00:58.359> of<00:00:58.420> five<00:00:58.659> and<00:00:58.839> we<00:00:58.959> go

00:00:59.099 --> 00:00:59.109 
say like we're out of five and we go

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:00.599 
say like we're out of five and we go
down<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.440> a<00:00:59.499> four<00:00:59.829> you're<00:01:00.339> going<00:01:00.489> to<00:01:00.549> be

00:01:00.599 --> 00:01:00.609 
down to a four you're going to be

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:02.099 
down to a four you're going to be
looking<00:01:00.819> at<00:01:01.120> about<00:01:01.359> a<00:01:01.389> hundred<00:01:01.629> and<00:01:01.899> thirty

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
looking at about a hundred and thirty

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.109 
looking at about a hundred and thirty
seven<00:01:02.379> degrees<00:01:02.619> between<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.549> shaft<00:01:03.819> and<00:01:04.030> the

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
seven degrees between the shaft and the

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:05.490 
seven degrees between the shaft and the
blade<00:01:04.330> so<00:01:04.780> it's<00:01:04.869> going<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.019> have<00:01:05.140> a<00:01:05.199> little<00:01:05.320> bit

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
blade so it's going to have a little bit

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.830 
blade so it's going to have a little bit
of<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.650> wider<00:01:05.920> angle<00:01:06.280> lowering<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.299> shaft<00:01:07.600> and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
of a wider angle lowering the shaft and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.420 
of a wider angle lowering the shaft and
portion<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.409> the<00:01:08.500> blade<00:01:08.740> being<00:01:08.920> on<00:01:09.070> the<00:01:09.190> rink

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
portion to the blade being on the rink

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.910 
portion to the blade being on the rink
also<00:01:10.360> if<00:01:10.450> you're<00:01:10.570> going<00:01:10.750> up<00:01:11.020> to<00:01:11.050> a<00:01:11.230> lie<00:01:11.440> six

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 
also if you're going up to a lie six

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.890 
also if you're going up to a lie six
from<00:01:12.160> a<00:01:12.250> five<00:01:12.490> you'll<00:01:13.030> be<00:01:13.180> looking<00:01:13.510> at<00:01:13.660> roughly

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
from a five you'll be looking at roughly

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.250 
from a five you'll be looking at roughly
a<00:01:14.260> hundred<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:14.950> thirty<00:01:15.160> three<00:01:15.490> degrees<00:01:16.260> okay

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
a hundred and thirty three degrees okay

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.080 
a hundred and thirty three degrees okay
so<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.440> went<00:01:17.590> ahead<00:01:17.740> and<00:01:18.160> pulled<00:01:18.370> three<00:01:18.730> sticks

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
so I went ahead and pulled three sticks

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.720 
so I went ahead and pulled three sticks
all<00:01:19.360> over<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:20.230> same<00:01:20.530> stick<00:01:20.890> however<00:01:21.460> each<00:01:21.700> one

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
all over the same stick however each one

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.420 
all over the same stick however each one
features<00:01:22.300> a<00:01:22.450> different<00:01:23.080> lie<00:01:23.320> I<00:01:23.620> have<00:01:24.010> a<00:01:24.100> four<00:01:24.400> a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
features a different lie I have a four a

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.370 
features a different lie I have a four a
five<00:01:24.790> and<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.060> six<00:01:25.300> lie<00:01:25.540> on<00:01:25.690> these<00:01:25.870> sticks<00:01:26.140> and

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
five and a six lie on these sticks and

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.380 
five and a six lie on these sticks and
as<00:01:26.740> you<00:01:26.890> can<00:01:27.040> see<00:01:27.220> each<00:01:27.460> stick<00:01:27.910> offers<00:01:28.360> a

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
as you can see each stick offers a

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.510 
as you can see each stick offers a
different<00:01:28.960> angle<00:01:29.110> all<00:01:29.620> three<00:01:30.070> sticks<00:01:30.340> the

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
different angle all three sticks the

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.660 
different angle all three sticks the
blades<00:01:30.850> are<00:01:31.090> level<00:01:31.630> on<00:01:31.810> the<00:01:32.170> ground<00:01:32.200> or<00:01:32.740> as<00:01:33.010> if

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
blades are level on the ground or as if

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.790 
blades are level on the ground or as if
this<00:01:33.880> would<00:01:34.090> be<00:01:34.120> a<00:01:34.270> rink<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.780> as<00:01:35.200> you<00:01:35.410> move<00:01:35.590> up

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
this would be a rink and as you move up

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.380 
this would be a rink and as you move up
on<00:01:35.980> the<00:01:36.070> shafts<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.400> can<00:01:36.580> see<00:01:36.730> how<00:01:36.820> each<00:01:37.060> one

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390

well<00:02:44.440> it's<00:02:44.590> going<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.800> be<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> little<00:02:45.310> more

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
well it's going to be a little more

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.310 
well it's going to be a little more
limiting<00:02:45.970> on<00:02:46.120> where<00:02:46.450> you<00:02:46.600> can<00:02:46.720> take<00:02:46.930> the<00:02:47.110> puck

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
the three most popular lies which once

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.710 
the three most popular lies which once
again<00:02:56.350> is<00:02:56.410> a<00:02:56.590> live<00:02:56.860> four<00:02:57.190> alive<00:02:57.850> five<00:02:58.120> as<00:02:58.480> well

better for and to help you decide which
one<00:03:04.420> of<00:03:04.450> those<00:03:04.600> lies<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.050> going<00:03:05.170> to<00:03:05.230> be<00:03:05.290> best

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
one of those lies is going to be best

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.470 
one of those lies is going to be best
for<00:03:05.620> your<00:03:05.680> style<00:03:06.010> play<00:03:06.280> so<00:03:06.970> starting<00:03:07.300> with<00:03:07.360> the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
for your style play so starting with the

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.240 
for your style play so starting with the
life--for<00:03:07.960> basically<00:03:08.740> this<00:03:08.860> is<00:03:09.010> going<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.190> be

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
life--for basically this is going to be

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.190 
life--for basically this is going to be
the<00:03:09.310> largest<00:03:09.820> angle<00:03:09.970> between<00:03:10.330> the<00:03:10.570> shaft<00:03:10.870> and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
the largest angle between the shaft and

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.110 
the largest angle between the shaft and
the<00:03:11.320> blade<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:12.280> it's<00:03:12.490> going<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.640> put<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.940> puck

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
the blade so it's going to put the puck

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.700 
the blade so it's going to put the puck
out<00:03:13.330> in<00:03:13.630> front<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:13.960> you<00:03:14.050> more<00:03:14.230> on<00:03:14.320> your<00:03:14.410> skating
