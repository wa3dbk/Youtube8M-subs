00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
just sick I'm gonna talk about the fit I

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.950 
just sick I'm gonna talk about the fit I
got<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> size<00:01:01.649> 9<00:01:01.980> my<00:01:02.219> true<00:01:02.520> size<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.270> they<00:01:03.629> fit

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
got a size 9 my true size and they fit

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.429 
got a size 9 my true size and they fit
perfectly<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:05.240> pretty<00:01:06.240> snug<00:01:06.600> too<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.409> I

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
perfectly like pretty snug too so I

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
perfectly like pretty snug too so I
would<00:01:07.680> definitely<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.430> down<00:01:08.729> half<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.180> size

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
would definitely not go down half a size

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.140 
would definitely not go down half a size
because<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.200> leather<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.340> pretty<00:01:11.760> stiff

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
because that leather is is pretty stiff

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.510 
because that leather is is pretty stiff
so<00:01:12.540> no<00:01:13.020> need<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.320> go<00:01:13.409> down<00:01:13.590> half<00:01:13.770> size<00:01:14.040> I'd<00:01:14.310> say

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
so no need to go down half size I'd say

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.730 
so no need to go down half size I'd say
stick<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:14.880> true<00:01:15.210> size<00:01:15.420> potentially<00:01:16.350> even<00:01:16.439> half

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
stick to true size potentially even half

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.830 
stick to true size potentially even half
size<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.189> if<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:18.509> more<00:01:18.659> room

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
size up if you like a little more room

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.480 
size up if you like a little more room
