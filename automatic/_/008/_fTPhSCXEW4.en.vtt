00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.609 

we<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.550> two<00:00:29.910> channels<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:31.080> control<00:00:31.439> the

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
we have two channels to control the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.720 
we have two channels to control the
power<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:32.160> up<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.910> three<00:00:33.120> lamp<00:00:33.510> it's<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:35.370> basic

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
power of up to three lamp it's the basic

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.220 
power of up to three lamp it's the basic
justment<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.510> made<00:00:36.870> here<00:00:37.230> with<00:00:37.860> these<00:00:38.100> knobs

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
justment is made here with these knobs

the<00:00:40.230> fine<00:00:40.440> adjustment<00:00:41.010> happens<00:00:41.820> over<00:00:42.629> here

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.209 

let's<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> close<00:00:46.379> look<00:00:46.500> at<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.010> front

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
let's have a close look at the front

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.580

panel<00:00:47.399> first<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:49.079> switch<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.469> power

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
panel first of all we switch the power

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.670 
panel first of all we switch the power
back<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.789> as<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.420> see<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.140> switch

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
back on and as you can see we can switch

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.930 
back on and as you can see we can switch
between<00:00:53.449> asymmetry<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.930> symmetry<00:00:55.940> that's

between asymmetry and symmetry that's

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.369 
between asymmetry and symmetry that's
how<00:00:57.090> we<00:00:57.149> start<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.870> symmetry<00:01:00.350> in<00:01:01.350> a

there is one more thing that might be
important<00:01:52.549> to<00:01:52.670> know<00:01:52.819> make<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.810> basic

the<00:01:57.079> left<00:01:57.289> side<00:01:57.499> where<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:58.039> switch<00:01:58.250> on<00:01:58.490> and

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
the left side where you switch on and

the left side where you switch on and
off<00:01:58.909> capacitors<00:01:59.770> if<00:02:00.770> you<00:02:00.950> do<00:02:01.069> so<00:02:01.310> your

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
off capacitors if you do so your

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:02.919 
off capacitors if you do so your
flashlight<00:02:02.060> will<00:02:02.299> remain<00:02:02.600> absolutely

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929

constant<00:02:03.500> in<00:02:03.770> color<00:02:04.039> and<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.909> flash<00:02:05.090> duration

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
constant in color and the flash duration

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.089 
constant in color and the flash duration
becomes<00:02:06.140> shorter<00:02:06.649> at<00:02:07.100> lower<00:02:07.340> settings<00:02:09.009> in<00:02:10.009> the

becomes shorter at lower settings in the

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.400 
becomes shorter at lower settings in the
second<00:02:10.429> step<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.849> make<00:02:11.569> the<00:02:11.690> fine<00:02:11.870> adjustment

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
second step you make the fine adjustment

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.630 
second step you make the fine adjustment
over<00:02:12.530> here<00:02:12.920> now<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.819> power<00:02:14.269> is<00:02:14.360> modified<00:02:15.230> by

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
over here now the power is modified by

over here now the power is modified by
voltage<00:02:16.640> variation<00:02:17.500> sensor<00:02:18.500> is<00:02:18.650> as<00:02:18.769> simple<00:02:18.980> as

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
voltage variation sensor is as simple as
