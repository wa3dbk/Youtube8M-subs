00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.810
 Y 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.000
 my beloved people 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:32.060
 receive a greeting from this server me 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.420
 I am very well and pleased to bring you 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:39.140
 something new something that will surely 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.190
 It will be very useful to upload your 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.379
 level of play in the black ops 2 will be 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.750
 a walking war machine and you 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.140
 They will take respect every time they see you in 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.629
 the lobby to the point that they would have 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.420
 like chickens when they see the wolf with 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.720
 usually avoid confronting you 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.720
 and it is by means of a hack 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.630
 today special that personally has 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:08.260
 helped a lot in my games and I want 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:11.560
 share it with you and you know not 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:16.510
 worry because it is 100% undetectable 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:19.600
 and never if they heard me right they will never be 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.500
 bathed simply because this goes more 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.390
 there as far as programming is concerned 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.120
 so here's the tutorial for 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.120
 install it and I hope you enjoy it 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.200
 good gentlemen here we are in the 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.480
 tutorial to activate the hack that 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.710
 said 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.840
 and to make it work is to simply leave 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.770
 to improve your aim for example 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.320
 here we are seeing the use with a sniper 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.480
 and as you will see there the crumb is very 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.700
 open follow the 4 cardinal points 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.070
 of the sights are widely separated 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.150
 so if we make a quisco a shot 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.430
 fast the bullet can come out 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.040
 well, everything outside the center 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.320
 we want to know is well where to put the 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.350
 eye puts the bullet or put the look put 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.130
 the bullet then first we go to 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.600
 equate with a snyder 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.390
 the second thing is that we're going to 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.510
 let's aim we 're going to be pointing 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.870
 a moment later we will cut a 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.670
 little piece of tape very carefully and 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.290
 that bit of tape we're going to paste 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.180
 on the screen as you are seeing it in 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.180
 the video well pegadito 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:41.110
 then there fell that good 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:45.510
 then with a marker we are going to 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.510
 make him look at our laptop look 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:54.980
 our laptop look we are going to do 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.260
 and bazinga we have our eyes from 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.780
 the hip a precise look where it is going 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.900
 to greatly improve the accuracy 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:06.620
 this works for all weapons already 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.560
 come because it is undetectable 100% work 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.690
 very manual very easy to save for 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.130
 weapons and I hope you get a lot 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:19.570
 good profit then here the skull 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.570

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.240
