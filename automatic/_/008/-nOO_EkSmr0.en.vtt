00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.810 
yet now I do have one pacific for my
iphone<00:01:12.900> 6<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.860> called<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.100> phone<00:01:14.310> fruit<00:01:14.610> or

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820

any<00:01:15.240> other<00:01:15.360> iphone<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.960> takes<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.290> port<00:01:16.650> on

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
any other iphone that takes that port on

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.460 
any other iphone that takes that port on
and<00:01:17.340> this<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.549> about<00:01:17.670> 3000<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.930> mean<00:01:19.259> they

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
and this is about 3000 and I mean they

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.109 
and this is about 3000 and I mean they
say<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.799> 3,000<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:20.430> goes<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.820> pretty

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
say it's 3,000 but it goes on pretty

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.179 
say it's 3,000 but it goes on pretty
fast<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.380> kind<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.740> miniature

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
fast so this is kind of like a miniature

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.920 
fast so this is kind of like a miniature
backup<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.850> in<00:01:24.030> case<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.479> charges<00:01:24.810> via
