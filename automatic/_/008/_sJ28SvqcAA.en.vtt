00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
color correction on will turn it off for

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.860 
color correction on will turn it off for
the<00:00:44.070> moment<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.180> we<00:00:45.270> will<00:00:45.360> do<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.600> first

the moment so what we will do is first
you<00:00:46.200> go<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.410> layer<00:00:46.860> new<00:00:47.450> solid<00:00:48.800> there's<00:00:49.800> a

you go to layer new solid there's a
matte<00:00:50.039> like<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> color<00:00:50.520> preferably<00:00:51.390> common

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
to go with the basic circle so I'm going

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.249 
to go with the basic circle so I'm going
to<00:01:33.329> move<00:01:33.570> up<00:01:34.100> down<00:01:35.100> onto<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> scope<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.450> I'm

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
to move up down onto the scope and I'm

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:45.139 
to move up down onto the scope and I'm
adjust<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.920> using<00:01:38.100> scale<00:01:42.380> okay<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:44.070> when<00:01:44.430> you

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
adjust it using scale okay so when you

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.639 
adjust it using scale okay so when you
look<00:01:45.450> at<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> settings<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.079> ignore<00:01:46.560> the

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
look at the settings you ignore the

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.590 
look at the settings you ignore the
color<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.070> now<00:01:47.100> but<00:01:47.880> if<00:01:48.060> thickness<00:01:48.479> we're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
color for now but if thickness we're

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.670 
color for now but if thickness we're
going<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> change<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> thickness<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.500> this

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
going to change the thickness of this

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.929 
going to change the thickness of this
and<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.520> about<00:01:50.909> 12<00:01:51.500> and<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:53.430> can<00:01:53.579> change<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
and get about 12 and you can change the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.920 
and get about 12 and you can change the
feather<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.720> bit<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.380> feather<00:01:55.619> there<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:56.930> softer

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
feather a bit of feather there I softer

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.499 
feather a bit of feather there I softer
edge<00:01:58.110> we<00:01:58.469> bring<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> opacity<00:01:59.009> down<00:01:59.250> later<00:01:59.640> and

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
edge we bring the opacity down later and

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.580 
edge we bring the opacity down later and
it<00:02:00.840> looks<00:02:00.990> pretty<00:02:01.200> nice<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.270> then<00:02:03.409> you<00:02:04.409> can

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it looks pretty nice and then you can

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.949 
it looks pretty nice and then you can
use<00:02:04.829> this<00:02:04.979> start<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.759> end<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:07.200> keyframe<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:09.780> do

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
use this start and end to keyframe to do

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:10.910 
use this start and end to keyframe to do
a<00:02:09.989> spinning<00:02:10.349> around<00:02:10.410> but<00:02:10.649> we're<00:02:10.739> going<00:02:10.860> to

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
a spinning around but we're going to

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.020 
a spinning around but we're going to
leave<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.190> alone<00:02:11.280> I'm<00:02:11.520> going<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.700> use<00:02:11.790> offset

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
leave that alone I'm going to use offset

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.160 
leave that alone I'm going to use offset
instead

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
instead

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.660 
instead
Straight<00:02:13.500> Outta<00:02:13.650> minute<00:02:13.950> I'm<00:02:14.340> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.490> click

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
Straight Outta minute I'm going to click

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.699 
Straight Outta minute I'm going to click
on<00:02:14.760> loop<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.360> then<00:02:15.569> come<00:02:15.750> down<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.959> taper<00:02:16.349> and

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
on loop and then come down to taper and

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.910 
on loop and then come down to taper and
click<00:02:17.670> enable<00:02:18.150> as<00:02:18.599> you<00:02:19.200> can<00:02:19.319> see<00:02:19.560> this<00:02:19.739> is

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
click enable as you can see this is

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.010 
click enable as you can see this is
going<00:02:20.069> to<00:02:20.190> give<00:02:20.340> you<00:02:20.550> this<00:02:21.360> case<00:02:21.630> they<00:02:21.750> can<00:02:21.959> be

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
going to give you this case they can be

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.890 
going to give you this case they can be
too<00:02:22.200> short<00:02:22.440> ends<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.220> thick<00:02:23.599> part<00:02:24.599> in<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
too short ends and the thick part in the

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.839 
too short ends and the thick part in the
middle<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:25.680> we<00:02:25.709> don't<00:02:26.010> want<00:02:26.220> this<00:02:26.370> we<00:02:26.640> want

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
middle but we don't want this we want

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.180 
middle but we don't want this we want
the<00:02:27.420> thick<00:02:27.989> part<00:02:28.290> you're<00:02:28.440> going<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.650> end<00:02:28.800> like

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
the thick part you're going to end like

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.449 
the thick part you're going to end like
so<00:02:29.550> now<00:02:30.420> I've<00:02:30.540> got<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.870> offset<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.590> bring<00:02:32.370> the

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
so now I've got to offset and bring the

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.979 
so now I've got to offset and bring the
value<00:02:32.760> up<00:02:32.940> see<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.660> more<00:02:33.840> I<00:02:33.870> bring<00:02:34.050> it<00:02:34.140> up<00:02:34.459> it

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
value up see the more I bring it up it

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.280 
value up see the more I bring it up it
causes<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.410> servos<00:02:38.400> spin<00:02:38.700> around<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:40.230> it

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
causes the servos spin around so it

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.080 
causes the servos spin around so it
brings<00:02:40.410> back<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.830> zero<00:02:41.100> I'm<00:02:41.700> going<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.940> change

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
brings back to zero I'm going to change

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.280 
brings back to zero I'm going to change
some<00:02:42.269> more<00:02:42.420> settings<00:02:42.630> that's<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.989> best<00:02:43.170> thing

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
some more settings that's the best thing

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.809 
some more settings that's the best thing
about<00:02:43.380> this<00:02:43.620> plug-in<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:44.160> can<00:02:44.250> see<00:02:44.459> all<00:02:44.700> the

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
about this plug-in you can see all the

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.910 
about this plug-in you can see all the
different<00:02:44.940> things<00:02:45.330> down<00:02:45.780> here<00:02:45.989> so<00:02:46.560> much<00:02:46.769> you

different things down here so much you
can<00:02:47.040> do<00:02:47.280> with<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.550> so<00:02:47.850> many<00:02:48.030> different<00:02:48.480> things

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
can do with it so many different things

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.440 
can do with it so many different things
so<00:02:49.470> make<00:02:49.650> sure<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.299> try<00:02:51.299> different

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
so make sure you and try different

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.220 
so make sure you and try different
things<00:02:51.600> so<00:02:52.290> what<00:02:52.410> you<00:02:52.500> like<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.870> if<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:55.080> call

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
things so what you like so if we call

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.449 
things so what you like so if we call
the<00:02:55.560> e<00:02:57.500> start<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.620> end<00:02:58.769> table<00:02:59.040> you<00:02:59.100> can<00:02:59.190> change

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
the e start and end table you can change

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.490 
the e start and end table you can change
the<00:02:59.760> size<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.450> length<00:03:00.750> as<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.380> goes

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
the size and the length as it goes

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.680 
the size and the length as it goes
around<00:03:01.709> sake<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.190> may<00:03:02.670> be<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.819> smaller<00:03:03.330> one<00:03:03.450> we

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
around sake it may be a smaller one we

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.300 
around sake it may be a smaller one we
could<00:03:03.810> have<00:03:03.930> maybe<00:03:04.560> three<00:03:04.980> small<00:03:05.280> ones

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
could have maybe three small ones

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.729 
could have maybe three small ones
spinning<00:03:05.880> around<00:03:05.940> something<00:03:06.360> like<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.780> so

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
spinning around something like that so

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:08.990 
spinning around something like that so
I'm<00:03:07.799> really<00:03:07.860> cool<00:03:08.280> stuff<00:03:08.459> you<00:03:08.549> can<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:08.760> with<00:03:08.880> it

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
I'm really cool stuff you can do with it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.140 
I'm really cool stuff you can do with it
but<00:03:09.030> I'm<00:03:09.239> going<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.510> leave<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.660> about<00:03:10.200> there

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
but I'm going to leave that about there

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.809 
but I'm going to leave that about there
okay<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.209> that's<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.540> basics<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:13.049> that<00:03:13.819> all

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
okay so that's the basics of that all

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.190 
okay so that's the basics of that all
you<00:03:14.880> have<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.030> do<00:03:15.120> is<00:03:15.209> keyframe<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.780> offset

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
you have to do is keyframe the offset

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.870 
you have to do is keyframe the offset
and<00:03:16.670> I'll<00:03:17.670> spin<00:03:17.970> around<00:03:18.090> nicely<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.310> next<00:03:20.700> what

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
and I'll spin around nicely so next what

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.569 
and I'll spin around nicely so next what
I'm<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.209> do<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.890> I'm<00:03:22.890> going<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.190> bring<00:03:23.400> in

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
I'm going to do is I'm going to bring in

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:27.080 
I'm going to do is I'm going to bring in
I'm<00:03:23.790> go<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.030> effects<00:03:25.160> generate<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.489> go<00:03:26.640> to<00:03:26.700> for

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
I'm go to effects generate and go to for

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.120 
I'm go to effects generate and go to for
color<00:03:27.359> gradient<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:28.920> basically

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
color gradient and this is basically

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.479 
color gradient and this is basically
what<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.489> use<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.150> give<00:03:31.109> the<00:03:31.350> rainbow<00:03:32.190> effect

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
what I use to give the rainbow effect

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.789 
what I use to give the rainbow effect
obviously<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:33.630> can<00:03:33.780> edit<00:03:33.989> all<00:03:34.200> these<00:03:34.350> colors

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
obviously you can edit all these colors

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.560 
obviously you can edit all these colors
I'm<00:03:35.010> happy<00:03:35.700> with<00:03:35.820> all<00:03:35.970> these<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.299> I'm<00:03:36.359> going<00:03:36.510> to

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
I'm happy with all these so I'm going to

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.810 
I'm happy with all these so I'm going to
leave<00:03:36.750> them<00:03:37.070> next<00:03:38.070> I'm<00:03:38.280> going<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.519> go<00:03:38.609> to<00:03:38.670> the

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
leave them next I'm going to go to the

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
leave them next I'm going to go to the
effects<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.359> presets<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:40.140> type<00:03:40.200> in<00:03:40.470> glow

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
effects and presets and type in glow

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.470 
effects and presets and type in glow
like<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:42.989> umm<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.850> is<00:03:44.850> going<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.209> really

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
like that umm this is going to really

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.970 
like that umm this is going to really
brighten<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.109> up<00:03:46.260> we<00:03:46.560> put<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.799> color

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
brighten it up we put the color

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.130 
brighten it up we put the color
correction<00:03:47.220> on<00:03:47.489> see<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.420> looking<00:03:48.660> really<00:03:48.930> nice

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
correction on see is looking really nice

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.890 
correction on see is looking really nice
now<00:03:49.410> but<00:03:50.220> we<00:03:50.940> can<00:03:51.060> increase<00:03:51.359> this<00:03:51.450> more<00:03:51.720> by

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
now but we can increase this more by

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.090 
now but we can increase this more by
moon-down<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:53.070> threshold<00:03:53.760> a<00:03:54.180> little<00:03:54.239> I<00:03:54.630> think

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
moon-down the threshold a little I think

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.080 
moon-down the threshold a little I think
yeah<00:03:56.100> you<00:03:56.250> want<00:03:56.400> to<00:03:56.459> bring<00:03:56.579> out<00:03:56.670> too<00:03:56.910> much

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
yeah you want to bring out too much

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.059 
yeah you want to bring out too much
because<00:03:57.209> you'll<00:03:57.420> start<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.900> be<00:03:58.410> on<00:03:58.560> to<00:03:58.709> zero

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
because you'll start to be on to zero

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.670 
because you'll start to be on to zero
start<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.090> lose<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.420> color<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:01.290> keep<00:04:01.530> that

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
start to lose the color so keep that

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.900 
start to lose the color so keep that
maybe<00:04:01.920> on<00:04:03.890> 40mm<00:04:05.209> what<00:04:06.209> if<00:04:06.299> I<00:04:06.390> will<00:04:06.569> do<00:04:07.910> we

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
maybe on 40mm what if I will do we

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.890 
maybe on 40mm what if I will do we
change<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.299> radius<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.959> give<00:04:10.109> it<00:04:10.200> more<00:04:10.500> below

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
change the radius to give it more below

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.879 
change the radius to give it more below
pretty<00:04:12.900> happy<00:04:13.350> with<00:04:13.470> that<00:04:13.940> intensity<00:04:15.769> make<00:04:16.769> it

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
pretty happy with that intensity make it

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.969 
pretty happy with that intensity make it
more<00:04:17.010> intense<00:04:18.350> I'm<00:04:19.350> pretty<00:04:19.590> happy<00:04:19.709> with<00:04:19.889> all

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
more intense I'm pretty happy with all

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.290 
more intense I'm pretty happy with all
that<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.340> then<00:04:21.200> let's<00:04:22.200> type<00:04:22.440> in<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.970> backup

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
taken the color way so it may be a

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.140 
taken the color way so it may be a
little<00:04:41.340> bit<00:04:41.580> too<00:04:41.760> much<00:04:42.030> bring<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:43.080> down<00:04:43.350> a<00:04:43.380> bit

that just for the sense this tutorial
and<00:05:14.229> so<00:05:15.229> as<00:05:15.740> you<00:05:16.009> saw<00:05:16.250> in<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.460> -<00:05:16.610> in<00:05:16.909> the<00:05:17.240> Edit

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
and so as you saw in the - in the Edit

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.219 
and so as you saw in the - in the Edit
it<00:05:18.830> was<00:05:19.129> well<00:05:19.909> it<00:05:20.090> was<00:05:20.180> poorly<00:05:20.719> but<00:05:20.990> it<00:05:21.110> was

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
it was well it was poorly but it was

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.649 
it was well it was poorly but it was
motion<00:05:21.740> trap<00:05:22.009> around<00:05:22.400> this<00:05:22.639> game<00:05:22.819> now<00:05:22.969> is<00:05:23.449> it

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
motion trap around this game now is it

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:25.809 
motion trap around this game now is it
was<00:05:23.870> difficult<00:05:24.050> to<00:05:24.289> motion<00:05:24.620> track<00:05:24.949> and<00:05:25.310> you

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
was difficult to motion track and you

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:27.969 
was difficult to motion track and you
can't<00:05:26.060> really<00:05:26.210> track<00:05:26.539> it<00:05:26.689> using<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:27.379> in<00:05:27.740> both

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
can't really track it using and in both

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:31.149 
can't really track it using and in both
plugins<00:05:29.229> because<00:05:30.229> obviously<00:05:30.409> when<00:05:30.800> it<00:05:30.919> zooms

00:05:31.149 --> 00:05:31.159 
plugins because obviously when it zooms

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:35.529 
plugins because obviously when it zooms
in<00:05:31.900> ease<00:05:33.129> then<00:05:34.129> the<00:05:34.699> bit<00:05:34.879> is<00:05:35.000> tracking<00:05:35.449> the

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:35.539 
in ease then the bit is tracking the

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:37.540 
in ease then the bit is tracking the
scope<00:05:35.780> will<00:05:35.960> cut<00:05:36.139> up<00:05:36.349> so<00:05:36.800> I<00:05:36.830> basically<00:05:37.250> had<00:05:37.430> to

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
scope will cut up so I basically had to

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.670 
scope will cut up so I basically had to
hand<00:05:37.789> track<00:05:38.000> this<00:05:38.180> like<00:05:38.389> a<00:05:38.419> fool<00:05:38.780> doing<00:05:39.560> quite

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
hand track this like a fool doing quite

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.330 
hand track this like a fool doing quite
a<00:05:39.740> wide<00:05:39.949> hand<00:05:40.190> racket<00:05:40.520> but<00:05:40.729> and<00:05:41.050> it<00:05:42.159> was<00:05:43.159> more

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
a wide hand racket but and it was more

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.029 
a wide hand racket but and it was more
reliable<00:05:43.580> that<00:05:43.819> way<00:05:44.050> so<00:05:45.050> when<00:05:45.500> I'm<00:05:45.800> going<00:05:45.919> to

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
reliable that way so when I'm going to

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:47.709 
reliable that way so when I'm going to
quickly<00:05:46.159> track<00:05:46.550> this<00:05:46.699> for<00:05:46.940> you<00:05:47.060> and<00:05:47.240> then<00:05:47.629> I'm

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
quickly track this for you and then I'm

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:52.240 
quickly track this for you and then I'm
going<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:47.930> and<00:05:48.319> when<00:05:48.620> a<00:05:48.650> key<00:05:49.599> frame<00:05:50.599> the<00:05:51.590> offset

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
going to and when a key frame the offset

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.589 
going to and when a key frame the offset
and<00:05:52.520> I'm<00:05:52.699> going<00:05:52.879> to<00:05:52.940> show<00:05:53.090> you<00:05:53.150> how<00:05:53.270> it<00:05:53.389> looks

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
and I'm going to show you how it looks

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:56.469 
and I'm going to show you how it looks
when<00:05:53.840> I've<00:05:54.050> tracked<00:05:54.289> it<00:05:54.379> up<00:05:54.560> and<00:05:55.330> when<00:05:56.330> I've

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 
when I've tracked it up and when I've

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.809 
when I've tracked it up and when I've
key<00:05:56.779> from<00:05:56.930> the<00:05:56.990> offset<00:05:57.409> and<00:05:57.440> I've<00:05:57.860> finished

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
key from the offset and I've finished

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:12.469 
key from the offset and I've finished
with<00:05:58.969> it<00:05:59.150> okay<00:05:59.719> I'll<00:05:59.810> see<00:05:59.900> you<00:05:59.960> guys<00:06:00.020> in<00:06:00.259> there

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.529 
going to just quickly pre-run previewed
it<00:06:18.919> so<00:06:19.919> that's<00:06:20.099> it<00:06:20.340> basically<00:06:20.520> it's<00:06:21.029> obviously

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:21.539 
it so that's it basically it's obviously

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:23.749 
it so that's it basically it's obviously
a<00:06:21.599> really<00:06:21.719> quick<00:06:21.960> motion<00:06:22.349> track<00:06:22.669> spend<00:06:23.669> more

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
a really quick motion track spend more

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:25.909 
a really quick motion track spend more
time<00:06:23.969> if<00:06:24.120> you<00:06:24.150> want<00:06:24.289> but<00:06:25.289> basically<00:06:25.469> how<00:06:25.830> it

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 
time if you want but basically how it

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.579 
time if you want but basically how it
works<00:06:26.099> for<00:06:26.279> every<00:06:26.580> on<00:06:26.789> the<00:06:27.059> offset<00:06:27.449> every<00:06:27.900> 100

00:06:28.579 --> 00:06:28.589 
works for every on the offset every 100

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:33.920 
works for every on the offset every 100
is<00:06:28.770> a<00:06:29.059> full<00:06:30.059> spin<00:06:30.650> so<00:06:31.650> I<00:06:31.680> see<00:06:32.279> frames<00:06:32.699> it<00:06:32.969> up

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:33.930 
is a full spin so I see frames it up

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.649 
is a full spin so I see frames it up
about<00:06:34.710> 500<00:06:35.400> soldiers<00:06:35.580> five<00:06:35.909> spins<00:06:36.180> obviously

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
about 500 soldiers five spins obviously

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:40.459 
about 500 soldiers five spins obviously
