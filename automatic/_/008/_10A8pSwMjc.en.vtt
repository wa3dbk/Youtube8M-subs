maybe say it one time I'm a broadcast I
was<00:03:25.049> seeing<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.590> little<00:03:26.010> bit<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.459> different

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
was seeing a little bit of a different

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.840 
was seeing a little bit of a different
Dale<00:03:27.660> Earnhardt<00:03:28.200> it's<00:03:28.680> almost<00:03:29.190> like<00:03:29.459> he<00:03:29.700> was

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
Dale Earnhardt it's almost like he was

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.650 
Dale Earnhardt it's almost like he was
on<00:03:30.000> defense<00:03:30.709> versus<00:03:31.709> on<00:03:31.859> offense<00:03:32.459> and<00:03:32.880> I<00:03:33.480> don't

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
on defense versus on offense and I don't

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.690 
on defense versus on offense and I don't
think<00:03:33.900> Dale<00:03:34.170> Earnhardt<00:03:34.620> was<00:03:34.769> ever<00:03:35.040> content

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
think Dale Earnhardt was ever content

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.539

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
with anything but winning the race but I

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.150 
with anything but winning the race but I
think<00:03:38.880> on<00:03:39.030> this<00:03:39.239> given<00:03:39.660> day<00:03:39.840> he<00:03:40.560> was<00:03:40.709> gonna<00:03:40.829> be

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160
