00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.700 
unfortunately it does have some ads
occasionally<00:00:53.340> but<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.110> don't<00:00:55.289> get<00:00:55.379> paid<00:00:55.530> by

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.810 
occasionally but and I don't get paid by
them<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.039> don't<00:00:56.160> consider<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.730> an

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
them so don't consider this an

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.279 
them so don't consider this an
advertisement<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.480> i<00:00:57.539> thought<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.809> because

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
advertisement but i thought this because

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.080 
advertisement but i thought this because
they've<00:00:58.469> not<00:00:58.680> locked<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.160> work<00:00:59.370> where<00:00:59.399> I<00:00:59.820> work

they've not locked up work where I work

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.290 
they've not locked up work where I work

00:01:59.750 --> 00:01:59.760 
think that's the best way to get good

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.790 
think that's the best way to get good
from<00:02:00.450> being<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.690> bands<00:02:00.900> for<00:02:01.140> long<00:02:01.290> time<00:02:01.440> myself
