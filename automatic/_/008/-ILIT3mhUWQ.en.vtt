 this process is the selection of paint 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.310
 how to choose the desired shade now we tell you

 use a spectrophotometer this is a device 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.150
 to determine the spectral composition of 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.510
 wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation in 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:50.480
 3 optical ranges spectrophotometer 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:52.940
 transfers data to the computer computer 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.010
 selects the desired formula based on this 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.820
 formulas the program determines the necessary 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.820
 number of components

 pigments 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.039
 it is important to respect the exact proportions

 otherwise the color of paint may change. 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:38.270
 when mixing all the ingredients we

 get the color you want then done 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.299
 control vykraska on which 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:59.929
 determine the required amount 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:02:06.289
 layering varnish can now be compared 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:07.970
 details in the end we get ready 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:09.800
 paint that fits perfectly 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.270
 main color of the car 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.230
 it remains only to put on 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.230
 prepared part
