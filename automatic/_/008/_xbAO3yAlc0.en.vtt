drag push that's the three steps for the
NES<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.330> Sigma<00:01:50.690> here<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:51.740> I'm<00:01:51.800> just<00:01:51.920> gonna

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
NES the Sigma here so I'm just gonna

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.399 
NES the Sigma here so I'm just gonna
walk<00:01:52.190> through<00:01:52.340> it<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.520> bit<00:01:52.550> slower<00:01:53.259> so<00:01:54.259> as<00:01:54.320> I

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
walk through it a bit slower so as I

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.130 
walk through it a bit slower so as I
approach<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:55.130> defender<00:01:55.610> make<00:01:56.210> a<00:01:56.240> move<00:01:56.659> and

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
approach the defender make a move and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.000 
approach the defender make a move and
then<00:01:57.259> I'm<00:01:57.440> dragging<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.040> and<00:01:58.340> then<00:01:58.460> pushing<00:01:58.850> it
