00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.570
 It means in the first place in the first place to have a very 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.869

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.300
 special things this floor can do 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.820
 stick but they stand on today 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.309
 the day is very very expensive and can be done 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.040

 close up in winter when they are over 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 the rooms are drier and the village is more 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.409
