00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.999 

okay<00:00:03.510> now<00:00:04.140> we're<00:00:04.319> going<00:00:04.410> to<00:00:04.529> do<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.799> Gram

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
okay now we're going to do the Gram

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.120 
okay now we're going to do the Gram
stain<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:06.000> Gram<00:00:06.240> stain<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:07.130> differential

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
stain the Gram stain is a differential

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.410 
stain the Gram stain is a differential
stain<00:00:08.400> because<00:00:09.000> it's<00:00:09.150> going<00:00:09.300> to

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
stain because it's going to

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.839 
stain because it's going to
differentiate<00:00:10.230> between<00:00:10.650> different<00:00:11.519> types<00:00:11.639> of

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
differentiate between different types of

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.230 
differentiate between different types of
bacteria<00:00:12.030> gram-positive<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.500> gram-negative

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
bacteria gram-positive and gram-negative

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.240 
bacteria gram-positive and gram-negative
now<00:00:15.240> you've<00:00:15.420> learned<00:00:15.599> about<00:00:15.870> this<00:00:16.139> in<00:00:16.440> lecture

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
now you've learned about this in lecture

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.950 
now you've learned about this in lecture
or<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.760> your<00:00:17.940> online<00:00:18.119> lecture<00:00:18.690> that<00:00:18.840> you're

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
or in your online lecture that you're

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.920 
or in your online lecture that you're
doing<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.300> procedure<00:00:21.630> that

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
doing and so this is the procedure that

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.450 
doing and so this is the procedure that
we're<00:00:22.080> going<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.230> use<00:00:22.529> now<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.160> one<00:00:23.340> of

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
we're going to use now this is one of

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.200 
we're going to use now this is one of
the<00:00:23.550> most<00:00:23.730> important<00:00:24.330> stains<00:00:24.660> when<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.410> doctor

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
the most important stains when a doctor

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.839 
the most important stains when a doctor
suspects<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.480> bacterial<00:00:28.170> infection<00:00:28.640> say<00:00:29.640> in

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
suspects a bacterial infection say in

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.429 
suspects a bacterial infection say in
the<00:00:29.970> lungs<00:00:30.269> or<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.779> blood<00:00:31.019> or<00:00:31.050> something

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the lungs or in the blood or something

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.190 
the lungs or in the blood or something
he's<00:00:32.219> going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> send<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.850> sample<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:33.870> lab

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
he's going to send a sample to the lab

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.990 
he's going to send a sample to the lab
and<00:00:34.590> then<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> lab<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.880> do<00:00:35.969> a

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
and then the lab is going to do a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.150 
and then the lab is going to do a
differential<00:00:36.570> stain<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.290> Gram<00:00:37.469> stain<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.010> it

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
differential stain and Gram stain and it

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.680 
differential stain and Gram stain and it
takes<00:00:38.340> maybe<00:00:38.489> about<00:00:38.820> 10<00:00:39.059> minutes<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.540> get<00:00:39.629> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
takes maybe about 10 minutes to get a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.930 
takes maybe about 10 minutes to get a
result<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:41.129> quickly<00:00:41.309> distinguish

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
result so you can quickly distinguish

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.479 
result so you can quickly distinguish
between<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.420> two<00:00:42.600> one<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.739> importance<00:00:44.219> of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
between the two one of the importance of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.930 
between the two one of the importance of
the<00:00:44.730> Gram<00:00:44.940> stain<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.690> most<00:00:45.899> important<00:00:46.469> is

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
the Gram stain or the most important is

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.040 
the Gram stain or the most important is
depending<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.149> type<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.539> wall<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
depending on the type of wall that a

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.080 
depending on the type of wall that a
bacteria<00:00:49.590> has<00:00:49.829> whether<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.370> grandpa's<00:00:50.760> or

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
bacteria has whether it's grandpa's or

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.720 
bacteria has whether it's grandpa's or
gram-negative<00:00:51.420> then<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.739> target<00:00:52.949> target

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
gram-negative then you can target target

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.639 
gram-negative then you can target target
that<00:00:53.879> particular<00:00:54.030> bacteria<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> type<00:00:55.469> of

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
that particular bacteria with a type of

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.450 
that particular bacteria with a type of
antibiotic<00:00:56.899> gram-negative<00:00:57.949> bacteria<00:00:58.949> for

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
antibiotic gram-negative bacteria for

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.610 
antibiotic gram-negative bacteria for
example<00:00:59.940> are<00:01:00.120> resistant<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> penicillin

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
example are resistant to penicillin

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.799 
example are resistant to penicillin
okay<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.670> is<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:02.879> really<00:01:03.180> important<00:01:03.600> stain

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
okay so this is a really important stain

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.320 
okay so this is a really important stain
to<00:01:03.989> know<00:01:04.140> now<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.040> has<00:01:05.280> several<00:01:06.030> different

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
to know now it has several different

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.080 
to know now it has several different
stains<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:07.020> we're<00:01:07.140> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.350> use<00:01:07.650> okay<00:01:08.460> so

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
stains that we're going to use okay so

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.179 
stains that we're going to use okay so
what<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.299> want<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.600> point<00:01:09.780> out<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.140> on<00:01:10.260> page<00:01:10.500> 35

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
what I want to point out is on page 35

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.149 
what I want to point out is on page 35
of<00:01:11.250> your<00:01:11.580> lab<00:01:11.790> manual<00:01:12.290> it<00:01:13.290> says<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:14.040> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
of your lab manual it says in the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.899 
of your lab manual it says in the
procedure<00:01:14.720> it<00:01:15.720> says<00:01:16.110> number<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:17.070> prepare<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
procedure it says number one prepare and

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.510 
procedure it says number one prepare and
fix<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.450> smear<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.530> would<00:01:19.950> go<00:01:20.130> through<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
fix a smear so you would go through the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
fix a smear so you would go through the
same<00:01:20.759> procedure<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.570> did<00:01:21.869> last<00:01:22.140> time

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
same procedure that we did last time

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.640 
same procedure that we did last time
where<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.640> put<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.450> bacteria<00:01:25.049> on<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.350> slide

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
where you put the bacteria on the slide

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.969 
where you put the bacteria on the slide
let<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.610> dry<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.270> after<00:01:28.140> it's<00:01:28.259> dry<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.530> run<00:01:28.860> it

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
let it dry and after it's dry you run it

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.230 
let it dry and after it's dry you run it
through<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> flame<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.520> couple<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.030> times

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
through the flame a couple of times

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.719 
through the flame a couple of times
that's<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.140> fixing<00:01:31.590> okay<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.250> remember<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
that's the fixing okay so remember I

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.310 
that's the fixing okay so remember I
said<00:01:32.970> last<00:01:33.150> time<00:01:33.420> that<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.720> need<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.170> that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
said last time that you need to do that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.830 
said last time that you need to do that
every<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:35.009> before<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:36.180> do<00:01:36.329> a<00:01:36.360> staining

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
every time before you do a staining

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.590 
every time before you do a staining
procedure<00:01:36.990> unless<00:01:37.560> otherwise<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.490> hold<00:01:38.700> okay

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
procedure unless otherwise to hold okay

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.719 
procedure unless otherwise to hold okay
so<00:01:40.229> once<00:01:40.470> we've<00:01:40.650> fixed<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.430> I'm<00:01:41.520> going<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
so once we've fixed it and I'm going to

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.130 
so once we've fixed it and I'm going to
pretend<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> slide<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.689> has<00:01:42.960> been

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
pretend I have a slide that has been

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.480 
pretend I have a slide that has been
fixed<00:01:44.930> okay<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.229> have<00:01:46.649> my<00:01:46.829> slide<00:01:47.159> with<00:01:47.340> my

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
fixed okay I have my slide with my

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.460 
fixed okay I have my slide with my
bacteria<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:48.930> I'm<00:01:49.079> going<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.290> go<00:01:49.409> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
bacteria on it now I'm going to go to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.340 
bacteria on it now I'm going to go to
page<00:01:49.710> 36<00:01:50.460> where<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.329> has<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.720> actual<00:01:52.110> Gram

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
page 36 where it has the actual Gram

be careful use gloves or if you like you

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.710 
be careful use gloves or if you like you
can<00:02:06.360> use<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.659> paper<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
can use the paper the

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.870 
can use the paper the
not<00:02:07.900> paper<00:02:08.110> clips<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.500> clothes<00:02:08.680> pins<00:02:08.950> so<00:02:09.729> it

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
not paper clips the clothes pins so it

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.640 
not paper clips the clothes pins so it
says<00:02:10.090> flood<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.570> so<00:02:10.930> I'm<00:02:11.050> going<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.260> flood<00:02:11.500> it

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
says flood it so I'm going to flood it

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.980 
says flood it so I'm going to flood it
you<00:02:11.740> just<00:02:11.950> cover<00:02:12.160> it<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.180> says<00:02:13.420> for<00:02:13.660> 30

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
you just cover it and it says for 30

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.290 
you just cover it and it says for 30
seconds<00:02:14.470> once<00:02:14.680> again<00:02:14.980> if<00:02:15.100> it<00:02:15.220> goes<00:02:15.340> 45<00:02:15.880> seconds

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
seconds once again if it goes 45 seconds

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.590 
seconds once again if it goes 45 seconds
that's<00:02:16.450> okay<00:02:16.980> all<00:02:17.980> right<00:02:18.160> now<00:02:19.090> I've<00:02:19.240> waited<00:02:19.420> my

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
that's okay all right now I've waited my

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.570 
that's okay all right now I've waited my
30<00:02:19.990> seconds<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.650> you're<00:02:21.100> always<00:02:21.280> going<00:02:21.550> to

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
30 seconds and you're always going to

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.940 
30 seconds and you're always going to
rinse<00:02:21.820> between<00:02:22.300> steps<00:02:22.630> so<00:02:23.320> I<00:02:23.350> have<00:02:23.590> my<00:02:23.740> water

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
rinse between steps so I have my water

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.920 
rinse between steps so I have my water
bottle<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.900> I'm<00:02:25.900> going<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.170> rinse<00:02:28.380> okay<00:02:29.730> now

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
bottle and I'm going to rinse okay now

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.910 
bottle and I'm going to rinse okay now
the<00:02:31.930> next<00:02:31.960> thing<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.380> it<00:02:32.650> says<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.890> do<00:02:33.280> is<00:02:34.920> put

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
the next thing that it says to do is put

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.040 
the next thing that it says to do is put
the<00:02:36.040> grams<00:02:36.310> iodine<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.150> that's<00:02:37.690> this<00:02:37.900> one

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
the grams iodine on that's this one

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.650 
the grams iodine on that's this one
right<00:02:38.110> here<00:02:38.440> grams<00:02:38.740> iodine<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.550> it<00:02:40.270> says<00:02:40.480> for

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
right here grams iodine and it says for

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.110 
right here grams iodine and it says for
about<00:02:40.810> 10<00:02:41.050> seconds<00:02:41.500> this<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:41.770> the<00:02:41.950> mordant<00:02:42.430> so

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
about 10 seconds this is the mordant so

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.990 
about 10 seconds this is the mordant so
if<00:02:43.270> it's<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.540> gram<00:02:43.750> positive<00:02:44.380> cell<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:45.370> iodine

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
if it's a gram positive cell the iodine

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.500 
if it's a gram positive cell the iodine
will<00:02:46.630> make<00:02:46.780> a<00:02:46.810> complex<00:02:47.580> with<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:49.090> crystal

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
will make a complex with the crystal

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.040 
will make a complex with the crystal
violet<00:02:50.670> pulling<00:02:51.670> it<00:02:51.790> into<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.209> wall<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.630> then

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
violet pulling it into the wall and then

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.480 
violet pulling it into the wall and then
when<00:02:53.230> we<00:02:53.350> go<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.709> next<00:02:53.920> step<00:02:54.160> and<00:02:54.310> it's

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
when we go to the next step and it's

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.490 
when we go to the next step and it's
dehydrated<00:02:55.270> those<00:02:55.420> crystals<00:02:55.959> will<00:02:56.140> stay<00:02:56.350> in

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
dehydrated those crystals will stay in

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.650 
dehydrated those crystals will stay in
the<00:02:56.620> wall<00:02:56.770> if<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.580> skip<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.060> mordant<00:02:58.420> you'll

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
the wall if you skip the mordant you'll

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.930 
the wall if you skip the mordant you'll
lose<00:02:58.930> your<00:02:59.080> crystal<00:02:59.470> violet<00:02:59.650> and<00:03:00.040> end<00:03:00.550> up<00:03:00.700> with

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
lose your crystal violet and end up with

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.230 
lose your crystal violet and end up with
a<00:03:00.970> false<00:03:01.480> negative<00:03:02.010> okay<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.790> sits<00:03:04.090> for

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
a false negative okay that sits for

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.270 
a false negative okay that sits for
about<00:03:04.420> 10<00:03:04.660> seconds<00:03:05.110> and<00:03:05.290> then<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.800> says<00:03:06.010> rinse

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
about 10 seconds and then it says rinse

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.150 
about 10 seconds and then it says rinse
smear<00:03:06.610> I'm<00:03:07.209> going<00:03:07.390> to<00:03:07.450> rinse<00:03:07.570> it<00:03:08.160> remember

never spray on to this this day in
itself<00:03:11.610> okay<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:13.090> next<00:03:13.330> one<00:03:13.570> is<00:03:14.190> decolorizing

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
itself okay the next one is decolorizing

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.120 
itself okay the next one is decolorizing
with<00:03:15.489> alcohol<00:03:16.030> this<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.050> one<00:03:17.260> step<00:03:17.440> that

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
with alcohol this is the one step that

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.460 
with alcohol this is the one step that
you<00:03:18.580> have<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:19.030> really<00:03:19.239> be<00:03:19.480> specific<00:03:19.750> at<00:03:20.290> what

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
you have to really be specific at what

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.890 
you have to really be specific at what
you<00:03:20.590> do<00:03:20.800> if<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.940> leave<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.300> on<00:03:22.360> too<00:03:22.660> long

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
you do if you leave it on too long

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.140 
you do if you leave it on too long
you'll<00:03:23.530> decolorize<00:03:24.280> grande<00:03:24.640> positive

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
you'll decolorize grande positive

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.360 
you'll decolorize grande positive
bacteria<00:03:25.330> if<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:26.470> don't<00:03:26.650> leave<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:26.980> on<00:03:27.070> long

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
bacteria if you don't leave it on long

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.040 
bacteria if you don't leave it on long
enough<00:03:27.670> you<00:03:28.300> will<00:03:29.760> not<00:03:30.760> take<00:03:31.300> it<00:03:31.330> off<00:03:31.600> if<00:03:31.870> it's

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
enough you will not take it off if it's

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.250 
enough you will not take it off if it's
gram-negative<00:03:32.459> okay<00:03:33.459> not<00:03:33.640> decolorize<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:35.170> you

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
gram-negative okay not decolorize so you

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.140 
gram-negative okay not decolorize so you
want<00:03:35.530> to<00:03:35.620> do<00:03:35.739> this<00:03:35.890> for<00:03:36.220> it's<00:03:36.640> not<00:03:36.850> really<00:03:37.120> a

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
want to do this for it's not really a

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.390 
want to do this for it's not really a
time<00:03:37.420> period<00:03:37.720> you<00:03:38.170> don't<00:03:38.620> sit<00:03:38.920> it<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:39.160> there

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
time period you don't sit it on there

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.789 
time period you don't sit it on there
and<00:03:39.610> let<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:39.910> sit<00:03:40.060> you<00:03:40.810> actually<00:03:41.260> run<00:03:41.470> it<00:03:41.650> off

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
and let it sit you actually run it off

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.850 
and let it sit you actually run it off
now<00:03:42.580> if<00:03:42.730> you've<00:03:42.880> ever<00:03:43.000> colored<00:03:43.510> your<00:03:43.690> hair

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
now if you've ever colored your hair

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.740 
now if you've ever colored your hair
this<00:03:44.860> is<00:03:45.070> kind<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.790> same<00:03:46.000> procedure<00:03:46.420> after

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
this is kind of the same procedure after

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.240 
this is kind of the same procedure after
you've<00:03:47.019> colored<00:03:47.350> your<00:03:47.500> hair<00:03:47.560> you<00:03:47.890> rinse<00:03:48.160> your

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
you've colored your hair you rinse your

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.160 
you've colored your hair you rinse your
hair<00:03:48.700> until<00:03:49.000> you<00:03:49.330> don't<00:03:49.540> see<00:03:49.690> any<00:03:49.840> color

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
hair until you don't see any color

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.830 
hair until you don't see any color
coming<00:03:50.590> off<00:03:50.709> that's<00:03:51.400> the<00:03:51.610> same<00:03:51.910> thing<00:03:52.209> so

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
coming off that's the same thing so

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.390 
coming off that's the same thing so
right<00:03:53.080> here<00:03:53.350> and<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.620> is<00:03:53.830> step<00:03:54.549> e<00:03:54.730> on<00:03:55.320> page<00:03:56.400> 36

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
right here and this is step e on page 36

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.699 
right here and this is step e on page 36
so<00:03:58.060> I'm<00:03:58.180> going<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.360> hold<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.720> at<00:03:58.900> 45-degree

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
so I'm going to hold it at 45-degree

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.830 
so I'm going to hold it at 45-degree
angle<00:04:00.070> and<00:04:00.280> this<00:04:00.880> is<00:04:00.940> a<00:04:01.120> glass<00:04:01.420> bottle

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
angle and this is a glass bottle

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.710 
angle and this is a glass bottle
sometimes<00:04:02.260> we<00:04:02.440> use<00:04:02.620> these<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:04.120> you<00:04:04.299> just<00:04:04.510> let

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
sometimes we use these and you just let

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.770 
sometimes we use these and you just let
the<00:04:04.900> alcohol<00:04:05.769> drip<00:04:06.040> on<00:04:06.190> there<00:04:06.430> until<00:04:07.330> you<00:04:07.570> do

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
the alcohol drip on there until you do

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.470 
the alcohol drip on there until you do
not<00:04:07.959> see<00:04:08.290> any<00:04:08.530> color<00:04:08.890> coming<00:04:09.850> off<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.209> bottom

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
not see any color coming off the bottom

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.600 
not see any color coming off the bottom
of<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:10.630> slide<00:04:10.989> okay<00:04:11.769> that's<00:04:12.040> when<00:04:12.310> it's<00:04:12.459> been

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
of the slide okay that's when it's been

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.550 
of the slide okay that's when it's been
decolorized<00:04:13.239> long<00:04:13.510> enough<00:04:13.750> then<00:04:14.350> you

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
decolorized long enough then you

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.180 
decolorized long enough then you
immediately

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
immediately

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.729 
immediately
rinse<00:04:16.940> with<00:04:17.120> water<00:04:17.360> because<00:04:18.110> you<00:04:18.230> don't<00:04:18.440> want

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
rinse with water because you don't want

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.340 
rinse with water because you don't want
any<00:04:19.520> of<00:04:19.790> the<00:04:19.940> alcohol<00:04:20.450> left<00:04:20.690> on<00:04:20.870> there<00:04:21.080> to

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
any of the alcohol left on there to

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.740 
any of the alcohol left on there to
continue<00:04:21.860> to<00:04:21.980> decolorize<00:04:22.600> after<00:04:23.600> we've

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
continue to decolorize after we've

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.900 
continue to decolorize after we've
rinsed<00:04:23.990> for<00:04:24.260> wat<00:04:24.440> with<00:04:24.740> water<00:04:24.980> then<00:04:25.700> we're

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
rinsed for wat with water then we're

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.000 
rinsed for wat with water then we're
going<00:04:26.030> to<00:04:26.060> put<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.480> Safran<00:04:26.990> in<00:04:27.140> on<00:04:27.290> which<00:04:27.800> is

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
going to put the Safran in on which is

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.220 
going to put the Safran in on which is
the<00:04:28.190> counter<00:04:28.610> stain<00:04:28.880> so<00:04:29.630> we<00:04:29.750> have<00:04:29.870> the<00:04:29.990> crystal

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 
the counter stain so we have the crystal

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.040 
the counter stain so we have the crystal
violet<00:04:30.530> was<00:04:30.950> the<00:04:31.070> primary<00:04:31.370> stain<00:04:31.880> we<00:04:32.810> had

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
violet was the primary stain we had

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.020 
violet was the primary stain we had
grams<00:04:33.620> iodine<00:04:34.250> as<00:04:34.520> the<00:04:35.030> mordant<00:04:35.500> we<00:04:36.500> had

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
grams iodine as the mordant we had

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.930 
grams iodine as the mordant we had
either<00:04:38.030> ethyl<00:04:38.720> alcohol<00:04:38.870> or<00:04:39.800> acetone<00:04:40.070> alcohol

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
either ethyl alcohol or acetone alcohol

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.600 
either ethyl alcohol or acetone alcohol
as<00:04:41.150> our<00:04:41.450> decolorizer<00:04:42.080> and<00:04:43.040> then<00:04:43.280> we<00:04:43.430> have

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
as our decolorizer and then we have

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.460 
as our decolorizer and then we have
safranin<00:04:44.630> as<00:04:44.750> our<00:04:45.350> counter<00:04:45.740> stain<00:04:46.010> so<00:04:46.610> if<00:04:46.940> the

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
safranin as our counter stain so if the

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.160 
safranin as our counter stain so if the
bacterial<00:04:48.470> gram<00:04:48.800> negative<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.630> the<00:04:50.630> crystal

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
bacterial gram negative and the crystal

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.700 
bacterial gram negative and the crystal
violet<00:04:51.320> washed<00:04:51.920> off<00:04:52.220> with<00:04:53.050> alcohol<00:04:54.050> then

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
violet washed off with alcohol then

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.890 
violet washed off with alcohol then
they're<00:04:55.220> going<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.430> turn<00:04:55.670> pink<00:04:55.940> okay<00:04:56.600> so<00:04:56.660> we're

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
they're going to turn pink okay so we're

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:58.570 
they're going to turn pink okay so we're
going<00:04:56.990> to<00:04:57.050> put<00:04:57.230> this<00:04:57.380> on<00:04:57.620> this<00:04:58.010> one's<00:04:58.220> clogged

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
going to put this on this one's clogged

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.000 
going to put this on this one's clogged
so<00:04:59.450> we'll<00:04:59.750> pretend<00:05:00.200> it<00:05:00.350> goes<00:05:00.500> on<00:05:00.680> there

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
so we'll pretend it goes on there

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.180 
so we'll pretend it goes on there
so<00:05:01.250> we're<00:05:01.430> staining<00:05:01.760> with<00:05:02.030> crystal<00:05:02.390> violet

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
so we're staining with crystal violet

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.640 
so we're staining with crystal violet
and<00:05:04.190> I'm<00:05:04.790> sorry<00:05:05.240> we're<00:05:06.140> standing<00:05:06.500> with

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
and I'm sorry we're standing with

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.010 
and I'm sorry we're standing with
safranin<00:05:07.310> okay<00:05:08.030> that's<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.420> counter<00:05:08.750> stain

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
safranin okay that's the counter stain

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.410 
safranin okay that's the counter stain
and<00:05:09.290> that's<00:05:09.890> going<00:05:10.160> to<00:05:10.220> sit<00:05:10.430> for<00:05:10.730> about<00:05:10.850> 30

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
and that's going to sit for about 30

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.090 
and that's going to sit for about 30
seconds<00:05:11.900> once<00:05:12.110> again<00:05:12.440> if<00:05:12.560> you<00:05:12.650> go<00:05:12.800> over<00:05:13.070> a

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
seconds once again if you go over a

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.250 
seconds once again if you go over a
little<00:05:13.310> bit<00:05:13.520> it's<00:05:13.700> okay<00:05:14.030> after<00:05:14.360> this

add<00:05:18.650> we're<00:05:19.550> going<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.700> rinse<00:05:19.910> with<00:05:20.000> water<00:05:20.300> one

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:20.900 
add we're going to rinse with water one

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:21.550 
add we're going to rinse with water one
more<00:05:21.080> time

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
more time

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.060

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
our stain off or our bacteria so once

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.900 
our stain off or our bacteria so once
again<00:05:29.090> dry<00:05:29.510> the<00:05:29.570> bottom<00:05:29.960> first<00:05:30.790> fold<00:05:31.790> the

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
again dry the bottom first fold the

again dry the bottom first fold the
paper<00:05:32.120> over<00:05:33.220> gently<00:05:34.220> blot<00:05:34.550> dry<00:05:34.610> and<00:05:35.150> you<00:05:35.240> don't

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.390 
paper over gently blot dry and you don't

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.840 
paper over gently blot dry and you don't
have<00:05:35.510> to<00:05:35.690> dry<00:05:35.870> it<00:05:35.930> completely<00:05:36.140> you<00:05:36.770> know<00:05:37.550> right

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
have to dry it completely you know right

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.030 
have to dry it completely you know right
away<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.390> can<00:05:38.750> let<00:05:39.170> it<00:05:39.320> dry<00:05:39.500> on<00:05:39.590> its<00:05:39.860> own

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
away you can let it dry on its own

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.890 
away you can let it dry on its own
sometimes<00:05:40.550> you<00:05:40.730> can<00:05:40.940> tilt<00:05:41.240> it<00:05:41.360> up<00:05:41.510> like<00:05:41.690> this

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
sometimes you can tilt it up like this

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.350
