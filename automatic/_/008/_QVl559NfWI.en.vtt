only get it for so long and so often but

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.549 
only get it for so long and so often but
when<00:00:48.149> you<00:00:48.360> do<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.719> allows<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> see<00:00:49.379> through

how<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.100> survived<00:01:41.549> that<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:41.880> there<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.570> now

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
how I survived that right there but now

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.149 
how I survived that right there but now
I<00:01:42.720> know<00:01:42.899> there's<00:01:43.170> another<00:01:43.380> guy<00:01:43.590> in<00:01:43.619> that<00:01:43.920> room

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
I know there's another guy in that room

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.160 
I know there's another guy in that room
so<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.430> run<00:01:44.790> out<00:01:44.970> just<00:01:45.509> far<00:01:45.720> enough<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.960> try<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
so I run out just far enough to try and

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.050 
so I run out just far enough to try and
put<00:01:46.290> enough<00:01:46.530> obstacles<00:01:47.490> between<00:01:47.610> us<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
put enough obstacles between us that

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.940 
put enough obstacles between us that
maybe<00:01:48.360> he's<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.810> going<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.049> hit<00:01:49.200> me<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.770> my

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
maybe he's not going to hit me so my

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.249 
maybe he's not going to hit me so my
health<00:01:50.159> can<00:01:50.369> recharge<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.090> also<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:52.110> my

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
health can recharge and also that my

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.340 
health can recharge and also that my
stealth<00:01:52.560> reactivates

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
stealth reactivates

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.340 
stealth reactivates
you<00:01:55.220> guys<00:01:55.369> are<00:01:55.490> new<00:01:55.580> this<00:01:55.790> game<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:56.350> this

you guys are new this game to this
berserkers<00:01:57.950> crazy<00:01:58.310> right<00:01:58.640> here<00:01:58.790> I<00:01:59.540> mean<00:01:59.869> it's

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
berserkers crazy right here I mean it's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.609 
berserkers crazy right here I mean it's
a<00:02:00.110> little<00:02:00.170> nine<00:02:00.890> killstreak<00:02:02.200> called<00:02:03.200> mutate

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
a little nine killstreak called mutate

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.560 
a little nine killstreak called mutate
when<00:02:03.830> your<00:02:03.950> Camaro<00:02:04.400> or<00:02:04.490> combat<00:02:05.060> armor<00:02:05.390> when

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
when your Camaro or combat armor when

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.719 
when your Camaro or combat armor when
your<00:02:05.690> humans<00:02:06.170> and<00:02:06.650> you<00:02:07.070> basically<00:02:07.190> turn<00:02:07.700> into

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
your humans and you basically turn into

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.729 
your humans and you basically turn into
this<00:02:08.060> huge<00:02:08.690> armored<00:02:09.410> guy<00:02:09.619> or<00:02:10.039> giant<00:02:10.759> hulking

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
this huge armored guy or giant hulking

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.370 
this huge armored guy or giant hulking
Giants<00:02:12.739> of<00:02:12.860> a<00:02:12.980> chimera<00:02:13.660> giant<00:02:14.660> hulking<00:02:14.810> giant

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
Giants of a chimera giant hulking giant

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.479 
Giants of a chimera giant hulking giant
I<00:02:15.410> guess<00:02:15.560> that's<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.770> little<00:02:15.950> redundant<00:02:16.160> but

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
I guess that's a little redundant but

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.150 
I guess that's a little redundant but
you<00:02:16.790> get<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.000> point<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:18.380> have<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.620> grenade

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
you get the point and you have a grenade

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.790 
you get the point and you have a grenade
launcher<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.940> as<00:02:20.150> infinite<00:02:20.630> ammo<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.170> can't

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
launcher that as infinite ammo and can't

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.800 
launcher that as infinite ammo and can't
hurt<00:02:22.100> you<00:02:22.310> if<00:02:22.520> you<00:02:22.610> shoot<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.300> ground<00:02:23.540> near

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
hurt you if you shoot the ground near

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.949 
hurt you if you shoot the ground near
yourself<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.800> you<00:02:24.860> pretty<00:02:25.130> much<00:02:25.810> pretty<00:02:26.810> much

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
yourself so you pretty much pretty much

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.240 
yourself so you pretty much pretty much
should<00:02:27.200> be<00:02:27.230> able<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.530> stay<00:02:27.680> alive<00:02:27.860> in<00:02:28.100> those

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
should be able to stay alive in those

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.970 
should be able to stay alive in those
circumstances<00:02:28.580> as<00:02:29.060> long<00:02:29.239> as<00:02:29.510> you're<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.890> know

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
circumstances as long as you're you know

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.590 
circumstances as long as you're you know
have<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.220> good<00:02:33.010> situational<00:02:34.010> awareness<00:02:34.130> about

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
have a good situational awareness about

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.449 
have a good situational awareness about
where<00:02:35.600> enemies<00:02:35.870> are<00:02:36.260> we're<00:02:36.560> coming<00:02:37.010> from<00:02:37.250> how

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
where enemies are we're coming from how

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.979 
where enemies are we're coming from how
low<00:02:37.640> your<00:02:37.819> health<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.209> you<00:02:38.420> should<00:02:38.569> be<00:02:38.720> fine

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
low your health is you should be fine

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.290 
low your health is you should be fine
now<00:02:39.890> right<00:02:40.370> here<00:02:40.640> I<00:02:40.700> know<00:02:40.819> there's<00:02:41.090> a<00:02:41.150> guy

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
now right here I know there's a guy

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.550 
now right here I know there's a guy
above<00:02:41.569> me<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.959> kind<00:02:42.140> of<00:02:42.200> wait<00:02:42.319> him<00:02:42.440> out<00:02:42.500> a

above me so I kind of wait him out a

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.559 
above me so I kind of wait him out a

him you know at a certain point I was

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:48.580 
him you know at a certain point I was
like<00:02:47.269> I'm<00:02:47.420> not<00:02:47.569> winning<00:02:47.720> this<00:02:47.870> gunfight<00:02:48.200> let

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
like I'm not winning this gunfight let

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.470 
like I'm not winning this gunfight let
me<00:02:48.680> fire<00:02:48.890> off<00:02:49.130> my<00:02:49.280> secondary<00:02:49.790> which<00:02:50.120> on<00:02:50.420> a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
me fire off my secondary which on a

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.100 
me fire off my secondary which on a
level<00:02:50.930> three<00:02:51.290> carbine<00:02:51.709> is<00:02:51.880> 3<00:02:52.880> 40<00:02:53.750> mils<00:02:53.959> which

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
level three carbine is 3 40 mils which

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.890 
level three carbine is 3 40 mils which
even<00:02:55.040> those<00:02:55.250> 3<00:02:55.489> 40<00:02:55.790> mils<00:02:55.940> will<00:02:56.150> not<00:02:56.330> kill<00:02:56.690> a

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
even those 3 40 mils will not kill a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.590 
even those 3 40 mils will not kill a
person<00:02:57.170> even<00:02:57.680> with<00:02:57.799> like<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:57.950> direct<00:02:58.310> hit<00:02:58.600> you

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
person even with like a direct hit you

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.449 
person even with like a direct hit you
pretty<00:02:59.720> much<00:02:59.900> have<00:03:00.110> to<00:03:00.170> win<00:03:00.410> someone<00:03:00.829> and<00:03:01.250> then

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
pretty much have to win someone and then

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.449 
pretty much have to win someone and then
it's<00:03:01.579> good<00:03:01.790> for<00:03:01.970> finishing<00:03:02.269> them<00:03:02.510> off<00:03:03.459> when

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
it's good for finishing them off when

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.319 
it's good for finishing them off when
it's<00:03:04.579> level<00:03:05.510> 1<00:03:05.660> carbine<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:07.040> only<00:03:07.190> have<00:03:07.640> 140

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
it's level 1 carbine you only have 140

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.210 
it's level 1 carbine you only have 140
it<00:03:08.540> doesn't<00:03:08.870> split<00:03:09.140> off<00:03:09.290> into<00:03:09.470> a<00:03:09.560> triple<00:03:09.829> spray

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
it doesn't split off into a triple spray

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.840 
it doesn't split off into a triple spray
and<00:03:10.519> that<00:03:11.090> is<00:03:11.329> I<00:03:12.130> don't<00:03:13.130> even<00:03:13.370> really<00:03:13.579> fire

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
and that is I don't even really fire

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.520 
and that is I don't even really fire
that<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:14.239> much<00:03:14.390> it's<00:03:14.600> not<00:03:14.750> very<00:03:14.900> useful<00:03:15.170> at

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
that that much it's not very useful at

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.530 
that that much it's not very useful at
all<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.310> can<00:03:16.459> do<00:03:16.549> a<00:03:16.579> little<00:03:16.730> damage<00:03:17.000> to<00:03:17.180> people

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
all you can do a little damage to people

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.569 
all you can do a little damage to people
but<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.380> time<00:03:18.680> that<00:03:18.709> it<00:03:18.920> takes<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.280> get<00:03:19.459> your

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
but the time that it takes to get your

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.220 
but the time that it takes to get your
shooting<00:03:19.970> back<00:03:20.120> is<00:03:20.329> usually<00:03:20.630> not<00:03:20.780> worth<00:03:21.019> it

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
shooting back is usually not worth it

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.140 
shooting back is usually not worth it
it's<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.560> last-ditch<00:03:21.950> effort<00:03:22.670> for<00:03:22.820> me<00:03:22.910> usually

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
it's a last-ditch effort for me usually

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.180 
it's a last-ditch effort for me usually
if<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.540> run<00:03:23.720> out<00:03:23.750> of<00:03:23.870> ammo<00:03:24.109> but<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:24.950> being<00:03:25.100> said

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
I'm you know I'm leveled up i have my

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.110 
I'm you know I'm leveled up i have my
level<00:03:28.280> 3<00:03:28.310> i<00:03:28.519> don't<00:03:28.670> really<00:03:28.790> have<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.090> worry

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
level 3 i don't really have to worry

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.819 
level 3 i don't really have to worry
about<00:03:29.329> that<00:03:29.480> one<00:03:30.200> great<00:03:30.410> thing<00:03:30.440> about<00:03:30.650> the

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:30.829 
about that one great thing about the

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:35.319 
about that one great thing about the
carbine<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.400> is<00:03:31.670> the<00:03:31.880> carbine<00:03:33.489> has<00:03:34.489> you<00:03:35.209> know

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
carbine to is the carbine has you know

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:36.940 
carbine to is the carbine has you know
really<00:03:35.570> strong<00:03:35.900> melee<00:03:36.290> when<00:03:36.470> you<00:03:36.560> leveled<00:03:36.890> up

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
really strong melee when you leveled up

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.210 
really strong melee when you leveled up
the<00:03:37.100> second<00:03:37.549> level<00:03:38.420> i<00:03:38.750> think<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.410> normally

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
the second level i think it normally

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.650 
the second level i think it normally
does<00:03:40.400> fifty<00:03:40.940> percent<00:03:41.239> with<00:03:41.420> the<00:03:41.510> bayonet

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
does fifty percent with the bayonet

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.539 
does fifty percent with the bayonet
fifty<00:03:42.200> percent<00:03:42.440> health<00:03:42.680> and<00:03:42.890> then<00:03:43.310> when<00:03:43.459> you

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
fifty percent health and then when you

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.180 
fifty percent health and then when you
level<00:03:43.910> it<00:03:43.970> up<00:03:44.120> to<00:03:44.299> level<00:03:44.690> two<00:03:45.019> it<00:03:45.980> does

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
level it up to level two it does

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.340 
level it up to level two it does
seventy-five<00:03:46.760> percent<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.390> that<00:03:47.840> melee<00:03:48.049> can

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
seventy-five percent so that melee can

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.770 
seventy-five percent so that melee can
make<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:49.070> difference<00:03:49.100> a<00:03:49.609> lot<00:03:49.880> i<00:03:49.910> mean<00:03:50.180> any

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
make the difference a lot i mean any

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:52.630 
make the difference a lot i mean any
carbine<00:03:51.230> users<00:03:51.560> should<00:03:51.769> be<00:03:51.920> mailing<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.459> lot

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
carbine users should be mailing a lot

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.479 
carbine users should be mailing a lot

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
is a headshot machine okay so you

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.490 
is a headshot machine okay so you
definitely<00:04:16.880> want<00:04:17.150> to<00:04:17.570> take<00:04:18.020> advantage<00:04:18.260> of

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
definitely want to take advantage of

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.130 
definitely want to take advantage of
that<00:04:18.650> because<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.940> can<00:04:20.090> destroy<00:04:20.510> people<00:04:20.959> by

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:21.140 
that because you can destroy people by

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.390 
that because you can destroy people by
going<00:04:21.470> for<00:04:21.650> head<00:04:21.739> shots<00:04:21.770> with<00:04:22.130> the<00:04:22.190> carbon

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
going for head shots with the carbon

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.010 
going for head shots with the carbon
same<00:04:22.610> with<00:04:22.730> the<00:04:22.790> bullseye<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.390> carbon

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
same with the bullseye the carbon

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.490 
same with the bullseye the carbon
actually<00:04:24.380> kills<00:04:24.590> quicker<00:04:25.010> than<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:26.500> bullseye

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
actually kills quicker than the bullseye

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.820 
actually kills quicker than the bullseye
so<00:04:28.010> if<00:04:28.790> you're<00:04:29.030> accurate<00:04:29.530> that's<00:04:30.530> why<00:04:30.710> I<00:04:30.740> like

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
to use it range but it definitely is a

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.360
