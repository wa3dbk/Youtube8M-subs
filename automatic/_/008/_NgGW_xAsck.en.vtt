00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.910 
cars have this everybody's car has a
serpentine<00:02:18.000> belt<00:02:18.269> or<00:02:18.450> one<00:02:18.660> belt<00:02:18.930> we<00:02:19.590> used<00:02:19.830> to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
serpentine belt or one belt we used to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.440 
serpentine belt or one belt we used to
have<00:02:20.010> two<00:02:20.340> or<00:02:20.460> three<00:02:20.490> belts<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:20.970> run<00:02:21.120> our<00:02:21.240> cars

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
have two or three belts you run our cars

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.870 
have two or three belts you run our cars
but<00:02:21.630> now<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:21.870> just<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.110> one<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.700> this<00:02:23.700> is

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
but now we just have one and this is

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.950 
but now we just have one and this is
tension<00:02:24.240> are<00:02:24.360> down<00:02:24.480> here

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
tension are down here

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.470 
tension are down here
you<00:02:25.050> can<00:02:25.200> see<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.850> that's<00:02:26.850> what<00:02:27.090> keeps<00:02:27.270> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
you can see it that's what keeps the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.530 
you can see it that's what keeps the
tension<00:02:27.870> on<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.890> belt<00:02:29.240> now<00:02:30.240> one<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
tension on the belt now one of the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.880 
tension on the belt now one of the
things<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.780> have<00:02:30.960> to<00:02:31.080> do<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.650> have<00:02:31.680> to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
things you have to do is you have to

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.300 
things you have to do is you have to
loosen<00:02:32.070> that<00:02:32.370> tensioner<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:34.380> be<00:02:34.500> able<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.890> get

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
loosen that tensioner to be able to get

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.210 
loosen that tensioner to be able to get
the<00:02:35.520> belt<00:02:35.910> off<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.230> alternator<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.980> use

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the belt off the alternator and you use

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.560 
the belt off the alternator and you use
a<00:02:38.570> what's<00:02:39.570> called<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.930> serpentine<00:02:40.560> belt<00:02:40.860> tool

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
a what's called a serpentine belt tool

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.620 
a what's called a serpentine belt tool
this<00:02:42.570> tool<00:02:42.630> as<00:02:43.200> you<00:02:43.950> can<00:02:44.100> see<00:02:44.340> as<00:02:44.630> all

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
this tool as you can see as all

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.980 
this tool as you can see as all
different<00:02:46.230> ways<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.710> turning<00:02:47.580> that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
different ways of turning that

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.900 
different ways of turning that
serpentine<00:02:48.990> that<00:02:49.460> tensioner<00:02:50.460> and<00:02:50.580> I'll<00:02:50.760> show

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
serpentine that tensioner and I'll show

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.000 
serpentine that tensioner and I'll show
you<00:02:50.940> how<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.150> goes<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.500> first<00:02:52.620> thing<00:02:52.770> we

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
you how that goes so the first thing we

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.550 
you how that goes so the first thing we
do<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.190> we<00:02:53.580> take<00:02:53.760> part<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.210> the<00:02:54.560> serpentine

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
do is we take part of the serpentine

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.170 
do is we take part of the serpentine
belt<00:02:55.800> tool<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.400> put<00:02:56.610> it<00:02:56.640> into<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.000> little

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
belt tool and we put it into the little

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.540 
belt tool and we put it into the little
hole<00:02:57.390> that's<00:02:58.290> on<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.740> tensioner<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.190> again

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
hole that's on the tensioner and again

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.160 
hole that's on the tensioner and again
the<00:02:59.700> tensioner<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.150> what<00:03:00.330> causes<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.900> belt<00:03:01.110> to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
the tensioner is what causes the belt to

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.890 
the tensioner is what causes the belt to
have<00:03:01.350> tension<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.830> hold<00:03:02.010> it<00:03:02.130> into<00:03:02.250> place<00:03:02.900> but

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
have tension to hold it into place but

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:04.850 
have tension to hold it into place but
it<00:03:03.960> into<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.170> little<00:03:04.350> hole<00:03:04.500> is<00:03:04.680> built

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
it into the little hole is built

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.980 
it into the little hole is built
specifically<00:03:05.340> for<00:03:05.430> the<00:03:05.700> tool<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.120> then<00:03:06.870> we

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
specifically for the tool and then we

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.410 
specifically for the tool and then we
take<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.290> second<00:03:07.650> piece<00:03:07.830> and<00:03:08.160> put<00:03:08.940> it<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:10.220> the

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
take the second piece and put it in the

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.140 
take the second piece and put it in the
top<00:03:12.420> tool<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:14.130> can<00:03:14.310> see<00:03:14.490> now<00:03:14.610> I<00:03:14.640> have<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:14.940> nice

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
top tool you can see now I have a nice

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.020 
top tool you can see now I have a nice
little<00:03:15.180> breaker<00:03:15.780> arm<00:03:16.020> now<00:03:16.710> what<00:03:17.490> we<00:03:17.580> do<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.760> we

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
little breaker arm now what we do is we

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.170 
little breaker arm now what we do is we
pull<00:03:18.240> back<00:03:18.560> releasing<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.590> pressure<00:03:19.850> as<00:03:20.850> you

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
pull back releasing the pressure as you

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.670 
pull back releasing the pressure as you
can<00:03:21.450> see<00:03:23.120> when<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.240> release<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.750> pressure<00:03:24.960> we

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
can see when we release the pressure we

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.810 
can see when we release the pressure we
can<00:03:25.710> now<00:03:25.980> pull<00:03:26.190> the<00:03:26.220> belt<00:03:26.490> off<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:29.150> and<00:03:31.820> that's

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
can now pull the belt off the and that's

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.690 
can now pull the belt off the and that's
it<00:03:33.210> now<00:03:34.200> we<00:03:34.260> can<00:03:34.560> move<00:03:34.680> on<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:35.100> removing<00:03:35.610> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
it now we can move on to removing the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.500 
it now we can move on to removing the
alternator<00:03:36.260> so<00:03:37.260> on<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.370> Mustang<00:03:38.550> it's

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
alternator so on the Mustang it's

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.390 
alternator so on the Mustang it's
different<00:03:39.750> than<00:03:39.990> most<00:03:40.170> there's<00:03:41.010> actually<00:03:41.370> a

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
different than most there's actually a

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.190 
different than most there's actually a
bracket<00:03:41.880> that<00:03:41.910> holds<00:03:42.060> on<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.630> alternator

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
bracket that holds on to the alternator

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.560 
bracket that holds on to the alternator
and<00:03:43.680> this<00:03:43.920> bracket<00:03:44.430> has<00:03:44.760> held<00:03:45.060> on<00:03:45.210> right<00:03:45.420> here

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
and this bracket has held on right here

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:46.730 
and this bracket has held on right here
there's<00:03:45.780> one<00:03:45.840> exactly<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:46.350> this<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.710> the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
there's one exactly like this on the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.710 
there's one exactly like this on the
other<00:03:46.830> side<00:03:47.160> well<00:03:47.910> remove<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.300> bolt<00:03:48.510> which

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
other side well remove this bolt which

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.620 
other side well remove this bolt which
you've<00:03:48.870> already<00:03:48.960> done<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:50.060> that<00:03:51.060> should<00:03:51.300> free

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
you've already done and that should free

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.870 
you've already done and that should free
up<00:03:51.720> the<00:03:52.020> top<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.380> the<00:03:52.470> alternate<00:03:52.860> as<00:03:53.430> we<00:03:53.670> see

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
up the top of the alternate as we see

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.920 
up the top of the alternate as we see
here<00:03:54.980> now<00:03:55.980> what<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:56.910> need<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.090> do<00:03:57.300> is<00:03:57.600> look

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
here now what I need to do is look

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.370 
here now what I need to do is look
release<00:03:58.650> these<00:03:58.950> two<00:03:59.220> and<00:04:00.170> once<00:04:01.170> those<00:04:01.320> are

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
release these two and once those are

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:15.330 
release these two and once those are
released<00:04:04.430> the<00:04:05.430> alternator<00:04:05.820> should<00:04:06.710> slide<00:04:07.710> out

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.360 

now<00:04:16.340> this<00:04:16.549> boat<00:04:16.820> is<00:04:17.150> really<00:04:17.959> on<00:04:18.109> there<00:04:18.350> so<00:04:19.220> what

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
now this boat is really on there so what

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.490 
now this boat is really on there so what
I've<00:04:19.549> done<00:04:19.579> is<00:04:20.030> I've<00:04:20.750> linked<00:04:21.109> two<00:04:21.259> wrenches

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
I've done is I've linked two wrenches

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.159 
I've done is I've linked two wrenches
together<00:04:22.039> which<00:04:22.820> gives<00:04:23.120> me<00:04:23.270> a<00:04:23.300> nice<00:04:23.840> hard

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
together which gives me a nice hard

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.870 
together which gives me a nice hard
lever<00:04:27.169> be<00:04:28.070> able<00:04:28.220> to<00:04:28.280> get<00:04:28.400> that<00:04:28.490> off<00:04:28.669> there

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
lever be able to get that off there

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.909 
lever be able to get that off there
which<00:04:29.479> will<00:04:29.720> break<00:04:29.960> the<00:04:30.110> bolt<00:04:30.320> quite<00:04:30.530> honestly

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
which will break the bolt quite honestly

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.740 
which will break the bolt quite honestly
quite<00:04:31.160> easily<00:04:31.370> and<00:04:31.729> it<00:04:32.360> gives<00:04:32.509> me<00:04:32.630> a<00:04:32.660> little

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
quite easily and it gives me a little

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.360 
quite easily and it gives me a little
bit<00:04:32.900> more<00:04:33.110> room<00:04:33.889> to<00:04:34.100> do<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.800> now<00:04:36.979> that<00:04:37.009> the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
bit more room to do it so now that the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.820 
bit more room to do it so now that the
bolts<00:04:37.669> are<00:04:37.789> off<00:04:39.009> the<00:04:41.110> this<00:04:42.110> is<00:04:42.289> still<00:04:42.470> attached

to<00:04:43.130> a<00:04:43.160> one<00:04:43.610> of<00:04:43.699> my<00:04:43.820> wires<00:04:44.060> which<00:04:44.419> we're<00:04:44.630> going

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
to a one of my wires which we're going

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.350 
to a one of my wires which we're going
to<00:04:44.840> leave<00:04:44.960> in<00:04:45.139> here<00:04:45.440> but<00:04:46.009> you<00:04:46.099> notice<00:04:46.430> this<00:04:47.180> is

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.620 
to leave in here but you notice this is
nice<00:04:47.509> and<00:04:47.690> floating<00:04:48.080> now<00:04:49.030> which<00:04:50.030> we<00:04:50.210> shall<00:04:50.449> be

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
able to pick take out as i see it comes

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:07.360 
able to pick take out as i see it comes
out<00:04:59.720> quite<00:05:00.050> easily<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.820> now<00:05:05.919> we<00:05:06.919> remove<00:05:07.250> the

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
out quite easily and now we remove the

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.409 
out quite easily and now we remove the
plug<00:05:07.610> from<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.599> back<00:05:08.810> that<00:05:09.470> actually<00:05:09.860> sends

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:10.419 
plug from the back that actually sends

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:27.300 
plug from the back that actually sends
the<00:05:11.419> electricity<00:05:12.139> to<00:05:15.190> the<00:05:16.190> system<00:05:18.760> right<00:05:19.760> here

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.839
