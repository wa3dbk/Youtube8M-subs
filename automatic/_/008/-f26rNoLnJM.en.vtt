00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.210
 hello i'm tatyana scold and now i'm 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.220
 I'll show you another option 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.820
 lining if you paid 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.710
 chiffon thin lung and you 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.640
 deliberately handle the neck roller 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.210
 let's say you do 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.930
 baseline by its own standards and 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.080
 any style you will then model 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:41.690
 after making the base pattern 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:45.120
 basics but you will have a clone therefore 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.339
 lining will be cut on the base 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:56.070
 basis but we need to be sure at the beginning 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:59.879
 cut the cut what we have here so 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.720
 on this basic base we have a cut 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:08.640
 shoulder tuck we remove the neckline 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:13.049
 wider and bigger lower and exactly the same 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:19.469
 you do on the shelf here you have 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:22.950
 there will be such a cut-out all on basic 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:27.240
 you draw a cutout if necessary 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:31.829
 you and armhole ochku cut out if you 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:36.869
 will be paid without a sleeve like this up 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.960
 climbed over the shoulder seam and now 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.009
 after you have decided on 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.070

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:50.729
 with cut and with cork you cut 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:55.829
 lining is already a new constructive 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:58.200
 lines lining cut clearly under 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.130

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:09.499
 product to you everything was as it should 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.499

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:18.590
