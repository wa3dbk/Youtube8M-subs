00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.030
 the value is very similar is the open potato 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:19.860
 It's mine, it 's mine, it's cool that the grid 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.810
 bringing you to another video of 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.669
 call of duty this time the modern series 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.470
 modern faith 2 sec 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.380
 and I really like this series is 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.259
 precisely why we have a goal 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.579
 But you know I like it a lot. 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:38.160
 Nubian 12 because we have a pa 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.260
 series of zombies however I think 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.330
 when you break coming in last 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.760
 prestige of these two games that I quoted 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.910
 before you lose a little there your 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.190
 logical goal is that you will play a 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.290
 little more and multiplayer but goes 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.060
 reach a certain point is that you will 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.980
 get seasick because you no longer have 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.489
 No more animals have already conquered all 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.770
 your prestige then we no longer have 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.949
 no purpose, but I think that in the 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.979
 modern series is a bit different from the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.200
 12 by the fact that you yourself arriving 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.840
 in the last collective and you will have 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.539
 those objectives and of conquering 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.170
 conquer in a look what it extracts and 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:21.749
 even the abc in the modern three then 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.450
 recipe motivates me a lot to play these 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:26.880
 old games including in the series both 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.670
 of the modern series unfortunately on a model 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.459
 unique code 41 and we do not have 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.259
 no kind of goal like who 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.319
 Is something like this here? 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.209
 but it is one of the best games there that 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.549
 my opinion and then these days I 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.679
 was playing and the modern 2 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.740
 unfortunately in my class I did not have 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.630
 released everything on her was still not take 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.289
 very low then the only thing I 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:56.990
 was and if I am not mistaken was the 

00:01:52.289 --> 00:02:00.990
 my strike will be the wave I think 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:05.310
 stone missile and also the fish jumped 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.060
 I was released in my class 1 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.530
 thousand 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.620
 usually puts it there the pelot does not take the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.030
 I put one 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:18.040
 the funk defendants I put fei long and I 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.830
 I also put the nucleus if I had 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.799
 in that game and with that sequence 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.290
 int streets I had my look 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.629
 at this stage but as I said with level 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.920
 Very low, I just do not ask you guys. 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:32.950
 You'll see that I 'm just going to die. 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:36.640
 a neighbor at the end after having killed already 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.459
 25 rambo my edge but could have 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.409
 done an award should leave but only that I 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.019
 end up dying at the end 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.709
 but if I were again with my 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.930
 look I would be turkey or the final phase and 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.260
 that the profit is this is the game of my 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.319
 class mt was the slide rennes was the 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.930
 fuse power station is usually this 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.879
 that exclude in the modern 2 and I like 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.209
 to pass on to you is as follows 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:07.840
 I ended up getting lighter beyond the Fed 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.540
 in this game and what I do the following 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.480
 1 ends up pulling a lot at the beginning but 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.950
 if you have a little strike 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.200
 Higher logic you will not get 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.169
 running crazy for you lose your 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.630
 nook its moab otão its who draws a 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.669
 goal if I'm not also denying the 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:28.540
 that you really do not have a 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:30.430
 moment of defense in the game but these 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.160
 old games that we have with 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.310
 sure people having a certain defense 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:39.459
 at a certain time and to prevent 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.269
 or even for another to attack the 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.090
 enemies 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.250
 so this helps a lot the three of 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:48.250
 to pass on to you the following also this 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:52.629
 week and the others until sick on day 9 and 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.660
 on trails this is the 19th I have the proof 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.549
 on day 6 another test on day 14 and another 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.040
 Proof of the 19th 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.949
 so most likely I'll be there 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.980
 a little guilty ok debut will be 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:08.990
 bringing the videos there more formally 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.020
 regular and how we have brought and 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.570
 days but it will probably be a 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.090
 neighbor or more clubs I'm going to play 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.470
 a little more the terrain than the 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.700
 dtvm videos 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:26.210
 although I like it a lot more place 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:29.180
 to a domain but unfortunately domenech and 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.190
 the crisis ends up taking a little more 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.290
 even time to produce the video 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.160
 because they end up staying in about 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.920
 10 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.620
 8 to 10 minutes sometimes even longer 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.050
 depending on the miner but the themes and 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.440
 He lasted a little less then I'll try. 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.260
 bring more to you even because the 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:51.050
 old games get very difficult to 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:54.200
 get a name nation in games 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.340
 old people if we see rooms and 15,000 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.960
 of 9,000 playing tm and sometimes 500 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.150
 thousand people 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.300
 Playing dominei chu and it ends. 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.800
 making it difficult to connect 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.460
 messing up a little on the connection 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.460
 This map is fucking great because the crew 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.530
 ends up staying a little this is backed off a 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.350
 Campeando little because it has quite a 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.210
 open field and woods is enough and then 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.700
 It's a little hard to see 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.350
 good this game is going to be around you 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.990
 They'll see I'm going to die, I think. 

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.690
 I'm going to kill another one and go soon. 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.430
 with goiás behind but the matches 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.110
 getting around the escort and stayed in the 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.210
 At the end, I really hope that you 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.860
 have enjoyed this from there if you 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.750
 is not subscribed to the channel, sign up for 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.790
 favorite teen channel to help 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.820
 following calculation was firmly 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.360
 next video does 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.360
 See you
