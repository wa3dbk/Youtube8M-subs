pretty<00:00:15.330> much<00:00:15.450> all<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.719> is<00:00:15.809> it's<00:00:16.020> an<00:00:16.320> LED<00:00:16.470> which

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
pretty much all it is it's an LED which

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.040 
pretty much all it is it's an LED which
flashes<00:00:17.910> when<00:00:18.029> I<00:00:18.119> hit<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.390> accelerator<00:00:18.660> on<00:00:18.930> my

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
though heat Bonnie dress-up kit what I

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.080 
though heat Bonnie dress-up kit what I
did<00:00:25.289> was<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:25.769> drilled<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.250> hole<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.609> inside

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
did was I drilled a hole and inside

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.950 
did was I drilled a hole and inside
there<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.599> LED<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.380> video<00:00:28.619> ID<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.750> this<00:00:30.750> goes

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
there is a LED or video ID and this goes

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.569 
there is a LED or video ID and this goes
into<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.500> for<00:00:31.619> your<00:00:31.740> racing<00:00:31.949> light<00:00:32.130> kit<00:00:32.340> and

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
into it for your racing light kit and

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.190 
into it for your racing light kit and
pretty<00:00:33.059> much<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.300> do<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.630> want<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.870> plug<00:00:34.050> that

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
pretty much we do you want to plug that

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.930 
pretty much we do you want to plug that
into<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> UM<00:00:35.329> sock<00:00:36.329> plug<00:00:37.079> where<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.710> only<00:00:38.040> flat

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
into the UM sock plug where it only flat

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.799 
into the UM sock plug where it only flat
up<00:00:39.149> turns<00:00:40.110> on<00:00:40.350> when<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.680> hit<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.010> accelerator

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
up turns on when you hit the accelerator

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:48.200 
up turns on when you hit the accelerator
what<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.840> did<00:00:43.079> was<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> circuses<00:00:46.850> okay<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:47.910> see

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
what I did was so circuses okay so see

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.270 
what I did was so circuses okay so see
um<00:00:48.950> that<00:00:49.950> little<00:00:50.510> rubbery<00:00:51.510> thing<00:00:52.280> actually

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
um that little rubbery thing actually

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.090 
um that little rubbery thing actually
took<00:00:53.640> an<00:00:54.059> iron<00:00:54.300> cut<00:00:54.719> in<00:00:54.840> half<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.230> put<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.980> here

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
took an iron cut in half and put it here

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:07.010 
took an iron cut in half and put it here
so<00:00:56.480> it's<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:58.170> exhausts<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.129> luffa<00:00:59.640> tab

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.310 

you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.070> see<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.700> off<00:01:08.909> top<00:01:09.210> things<00:01:10.170> off

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
you can see it's off top things off

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.530 
you can see it's off top things off
they're<00:01:12.229> just<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:13.290> hot<00:01:13.470> glue<00:01:13.680> nothing<00:01:14.130> big

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
they're just so hot glue nothing big

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.510 
they're just so hot glue nothing big
it<00:01:15.810> was<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.229> Tamia<00:01:17.000> LED<00:01:18.530> you<00:01:19.530> know<00:01:19.649> -<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.280> was<00:01:20.369> too

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it was a Tamia LED you know - it was too

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.800 
it was a Tamia LED you know - it was too
early<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.820> start<00:01:20.880> off<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.539> then<00:01:21.570> one<00:01:21.750> of

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
early to start off with and then one of

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.440 
early to start off with and then one of
them<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.049> started<00:01:22.320> losing<00:01:23.000> its<00:01:24.000> connection

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
them just started losing its connection

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.820 
them just started losing its connection
I<00:01:24.539> think<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.840> solving<00:01:25.110> was<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.439> bad<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:25.799> I

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
I think it's solving was really bad so I

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.469 
I think it's solving was really bad so I
redid<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.399> was<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.759> one<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.270> was<00:01:27.330> like

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
redid it and was this one and I was like

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.700 
redid it and was this one and I was like
I<00:01:27.689> want<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.110> make<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.350> fall<00:01:28.500> right

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
I want to make it fall right

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:36.109 
I want to make it fall right
so<00:01:28.920> I'm<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.460> know<00:01:29.610> that's<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.000> did<00:01:34.759> um<00:01:35.759> and

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
so I'm you know that's what I did um and

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.940 
so I'm you know that's what I did um and
if<00:01:36.210> anyone<00:01:36.509> knows<00:01:36.750> where<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.020> can<00:01:37.140> pop<00:01:37.470> sound

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
on comment or let me know it's a pretty

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.109 
on comment or let me know it's a pretty
nice<00:02:07.780> forearm<00:02:08.580> pretty<00:02:09.580> much<00:02:09.700> because<00:02:09.940> was

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
nice forearm pretty much because was

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.190 
nice forearm pretty much because was
angled<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.450> managed<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.750> get<00:02:10.840> it<00:02:10.929> scratched

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
angled I managed to get it scratched

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.729 
angled I managed to get it scratched
when<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.680> was<00:02:11.770> floating<00:02:12.160> on<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.430> ground

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
when I was floating on the ground

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.870 
when I was floating on the ground
yeah<00:02:14.739> it's<00:02:14.980> nothing<00:02:15.069> bad

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
yeah it's nothing bad

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.330 
yeah it's nothing bad
I<00:02:15.940> actually<00:02:16.630> thought<00:02:17.110> those<00:02:17.290> in<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.590> second<00:02:17.980> I

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
I actually thought those in a second I

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.990 
I actually thought those in a second I
should<00:02:18.790> get<00:02:18.940> another<00:02:19.060> some<00:02:20.310> exhaust<00:02:21.310> so<00:02:21.819> I<00:02:21.850> can

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
should get another some exhaust so I can

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.390 
should get another some exhaust so I can
put<00:02:22.090> on<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.270> other<00:02:22.330> side<00:02:22.600> make<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:22.989> duel<00:02:23.400> where

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
put on the other side make it duel where

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.890 
put on the other side make it duel where
that<00:02:24.550> requires<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.150> tad<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.450> cutting<00:02:25.660> into<00:02:25.810> the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
that requires a tad of cutting into the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.320 
that requires a tad of cutting into the
body<00:02:26.080> which<00:02:26.260> doesn't<00:02:26.920> really<00:02:27.040> mind<00:02:27.220> but<00:02:27.519> if

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
body which doesn't really mind but if

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.850 
body which doesn't really mind but if
you're<00:02:28.570> okay<00:02:28.840> with<00:02:28.930> that<00:02:28.989> stuff<00:02:29.320> go<00:02:29.680> ahead

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
you're okay with that stuff go ahead

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.739 
you're okay with that stuff go ahead
don't<00:02:29.980> why<00:02:30.130> not<00:02:31.200> thanks<00:02:32.200> all<00:02:32.380> right<00:02:32.440> boy
