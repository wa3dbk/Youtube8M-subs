00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
short term memory loss so if I say I

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.639 
short term memory loss so if I say I
opened<00:01:48.000> three<00:01:48.180> bucks<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.630> opened<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.290> open

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
uh I guess again no one do shares some

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.490 
uh I guess again no one do shares some
is<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.880> Finland<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.719> only<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.079> does<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.439> he

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
is a Finland as only it does that he
