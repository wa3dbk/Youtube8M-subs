00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 well jeffrey sarpong that was nice 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.620
 its immediate action you sure yes if you 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.200
 write me wind is now very good 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.740
 good because I am very sharp aggressive 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.719
 had final floor game coming and the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.920
 kansas market and therefore nice to finish 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.930
 to make 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.460
 the weakness of giggles is the defense 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.769
 that have you draw lead clip coverage 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.740
 today yes i walk through the city of 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.720
 actually beforehand and yes they knew it high 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.150
 put pressure that it is such difficulties 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.180
 would have allowed you to get the ball quickly 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.399
 came up with a quick counter 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.600
 and that works well today 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.430
 max and played a lot of pressure 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 so aggressive as I should think with 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.399
 especially at home 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.930
 that already resulted in a 4 0 lead 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.250
 at rest yes then that match is in 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.110
 actually played too 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.140
 yes exactly I think that is the last one 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.320
 it do well also the entire class 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.559
 home and az home of days again I think 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.719
 that it is that dream line to put 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.670
 max court there properly you make it too 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.309
 one today who 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.440
 turn on think of that man special 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.150
 yes we thought 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.810
 bass only became a father where the 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.130
 gods and secretly most beautiful goal market 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.690
 today only a child yes you play 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.310
 great at nac this season 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.950
 life looks like the woman according to me 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.770
 preference sapori you can't complain 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.430
 nice not but yes it goes well 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.770
 call the art holding it and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.180
 and by continuing this victory 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.980
 van nac was also a very useful heroin 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.540
 nac needed cross your fingers party 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.440
 because I have a little more solid emotion 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.680
 to nest 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.020
 yes that's right i think i 'll get you back 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.860
 from that it was making dark show 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.130
 extra driven value and knew today 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.320
 so that was so important this will be 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.880
 points you hinder you say it all it 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.680
 against utrecht was in a lesser game 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.660
 from ar yes that feeling I think that 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.340
 corrected again , yes certainly 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.550
 important for you 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.560
 absolutely absolutely i think if it were you 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.540
 match loses how it's always like this 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.390
 straighten me up 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.780
 and you can see i could see it 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.340
 all driven value and deserve 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.750
 just have it 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.040
 after the break I say that makes 5 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.660
 man in the back delivery drax van 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.370

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.840
 in the rest vain of hey boys must 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.760
 just keep divorcing 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.850
 and give nothing away 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.280

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.150
