00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
that gives me that x-factor but equally

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:35.810 
that gives me that x-factor but equally
something<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.370> can<00:00:35.460> get<00:00:35.550> me<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.730> trouble

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
something that can get me in trouble

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:43.979 
yet was it one ranking on what was the

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.820 
yet was it one ranking on what was the
laughs<00:04:44.129> yeah<00:04:44.340> my<00:04:44.699> government<00:04:45.629> did<00:04:45.900> red<00:04:46.590> cap

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830

Hamburg<00:04:47.789> that<00:04:47.970> can<00:04:48.090> unblock<00:04:48.330> wasn't<00:04:48.659> even

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
Hamburg that can unblock wasn't even

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.379 
Hamburg that can unblock wasn't even
wasn't<00:04:49.259> even<00:04:49.409> foul<00:04:49.590> yeah<00:04:50.099> but<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.310> think<00:04:50.970> that's

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
wasn't even foul yeah but I think that's

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:52.460 
wasn't even foul yeah but I think that's
why<00:04:51.539> I<00:04:51.569> think<00:04:51.780> it's<00:04:51.870> a<00:04:51.900> little<00:04:51.990> bit<00:04:52.169> unfair<00:04:52.409> to

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
why I think it's a little bit unfair to

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.219 
why I think it's a little bit unfair to

compare south to you know someone like

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.070 
compare south to you know someone like
me<00:04:55.349> because<00:04:55.650> he<00:04:55.759> didn't<00:04:56.759> have<00:04:56.819> that<00:04:56.879> switch<00:04:57.840> I

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
me because he didn't have that switch I

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.809
