00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:13.449
 Hello in this video a little tip you should keep in mind 

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:17.369
 The appearance of the fonts on your screen has been a long one 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.009
 Time did not change that was also first necessary than the so-called first 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.169
 Monitors slowly but surely prevailed 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.999
 Suddenly, the typeface was literally pixel-accurate 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.779
 However, this had a very ugly typeface picture and that's why 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.779
 Microsoft developed the so-called Trondheim 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.860
 The characters are intentionally out of focus 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.990
 they do not really notice in the presentation but the picture is like that 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.670
 much nicer to read the an alternative to Microsoft's total 90's 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.190
 g + j is and that is currently in a fairly early stadium 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.090
 in advance, the before-after-effect, I'll show you the same I can here 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.950
 but it can be easily recognized because of the postproduction 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.780
 and the conversion before the departure to YouTube gets lost and they do the whole thing 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.420
 possibly in the video can not really see in this case in Antalya itself 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.510
 So let's start near our standard web 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.510
 Call browser and our root search engine 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.210
 the idea him PP 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.490
 GDP rose by plus 2 1 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.930
 we are looking for 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.930
 we should find the first hit 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.450
 due to federal google point 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.840
 So the DPP Project Hosting below Google Code just rain on time 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.090
 the latest version here 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.470
 Version 0 point 8 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.510
 It also showed something that is quite new 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.510
 while downloading 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.510
 it will 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.510
 To run 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.320
 Mixed 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.670
 There are three possibilities 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.550
 I want to install it as a windows service but that's not 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.680
 We recommend that you read the information on the homepage when you are 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.029
 read that there 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:16.430
 Tobler or that this is the time he recommended with version 0 point 8 version 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.599
 was the same all year 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.660
 a virtual machine 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.580
 nothing can happen to her that's why I take 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.220
 in windows server is programs or he has the difference 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.390
 which you can then set for each individual program 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.760
 that there give the ++ should be used if they - yes, all know that we 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.279
 then take it for the complete binding system 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:39.380
 Sound and Azizi passes show 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.930
 blasier windows servers 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:41.909
 Next 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:44.909
 in the tunnel 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.079
 why installation just completed for me 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:56.079
 the chance the whole concept control panel 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:03.639
 administrations 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:06.639
 they would have to 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.869
 and here I have a service called 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.509
 the PP 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.909
 Here is the new service he is now launched what is the whole thing 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:23.869
 active 

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:27.369
 I can try everything before the most recent perform 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.769
 so it's off yet 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.769
 I will do it again 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.719
 what was it called 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:48.689
 9 is now 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.879
 so he is already a small step that the essential round was eliminated 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:56.119
 and then 7 should not be anyway 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.639
 the 2 0 marks 

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:03.659
 also font size up to 24 times 

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:08.259
 26 seven people 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.239
 cli 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.509
 I see this here 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.959
 and that's still changed in the old way 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.729
 we have come to terms with the existing this is here and in 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.580
 Normal employment what they too 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.760
 Venhaus im just because I stop it 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.249
 starting services 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:31.580
 makes it is still on the old pensioner Art 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.580
 shown 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.479
 if i do not like the software just go install it again or 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.479
 just as easy and easy 

00:04:43.689 --> 00:04:46.689
 please switch off everything 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.490
 like BP 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.490
 the lists are 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:00.969
 and the installation has to be started again 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.440
 However, the system is not on its own Markus so we have to exist 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:28.570
 as under Windows 7 arrived as we the old cityscape should now again 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:29.800
 very short 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.870
 on the one hand, in case she does the catch-up, she will be satisfied 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.710
 want as I said that is not recommended then as if that was 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.379
 install it being at our percent it ran absolutely smoothly 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:43.979
 but we do not use this computer here in production because of it 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.050
 here again at the end again the option program Lauder 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:51.159
 also just select the rest normally by installing 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:56.629
 after installation, we have a link to the EPPA if you are an expert 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.319
 to be able to double down on how to put an exe file on it 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.449
 formerly with the the lipid league hometown 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:07.669
 For example, emergency helpers will choose again 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.270
 local drive 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.979
 minuses 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.979
 Censorship is 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.710
 and so-called normal method 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:28.139
 to the poor old and old and new 

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:50.360
 so and as i said i can see a difference in my opinion 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.490
 after is not as strong as it is but definitely there 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.310
 for those who want to test the Soma relatively harmless above 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.680
 said the important part but does not exist
