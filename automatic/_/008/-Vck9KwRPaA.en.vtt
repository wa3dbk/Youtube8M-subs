okay<00:00:02.639> we<00:00:02.850> are<00:00:02.879> checking<00:00:03.210> here

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:03.890 
okay we are checking here

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.550 
okay we are checking here
the<00:00:04.890> fare<00:00:05.130> ticket<00:00:05.430> three<00:00:05.700> GPL<00:00:06.410> with<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
the fare ticket three GPL with the

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.299 
the fare ticket three GPL with the
vendor<00:00:07.890> is<00:00:08.130> 600<00:00:08.700> liters<00:00:09.030> an<00:00:09.179> hour<00:00:09.980> with<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> rota

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
vendor is 600 liters an hour with a rota

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.720 
vendor is 600 liters an hour with a rota
meter<00:00:11.429> of<00:00:11.940> 150<00:00:12.660> liters<00:00:12.929> an<00:00:13.110> hour<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:14.190> we<00:00:14.549> will

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
meter of 150 liters an hour and we will

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.859 
meter of 150 liters an hour and we will
see<00:00:15.000> how<00:00:15.660> we<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.900> adjust<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.830> flow

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.359 

so<00:00:24.349> the<00:00:24.470> flow<00:00:24.680> now<00:00:24.949> is<00:00:25.160> on<00:00:25.279> 150<00:00:27.070> uknown<00:00:28.070> can<00:00:28.250> you

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
so the flow now is on 150 uknown can you

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:41.260 
so the flow now is on 150 uknown can you
reduce<00:00:28.550> it<00:00:28.820> to<00:00:29.000> 140

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:52.720 

okay<00:00:41.890> take<00:00:42.890> it<00:00:42.920> down<00:00:43.570> to<00:00:44.570> 130

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.540 

here<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:53.420> take<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.720> to<00:00:53.840> 120

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:10.760 

okay<00:01:01.120> take<00:01:01.510> it<00:01:01.540> down<00:01:01.690> to<00:01:02.140> 100

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.060 

okay<00:01:11.400> take<00:01:11.820> it<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.630> 80

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.330 

and<00:01:17.550> now<00:01:18.000> 250

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:28.700 

and<00:01:22.820> leave<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.210> like<00:01:23.390> this

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:41.630 

now<00:01:29.250> take<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.550> back<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.970> 100

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:51.630 

and<00:01:42.180> now<00:01:42.480> take<00:01:43.440> it<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:43.710> 150

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.190 

okay

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.950 

so<00:01:56.680> we<00:01:56.830> can<00:01:57.010> see<00:01:57.220> that<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.520> system<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:58.479> able<00:01:58.780> to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
so we can see that the system is able to

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.570 
so we can see that the system is able to
adjust<00:02:02.220> without<00:02:03.220> any<00:02:03.570> difficulties
