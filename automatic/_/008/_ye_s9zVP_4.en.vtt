00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
you're taking another approach with him

in this game so talk to us about this
game<00:00:27.869> yeah<00:00:28.529> actually<00:00:29.150> we<00:00:30.150> start<00:00:31.050> having<00:00:31.349> this

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
game yeah actually we start having this

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.130 
game yeah actually we start having this
idea<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.040> spider-man<00:00:32.550> edge<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.420> time<00:00:33.630> while<00:00:33.960> we

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
idea of spider-man edge of time while we

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.500 
idea of spider-man edge of time while we
were<00:00:34.170> working<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.920> shadow<00:00:35.250> dimension<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
were working on shadow dimension and the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.889 
were working on shadow dimension and the
old<00:00:36.690> concept<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:39.059> player<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.719> able

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
old concept is that the player is able

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.830 
old concept is that the player is able
to<00:00:40.020> play<00:00:40.550> amazing<00:00:41.550> spider-man<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.329> big

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
to play amazing spider-man and big

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.229 
to play amazing spider-man and big
willow<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.200> experimenting<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> know<00:00:44.309> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
willow are experimenting on you know the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.389 
willow are experimenting on you know the
reason<00:00:45.570> for<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.200> they<00:00:46.890> are<00:00:47.129> both

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
reason for that is that they are both

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.450 
reason for that is that they are both
sharing<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.300> same<00:00:48.510> timeline<00:00:48.899> continuum<00:00:49.680> so

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
sharing the same timeline continuum so

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.479 
sharing the same timeline continuum so
about<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.879> story<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.660> fact<00:00:51.949> we<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.129> an<00:00:53.250> evil

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
about the story in fact we have an evil

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.389 
about the story in fact we have an evil
scientist<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.690> goes<00:00:54.960> back<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.710> time<00:00:56.010> in

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
scientist that goes back in time in

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.700 
scientist that goes back in time in
order<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.699> rewrite<00:00:57.120> history<00:00:57.680> mid-well<00:00:58.680> Oh

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
order to rewrite history mid-well Oh

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.700 
order to rewrite history mid-well Oh
around<00:00:58.980> witness<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.199> he<00:01:01.500> needs

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
around witness is that and so he needs

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.650 
around witness is that and so he needs
to<00:01:01.890> contact<00:01:02.340> spider-man<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.480> own

Oh in fact there is a chronal link that
is<00:02:28.830> created<00:02:29.370> is<00:02:29.610> between<00:02:30.090> those<00:02:30.300> two<00:02:30.660> specific

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
is created is between those two specific

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.040 
is created is between those two specific
moments<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.459> their<00:02:32.700> timeline<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.630> this<00:02:33.840> is

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
moments in their timeline so this is

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.229 
moments in their timeline so this is
what<00:02:34.470> helps<00:02:34.830> them<00:02:35.130> communicate<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.910> got

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
universe and that allows them in fact to

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.650 
universe and that allows them in fact to
discuss<00:02:44.340> together<00:02:44.700> well<00:02:45.330> about<00:02:45.600> a
