I'll be right back alright I'm back to

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.719 
I'll be right back alright I'm back to
the<00:02:03.899> same<00:02:04.140> ledge<00:02:04.350> where<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.770> start<00:02:05.070> from<00:02:05.130> so

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
the same ledge where you start from so

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.869 
the same ledge where you start from so
we<00:02:05.820> said<00:02:06.000> from<00:02:06.149> jumping<00:02:06.540> over<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.530> the

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879 
we said from jumping over there to the

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:10.580 
we said from jumping over there to the
chest<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.539> we'll<00:02:09.690> jump<00:02:09.929> here<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.410> right

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
chest and we'll jump here to the right

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.260 
chest and we'll jump here to the right
and<00:02:10.890> I'm<00:02:11.129> actually<00:02:11.400> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> use<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.940> speak

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
and I'm actually going to use a speak

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.110 
and I'm actually going to use a speak
mechanic

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
mechanic

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.180 
mechanic
would<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.480> suggest<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:14.319> to<00:02:14.530> use<00:02:14.560> as<00:02:14.920> well

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
would you suggest you to use as well

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.190 
would you suggest you to use as well
because<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.209> jump<00:02:16.510> maybe<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.870> little<00:02:16.989> bit

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
because this jump maybe a little bit

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.949 
because this jump maybe a little bit
tricky<00:02:17.620> if<00:02:17.830> you<00:02:18.010> do<00:02:18.159> it<00:02:18.250> wrong<00:02:18.459> and<00:02:18.959> jumping

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
tricky if you do it wrong and jumping

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.479 
tricky if you do it wrong and jumping
the<00:02:20.080> falling<00:02:20.620> down<00:02:20.769> isn't<00:02:21.190> that<00:02:21.220> painful

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
the falling down isn't that painful

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.830 
the falling down isn't that painful
simply<00:02:22.120> take<00:02:22.569> a<00:02:22.599> small<00:02:23.049> trip<00:02:23.080> right<00:02:23.680> here<00:02:24.159> and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
simply take a small trip right here and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.570 
simply take a small trip right here and
you<00:02:25.840> get<00:02:26.200> back<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.500> same<00:02:26.709> spot<00:02:26.830> but<00:02:27.010> there<00:02:27.489> is

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
you get back the same spot but there is

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.000 
you get back the same spot but there is
no<00:02:27.700> need<00:02:27.879> to<00:02:27.940> do<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.299> more<00:02:28.690> than<00:02:28.720> once<00:02:29.010> so

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
no need to do this more than once so

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.089 
no need to do this more than once so
take<00:02:30.640> this<00:02:30.819> jump<00:02:31.180> as<00:02:31.390> well<00:02:31.799> here<00:02:32.799> there<00:02:33.010> are

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
take this jump as well here there are

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.740 
take this jump as well here there are
some<00:02:33.280> K<00:02:33.459> pads<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:34.000> can<00:02:34.060> ignore<00:02:34.450> them

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
some K pads you can ignore them

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.240 
some K pads you can ignore them
altogether<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:36.930> make<00:02:37.930> those<00:02:38.200> jumps<00:02:38.769> there

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
altogether and make those jumps there

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.360 
altogether and make those jumps there
are<00:02:39.370> not<00:02:39.610> that<00:02:40.150> hard<00:02:40.599> without<00:02:41.590> any<00:02:41.829> speed<00:02:42.190> buff

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
are not that hard without any speed buff

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.869 
are not that hard without any speed buff
so<00:02:42.700> shouldn't<00:02:43.540> worry<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.170> too<00:02:44.409> much<00:02:44.879> alright

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
so shouldn't worry you too much alright

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.059 
so shouldn't worry you too much alright
so<00:02:46.030> at<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.239> point<00:02:46.569> there<00:02:47.049> there<00:02:47.799> is<00:02:47.920> this

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
so at this point there there is this

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.500 
so at this point there there is this
small<00:02:48.340> plot<00:02:48.640> from<00:02:48.790> here<00:02:49.090> with<00:02:49.239> all<00:02:49.390> those

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
small plot from here with all those

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.509 
small plot from here with all those
enemies<00:02:49.900> but<00:02:50.170> we're<00:02:50.530> not<00:02:50.680> interested<00:02:51.010> in<00:02:51.310> them

we're interested in these jumping
platforms<00:02:56.459> take<00:02:57.459> those<00:02:57.730> jumps<00:02:58.120> carefully<00:02:58.659> and

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
platforms take those jumps carefully and

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:00.780 
platforms take those jumps carefully and
I<00:02:59.170> don't<00:02:59.349> want<00:02:59.500> to<00:02:59.560> fall<00:02:59.739> down<00:02:59.769> here<00:03:00.280> again<00:03:00.670> not

these are lower level enemies remember

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.460 
these are lower level enemies remember
that<00:03:21.250> if<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:21.459> even<00:03:21.760> higher<00:03:22.150> level<00:03:22.599> you<00:03:23.109> always

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
that if you even higher level you always

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.280 
that if you even higher level you always
scale<00:03:23.859> down<00:03:24.069> to<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.329> appropriate<00:03:25.540> level<00:03:25.810> of

by<00:03:59.500> one<00:03:59.530> unless<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.609> are<00:04:00.669> here<00:04:00.910> with<00:04:01.060> friends

by one unless you are here with friends

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.220 
by one unless you are here with friends
which<00:04:01.780> will<00:04:02.049> make<00:04:02.169> them<00:04:02.379> obviously<00:04:02.919> easier

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
which will make them obviously easier

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.449 
which will make them obviously easier
don't<00:04:05.230> be<00:04:05.379> here<00:04:05.680> or<00:04:05.769> don't<00:04:05.949> try<00:04:06.099> to<00:04:06.160> take<00:04:06.280> them

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
don't be here or don't try to take them

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.740 
don't be here or don't try to take them
to<00:04:06.609> it<00:04:06.699> once<00:04:06.910> you're<00:04:07.389> probably

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
to it once you're probably

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.569 
to it once you're probably
won't<00:04:09.750> make<00:04:09.989> it<00:04:10.140> unless<00:04:10.739> you<00:04:10.920> are<00:04:11.189> heavily

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
won't make it unless you are heavily

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:17.300 
won't make it unless you are heavily
geared<00:04:12.620> and<00:04:14.510> let<00:04:15.510> me<00:04:15.629> finish<00:04:15.810> this<00:04:16.410> one<00:04:16.739> I'm

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
geared and let me finish this one I'm

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.029 
geared and let me finish this one I'm
going<00:04:17.549> to<00:04:17.639> advance<00:04:17.940> the<00:04:18.180> next<00:04:18.419> one<00:04:19.039> and

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
going to advance the next one and

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.430 
going to advance the next one and
basically<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.389> moment<00:04:21.630> you<00:04:21.720> kill<00:04:22.109> them<00:04:22.259> both

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
basically the moment you kill them both

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.990 
basically the moment you kill them both
and<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:23.340> open<00:04:23.729> the<00:04:23.850> chest<00:04:24.120> you<00:04:25.820> finish<00:04:26.820> the

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
and you open the chest you finish the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.529 
and you open the chest you finish the
achievement<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.570> get<00:04:28.139> your<00:04:28.289> reward<00:04:29.539> so

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
that's it that unlike other achievements

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.629 
that's it that unlike other achievements
this<00:04:35.639> one<00:04:35.850> is<00:04:35.940> quite<00:04:36.270> easy<00:04:36.300> and<00:04:36.930> also<00:04:37.650> quite

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
this one is quite easy and also quite

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.180 
this one is quite easy and also quite
lower<00:04:39.509> level<00:04:39.990> demanding<00:04:40.470> that's<00:04:40.710> degree<00:04:40.979> to

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
lower level demanding that's degree to

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.830 
lower level demanding that's degree to
be<00:04:41.310> higher<00:04:41.550> level<00:04:41.910> but<00:04:42.419> on<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.630> other<00:04:42.690> hand

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 
reward chest it will be quite hard to

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.250 
reward chest it will be quite hard to
disable<00:04:50.280> both<00:04:50.639> of<00:04:50.910> them<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.330> jump<00:04:51.900> for<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.139> we

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260

disable both of them and jump for the we
were<00:04:52.410> just<00:04:52.680> so<00:04:53.690> bear<00:04:54.690> that<00:04:54.720> in<00:04:54.990> mind<00:04:57.500> and

were just so bear that in mind and

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.710 
were just so bear that in mind and
that's<00:04:59.039> it<00:04:59.160> once<00:04:59.490> you<00:04:59.729> stand<00:05:00.240> next<00:05:00.419> to<00:05:00.599> the

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720
