to kind of a written it off to a

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.370 
to kind of a written it off to a
businesslike<00:01:34.540> approach<00:01:34.720> but<00:01:35.050> this<00:01:35.170> team

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
businesslike approach but this team

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.710 
businesslike approach but this team
looked<00:01:35.560> flat<00:01:35.710> in<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:35.920> first<00:01:36.130> half<00:01:36.310> well<00:01:36.910> you

Syracuse they they just did some things

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.600 
Syracuse they they just did some things
really<00:01:41.830> good<00:01:42.040> they're<00:01:42.220> very<00:01:42.430> good

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
really good they're very good

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.460 
really good they're very good
defensively<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.690> then<00:01:43.960> I'd<00:01:44.110> like<00:01:44.260> to<00:01:44.380> talk

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
defensively and then I'd like to talk

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.170 
defensively and then I'd like to talk
about<00:01:44.530> our<00:01:44.860> defense<00:01:45.040> after<00:01:45.550> those<00:01:45.700> two<00:01:45.910> first

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
about our defense after those two first

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.240 
about our defense after those two first
two<00:01:46.360> long<00:01:46.540> bombs<00:01:46.840> we<00:01:47.440> really<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:47.740> thought<00:01:48.130> we

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
two long bombs we really I thought we

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.370 
two long bombs we really I thought we
stepped<00:01:48.580> up<00:01:48.820> but<00:01:49.090> that<00:01:49.780> is<00:01:49.930> where<00:01:50.050> I<00:01:50.110> think<00:01:50.320> the

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
stepped up but that is where I think the

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.230 
stepped up but that is where I think the
momentum<00:01:50.590> shift<00:01:50.950> game<00:01:51.160> no<00:01:51.400> question<00:01:51.430> it<00:01:52.090> was<00:01:52.210> a

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
momentum shift game no question it was a

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.719 
momentum shift game no question it was a
battle<00:01:52.660> here<00:01:52.840> tonight<00:01:52.960> Michael<00:01:53.890> Vick<00:01:54.070> kind<00:01:54.640> of
