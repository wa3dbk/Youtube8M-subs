hi<00:00:03.400> my<00:00:04.270> name<00:00:04.390> is<00:00:04.480> John<00:00:04.660> cattlemen<00:00:06.600> today<00:00:07.600> I

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.050 
hi my name is John cattlemen today I

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.749 
hi my name is John cattlemen today I
want<00:00:08.950> to<00:00:09.009> talk<00:00:09.190> to<00:00:09.370> you<00:00:09.789> about<00:00:11.009> metallic<00:00:12.009> heat

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:12.759 
want to talk to you about metallic heat

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.480 
want to talk to you about metallic heat
transfer<00:00:13.980> now<00:00:14.980> behind<00:00:15.429> me<00:00:15.630> you<00:00:16.630> can<00:00:16.660> see<00:00:16.900> some

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
transfer now behind me you can see some

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.120 
transfer now behind me you can see some
empty<00:00:18.490> D<00:00:18.670> collectors<00:00:19.270> that<00:00:19.750> use<00:00:20.170> a<00:00:20.530> method<00:00:21.010> of

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
empty D collectors that use a method of

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.210 
empty D collectors that use a method of
non<00:00:21.880> metallic<00:00:22.330> you<00:00:22.750> transfer<00:00:23.320> but<00:00:24.010> they'll

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
non metallic you transfer but they'll

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.560 
non metallic you transfer but they'll
save<00:00:24.460> a<00:00:24.820> discussion<00:00:25.540> about<00:00:25.990> this<00:00:27.300> okay<00:00:28.300> I'd

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
save a discussion about this okay I'd

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.870 
save a discussion about this okay I'd
like<00:00:28.750> you<00:00:28.900> to<00:00:29.050> look<00:00:29.230> at<00:00:29.380> this<00:00:29.650> as<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:31.770> concept

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
like you to look at this as a concept

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.000 
like you to look at this as a concept
example<00:00:33.880> I<00:00:34.060> I<00:00:34.660> don't<00:00:35.110> expect<00:00:35.500> you<00:00:35.710> to<00:00:35.860> actually

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
example I I don't expect you to actually

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.940 
example I I don't expect you to actually
use<00:00:36.990> half-inch<00:00:37.990> copper<00:00:38.320> tubes<00:00:39.270> as<00:00:40.650> flow<00:00:41.650> tubes

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
use half-inch copper tubes as flow tubes

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.010 
use half-inch copper tubes as flow tubes
you<00:00:42.220> should<00:00:42.400> really<00:00:42.579> use<00:00:42.670> something<00:00:43.210> like<00:00:43.239> 3/8

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
you should really use something like 3/8

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.900 
you should really use something like 3/8
inch<00:00:44.320> copper<00:00:44.560> -<00:00:44.829> it's<00:00:45.520> their<00:00:47.430> creation<00:00:48.430> of

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
inch copper - it's their creation of

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.540 
inch copper - it's their creation of
course<00:00:49.090> going<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.300> be<00:00:49.360> a<00:00:49.450> lot<00:00:50.280> less<00:00:51.280> expensive

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
course going to be a lot less expensive

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.970 
course going to be a lot less expensive
you<00:00:51.910> don't<00:00:52.060> really<00:00:52.210> need<00:00:52.450> them<00:00:52.630> I<00:00:52.809> found<00:00:53.739> a

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
you don't really need them I found a

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.750 
you don't really need them I found a
good<00:00:54.540> distance<00:00:55.540> between<00:00:55.809> the<00:00:56.649> copper<00:00:57.340> tube<00:00:57.520> is

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
good distance between the copper tube is

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.639 
good distance between the copper tube is
about<00:00:58.090> six<00:00:58.570> inches<00:00:58.930> I<00:00:58.989> mean<00:00:59.290> I'm<00:00:59.410> going<00:00:59.590> to

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
about six inches I mean I'm going to

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.290 
about six inches I mean I'm going to
leave<00:00:59.860> that<00:01:00.010> up<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:00.250> you<00:01:00.460> but<00:01:00.700> that<00:01:00.730> works<00:01:01.030> out

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
leave that up to you but that works out

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.259 
leave that up to you but that works out
pretty<00:01:01.600> good<00:01:01.840> for<00:01:01.899> me<00:01:02.140> anyway<00:01:03.040> the<00:01:03.940> thing<00:01:04.119> that

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:04.269 
pretty good for me anyway the thing that

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.140 
pretty good for me anyway the thing that
we<00:01:04.360> really<00:01:04.780> are<00:01:05.019> concerned<00:01:05.920> with<00:01:06.130> today<00:01:06.310> has

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
we really are concerned with today has

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.969 
we really are concerned with today has
to<00:01:07.360> do<00:01:07.479> with<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.780> thickness<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.440> absorber

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
to do with the thickness of the absorber

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:09.210 
to do with the thickness of the absorber
plate

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
plate

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.450 
plate
if<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:09.970> absorber<00:01:10.420> plate<00:01:10.450> is<00:01:10.900> too<00:01:11.140> thick<00:01:11.500> it

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
if the absorber plate is too thick it

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.390 
if the absorber plate is too thick it
will<00:01:12.610> take<00:01:12.820> too<00:01:13.180> long<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.870> heat<00:01:14.260> up<00:01:14.290> and<00:01:14.710> we'll

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
will take too long to heat up and we'll

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.880 
will take too long to heat up and we'll
also<00:01:15.610> take<00:01:15.970> too<00:01:16.240> long<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.510> transfer<00:01:17.200> heat<00:01:17.619> from

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
also take too long to transfer heat from

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.590 
also take too long to transfer heat from
the<00:01:18.670> absorber<00:01:19.119> plate<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:20.229> flow<00:01:20.710> tube<00:01:21.010> as<00:01:21.600> you

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
the absorber plate to a flow tube as you

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.530 
the absorber plate to a flow tube as you
know<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:23.260> know<00:01:23.290> this<00:01:23.530> is<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:24.510> absorber<00:01:25.510> plate

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
know you know this is the absorber plate

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.320 
know you know this is the absorber plate
and<00:01:25.990> this<00:01:26.320> is<00:01:26.380> the<00:01:26.590> flow<00:01:26.860> tube<00:01:27.220> just<00:01:28.090> want<00:01:28.270> to

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
and this is the flow tube just want to

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.060 
and this is the flow tube just want to
clarify<00:01:28.510> that<00:01:28.750> I'm<00:01:29.140> sure<00:01:29.320> you<00:01:29.470> know<00:01:29.590> you<00:01:29.770> know

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
clarify that I'm sure you know you know

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.390 
clarify that I'm sure you know you know
okay<00:01:30.280> all<00:01:31.060> right<00:01:31.270> that's<00:01:31.689> good<00:01:32.020> all<00:01:32.950> right<00:01:33.100> so

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:33.400 
okay all right that's good all right so

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.490 
okay all right that's good all right so
if<00:01:33.939> it's<00:01:34.060> too<00:01:34.299> thick<00:01:34.630> it's<00:01:34.840> going<00:01:34.930> to<00:01:35.110> take<00:01:35.290> too

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
if it's too thick it's going to take too

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.010 
if it's too thick it's going to take too
long<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:36.100> transfer<00:01:36.850> the<00:01:37.000> heat<00:01:37.150> so<00:01:37.540> the<00:01:37.720> heat

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
long to transfer the heat so the heat

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.469 
long to transfer the heat so the heat
transfer<00:01:38.470> rates<00:01:38.680> gonna<00:01:38.890> be<00:01:39.070> too<00:01:39.280> slow<00:01:39.549> what

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
transfer rates gonna be too slow what

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.100 
transfer rates gonna be too slow what
happens<00:01:40.869> if<00:01:41.049> it's<00:01:41.200> too<00:01:41.409> thin<00:01:42.150> well<00:01:43.150> well<00:01:43.930> it's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
happens if it's too thin well well it's

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.460 
happens if it's too thin well well it's
gonna<00:01:44.259> heat<00:01:44.799> up<00:01:44.830> right<00:01:45.189> away<00:01:45.340> but<00:01:46.240> if<00:01:46.509> it's<00:01:46.810> too

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
gonna heat up right away but if it's too

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.020 
gonna heat up right away but if it's too
thin<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.810> heat<00:01:50.380> dissipation<00:01:50.979> compared<00:01:51.790> to

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
thin the heat dissipation compared to

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.850 
thin the heat dissipation compared to
the<00:01:52.180> heat<00:01:52.750> conduction<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.780> heat<00:01:55.990> dissipation

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
the heat conduction the heat dissipation

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.980 
the heat conduction the heat dissipation
will<00:01:57.400> be<00:01:57.579> higher<00:01:57.850> than<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.450> heat<00:01:58.630> conduction

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
will be higher than the heat conduction

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.840 
will be higher than the heat conduction
rate<00:01:59.350> so<00:01:59.590> we're<00:01:59.710> gonna<00:01:59.799> be<00:02:00.009> losing<00:02:00.460> more<00:02:00.640> heat

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
rate so we're gonna be losing more heat

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.830 
rate so we're gonna be losing more heat
than<00:02:01.030> we're<00:02:01.210> doing<00:02:01.829> okay<00:02:02.829> so<00:02:03.729> we<00:02:04.390> don't<00:02:04.570> want

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
than we're doing okay so we don't want

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.410 
than we're doing okay so we don't want
our<00:02:05.130> absorber<00:02:06.130> plate<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.520> be<00:02:06.670> too<00:02:06.939> thick<00:02:07.210> or

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
our absorber plate to be too thick or

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.440 
our absorber plate to be too thick or
too<00:02:07.479> thin<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.920> we<00:02:09.550> don't<00:02:09.759> want<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.149> be<00:02:10.270> too

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
too thin and we don't want it to be too

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.270 
too thin and we don't want it to be too
expensive<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:12.360> want<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.530> find<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.620> balance

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
expensive so want to find a balance

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.770 
expensive so want to find a balance
between<00:02:15.550> all<00:02:15.760> these<00:02:15.970> things<00:02:16.240> and<00:02:16.510> that's<00:02:16.569> what

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
between all these things and that's what

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.449 
between all these things and that's what
this<00:02:16.900> experiment<00:02:17.560> is<00:02:17.650> about<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.250> we're<00:02:18.340> all

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
this experiment is about and we're all

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.730 
this experiment is about and we're all
set<00:02:18.880> up<00:02:19.030> for<00:02:19.270> our<00:02:19.300> heat<00:02:19.600> transfer<00:02:19.740> experiment

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
set up for our heat transfer experiment

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.730 
set up for our heat transfer experiment
what<00:02:21.730> we<00:02:21.760> want<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.120> do<00:02:22.270> is<00:02:22.510> measure<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.230> heat

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
what we want to do is measure the heat

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.449 
what we want to do is measure the heat
transfer<00:02:24.370> rate<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:26.110> thin<00:02:26.890> sheet<00:02:27.220> of

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
transfer rate in a thin sheet of

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.059 
transfer rate in a thin sheet of
aluminum<00:02:27.970> as<00:02:28.150> opposed<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.440> thick<00:02:29.770> sheet<00:02:30.040> of

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
aluminum as opposed to a thick sheet of

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.070 
aluminum as opposed to a thick sheet of
aluminum<00:02:30.550> now<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.360> difference<00:02:31.900> in

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
aluminum now the difference in

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.559 
aluminum now the difference in
thicknesses<00:02:32.709> is<00:02:33.010> not<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.700> much<00:02:34.000> but<00:02:34.360> there

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
thicknesses is not that much but there

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.530 
thicknesses is not that much but there
is<00:02:34.780> a<00:02:34.810> difference<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.790> thin<00:02:37.180> sheet<00:02:37.209> of

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
is a difference the thin sheet of

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.050 
is a difference the thin sheet of
aluminum<00:02:38.020> is<00:02:38.290> point<00:02:38.800> zero<00:02:39.100> one<00:02:39.340> four<00:02:39.580> inches

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
aluminum is point zero one four inches

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.150 
aluminum is point zero one four inches
and<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.510> thick<00:02:40.720> sheet<00:02:40.930> of<00:02:40.959> aluminum<00:02:41.470> is<00:02:41.709> point

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
and the thick sheet of aluminum is point

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.830 
and the thick sheet of aluminum is point
zero<00:02:42.400> two<00:02:42.610> inches<00:02:42.959> okay<00:02:43.959> so<00:02:45.420> what<00:02:46.420> we<00:02:46.600> have

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
zero two inches okay so what we have

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.070 
zero two inches okay so what we have
here<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.530> we<00:02:47.890> have<00:02:48.269> four<00:02:49.269> temperature<00:02:49.810> probes

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
here is we have four temperature probes

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.400 
here is we have four temperature probes
two<00:02:51.010> temperature<00:02:51.519> probes<00:02:51.820> are<00:02:52.230> two<00:02:53.230> inches

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
two temperature probes are two inches

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.479 
two temperature probes are two inches
from<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.160> heat<00:02:54.730> source<00:02:54.760> and<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:57.010> other<00:02:57.190> two

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
from the heat source and the other two

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.540 
from the heat source and the other two
temperature<00:02:58.450> probes<00:02:58.750> are<00:02:59.110> 4<00:02:59.920> inches<00:03:00.280> from<00:03:00.459> the

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
temperature probes are 4 inches from the

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.410 
temperature probes are 4 inches from the
heat<00:03:00.819> source<00:03:01.590> so<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:04.050> monitor<00:03:05.050> on<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.980> Left

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420

aluminum and the monitor on the right

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.290 
aluminum and the monitor on the right
will<00:03:14.560> be<00:03:14.800> monitoring<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.370> temperatures<00:03:15.940> in

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
will be monitoring the temperatures in

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.420 
will be monitoring the temperatures in
the<00:03:16.450> thick<00:03:16.660> sheet<00:03:16.840> of<00:03:16.959> aluminum<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
the thick sheet of aluminum the

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.670 
the thick sheet of aluminum the
temperature<00:03:18.910> reading<00:03:19.180> on<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.450> top<00:03:19.690> is<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.079> is

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
temperature reading on the top is the is

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.039 
temperature reading on the top is the is
this<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.910> temperature<00:03:22.540> right<00:03:22.720> here<00:03:22.750> is

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
this this temperature right here is

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.840 
this this temperature right here is
measuring<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:24.519> thin<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:27.370> temperature<00:03:27.760> in

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
measuring the thin the temperature in

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.170 
measuring the thin the temperature in
the<00:03:27.970> thin<00:03:28.180> sheet<00:03:28.209> of<00:03:28.510> aluminum<00:03:29.160> 2<00:03:30.160> inches<00:03:30.519> from

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
the thin sheet of aluminum 2 inches from

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.990 
the thin sheet of aluminum 2 inches from
the<00:03:31.299> heat<00:03:31.450> source<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:32.560> we<00:03:32.739> would<00:03:32.920> expect<00:03:33.250> this

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
the heat source so we would expect this

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.729 
the heat source so we would expect this
temperature<00:03:34.600> to<00:03:34.900> rise<00:03:36.870> more<00:03:37.870> rapidly<00:03:37.930> than

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
temperature to rise more rapidly than

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.770 
temperature to rise more rapidly than
the<00:03:39.690> then<00:03:40.690> the<00:03:40.870> probe<00:03:41.290> that's<00:03:41.500> 4<00:03:41.799> inches<00:03:42.070> away

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
the then the probe that's 4 inches away

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.479 
the then the probe that's 4 inches away
and<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:44.200> would<00:03:44.350> be<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.590> same<00:03:44.829> for<00:03:44.859> the<00:03:45.250> thick

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
and that would be the same for the thick

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.099 
and that would be the same for the thick
or<00:03:45.910> the<00:03:46.570> thin<00:03:47.019> sheet<00:03:47.049> of<00:03:47.410> aluminum<00:03:47.829> so<00:03:48.989> for<00:03:49.989> our

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
or the thin sheet of aluminum so for our

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:55.050 
or the thin sheet of aluminum so for our
heat<00:03:50.290> source<00:03:50.560> we're<00:03:50.859> going<00:03:51.100> to<00:03:51.250> use<00:03:53.489> 2<00:03:54.489> candles

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
heat source we're going to use 2 candles

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.220 
heat source we're going to use 2 candles
okay<00:03:55.810> so<00:03:55.870> I<00:03:56.079> like<00:03:56.410> that<00:03:56.650> right<00:03:56.920> now

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
okay so I like that right now

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
okay so I like that right now
very<00:03:59.230> scientific<00:03:59.500> isn't<00:04:00.370> it<00:04:00.519> yes<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.720> okay

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
very scientific isn't it yes it is okay

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.490 
very scientific isn't it yes it is okay
so<00:04:03.250> we<00:04:03.910> have<00:04:04.030> two<00:04:04.209> candles<00:04:04.630> in<00:04:04.750> there<00:04:04.930> trust<00:04:05.260> me

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
so we have two candles in there trust me

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.649 
so we have two candles in there trust me
on<00:04:05.590> this

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:15.240 

well<00:04:13.659> this<00:04:13.870> is<00:04:13.989> about<00:04:14.200> as<00:04:14.379> scientific<00:04:14.950> as<00:04:15.069> I

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
well this is about as scientific as I

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.129 
well this is about as scientific as I
can<00:04:15.670> get<00:04:15.879> I<00:04:16.060> don't<00:04:16.120> know<00:04:16.239> if<00:04:16.510> you<00:04:16.690> want<00:04:16.840> to<00:04:16.900> do

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
can get I don't know if you want to do

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:18.870 
can get I don't know if you want to do
this<00:04:17.290> on<00:04:17.500> your<00:04:17.530> own<00:04:17.680> you<00:04:17.949> can<00:04:18.130> verify<00:04:18.370> some<00:04:18.790> of

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
this on your own you can verify some of

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.409 
this on your own you can verify some of
these<00:04:19.000> results<00:04:20.040> anyway<00:04:21.960> so<00:04:22.960> as<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:23.919> can<00:04:24.070> see

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
these results anyway so as you can see

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.750 
these results anyway so as you can see
the<00:04:25.419> temperature<00:04:25.900> on<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.979> left<00:04:27.160> is<00:04:27.400> starting

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
the temperature on the left is starting

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.400 
the temperature on the left is starting
to<00:04:27.880> rise<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.389> so<00:04:28.540> is<00:04:28.690> the<00:04:28.810> one<00:04:28.930> on<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.229> right

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
to rise and so is the one on the right

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.710 
to rise and so is the one on the right
these<00:04:30.220> are<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.520> temperatures<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.120> are<00:04:31.570> only

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
these are the temperatures that are only

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.270 
these are the temperatures that are only
two<00:04:31.990> inches<00:04:32.260> away<00:04:32.410> now<00:04:32.620> it's<00:04:32.770> already<00:04:33.040> up<00:04:33.160> to

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
two inches away now it's already up to

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.350 
two inches away now it's already up to
80<00:04:33.490> 81<00:04:33.970> 82<00:04:34.260> 83<00:04:35.260> degrees<00:04:35.800> so<00:04:36.639> the<00:04:36.790> temperatures

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
80 81 82 83 degrees so the temperatures

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.050 
80 81 82 83 degrees so the temperatures
for<00:04:38.350> both<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.740> thick<00:04:38.979> sheet<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.430> aluminum<00:04:39.880> and

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
for both the thick sheet of aluminum and

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.879 
for both the thick sheet of aluminum and
the<00:04:40.330> thin<00:04:40.540> sheet<00:04:40.780> of<00:04:41.020> aluminum<00:04:41.470> are<00:04:41.680> just

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
the thin sheet of aluminum are just

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.330 
the thin sheet of aluminum are just
about<00:04:42.130> the<00:04:42.310> same<00:04:42.520> actually<00:04:43.410> you<00:04:44.410> can<00:04:44.590> see<00:04:44.740> 87

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
about the same actually you can see 87

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.409 
about the same actually you can see 87
degrees<00:04:45.639> 87<00:04:46.270> degrees<00:04:47.070> now<00:04:48.070> you<00:04:49.060> can<00:04:49.240> notice

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
degrees 87 degrees now you can notice

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.460 
degrees 87 degrees now you can notice
the<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:50.740> temperature<00:04:51.190> at<00:04:52.030> four<00:04:52.900> inches<00:04:53.229> it's

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470 
the the temperature at four inches it's

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.140 
the the temperature at four inches it's
it's<00:04:53.710> actually<00:04:54.160> a<00:04:54.190> little<00:04:54.400> higher<00:04:54.639> for<00:04:55.030> the

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
it's actually a little higher for the

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.450 
it's actually a little higher for the
thicker<00:04:55.330> sheet<00:04:55.600> of<00:04:55.720> aluminum<00:04:56.139> 84<00:04:56.860> degrees<00:04:57.039> as

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
thicker sheet of aluminum 84 degrees as

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.170 
thicker sheet of aluminum 84 degrees as
opposed<00:04:57.789> to<00:04:57.880> 79<00:04:58.419> degrees<00:05:00.000> but<00:05:01.000> the

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
opposed to 79 degrees but the

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.680 
opposed to 79 degrees but the
temperature<00:05:01.630> differences<00:05:02.440> is<00:05:02.650> really<00:05:03.690> are

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
temperature differences is really are

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.510 
temperature differences is really are
really<00:05:05.229> quite<00:05:05.560> similar<00:05:08.100> well<00:05:09.100> you<00:05:09.310> might<00:05:09.490> say

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
really quite similar well you might say

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.279 
really quite similar well you might say
that<00:05:09.729> the<00:05:10.090> thicker<00:05:10.600> feet<00:05:10.780> of<00:05:10.870> aluminum

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
that the thicker feet of aluminum

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.300 
that the thicker feet of aluminum
conducts<00:05:11.650> heat<00:05:11.800> a<00:05:12.010> little<00:05:12.250> bit<00:05:13.060> better<00:05:14.310> but

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
conducts heat a little bit better but

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.980 
conducts heat a little bit better but
but<00:05:16.150> not<00:05:16.300> much<00:05:17.430> anyway<00:05:18.430> so<00:05:18.789> these<00:05:19.570> are<00:05:19.720> one<00:05:19.870> of

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
but not much anyway so these are one of

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.219 
but not much anyway so these are one of
the<00:05:20.050> things<00:05:20.260> that<00:05:20.500> you<00:05:20.710> will<00:05:21.280> need<00:05:21.430> to<00:05:21.610> decide

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
the things that you will need to decide

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.860 
the things that you will need to decide
when<00:05:23.229> you<00:05:23.970> purchase<00:05:24.970> your<00:05:25.000> aluminum<00:05:25.660> to<00:05:25.840> make

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
when you purchase your aluminum to make

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:33.000 
when you purchase your aluminum to make
your<00:05:27.570> solar<00:05:28.570> collector<00:05:31.560> one<00:05:32.560> thing<00:05:32.800> to

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
your solar collector one thing to

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.680 
your solar collector one thing to
remember<00:05:33.280> is<00:05:33.610> the<00:05:33.849> thicker<00:05:34.330> sheet<00:05:34.570> of

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
remember is the thicker sheet of

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.240 
remember is the thicker sheet of
aluminum<00:05:36.750> will<00:05:37.750> cost<00:05:38.110> you<00:05:38.349> about<00:05:38.500> twice<00:05:39.039> as

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
aluminum will cost you about twice as

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.680 
aluminum will cost you about twice as
much<00:05:39.490> and<00:05:41.400> you'll<00:05:42.400> notice<00:05:42.729> right<00:05:43.030> now<00:05:43.510> that

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
much and you'll notice right now that

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.960 
much and you'll notice right now that
the<00:05:43.990> temperature<00:05:44.560> the<00:05:45.370> one<00:05:45.550> on<00:05:45.669> the<00:05:45.789> right

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
the temperature the one on the right

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.730 
the temperature the one on the right
this<00:05:46.180> is<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.360> hundred<00:05:46.720> and<00:05:46.840> seventeen<00:05:47.349> degrees

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
this is a hundred and seventeen degrees

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.480 
this is a hundred and seventeen degrees
and<00:05:48.099> the<00:05:48.520> thicker<00:05:49.150> aluminum<00:05:49.720> is<00:05:50.190> 114<00:05:51.190> degrees

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
and the thicker aluminum is 114 degrees

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.540 
and the thicker aluminum is 114 degrees
so<00:05:51.699> actually<00:05:52.120> it's<00:05:52.330> a<00:05:52.449> little<00:05:52.690> hotter<00:05:52.930> at<00:05:53.550> two

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
so actually it's a little hotter at two

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.659 
so actually it's a little hotter at two
inches<00:05:57.270> you<00:05:58.270> know<00:05:58.300> it's<00:05:58.539> up<00:05:58.660> to<00:05:58.810> 121<00:05:59.710> and<00:06:00.160> the

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
inches you know it's up to 121 and the

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.750 
inches you know it's up to 121 and the
thicker<00:06:01.419> feed<00:06:01.690> is<00:06:01.889> 117<00:06:02.889> anyway<00:06:03.580> they're

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
thicker feed is 117 anyway they're

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.839 
thicker feed is 117 anyway they're
pretty<00:06:04.419> much<00:06:04.630> neck<00:06:04.900> in<00:06:05.020> there<00:06:05.550> but<00:06:06.550> you<00:06:06.699> can

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
pretty much neck in there but you can

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:13.650 
pretty much neck in there but you can
see<00:06:07.030> the<00:06:07.210> the<00:06:07.539> differences<00:06:09.449> not<00:06:10.449> much<00:06:12.240> anyway

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
see the the differences not much anyway

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.830 
see the the differences not much anyway
when<00:06:13.960> it<00:06:14.080> comes<00:06:14.289> to<00:06:14.530> bending<00:06:15.099> the<00:06:15.280> aluminum

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
when it comes to bending the aluminum

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.120 
when it comes to bending the aluminum
that's<00:06:16.840> when<00:06:17.199> you're<00:06:17.380> going<00:06:17.590> to<00:06:17.680> have<00:06:17.860> your

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
that's when you're going to have your

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.950 
that's when you're going to have your
your<00:06:18.520> problem<00:06:18.909> if<00:06:19.060> you<00:06:19.180> decide<00:06:19.539> to<00:06:19.750> make<00:06:19.900> your

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
your problem if you decide to make your

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.250 
your problem if you decide to make your
absorber<00:06:20.620> plate<00:06:20.650> yourself

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:22.260 
absorber plate yourself

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.280 
absorber plate yourself
the<00:06:22.440> thick<00:06:22.680> sheet<00:06:23.070> of<00:06:23.190> aluminum<00:06:23.670> will<00:06:24.180> be<00:06:24.420> more

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:25.290 
the thick sheet of aluminum will be more

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.620 
the thick sheet of aluminum will be more
difficult<00:06:25.500> to<00:06:25.920> bend<00:06:26.190> taking<00:06:26.730> forward<00:06:27.120> on<00:06:27.420> this

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
difficult to bend taking forward on this

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.620 
difficult to bend taking forward on this
okay<00:06:28.410> anyway<00:06:29.190> that's<00:06:29.430> our<00:06:29.610> experiment<00:06:30.210> for

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
okay anyway that's our experiment for

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.600 
okay anyway that's our experiment for
heat<00:06:31.230> transfer<00:06:31.500> using<00:06:32.130> two<00:06:33.090> thicknesses<00:06:33.390> of

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:34.610 
heat transfer using two thicknesses of

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.610 
heat transfer using two thicknesses of
aluminum
