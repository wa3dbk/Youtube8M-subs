you guys is the np11 glide twisted KFI
breakneck<00:00:09.360> these<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.410> my<00:00:10.620> opinion<00:00:10.920> are<00:00:11.070> two<00:00:11.309> of

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
breakneck these in my opinion are two of

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.240 
breakneck these in my opinion are two of
the<00:00:11.610> best<00:00:11.750> elite<00:00:12.750> SMGs<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.769> just<00:00:13.980> didn't<00:00:14.219> think

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
the best elite SMGs I just didn't think

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.010 
the best elite SMGs I just didn't think
that<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.610> other<00:00:14.700> two<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.240> their<00:00:15.480> same<00:00:15.780> class

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
that the other two in their same class

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.660 
that the other two in their same class
where<00:00:16.289> world<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.560> comparing<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.130> think<00:00:17.580> these

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
where world of comparing I think these

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.210 
where world of comparing I think these
two<00:00:17.910> head-to-head<00:00:18.230> these<00:00:19.230> are<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.680> number

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
two head-to-head these are the number

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.160 
two head-to-head these are the number
two<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.580> number<00:00:20.609> three<00:00:20.760> Best<00:00:21.150> Lead<00:00:21.390> smgs<00:00:21.930> in

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
two and number three Best Lead smgs in

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.990 
two and number three Best Lead smgs in
advanced<00:00:22.560> warfare<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.250> basically<00:00:23.640> start<00:00:23.880> off

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
advanced warfare so basically start off

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.210 
advanced warfare so basically start off
with<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.210> MP<00:00:24.480> 11<00:00:24.750> glide<00:00:24.960> has<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.260> plus<00:00:25.680> 3<00:00:25.949> damage

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
with the MP 11 glide has a plus 3 damage

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.130 
with the MP 11 glide has a plus 3 damage
and<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> minus<00:00:26.910> 3<00:00:27.150> handling<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.660> basically<00:00:27.990> what

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and a minus 3 handling so basically what

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.019 
and a minus 3 handling so basically what
sets<00:00:28.470> going<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.130> give<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.400> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> give

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
sets going to give you is going to give

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.669 
sets going to give you is going to give
you<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.150> highest<00:00:30.539> close<00:00:30.960> range<00:00:31.230> damage<00:00:31.439> out

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you the highest close range damage out

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.160 
you the highest close range damage out
of<00:00:31.769> every<00:00:32.070> SMG<00:00:32.520> in<00:00:32.700> advanced<00:00:33.180> warfare<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.930> MP

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
of every SMG in advanced warfare the MP

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.319 
of every SMG in advanced warfare the MP
11<00:00:34.410> Goliath<00:00:34.739> close<00:00:35.040> range<00:00:35.340> damage<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:36.000> number

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
11 Goliath close range damage is number

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.360 
11 Goliath close range damage is number
one<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.540> advance<00:00:36.930> or<00:00:37.050> four<00:00:37.290> smgs<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.100> minus

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
one in advance or four smgs the minus

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.010 
one in advance or four smgs the minus
three<00:00:38.579> handling<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> give<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.840> a

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
three handling is going to give you a

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.220 
three handling is going to give you a
30-percent<00:00:40.980> reduced<00:00:41.340> 80s<00:00:41.940> time<00:00:42.270> which<00:00:42.510> so

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
30-percent reduced 80s time which so

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.650 
30-percent reduced 80s time which so
it's<00:00:43.980> kind<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.640> bounced<00:00:45.030> off<00:00:45.360> there<00:00:45.629> so

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
it's kind of a it bounced off there so

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.330 
it's kind of a it bounced off there so
you<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.500> highest<00:00:46.649> close<00:00:46.920> range<00:00:47.160> damage

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
you have the highest close range damage

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.209 
you have the highest close range damage
which<00:00:47.579> your<00:00:47.700> 80s<00:00:48.000> time<00:00:48.329> is<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.530> negative

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
which your 80s time is the negative

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
which your 80s time is the negative
thirty<00:00:50.820> percent<00:00:51.239> that's<00:00:51.420> absolutely

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
thirty percent that's absolutely

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.080 
thirty percent that's absolutely
terrible<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.590> well<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.520> either<00:00:53.610> use<00:00:53.760> on

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
terrible so well you can either use on

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.819 
terrible so well you can either use on
that<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.360> use<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> quick<00:00:55.199> draw<00:00:55.410> or<00:00:55.469> use<00:00:55.710> the

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
that is use of a quick draw or use the

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.529 
that is use of a quick draw or use the
laser<00:00:55.980> sight<00:00:56.309> they'll<00:00:56.670> help<00:00:56.879> improve<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.390> and

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
laser sight they'll help improve it and

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.170 
laser sight they'll help improve it and
it<00:00:57.840> has<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.230> highest<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.920> class<00:00:59.280> mobility<00:00:59.670> so

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it has the highest in class mobility so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.840 
it has the highest in class mobility so
the<00:01:00.300> np11<00:01:00.510> goliath<00:01:00.989> hipfire<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.850> absolutely

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the np11 goliath hipfire is absolutely

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.369 
the np11 goliath hipfire is absolutely
insane<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.570> throw<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> laser<00:01:04.019> sight<00:01:04.350> on

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
insane so if you throw a laser sight on

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.870 
insane so if you throw a laser sight on
there<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.739> going<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.979> be<00:01:05.129> and<00:01:05.339> just

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
there it's going to be and just

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.280 
there it's going to be and just
incredibly<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.049> like<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
incredibly it's going to be like a

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.690 
incredibly it's going to be like a
little<00:01:07.710> laser<00:01:07.920> shooting<00:01:08.340> from<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.580> hip

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
little laser shooting from the hip

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.370 
little laser shooting from the hip
that's<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.180> best<00:01:09.330> part<00:01:09.479> about<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.960> implement

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that's the best part about the implement

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.890 
that's the best part about the implement
lies<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:11.100> class<00:01:11.310> mobility<00:01:11.659> then<00:01:12.659> obviously

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
lies in class mobility then obviously

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.080 
lies in class mobility then obviously
the<00:01:13.229> reload<00:01:13.530> times<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.040> has<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> two-second

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the reload times it has a two-second

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.120 
the reload times it has a two-second
loaded<00:01:15.479> 1.5<00:01:16.140> seconds<00:01:16.530> reloading<00:01:16.890> fast

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
loaded 1.5 seconds reloading fast

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.700 
loaded 1.5 seconds reloading fast
absolutely<00:01:17.759> insane<00:01:18.030> reload<00:01:18.390> time<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.470> gun

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
absolutely insane reload time the gun

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.160 
absolutely insane reload time the gun
comes<00:01:20.009> with<00:01:20.220> 32<00:01:20.580> bolts<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.119> clip<00:01:21.360> 48<00:01:22.049> with

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
ASM one my pins the best gun and that's

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.270 
ASM one my pins the best gun and that's
I'm<00:01:54.899> juice<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.380> has<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> same<00:01:55.799> fires<00:01:56.040> to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280

recommend using it's a foregrip a laser
sight<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.930> long<00:02:35.110> brooks<00:02:35.410> obviously<00:02:35.770> can't

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
sight and a long brooks obviously can't

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.699 
sight and a long brooks obviously can't
use<00:02:36.100> extended<00:02:36.580> mags<00:02:36.790> but<00:02:37.569> with<00:02:37.810> this<00:02:37.989> gun<00:02:38.290> it

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
use extended mags but with this gun it

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.100 
use extended mags but with this gun it
does<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:39.130> 40<00:02:39.850> bolts<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.269> the<00:02:40.300> clip<00:02:40.600> with<00:02:40.989> an

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
does have 40 bolts in the clip with an

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.110 
does have 40 bolts in the clip with an
increased<00:02:41.410> fire<00:02:41.650> rate<00:02:41.860> so<00:02:42.100> with<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.610> 1.3

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
increased fire rate so with the 1.3

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.300 
increased fire rate so with the 1.3
second<00:02:43.480> reload<00:02:43.660> time<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.680> reload<00:02:44.950> pretty

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
second reload time you can reload pretty

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.130 
second reload time you can reload pretty
much<00:02:45.489> instantly<00:02:45.910> with<00:02:46.269> this<00:02:46.450> gun<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:46.959> I<00:02:46.989> mean

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
much instantly with this gun so I mean

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.960 
much instantly with this gun so I mean
you<00:02:47.260> can<00:02:47.410> melt<00:02:47.590> them<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:48.130> to<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.400> guys<00:02:48.550> real<00:02:48.790> oh

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000

is<00:03:02.440> insane<00:03:03.190> and<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:04.120> reloads<00:03:04.420> really<00:03:04.720> really

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
is insane and it reloads really really

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.449 
is insane and it reloads really really
fast<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:05.380> then<00:03:05.440> obviously<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.980> three<00:03:06.220> damage

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
fast and then obviously the three damage

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.180 
fast and then obviously the three damage
increase<00:03:07.200> in<00:03:08.200> my<00:03:08.410> opinion<00:03:08.709> I'm<00:03:08.830> going<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.069> go

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
increase in my opinion I'm going to go

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.490 
increase in my opinion I'm going to go
with<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.519> a.m<00:03:10.239> p11<00:03:10.690> glide<00:03:10.870> here<00:03:11.110> just<00:03:11.319> because

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
with the a.m p11 glide here just because

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.710 
with the a.m p11 glide here just because
I<00:03:11.739> feel<00:03:11.769> like<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.220> negatives<00:03:12.730> on<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.000> k5<00:03:13.480> are

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
I feel like the negatives on the k5 are

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.680 
I feel like the negatives on the k5 are
a<00:03:13.780> lot<00:03:14.140> stronger<00:03:14.799> than<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.730> polemic<00:03:16.120> glide<00:03:16.360> with

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
a lot stronger than a polemic glide with

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.900 
a lot stronger than a polemic glide with
the<00:03:17.350> negative<00:03:17.769> three<00:03:18.160> hands<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.730> can

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
the negative three hands and you can

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.280 
the negative three hands and you can
just<00:03:19.060> do<00:03:19.209> a<00:03:19.239> quick<00:03:19.450> draw<00:03:19.750> in<00:03:19.900> there<00:03:20.079> and<00:03:20.230> the

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
just do a quick draw in there and the

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.630 
just do a quick draw in there and the
quick<00:03:20.530> job<00:03:20.739> will<00:03:20.859> pretty<00:03:21.040> much<00:03:21.130> negate<00:03:21.609> that

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
quick job will pretty much negate that

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.449 
quick job will pretty much negate that
negative<00:03:22.120> 3<00:03:22.299> handling<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.920> obviously<00:03:24.220> use<00:03:24.430> a

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
negative 3 handling and obviously use a

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.069 
negative 3 handling and obviously use a
fork<00:03:24.820> of<00:03:24.940> an<00:03:25.030> extended<00:03:25.329> magazine<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:25.959> the

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
fork of an extended magazine and the

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:27.630 
fork of an extended magazine and the
guns<00:03:26.320> stats<00:03:26.739> in<00:03:26.980> my<00:03:27.100> opinion<00:03:27.340> would<00:03:27.459> better

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
guns stats in my opinion would better

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.729 
guns stats in my opinion would better
than<00:03:27.850> KF<00:03:28.120> five<00:03:28.269> so<00:03:29.019> head-to-head<00:03:29.530> I'm

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
than KF five so head-to-head I'm

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.130 
than KF five so head-to-head I'm
definitely<00:03:30.100> taking<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.700> MP<00:03:31.359> 11<00:03:31.630> glide<00:03:31.840> theory

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
definitely taking the MP 11 glide theory

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.900 
definitely taking the MP 11 glide theory
i<00:03:32.290> think<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.620> k5<00:03:33.100> not<00:03:33.370> being<00:03:33.579> able<00:03:33.670> use

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
i think the k5 not being able use

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.270 
i think the k5 not being able use
extended<00:03:34.420> mags<00:03:34.600> or<00:03:34.780> stock<00:03:35.260> or<00:03:35.530> quick-draw<00:03:36.100> is

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
extended mags or stock or quick-draw is

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.699 
extended mags or stock or quick-draw is
an<00:03:36.430> absolutely<00:03:36.880> terrible<00:03:37.269> trade<00:03:37.690> off<00:03:37.870> for<00:03:38.140> a

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
an absolutely terrible trade off for a

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.710 
an absolutely terrible trade off for a
neck<00:03:39.100> strain<00:03:39.370> fire<00:03:39.670> rate<00:03:39.880> so<00:03:40.030> that's<00:03:40.450> pretty

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
neck strain fire rate so that's pretty

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.090 
neck strain fire rate so that's pretty
much<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:40.959> for<00:03:41.140> this<00:03:41.320> video<00:03:41.500> hopefully<00:03:41.920> you

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
much it for this video hopefully you

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.319
