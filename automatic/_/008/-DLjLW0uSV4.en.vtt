what<00:04:15.560> kind<00:04:15.709> of<00:04:15.769> track<00:04:16.010> is<00:04:16.039> it<00:04:16.780> well<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:17.810> see<00:04:18.680> I

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
what kind of track is it well I see I

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.199 
what kind of track is it well I see I
immediately<00:04:19.400> thought<00:04:19.669> back<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.030> old

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
immediately thought back to the old

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:21.460 
immediately thought back to the old
track<00:04:20.450> but<00:04:20.630> obviously<00:04:20.959> there's<00:04:21.109> been<00:04:21.139> some

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
track but obviously there's been some

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.900 
track but obviously there's been some
developments<00:04:21.950> last<00:04:22.160> year<00:04:22.460> was<00:04:22.639> the<00:04:22.760> first

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
developments last year was the first

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.240 
developments last year was the first
time<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.780> know<00:04:24.770> we<00:04:24.889> raced<00:04:25.789> on<00:04:25.970> 73<00:04:26.870> 300<00:04:27.440> now

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
time you know we raced on 73 300 now

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.860 
time you know we raced on 73 300 now
it's<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.610> very<00:04:28.789> different<00:04:29.000> beast<00:04:29.389> to<00:04:29.660> what<00:04:29.780> it

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
it's a very different beast to what it

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.360 
it's a very different beast to what it
was<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.200> still<00:04:30.380> got<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:30.889> know<00:04:30.979> certain

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
was it still got that you know certain

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.710 
was it still got that you know certain
characters<00:04:31.729> of<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:31.880> old<00:04:32.000> track<00:04:32.270> we've<00:04:32.450> still

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
characters of the old track we've still

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.080 
characters of the old track we've still
got<00:04:32.930> here<00:04:33.440> the<00:04:33.590> big<00:04:33.740> on<00:04:33.860> back<00:04:34.070> straight<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.910> X

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
got here the big on back straight the X

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.750 
got here the big on back straight the X
is<00:04:35.270> bomb<00:04:35.570> whole<00:04:35.810> quorum<00:04:36.380> but<00:04:37.130> it<00:04:37.250> changes<00:04:37.700> a

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
is bomb whole quorum but it changes a

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.750 
is bomb whole quorum but it changes a
lot<00:04:37.970> from<00:04:38.180> there<00:04:38.389> you<00:04:38.479> know<00:04:38.599> quorum<00:04:38.990> Titans

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
lot from there you know quorum Titans

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.339 
lot from there you know quorum Titans
and<00:04:40.760> then<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.599> know<00:04:41.720> we've<00:04:41.840> got<00:04:41.960> that<00:04:42.080> big

00:04:42.339 --> 00:04:42.349 
and then you know we've got that big

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.900 
and then you know we've got that big
long<00:04:42.590> straight<00:04:42.889> up<00:04:43.039> pastures<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.669> start

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
long straight up pastures to start

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.730 
long straight up pastures to start
finish<00:04:44.240> straight<00:04:44.419> into<00:04:44.780> riches<00:04:45.440> which<00:04:45.590> is<00:04:45.710> a

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
finish straight into riches which is a

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.980 
finish straight into riches which is a
fantastic<00:04:46.250> corner<00:04:46.849> really<00:04:47.060> quick<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:47.930> then

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
fantastic corner really quick and then

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.170 
fantastic corner really quick and then
it<00:04:48.380> changes<00:04:48.680> again<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.099> it's<00:04:49.220> all<00:04:49.340> quite<00:04:49.610> tit

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
it changes again and it's all quite tit

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.240 
it changes again and it's all quite tit
twit<00:04:50.599> twisty<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:50.960> technical<00:04:51.500> so<00:04:51.650> it's<00:04:52.130> a

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
twit twisty and technical so it's a

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.180 
twit twisty and technical so it's a
circuit<00:04:52.699> where<00:04:53.650> well<00:04:54.650> I<00:04:54.680> think<00:04:54.800> it<00:04:55.070> would<00:04:55.160> be

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
circuit where well I think it would be

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.270 
circuit where well I think it would be
great<00:04:55.520> for<00:04:55.550> a<00:04:55.789> fright<00:04:56.150> car<00:04:57.039> you<00:04:58.039> know<00:04:58.190> and

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
great for a fright car you know and

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.890 
great for a fright car you know and
that's<00:04:58.430> on<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.760> assumption<00:04:59.270> we<00:04:59.539> get<00:04:59.720> our

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
that's on the assumption we get our

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.279 
that's on the assumption we get our
development<00:05:00.410> going<00:05:00.650> the<00:05:00.710> right<00:05:00.860> way<00:05:00.919> and<00:05:02.289> I

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
development going the right way and I

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.960 
development going the right way and I
think<00:05:03.320> it's<00:05:03.680> it's<00:05:04.099> going<00:05:04.370> to<00:05:04.430> produce<00:05:04.610> some

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
think it's it's going to produce some

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.000 
think it's it's going to produce some
great<00:05:05.210> racing<00:05:05.389> you<00:05:05.690> know<00:05:05.810> what<00:05:05.960> since<00:05:06.889> it

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
great racing you know what since it

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.409 
great racing you know what since it
always<00:05:07.310> does<00:05:07.460> a<00:05:07.490> habit<00:05:07.849> if<00:05:07.970> the<00:05:08.120> weather's

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
always does a habit if the weather's
