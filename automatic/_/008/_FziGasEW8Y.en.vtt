00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.320
 I'm still a little sick 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.840
 and I am almost their whole tall now 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.160
 week it just doesn't stop 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.559
 then the cold starts again 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.020
 nausea you get a headache again 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.690
 then you get a fever then you get 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.090
 sniffing again then you get coughing again 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.899

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.739
 is not nice but good I am now again 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.750
 a bit better 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.000
 I went to the Ardennes with Romy 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.940
 was great fun 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.609
 I was away from Friday to Monday 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.750
 so I came back today 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.489
 at around 11 am on cumbersome and I thought after 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.619
 have a very long walk there 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.479
 done on the weekend I also filmed 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.049
 and I also have some nice pictures there 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.700
 shot 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.909
 it was incredibly fun with whole 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.880
 family had been on rowie's side 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.270
 32 hot man in a cottage and it was 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.310
 eat lots of delicious things and 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.409
 enjoy walking enjoy the view 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.939
 because you want to have a vacation ever 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.890
 and I had hoped that my 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.259
 being sick a bit went over but that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.299
 is not gone so I am still 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.619
 a little bit back in the bit 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.930
 arugula 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.350
 yes but we don't want to breathe 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.060
 by 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.200
 we just go through a handful of topics and 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.030
 I have a letter here 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.880
 written and that is roller coaster 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.970
 tycoon world and the trailer came from and 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.950
 everyone angry and I don't know what anymore 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.560
 I have to say about this trailer 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.740
 he was terrible he was bad 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.189
 he was he was horrific he broke 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.710
 was demolishing nervously he was used to 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.909
 terribly bad 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.729
 you got him in more cancers that left 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.470
 but I'm going to make a video about it 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.879
 a day or two or three 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.840
 is there a video on my channel I have 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.569
 already made it 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.910
 He will definitely keep an eye on it 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.080
 a video with logic there is none 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.060
 logic in that trailer 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.920
 and I will explain that in the video so I 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.540
 stop hearing the subject now 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:31.680
 coaster tycoon world is just weird 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.450
 yes mom grubbing now watch a series that 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.569
 he that prison break that is the 4 one 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.910
 series that we watch namely small lot 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.200
 walking dead game or thrones and 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.150
 prison break 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.099
 4 together it's a bit 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.180
 confusing but it succeeds 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.950
 game or there for almost a year 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.329
 nothing to be heard 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.799
 but there will be a season name we have to 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.750
 just wait in April I believe 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.000
 though it starts again and again 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.410
 by me sick I less I 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.629
 start talking about being sick again 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.819
 so I'm going to subject subjects 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.799
 third series prison break is definitely one 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.950
 highly recommended we are almost at 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.769
 season 2 out of 4 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.750
 and if then if there is a cm past then 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.160
 we go to the next one in that becomes the 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.040
 marvel 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.880
 agents of shield from the advertising 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 I here for series after generally known 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.120
 so you just do n't look for it 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.620
 i yes i think this is a nice one 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.660
 video was i don't have a cup i still have 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.359
 always in t i have enough tea 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.250
 drunk during the Ardennes trip I 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.579
 have a fun and that is important 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.560
 I'm back in my hole I'm going 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.599
 make some videos for you again 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.910
 and soon I can visit 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.109
 to a new amusement park 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.489
 The Netherlands 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:47.400
 that is very special i think it is very 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.069
 great I can be present as a press at 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.840
 the amusement park jumbo 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.849
 so keep an eye on my channel then go 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.200
 I make a report of it and then 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.630
 you also get more information about it 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.650
 the amusement park itself what you do afterwards 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.200
 can do exactly 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.940
 what attractions to be and everything on and 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.700
