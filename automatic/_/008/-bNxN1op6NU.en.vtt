I<00:00:54.719> don't<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:55.940> we<00:00:56.940> were<00:00:57.059> shooting<00:00:57.239> at<00:00:57.449> a

I don't know we were shooting at a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.660 
I don't know we were shooting at a
distance<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.079> only<00:00:58.260> about<00:00:58.680> 20<00:00:59.129> yards<00:00:59.489> or

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
distance of only about 20 yards or

approximately<00:01:00.600> 18<00:01:01.050> meters<00:01:01.500> away<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:03.170> that's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
approximately 18 meters away and that's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.350 
approximately 18 meters away and that's
such<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> close<00:01:05.040> distance<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:06.000> really

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
such a close distance you really

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.789 
such a close distance you really
wouldn't<00:01:06.570> even<00:01:06.659> have<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.900> aim<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.470> hit<00:01:07.590> this

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
wouldn't even have to aim to hit this

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.850 
wouldn't even have to aim to hit this
thing<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> normal<00:01:08.580> round<00:01:09.439> now<00:01:10.439> we've<00:01:10.619> seen

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
thing with a normal round now we've seen

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.620 
thing with a normal round now we've seen
weird<00:01:11.220> things<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.939> before<00:01:12.210> with

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
weird things like this before with

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.469 
weird things like this before with
lightweight<00:01:13.100> projectiles<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.479> probably

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
lightweight projectiles and probably

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.730 
lightweight projectiles and probably
what's<00:01:15.630> happening<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> rounds<00:01:16.560> own

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
what's happening is the rounds own

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.460 
what's happening is the rounds own
shockwave<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.729> hitting<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.900> plate<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
shockwave is hitting that plate and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.770 
shockwave is hitting that plate and
actually<00:01:19.979> pushing<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> projectile<00:01:21.060> around

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
actually pushing the projectile around

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.469 
actually pushing the projectile around
the<00:01:22.380> plate<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.549> really<00:01:23.970> weird<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the plate and it's just really weird to

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
the plate and it's just really weird to
see<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.960> happening<00:01:31.130> now<00:01:32.130> we'll<00:01:32.280> move<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
see that happening now we'll move the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.230 
see that happening now we'll move the
target<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.150> about<00:01:33.479> 10<00:01:33.960> yards<00:01:34.619> away<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.729> we'll

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
target to about 10 yards away and we'll

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.100 
target to about 10 yards away and we'll
see<00:01:36.390> if<00:01:36.450> we<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.689> hit<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.020> time<00:01:38.930> there<00:01:39.930> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
see if we can hit it this time there you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.080 
see if we can hit it this time there you
go<00:01:41.150> fragmentation

wave reflections and all that stuff the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.240 
wave reflections and all that stuff the
good<00:02:28.690> news<00:02:28.870> is<00:02:29.080> we<00:02:29.290> recovered<00:02:29.860> one<00:02:30.070> of<00:02:30.160> the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
good news is we recovered one of the

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.250 
good news is we recovered one of the
rounds<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.850> you<00:02:31.360> can<00:02:31.510> see<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:32.050> it<00:02:32.230> actually

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
rounds and you can see that it actually

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.470 
rounds and you can see that it actually
survived<00:02:33.100> it's<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.910> little<00:02:34.300> bit<00:02:34.390> of

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
survived it's just a little bit of

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.979 
survived it's just a little bit of
damage<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.209> thought<00:02:37.780> it<00:02:37.900> would

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
damage and it I thought it would

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.199 
damage and it I thought it would
probably<00:02:38.170> shatter<00:02:38.590> or<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.280> target<00:02:40.090> would

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
probably shatter or the target would

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.530 
probably shatter or the target would
shatter<00:02:41.489> if<00:02:42.489> you<00:02:42.550> want<00:02:42.730> a<00:02:42.790> little<00:02:42.940> souvenir

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
shatter if you want a little souvenir
