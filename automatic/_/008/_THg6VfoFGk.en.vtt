 Minecraft graphics but in sui suter 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.589
 commented to the author and but notice that 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.390
 we have three game modes we can 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.309

 with our friends or we can play 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.710
 in a local game through our 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.149
 local wireless network we have a mode 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.219
 campaign where we are going to have to overcome 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.530
 different very interesting missions 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.330
 especially to get to the depth 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.330
 of this video game where we have as 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.670
 you see a lot of maps to play 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.930
 in each of them I will teach you 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.550
 a little bit how the game works 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.040
 so you can see the graphics and such in the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.380
 survival mode because we have a mode of 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.810
 survival where we have to be in 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.220
 this sand and survive waves of 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.720
 enemies notice that this is the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.280
 shooter in the purest style 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.020
 but as I say with graphics of 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.190
 minecraft fix that we are going 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.570
 appearing a bunch of zombies 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.340
 we simply have to annihilate you 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.050
 as you are watching and meanwhile 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.910
 we have to go pick up the objects that 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.979
 we are appearing around here we have 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.810
 to overcome wave after wave in this 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.830
 great video game as I tell you if you 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.150
 like ions 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.770
 I think this video game is going to 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.420
 love and especially if you are 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.000
 familiar and you like mostly 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.840
 play minecraft I recommend it and 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.840
 we continue 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.000
 good guys girls let's continue 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.310
 with an exquisite application for it 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.080
 is that it is called and soul is an application 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.750
 to manage our favorite series 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.490
 is an application for fans of the 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.049
 TV series will get us 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.360
 there because it gives us so many 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.160
 options to fix that we're going to go to 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.319
 the settings to customize this 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.480
 application we can see the series in 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.640
 list view or in poster view 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.080
 look expensive we are in the list of posters 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.459
 let's go to the list to see what is 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.900
 it is here to notice that it is very 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.610
 Customizable we can change the color 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.110
 we can change all these 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.640
 options that you are seeing here and 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.930
 then we can even make a backup of 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.390
 our series is something very interesting 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.130
 so as not to lose track of where 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.569
 we go because for me I think it's in 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.830
 the application is this kind of 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.450
 applications I like for that to 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.459
 know in what chapter I have been 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.019
 let's see a little cooking we have 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.550
 notice that I have here put two 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.170
 series but if we want to add more 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.000
 series we give the button in addition 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.560
 typical what from here we can look for 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.180
 by the name of the series or else fixed 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.040
 that we can search for in the series 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.440
 most popular like this one when we go to 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.019
 take any one for example this one 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.880
 marbles and notice that we would have it here 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.250
 us doing the usual in any 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.230
 series we will be able to mark it as seen 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.360
 Of course we will also be able to eliminate 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.060
 the series or tell him to tell us 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.680
 when new episodes of 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.420

 thrones of this great series with 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.510
 I recommend to see if you do not know her. 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.670
 that we have gotten into it to 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.410
 start let's see here a synopsis and 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.620
 how can we go and see all the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.440
 data on the web of imc see better web I think 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.090
 I film and television series and 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.980
 then note that in this little button of 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.900
 here when we press it we will see a 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.580
 list of all chapters that have been 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.010
 issued and best of all is that 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.660
 we can mark then that we have 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.580
 seen any chapter this way 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.739
 we just touch it and when it appears 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.450
 the eye in red is that this chapter already 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:44.220
 we've seen it we can get into this 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.800

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.570
 we can choose any of them and 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.180
 note that here we are going to see a little 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.670
 nor mdb who is this actress where has 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.070
 participated and such an application as os 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.540
 I say to keep all 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.480
 your television series 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.489
 we continue 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.140
 good guys let's finish with a 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.569
 application for it is that it's called 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.159
 shop videos super interesting for all 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.620
 those that you want to edit yours 

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:14.810
 home videos your photographs in 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.850
 a single montage with background music with 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.280
 transitions with themes an application 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.500
 super powerful to create your videos 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.030
 mounts is called video shop we are going to 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.650
 get in the application to see that 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.720
 to begin click on the little button 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.460
 more and we give to album or camera 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.139
 if we want to take pictures or videos 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.729
 at this very moment I'm going to catch 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.770
 things on the reel and notice that we can 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.960
 catch it all videos or only 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.789
 pictures let's go to video let's go 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.710
 to go here and notice that we are going to leave 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.300
 everything and let's go here we give to 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.770
 it's good to see that you have already loaded it 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.449
 he has done it quite quickly and here we 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.940
 let's find with the interface 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.800
 edition is very simple to use for 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.900
 start we go to the settings and from 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.970
 here we can define a maximum time 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.500
 because this is very interesting we can 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.060
 make videos to upload them to dance 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.199
 instagram or where we want already 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.090
 you know there is a time limitation 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.800
 in instagram for example are 16 seconds 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.510
 and we from here we could define 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.699
 then the maximum time we want 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.260
 use for our good assembly 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:08.330
 see what we can select a clip 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.000
 of video and give it reverse 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.500
 invest the video and start with 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.720
 the end and finish by the beginning 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.680
 we can copy we can move as you see 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.460
 all the clips that we have 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.080
 selected 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.449
 we can add transitions for example 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.590
 it is here to notice that one thing that 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.719
 like it a lot we can add 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.370
 slow motion effects from here 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.229
 we define the video space where 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.030
 we want it to be applied in slow motion and 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.379
 here we define the speed at which 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.120
 we want you to go we can tell you that 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:33.860
 go in slow motion or in fast motion if 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.750
 we want it to go a tad faster 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.699
 we can add text about what is 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.169
 pretty simple we simply put what 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.180
 we want to put text 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:42.620
 for example and this we could move and 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.539
 give the duration the duration that 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.919
 we would like something that 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.990
 I like it very much that we can 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:49.520
 go to a certain part, look for that 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.620
 we have the dance and performance indicators 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.479
 instagram and fix that with the little button 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.400
 of voice we could add a note of 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.870
 voice in this video in such a way that 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.370
 we could hide it if we are 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.379
 editing a video for youtube 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.539
 example from this very application 

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:04.370
 powerful we can choose a video give to 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.719
 cut out and something that I really like is the 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.210
 theme of music we can select 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:10.250
 music from our reel with this 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.110
 native music music application 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.340
 which is predefined in the system or 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.090
 well we can search for any channel 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:19.410
 note that we put for example metallic 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.910
 metallic and fix that we're going to give to 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.100
 search and we will look for all the 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.750
 songs that we have on itunes we can 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.570
 buy the song to put it whole or 

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:29.430
 well we can select the previous clip 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.780
 of 30 seconds and put it here as 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:32.610
 you are watching you notice that here 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.290
 we have and we can move it where we 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.030
 we want to start sounding the 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.860
 music here good little bit more 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.180
 we can simply select and delete 

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.010
 Well, any clip that we 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.900
 let's think that it does not fit for the reason 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.760
 let's give it to next to render 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.919
 the video is good since finished 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.750
 reedit the video as simple as 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.979
 now choose one of the themes or one of 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.080
 the filters that we want 

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:54.060
 apply for example let's apply this 

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.410
 filter here and we're going to take this topic 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.510
 from here in such a way that we 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.910
 we would put a title let's leave it such 

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.740
 which would an author put our name 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.330
 let's put us to appear in 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.669
 the credits set that then 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.050
 we would put a place for example if 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.580
 we are in a certain city we have 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.200
 made a holiday video then 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.880
 we could put it here the text that 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.350
 we want and then nothing 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.760
 simply when we have it we can 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:17.729
 play it to see how it's running 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.320
 look at the pimp you see with the 

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:20.820
 topics that we will be able to choose 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.220
 let's go for a walk 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.770
 finally we can share this 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:27.300
 video has already reused on the reel what 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.210
 we can upload to youtube send by email 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.910
 upload to facebook to dance or to Instagram 

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:34.710
 in the quality that we want a 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.450
 application to edit super videos 

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.220
 super powerful guys and girls that you 

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.080

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.490
 that authentic wonders good here 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.230
 dismissal I hope you liked the 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.430
 today's video has been shorter shorter 

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.290
 of the usual have been other applications 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.480
 but I at least have the commitment 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.860
 to recommend the applications that to me 

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.440
 I like the best applications 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.760
 for my taste on offer and for free so 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.620
 this is what we have for today 

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.360
