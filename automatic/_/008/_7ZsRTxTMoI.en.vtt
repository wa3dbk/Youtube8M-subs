pretty good built-in video stabilization
but<00:01:57.000> if<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.180> want<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.390> get<00:01:57.479> more<00:01:57.630> fluid<00:01:58.020> motion

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
but if you want to get more fluid motion

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.910 
but if you want to get more fluid motion
you<00:01:58.799> can<00:01:58.950> use<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.909> Moto<00:02:00.149> Study<00:02:00.920> believe

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
you can use this the Moto Study believe

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.859 
you can use this the Moto Study believe
it<00:02:02.040> or<00:02:02.130> not<00:02:02.219> this<00:02:02.820> thing<00:02:02.880> folds<00:02:03.420> out<00:02:03.540> to<00:02:03.780> be

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
it or not this thing folds out to be

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.190 
it or not this thing folds out to be
used<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> Steadicam<00:02:05.810> once<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.930> make<00:02:07.079> the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
used like a Steadicam once you make the

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.740 
used like a Steadicam once you make the
right<00:02:07.320> adjustments<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.910> weighted<00:02:09.270> arm<00:02:09.420> acts

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
right adjustments the weighted arm acts

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.930 
right adjustments the weighted arm acts
like<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> counterbalance<00:02:10.770> keeping<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.730> camera

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
like a counterbalance keeping the camera

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.360 
like a counterbalance keeping the camera
level<00:02:12.360> at<00:02:12.540> all

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
level at all

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.369 
level at all
resulting<00:02:14.209> in<00:02:14.269> smooth<00:02:14.599> motions<00:02:15.080> in<00:02:15.260> your

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
resulting in smooth motions in your

video<00:02:21.670> using<00:02:22.670> a<00:02:22.970> weighted<00:02:23.180> stabilizer

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
video using a weighted stabilizer

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.140 
video using a weighted stabilizer
definitely<00:02:24.440> takes<00:02:24.650> some<00:02:24.830> practice<00:02:25.040> but<00:02:26.030> if

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
definitely takes some practice but if

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.390 
definitely takes some practice but if
you<00:02:26.239> want<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.450> more<00:02:26.629> sturdy<00:02:26.900> solution<00:02:27.500> there's

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
you want a more sturdy solution there's

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.520 
you want a more sturdy solution there's
another<00:02:28.640> mode<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.750> can<00:02:29.930> flip<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.290> thing

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
another mode you can flip this thing

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.410 
another mode you can flip this thing
around<00:02:30.680> and<00:02:31.220> use<00:02:32.060> this<00:02:32.269> as<00:02:32.599> a<00:02:33.290> chest<00:02:33.680> pod<00:02:34.420> this

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
around and use this as a chest pod this

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.420 
around and use this as a chest pod this
is<00:02:35.599> also<00:02:35.780> a<00:02:35.930> very<00:02:36.260> effective<00:02:36.410> way<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.160> holding

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
is also a very effective way and holding

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.300 
is also a very effective way and holding
the<00:02:37.519> camera<00:02:37.819> steady<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:39.620> if<00:02:39.980> that's<00:02:40.099> not

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
the camera steady and if that's not

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.240 
the camera steady and if that's not
enough<00:02:40.400> for<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.819> it<00:02:41.569> doesn't<00:02:41.750> stop<00:02:42.079> there<00:02:42.349> the

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
enough for you it doesn't stop there the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.059 
enough for you it doesn't stop there the
grip<00:02:43.549> also<00:02:43.790> splits<00:02:44.239> out<00:02:44.390> into<00:02:44.629> a<00:02:44.659> tripod<00:02:45.200> it

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
grip also splits out into a tripod it

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.490 
grip also splits out into a tripod it
can<00:02:46.250> be<00:02:46.340> propped<00:02:46.640> on<00:02:46.760> a<00:02:46.879> table<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:47.420> aimed<00:02:48.260> with
