quit the game and load the game

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:28.620 
quit the game and load the game
regularly<00:04:24.330> without<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.660> bypass<00:04:27.300> so<00:04:28.300> quick

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
regularly without the bypass so quick

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:37.020 
regularly without the bypass so quick
game<00:04:33.120> and<00:04:34.770> I<00:04:35.770> think<00:04:36.190> I<00:04:36.250> already<00:04:36.280> said<00:04:36.700> but<00:04:36.850> yeah

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
game and I think I already said but yeah

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.270 
game and I think I already said but yeah
this<00:04:37.330> this<00:04:37.690> bypass<00:04:38.110> doing<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.650> bypass<00:04:39.010> in

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
this this bypass doing the bypass in

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.520 
this this bypass doing the bypass in
this<00:04:39.400> manner<00:04:39.640> will<00:04:40.300> pretty<00:04:40.570> much<00:04:40.660> bypass<00:04:41.320> the

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
this manner will pretty much bypass the

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.020 
this manner will pretty much bypass the
patches<00:04:41.890> on<00:04:42.010> any<00:04:42.190> game<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.490> they've<00:04:42.790> patched

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
patches on any game that they've patched

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.400 
patches on any game that they've patched
because<00:04:43.480> the<00:04:43.600> patches<00:04:43.960> are<00:04:44.080> held<00:04:44.260> in<00:04:44.350> your

because the patches are held in your

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.020 
because the patches are held in your
utility<00:04:44.740> data<00:04:45.100> and<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:48.550> know<00:04:48.610> when<00:04:48.760> you<00:04:48.850> do

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
utility data and you know when you do

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
this bypass it starts the game past the

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.300 
this bypass it starts the game past the
point<00:04:52.570> where<00:04:52.960> the<00:04:53.110> utility<00:04:53.590> data<00:04:53.800> actually

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
takes effect and loads so therefore any

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.090 
takes effect and loads so therefore any
