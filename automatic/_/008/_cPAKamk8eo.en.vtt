00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.050
 that the company does a certain 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.840
 time and he has some that have 500 thousand

 he does it several times a day and it's so good 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.579
 finally he made a video saying that he 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.219
 I would like to recruit some in October 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.750

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.629

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.629
 I went there and left my comment that you 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.879
 should be seeing there then let's read one 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.280
 comment or it occupies and has a channel 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.619
 which has just reached 35 thousand subscribers and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.229
 is focused on the so-called games of the future 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.060
 like skylanders and always disinfect 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.490
 I say I 'm wrong and October is Brazil. 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.290
 it is from this game simply because 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.430
 there are almost no other YouTube 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.220

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.860
