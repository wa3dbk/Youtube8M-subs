of my own energy to make Porter's and
making<00:00:47.039> those<00:00:47.160> Porter's<00:00:47.640> will<00:00:47.940> make<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.600> give

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
making those Porter's will make it give

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.020 
making those Porter's will make it give
me<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> ability<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.920> Bank<00:00:50.489> things<00:00:50.820> without

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
actually banking them they automatically

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.340

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
level that I'm at for the concentrated

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.090 
level that I'm at for the concentrated
gold<00:01:02.789> deposits<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> living<00:01:04.470> Rock<00:01:04.650> camryn

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.750 
gold deposits and the living Rock camryn
so<00:01:05.479> what<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.510> decided<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.229> was<00:01:08.070> try<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> get

that<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:12.810> shit<00:01:13.049> ton<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.860> was

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
that is going to be a shit ton and I was

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.789 
that is going to be a shit ton and I was
actually<00:01:14.189> able<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.820> get<00:01:15.030> over<00:01:15.439> as<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.619> can

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
actually able to get over as you can

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.370 
actually able to get over as you can
keep<00:01:17.100> an<00:01:17.250> eye<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.640> radiant<00:01:18.240> energy<00:01:18.570> down

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
keep an eye on the radiant energy down

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.859 
keep an eye on the radiant energy down
in<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.530> bottom<00:01:19.830> left<00:01:20.009> corner<00:01:20.100> over<00:01:20.869> 100k

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
in the bottom left corner over 100k

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.710 
in the bottom left corner over 100k
radiant<00:01:22.619> energy<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:24.060> was<00:01:24.180> able<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.360> convert

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
radiant energy and I was able to convert

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.810 
radiant energy and I was able to convert
those<00:01:24.840> all<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.290> porters<00:01:25.680> so<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.430> about<00:01:26.580> one

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
those all to porters so it's about one

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.510 
those all to porters so it's about one
point<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.479> point<00:01:28.229> eight<00:01:28.439> K<00:01:28.710> Porter's<00:01:29.250> which

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
point one point eight K Porter's which

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.780 
point one point eight K Porter's which
equals<00:01:29.909> about<00:01:30.030> forty<00:01:30.630> thousand<00:01:31.460> gold<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.579> that

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
equals about forty thousand gold or that

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.219 
equals about forty thousand gold or that
little<00:01:32.880> deposit<00:01:33.450> for<00:01:33.659> me<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.110> pretty

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
little deposit for me so it's pretty

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.590 
little deposit for me so it's pretty
awesome<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.579> does<00:01:35.759> take<00:01:36.000> me<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> lot<00:01:36.390> longer

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
awesome and it does take me a lot longer

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.999 
awesome and it does take me a lot longer
to<00:01:36.780> get<00:01:36.930> these<00:01:37.079> divination<00:01:37.500> levels

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
to get these divination levels

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.480 
to get these divination levels
considering<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.880> am<00:01:39.150> just<00:01:39.479> using<00:01:39.869> the

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
considering that I am just using the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.830 
considering that I am just using the
experience<00:01:41.490> method<00:01:41.939> I'm<00:01:42.060> not<00:01:42.210> actually<00:01:42.450> using

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
experience method I'm not actually using

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.440 
experience method I'm not actually using
enhanced<00:01:43.590> experience<00:01:43.829> where<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.340> put<00:01:44.939> energies

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
enhanced experience where I put energies

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.660 
enhanced experience where I put energies
and<00:01:45.750> convert<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.530> into<00:01:46.740> extra<00:01:47.250> experience

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
and convert that into extra experience

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.999 
and convert that into extra experience
as<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.060> would<00:01:48.240> be<00:01:48.390> able<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.320> also<00:01:49.860> I've<00:01:49.979> been

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
as I would be able to and also I've been

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
for that so I was able to get 95 div

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.590 
for that so I was able to get 95 div
which<00:02:28.710> Keeble<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.730> gave<00:02:29.940> me<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.210> ability<00:02:30.300> to

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
which Keeble it gave me the ability to

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.770 
which Keeble it gave me the ability to
go<00:02:30.810> to<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.960> 95<00:02:31.410> spot<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:31.980> so<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.030> XP<00:02:33.330> definitely

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
go to a 95 spot and so the XP definitely

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.730 
go to a 95 spot and so the XP definitely
picked<00:02:33.990> up<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.730> it's<00:02:35.730> very<00:02:36.390> afk<00:02:37.020> because<00:02:37.470> the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
picked up and it's very afk because the

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.950 
picked up and it's very afk because the
spots<00:02:38.310> are<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:38.700> close<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.150> each<00:02:39.210> other<00:02:39.450> and

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
spots are so close to each other and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.410 
spots are so close to each other and
actually<00:02:40.260> got<00:02:40.410> 89<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.130> 90<00:02:41.700> herb-lore<00:02:42.060> today

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
actually got 89 and 90 herb-lore today

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.200 
actually got 89 and 90 herb-lore today
so<00:02:42.480> there's<00:02:42.840> another<00:02:43.080> level<00:02:43.350> at<00:02:43.680> 90<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.280> herb

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
so there's another level at 90 and herb

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.720 
so there's another level at 90 and herb
to<00:02:45.510> me<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.750> a<00:02:45.840> big<00:02:46.430> accomplishment<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.490> get<00:02:47.640> up

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.120 
and so I ended up doing fate of the gods
which<00:05:35.010> was<00:05:35.250> a<00:05:35.280> huge<00:05:35.760> step<00:05:36.060> for<00:05:36.090> me<00:05:37.100> doing<00:05:38.100> like

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
which was a huge step for me doing like

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.480 
which was a huge step for me doing like
an<00:05:38.520> actual<00:05:39.330> quest<00:05:39.810> that<00:05:40.110> isn't<00:05:40.710> that<00:05:41.190> easy

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
an actual quest that isn't that easy

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.029 
an actual quest that isn't that easy
it's<00:05:41.820> not<00:05:41.970> very<00:05:42.030> general<00:05:42.780> so<00:05:43.020> I<00:05:43.229> was<00:05:43.889> really

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
it's not very general so I was really

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.620 
it's not very general so I was really
excited<00:05:44.280> to<00:05:44.520> get<00:05:44.639> that<00:05:44.789> done<00:05:44.970> so<00:05:45.240> now<00:05:45.360> I<00:05:45.389> can

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
excited to get that done so now I can

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.659 
excited to get that done so now I can
use<00:05:45.660> the<00:05:45.930> nightmare<00:05:46.349> must<00:05:46.650> be'<00:05:46.860> so<00:05:47.520> which
