00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.030
 collection of spring and Shenzhen 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:32.580
 Here are a galaxy ray on May 5 mayline 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:37.010
 shenzhen it's a simple 1 5 or 6 mhz and 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.010
 I'm told it's not a quad core 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:58.950
 it's downright 5 here is the interface 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.090
 but by then 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.270
 I'll try to put it in 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.270
 French or English 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.840
 magna 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.520
 who denigrated as always with 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.520
 a lot of application 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.040
 13 megapixels 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500
 at 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.840
 2 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.400
 marty 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:03:01.870
 the screen is and ubs 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:03:03.630
 and he has a good quality it looks like that 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:08.760
 will say m 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.760
 we will see if the videos in full hd 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:49.850
 basically a final with life in full 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.850
 hd 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.610
 I'm going to do is I'm going 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.610
 install in all 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.980
 some 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.790
 a version 4 jitter 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.789
 within 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.520
 in terms of testing is almost 10 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:54.170
 included 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.170
 the brand and android 4.4 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:10.159
 4500 in 3d it's still when 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.849
 not bad what that is without being a vcore 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:13.849
 it's a good body weight 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.139
 full hd 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.680
 that's what a very young year I do not know 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.029
 not if reality like that I think that 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.919
 we kill everything to some problems because 

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:43.979
 that yes nico it's an adreno but it's 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:53.120
 a qualcomm processor the slow where all 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:53.120
 is soaked by the brother of the phone
