yeah now let's talk about the knowledge

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.730 
yeah now let's talk about the knowledge
of<00:06:05.509> break<00:06:05.660> now<00:06:05.840> with<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.139> equipment<00:06:06.470> you<00:06:06.710> see

of break now with the equipment you see

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.379 
of break now with the equipment you see
the<00:06:07.009> classic<00:06:07.370> techniques<00:06:07.789> you<00:06:07.940> got<00:06:08.090> the<00:06:08.210> rain

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
the classic techniques you got the rain

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:10.210 
the classic techniques you got the rain
mixer<00:06:08.930> I<00:06:09.169> mean<00:06:09.380> you<00:06:09.470> know<00:06:09.590> I<00:06:09.710> just<00:06:09.949> keep<00:06:10.070> it

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
mixer I mean you know I just keep it

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:11.660 
basic man me that's that's what I

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.540 
basic man me that's that's what I
started<00:06:12.110> on<00:06:12.199> not<00:06:12.440> the<00:06:12.560> rain<00:06:12.770> mixer<00:06:13.160> of<00:06:13.280> course

tools and knows where the tools and then

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.180 
tools and knows where the tools and then
once<00:06:23.419> the<00:06:23.570> computer<00:06:23.990> became<00:06:24.380> the<00:06:24.560> thing<00:06:24.800> all

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
once the computer became the thing all

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.550 
once the computer became the thing all
this<00:06:25.729> does<00:06:26.000> for<00:06:26.300> me<00:06:26.510> and<00:06:26.840> what<00:06:26.960> program<00:06:27.380> isn't
