switch this we now is going to drop down
to<00:03:30.980> this<00:03:31.189> thing<00:03:31.430> this<00:03:32.209> guy<00:03:32.450> not<00:03:32.629> only<00:03:32.689> was<00:03:32.989> a

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
to this thing this guy not only was a

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.099 
to this thing this guy not only was a
switching<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:34.040> front<00:03:34.489> of<00:03:34.609> me<00:03:34.730> six<00:03:35.120> here<00:03:35.420> here

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
switching in front of me six here here

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.009 
switching in front of me six here here
here<00:03:36.829> see<00:03:37.189> so<00:03:37.370> it's<00:03:37.459> almost<00:03:37.670> similar<00:03:38.389> to<00:03:38.689> doing

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
here see so it's almost similar to doing

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.099 
here see so it's almost similar to doing
this<00:03:39.230> but<00:03:40.040> this<00:03:40.519> is<00:03:40.579> not<00:03:40.910> me<00:03:41.180> not<00:03:41.690> switching

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
this but this is not me not switching

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.140 
this but this is not me not switching
this<00:03:42.709> is<00:03:42.829> not<00:03:42.980> switching<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.579> clean<00:03:43.819> your<00:03:43.970> head

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
this is not switching is clean your head

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.110 
this is not switching is clean your head
on<00:03:44.299> both<00:03:44.480> sides<00:03:44.810> but<00:03:45.620> he<00:03:45.859> is<00:03:46.699> getting<00:03:46.970> his<00:03:47.030> head

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
on both sides but he is getting his head

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.270 
on both sides but he is getting his head
