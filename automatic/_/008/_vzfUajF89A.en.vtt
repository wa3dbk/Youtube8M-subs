00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:11.460
 Hi there, this is a fight on the map and 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.330
 Today we will talk about the tank leopard 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.270
 prototype 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.940
 or abbreviated pt leopard is German 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.770
 medium tank level 9 he investigated 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.110
 after indian-panzer and that i already 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.110
 told on his channel and after it 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.090
 is the top tanks of this branch of development 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.800
 Leopard 1 in general, then this whole branch 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.350
 German tanks stands a bit apart 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.360
 and different from classmates complete 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.680
 lack of armor 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.170
 which is superbly compensated 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.120
 dynamics and great guns what 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.640
 is the ninth leopard 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.989
 level the car is visually pleasing and not 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.780
 square like most German 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.010
 tanks a small tower with sloping tanks 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.649
 slightly shifted forward 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.630
 what in this case is a tank plus 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.010
 Medium size certainly larger 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.870
 understated Soviet st 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.670
 but far fewer french that already 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.160
 nice and disguise 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.200
 practically q Soviet t-54 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.270
 unlike the same E50 which 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.579
 masking is two times worse after 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.889
 opening acquisition leap is you 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:10.619
 get a stock car that doesn't 

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:12.420
 rides and does not shoot the best option 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.659
 research module exploring this 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.359
 gun engine then turret chassis and 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.740
 already in the last radio guns 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.990
 need to explore the first place 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.179
 because then you can wear damage 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.069
 and get the maximum amount of experience 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.529
 which in turn will allow faster 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:30.539
 open you the next module and armor 

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:32.639
 there is no tank both in stock and in top 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:35.429
 so playing on whether the experience on it 

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:38.579
 you should not count forehead corps 70 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.649
 side 35 feed 25 millimeters at the tower 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.349
 much bigger in forehead 52 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.270
 board and nape of 60 that is, any 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:46.750
 the gun since 5 has no 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.730
 problems with our armor 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.070
 here is of course amazing such for example 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.960
 what's the fight ricochet from e-100 but this 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.750
 rather such a magical luck to those 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.780
 regularity for parquet when weighed 40 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.120
 tons has an engine capacity of 831 their strength 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.830
 this ratio gives him the best 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.800
 dynamics sadists Ninth level 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.990
 twenty one horse per ton making 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.450
 the tank is very mobile and speedy yet 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.730
 maximum speed at the level of 65 kilometers 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.620
 forward back true the car is moving not 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.840
 very quickly only 23 kilometers per hour 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.520
 such dynamics are much simpler and 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.680
 turn around faster to get away 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.780
 so slowly backing back in general from 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.970
 agility leopards dynamism is 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.040
 you can have fun and she often 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.600
 will hand it once with ease to run and 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.910
 appears to the enemy with an unexpected 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.400
 side firepower is average 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.590
 if this is exactly the approval of dpm 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.390
 here is one of the lowest at level i 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.370
 I personally believe that when comparing this 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.860
 Tank with classmates need to be considered 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.380
 the fact that this tank is 2 or 3 lines 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.780
 Is there more and more experience for that? 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.940
 just one-time damage pleases 390 units and 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.650
 excellent armor penetration in 206 of 8 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.750
 millimeters and on regular 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.880
 projectiles if you even have this breakthrough 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.250
 not enough chinese fly you which 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.110
 total flashing 330 millimeters because 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.040
 gun pretty accurate comfortable on 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.950
 long distances 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.019
 scatter on 100 meters all 032 and here 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.330
 reduction to 2 and 3 recharge rate 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.610
 10 seconds is what many gasp for 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.769
 this car though me personally it is strong 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.510
 not annoying there is accuracy and one-time 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.150
 damage that allows you to fall more often and 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.860
 ok nastrelivat a weapon in our 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.200
 there is another plus is high speed 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.190
 the flight of the main projectile then how here 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.260
 we have podkalibery 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.540
 and even long lead 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.519
 need to do the minimum pressed shot and 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.260
 instantly hit and not like 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.239
 some guns when after the shot 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.430
 can go put the tea back 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.680
 see how you missed the top 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.079
 going up well plus 20 degrees not 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.019
 be bent on minus 6 as if not good but 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.010
 not such a bad average 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.140
 the only thing you need to be careful 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.480
 when the tower is turned back the gun is not 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.280
 bends at all to take on the autosight 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.769
 running off to shoot the enemy turned 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.299
 the tower back you will not work well if 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.380
 just a thread of flat surface 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:55.510
 will say somewhere in the year 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.130
 where equipment for leopards is 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.230
 depending on the style of play 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.820
 standard set for medium tank up 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.980
 Vertical Stabilizer 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.050
 pickup and coated optics 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.940
 but the leopard case is necessary 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.010
 consider that mixing is kind enough 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.840
 so I personally put the drives 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.580
 vertical pickup instead of enlightened 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.140
 ki because it is more important for me 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.180
 minimize shutdown time 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.910
 for a shot and near speed up time 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.760
 information of the victim and the review but the review with 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.720
 recharge I already improves doppike 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.880
 As a result, I get the same 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.130
 most overview but with quick details 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.810
 so of course it turns out a little expensive and 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.880
 every fight besides all expenses 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.310
 adds another - 20,000 silver 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.050
 but it pays off with interest because everything 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.240
 tank parameters improved by 10 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.730
 percent or more of that if it burns 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.930
 extremely rare this is my choice of consumables 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.840
 next stage . 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.120
 repair and add some carry on 2 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.890
 repair kit and first aid kit can not honest 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.780
 saying it did not try to comment 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.570
 and often the needs of me are not 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.250
 there was a crew of a prototype leopard 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.650
 composition and quantity does not differ from 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:59.800
 indian-panzer there is the same composition commander 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.480
 gunner mechanic driver and loader to 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.640
 the main perk is fraternity repair and 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.650
 disguise I would add a smooth turn 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:08.050
 turret gunner and a smooth ride 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.460
 the driver is perks who 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.070
 very useful for improving accuracy 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.710
 guns will help to be reduced faster and more often 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.690
 fall based on the feature left it 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.410
 lack of armor and quite long 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.120
 recharge 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.340
 show the enemy as necessary 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.380
 less and more that tank is being criticized 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.480
 quite often so this is a tank like me 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.980
 already said 2 or 3 lines 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.530
 that is, you need as long as possible 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:31.450
 keep your hp playing disguise 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.860
 sniper and cover shooting 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:34.270
 is for him the most preferred 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.590
 version of the game 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.150
 well of course thanks to my 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.460
 mobility can break through 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.650
 abandoned enemy flank to enter 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.540
 rear and dream for hell 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:46.270
 often it happens that at the end of the fight it 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:48.430
 your exact big alder gun decides 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.800
 the outcome of the battle is therefore the first half of the battle 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.420
 play carefully and then act 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.850
 as often as possible 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.570
 change position after the daylight and will 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.700
 you happiness 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.380
 I think this tank will be interesting to players 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.100
 playing thoughtfully and with an eye on 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.230
 minimap 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.930
 Do not personally experience really liked for 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.970
 mobility accurate cannon and big alpha 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.430
 I hope that the next leopard-1 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.870
 will not be worse, but today it is all 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.030
 thank you for coming 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.490
 rate the video like or 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:19.470
 dizlayki subscribe and come again 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:19.470
