the center of your board on the coping

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.719 
the center of your board on the coping
now<00:01:47.750> it's<00:01:47.990> time<00:01:48.200> to<00:01:48.380> change<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:49.400> can<00:01:49.550> see

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
now it's time to change and you can see

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.880 
now it's time to change and you can see
you<00:01:49.880> can<00:01:50.030> go<00:01:50.150> from<00:01:50.330> trick<00:01:50.570> to<00:01:50.690> trick<00:01:50.900> so<00:01:51.770> we're

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
you can go from trick to trick so we're

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:52.960 
you can go from trick to trick so we're
going<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.070> go<00:01:52.100> ahead<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:52.340> check<00:01:52.430> out<00:01:52.610> somebody

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
going to go ahead and check out somebody

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.580 
going to go ahead and check out somebody
else<00:01:53.150> here<00:01:53.330> in<00:01:53.479> this<00:01:53.570> bowl<00:01:53.810> section<00:01:54.290> let's

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
else here in this bowl section let's

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.110 
else here in this bowl section let's
actually<00:01:54.770> go<00:01:55.040> back<00:01:55.250> and<00:01:55.600> check<00:01:56.600> out<00:01:56.780> errors<00:01:58.120> so

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
actually go back and check out errors so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.930 
actually go back and check out errors so
we're<00:01:59.299> going<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.479> do<00:01:59.690> an<00:02:00.680> ollie<00:02:00.920> melon<00:02:01.460> which

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
we're going to do an ollie melon which

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.880 
we're going to do an ollie melon which
isn't<00:02:02.240> really<00:02:02.270> an<00:02:02.450> error<00:02:02.659> but<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.229> is<00:02:03.380> empty
