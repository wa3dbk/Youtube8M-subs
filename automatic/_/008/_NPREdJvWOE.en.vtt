00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.099
 a webdesign course that teaches you 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.440
 make a website from scratch starting the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.809
 photoshop problem 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.460
 here I'll be showing up finalizing 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.539
 How are we going to create the cadastre in the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.779
 site as host ok site is 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.029
 I want to say first that I go 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.220
 is sending you the link too 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.910
 of a video lesson for you to do 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.920
 register on free site host site us 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.120
 Let's go and we'll host this one. 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.579
 site is now right on hawtin site for 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.329
 you see what the operation will be 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.039
 his 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.539
 before that I will only highlight 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.020
 these names that you have placed give a 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.020
 last 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.960
 I'll put an agreement here on the names 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.640
 for us to be able to highlight when 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.220
 put it on the air 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.040
 remembering that each page of this each tab 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.500
 This you go yourself will edit 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.160
 individually 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:32.640
 then it is logical that a site does not consist 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:36.040
 It's just that we did one here. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.080
 the basis of everything for you to start doing 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.870
 this page 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:46.150
 the folder of your site all the pages you 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:48.580
 contained inside it ok then the 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.070
 organization is everything when you are going to do 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.350
 the organization of the name of the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:59.200
 images organization of colors 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.750

 that you're not even part of the root inside 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:04.260
 What do I do? 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:07.780
 We are going to access my computer here. 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:14.290
 you the unit that was one of the targets 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:16.750
 from site sites 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.400
 the four pages and the images 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.440
 corresponding to each page 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:31.540
 in case of very light image repetition 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:36.190
 just copy right copy and paste here 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.320
 inside the folder of the server remembering 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:43.770
 that this server could be any 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:48.340
 other item options like yahoo sites 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:50.410
 zip a globe server to whom pay has 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:55.650
 a free download then there are several 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:58.710
 other good and bad servers and 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:02.680
 His address is a bit long though 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:04.720
 also because a free server but 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.479
 the page do not have advertisements not be a 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:11.500
 small name that will appear in the 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.270
 Page bottom of anything not 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.660
 Are you seeing is sending the files? 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.410
 depending on your internet connection 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:23.130
 It may take a few minutes 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.130
 now it's not impossible 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:29.950
 lets wait a little bit 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.990
 it is not impossible to hours more the site well 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.530
 too heavy your connection has to 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.530
 be very bad 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.250
 in this example here 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.570
 speed also depends on your 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.980
 host nÃ© 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.680
 even if you have super internet 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.690
 fast but we will lose here beyond 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.280
 transfer him no he did not 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.000
 It matters that you have a connection of 1 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.690
 mega 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.370
 I'm doing it here so let's lose 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.730
 the same so he will not mind 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:05.260
 should carry weight bearing 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:07.000
 mega is not who will do you have already sent 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.240

 here is the page here 

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.600
 does not have any content 

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:53.070
 if we put some content not 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:56.020
 it would be on the bottom and you have 

00:06:53.070 --> 00:07:00.310
 all pages running 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:02.710
 perfectly as we had done 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.840
 from here you can see navigation if the 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.050
 page is loading fast not 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.820
