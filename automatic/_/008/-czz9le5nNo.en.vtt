gear now version was modified for five
smaller<00:04:02.620> rounds<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:03.489> probably<00:04:03.909> accounts

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
smaller rounds so that probably accounts

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.569 
smaller rounds so that probably accounts
for<00:04:04.450> its<00:04:04.659> controllability<00:04:05.139> in<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:06.069> game<00:04:06.250> this

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579

and designed more for suppressing the
enemy<00:04:13.150> rather<00:04:13.389> than<00:04:13.629> making<00:04:13.870> them<00:04:14.109> bleed<00:04:14.409> but

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
enemy rather than making them bleed but

enemy rather than making them bleed but
what<00:04:15.010> I<00:04:15.040> like<00:04:15.280> best<00:04:15.489> is<00:04:15.669> the<00:04:15.730> fact<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.060> it's

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
what I like best is the fact that it's

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.759

nice<00:04:16.449> and<00:04:16.630> loud<00:04:16.780> every<00:04:17.380> time<00:04:17.530> you<00:04:17.650> squeeze

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
nice and loud every time you squeeze

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.349
