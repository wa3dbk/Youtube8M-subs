00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.470
 you with me make up bruises 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.770
 otherwise why should I go on the road 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.600
 scary man talks tight 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.599
 the flow of the district sixth is a big 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:10.300
 part of transit transport 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.400
 with the advent of the new southern neighborhood 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.630
 cars still added 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.650
 add problems by parents and school 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.210
 kindergarten they are on 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.090
 the opposite side of children need 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.390
 driver for housing on the motorway sign 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.390
 crosswalk 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.349
 very dangerous 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.519
 because it's risky another time you leave 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.069
 crossing the road on a zebra and it turns out 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:32.430
 become first 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.390
 and from this side 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.760
 the car does not have time to cool down 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.260
 would like to here 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.650
 until the last 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.340
 with such a request, residents of new buildings 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.550
 turned to regional 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.920
 parliamentarians along with 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.080
 city ​​representatives 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.460
 administration and staff 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.560
 traffic police are already in place they discussed 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.610
 the problem 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.610
 there are several options 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.210
 traffic light steel 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.860
 and then transfer to another place 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.350
 or 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.350
 just second 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.110
 there is even a construction plan on paper 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.729
 pedestrian overpass 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.890
 on this stretch of road if in 2008 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.330
 that is, about six in the meantime 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.140
 million rubles for the installation of a traffic light 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.230
 from the city budget to allocate to this 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.430
 they say you can only rely on private 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.490
 investment how did this time happen 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.870
 on a zebra 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.620
 city ​​authorities offer residents 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.820
 new buildings cross the road 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.220
 pedestrian crossing on which 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.909
 special signs are installed 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.850
 with LEDs it is literally 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.479
 not so easy 1 st but the way they year 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.539
 real test even 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.039
 but not to save it is very difficult here Natalia 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.710
 auto will 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.600
 almost impossible 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.159
 developer taran amber 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.960
 also does not take responsibility 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.259
 redevelopment new neighborhood 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.119
 thinks they needed to 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.409
 consider all the nuances in a day or through 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.980
 week we shall meet 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.250
 I'll try my best 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.340
 invite and their developers 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.040
 designers but also citizens naturally 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.390
 who use this one 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.399
 and we you work 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.289
 those offers of opportunity may 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.229
 not quite costly dollars 

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:17.479
 question but I think Khreshchatyk 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.829
 the ideal option is to install a traffic light 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.209
 because 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.569
 only traffic light can provide on 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.489
 really safe transition 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.609
 pedestrians 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.459
 maybe it will just be a percentage 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.840
 more than five nose science traffic object 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.249
 with call button 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.419
 so that in the absence of pedestrians transport 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.249
 so 5 7 move 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.169
 however, the traffic light will be happy not only 

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:41.080
 pedestrians police time 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.560
 drivers themselves have repeatedly appealed to the traffic police 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.180
 to the intersection of the county council 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.409
 birth made adjustable 

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:48.809
