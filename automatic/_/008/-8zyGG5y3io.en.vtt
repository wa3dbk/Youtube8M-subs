00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
hit me until last night when I started

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.359 
hit me until last night when I started
thinking<00:01:03.510> about<00:01:03.600> how<00:01:04.199> sad<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> was<00:01:05.100> going<00:01:05.309> to

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
thinking about how sad it was going to

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.070 
thinking about how sad it was going to
be<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.489> shooting<00:01:05.880> of<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.240> our<00:01:06.360> house<00:01:06.600> and

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
be a shooting of that of our house and

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.280 
be a shooting of that of our house and
how<00:01:07.200> empty<00:01:07.500> would<00:01:07.770> be<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> powder<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.020> think

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
how empty would be a powder and I think

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.750
