much so little bit crazy anyway what

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.120 
much so little bit crazy anyway what
essentially<00:01:49.180> what<00:01:49.390> happens<00:01:49.750> is<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:51.100> a

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
essentially what happens is with a

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.550 
essentially what happens is with a

Twitter emails texts everything shows up
in<00:01:58.479> one<00:01:58.659> thing<00:01:58.960> or<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.590> can<00:01:59.799> look<00:02:00.400> through<00:02:00.430> the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
in one thing or you can look through the

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.280 
in one thing or you can look through the
hub<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.060> choose<00:02:01.360> just<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.750> see<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.049> Twitter

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
hub and choose just to see the Twitter

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.160 
hub and choose just to see the Twitter
ones<00:02:02.530> now<00:02:02.799> the<00:02:03.460> problem<00:02:03.670> is<00:02:03.940> that<00:02:04.000> if<00:02:04.360> you<00:02:04.510> read

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
ones now the problem is that if you read

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.859 
ones now the problem is that if you read
them<00:02:05.380> on<00:02:05.560> there<00:02:05.830> then<00:02:06.250> obviously<00:02:06.400> then<00:02:06.880> they

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
them on there then obviously then they

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:09.270 
them on there then obviously then they
mark<00:02:08.200> as<00:02:08.379> read<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.619> they<00:02:08.830> don't<00:02:08.979> show<00:02:09.250> up

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
mark as read and they don't show up

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.859 
mark as read and they don't show up
anymore<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:09.970> doesn't<00:02:10.209> tell<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.539> you've<00:02:10.690> got

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
don't go there at all and you go

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.070 
don't go there at all and you go
straight<00:02:15.849> to<00:02:16.329> the<00:02:16.359> app

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
straight to the app

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.630

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
you then go back to the hub and it's

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.070 
you then go back to the hub and it's
still<00:02:22.090> showing<00:02:22.300> that<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.630> haven't<00:02:22.900> read<00:02:23.050> it

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
still showing that you haven't read it

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.860 
still showing that you haven't read it
so<00:02:23.350> then<00:02:23.500> you<00:02:23.590> have<00:02:23.770> to<00:02:23.920> go<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:24.420> mark<00:02:25.420> all<00:02:25.690> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
so then you have to go and mark all the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.870 
so then you have to go and mark all the
stuff<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:26.410> show<00:02:26.800> that<00:02:26.830> you've<00:02:27.340> read<00:02:27.640> this

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
stuff and show that you've read this

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.880 
stuff and show that you've read this
stuff<00:02:28.150> when<00:02:28.510> you've<00:02:28.690> all<00:02:28.900> done<00:02:29.290> that<00:02:29.560> through

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
stuff when you've all done that through

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:32.040 
stuff when you've all done that through
the<00:02:30.070> Twitter<00:02:30.280> app<00:02:30.400> it's<00:02:30.700> really<00:02:30.970> quite<00:02:31.240> a<00:02:31.480> long

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
the Twitter app it's really quite a long

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.420 
the Twitter app it's really quite a long
way<00:02:32.200> around<00:02:32.320> this<00:02:32.680> pointless<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.340> it's

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
way around this pointless and it's

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.880 
way around this pointless and it's
almost<00:02:33.790> like<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.540> want<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.870> get<00:02:35.500> your<00:02:35.620> Twitter

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
almost like you want to get your Twitter

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.190 
almost like you want to get your Twitter
account<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.490> facebook<00:02:37.270> account<00:02:37.600> off<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.990> hub

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
account and facebook account off the hub

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.750 
account and facebook account off the hub
so<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.190> you<00:02:39.310> don't<00:02:39.490> get<00:02:39.610> those

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
so that you don't get those

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.270 
so that you don't get those
notifications<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:41.050> kind<00:02:41.320> of<00:02:41.410> goes

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
notifications and that kind of goes

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.980 
notifications and that kind of goes
against<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.880> whole<00:02:42.910> point<00:02:43.300> of<00:02:43.510> having<00:02:43.570> it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
against the whole point of having it

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.480 
against the whole point of having it
there<00:02:44.020> in<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.410> first<00:02:44.680> place<00:02:44.770> or<00:02:45.130> having<00:02:45.400> a
