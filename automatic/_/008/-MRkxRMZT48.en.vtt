might<00:02:09.390> be<00:02:09.690> able<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:10.200> cook<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:10.860> eat<00:02:11.340> it

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
might be able to cook it and eat it

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.940 
might be able to cook it and eat it
which<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.569> really<00:02:12.870> really<00:02:13.140> gross<00:02:13.500> can

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
which is really really gross can

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.820 
which is really really gross can
tittering<00:02:14.370> now<00:02:14.580> zombies<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.930> terms<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.590> things

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
tittering now zombies in terms of things

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.979 
tittering now zombies in terms of things
that<00:02:17.040> are<00:02:17.190> more<00:02:17.400> like<00:02:17.640> fixes<00:02:18.269> rather<00:02:18.569> than<00:02:18.750> new

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
that are more like fixes rather than new

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.530 
that are more like fixes rather than new
features<00:02:19.500> partly<00:02:19.980> clouds<00:02:20.310> work<00:02:20.790> properly<00:02:21.120> now

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
features partly clouds work properly now

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.020 
features partly clouds work properly now
the<00:02:21.989> new<00:02:22.170> lighting<00:02:22.650> system<00:02:23.010> looks<00:02:23.190> incredible

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
the new lighting system looks incredible

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.540 
the new lighting system looks incredible
it<00:02:24.569> basically<00:02:24.780> works<00:02:25.200> by<00:02:25.500> changing<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.069> texture

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
it basically works by changing a texture

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.330 
it basically works by changing a texture
of<00:02:26.700> blocks<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.810> it<00:02:28.200> doesn't<00:02:28.440> require<00:02:28.890> to

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
of blocks so that it doesn't require to

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.729 
of blocks so that it doesn't require to
update<00:02:29.940> chunks<00:02:30.540> when<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.170> changes<00:02:31.680> to

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
update chunks when it changes to

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.979 
update chunks when it changes to
nighttime<00:02:32.400> or<00:02:32.610> whatever<00:02:32.880> so<00:02:33.510> basically

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
nighttime or whatever so basically

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.979 
nighttime or whatever so basically
there's<00:02:34.230> virtually<00:02:34.800> no<00:02:35.550> lag<00:02:35.910> when<00:02:36.660> lighting

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
there's virtually no lag when lighting

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.440 
there's virtually no lag when lighting
changes<00:02:37.739> knots<00:02:38.220> demonstrated<00:02:39.030> this<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.239> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
is just no lag also the lighting looks

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.170 
is just no lag also the lighting looks
amazing<00:02:47.130> because<00:02:47.400> there's<00:02:47.670> now<00:02:47.910> two

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
amazing because there's now two

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.539 
amazing because there's now two
different<00:02:48.720> types<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.200> lighting<00:02:49.440> OMG<00:02:50.220> fire

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
different types of lighting OMG fire

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.600 
different types of lighting OMG fire
light<00:02:50.849> or<00:02:51.030> tungsten<00:02:51.330> light<00:02:51.810> and<00:02:52.079> also<00:02:52.920> natural

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
light or tungsten light and also natural

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.960 
light or tungsten light and also natural
daylight<00:02:53.880> every<00:02:54.500> texture<00:02:55.500> has<00:02:56.310> different

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
daylight every texture has different

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.259 
daylight every texture has different
combinations<00:02:57.810> of<00:02:58.019> those<00:02:58.260> two<00:02:58.560> lights<00:02:58.970> so<00:02:59.970> that

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
combinations of those two lights so that

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.870 
combinations of those two lights so that
the<00:03:00.599> effect<00:03:01.019> in<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.290> game<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.920> that<00:03:02.130> torches

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
the effect in the game is that torches

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.150 
the effect in the game is that torches
in<00:03:02.910> a<00:03:03.150> cave<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.810> light<00:03:04.019> will<00:03:04.290> be<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.500> Inge<00:03:04.860> but

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
in a cave the light will be on Inge but

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.890 
in a cave the light will be on Inge but
then<00:03:05.310> if<00:03:05.489> there's<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.760> hole<00:03:06.030> in<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.269> ceiling<00:03:06.569> or

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
then if there's a hole in the ceiling or

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.050 
then if there's a hole in the ceiling or
something<00:03:07.290> with<00:03:07.410> daylight<00:03:07.799> coming<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.430> that

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
something with daylight coming in that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.509 
something with daylight coming in that
light<00:03:09.299> will<00:03:09.630> look<00:03:09.870> blue<00:03:10.349> in<00:03:10.560> comparison<00:03:11.310> like

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
light will look blue in comparison like

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.640 
light will look blue in comparison like
real<00:03:11.819> daylight<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.900> just<00:03:13.110> looks<00:03:13.410> really

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
real daylight and it just looks really

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.620 
real daylight and it just looks really
really<00:03:14.069> nice<00:03:14.250> so<00:03:14.670> that's<00:03:14.849> actually<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.450> thing

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
really nice so that's actually the thing

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.620 
really nice so that's actually the thing
I'm<00:03:15.900> actually<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.739> most<00:03:16.980> excited<00:03:17.700> about<00:03:17.790> so

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
I'm actually the most excited about so

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.720 
I'm actually the most excited about so
on<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.959> proper<00:03:19.319> new<00:03:19.590> features<00:03:20.190> now<00:03:20.430> there's

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
on to proper new features now there's

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.090 
on to proper new features now there's
going<00:03:20.790> to<00:03:20.970> be<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.120> creative<00:03:21.569> mode<00:03:22.049> it's<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.769> bit

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
going to be a creative mode it's a bit

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.160 
going to be a creative mode it's a bit
like<00:03:23.280> an<00:03:23.519> official<00:03:24.030> version<00:03:24.540> of<00:03:24.690> too<00:03:24.930> many

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
like an official version of too many

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.650 
like an official version of too many
items<00:03:25.410> and<00:03:25.950> fly<00:03:26.370> mods<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:26.940> you<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.209> fly<00:03:27.480> around

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
items and fly mods so you can fly around

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.190 
items and fly mods so you can fly around
a<00:03:28.019> bit<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:29.430> can<00:03:29.459> use<00:03:30.060> select<00:03:30.690> any<00:03:30.900> blocks

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
a bit and you can use select any blocks

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.020 
a bit and you can use select any blocks
you<00:03:31.380> like<00:03:31.590> and<00:03:31.920> build<00:03:32.220> whatever<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.790> want

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
you like and build whatever you want

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.240 
you like and build whatever you want
what's<00:03:33.720> interesting<00:03:33.959> about<00:03:34.470> that<00:03:34.590> mode<00:03:35.040> is

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
what's interesting about that mode is

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.930 
what's interesting about that mode is
it's<00:03:35.549> also<00:03:35.850> going<00:03:36.299> to<00:03:36.389> be<00:03:36.600> available<00:03:36.989> in

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
it's also going to be available in

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.240 
it's also going to be available in
multiplayer<00:03:38.940> where<00:03:39.690> admins<00:03:40.230> will<00:03:40.410> be<00:03:40.739> able<00:03:41.130> to

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
multiplayer where admins will be able to

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.780 
multiplayer where admins will be able to
turn<00:03:41.700> that<00:03:41.880> mode<00:03:42.150> on<00:03:42.420> so<00:03:42.989> rather<00:03:43.230> than<00:03:43.470> having

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
turn that mode on so rather than having

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.180 
turn that mode on so rather than having
specialised<00:03:44.790> mods<00:03:45.269> installed<00:03:45.920> that's<00:03:46.920> now

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
specialised mods installed that's now

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.099 
specialised mods installed that's now
going<00:03:47.370> to<00:03:47.489> be<00:03:47.579> part<00:03:47.850> of<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.510> main<00:03:48.720> game

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
going to be part of the main game

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.830 
going to be part of the main game
obviously<00:03:49.889> endermen<00:03:50.670> is<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:51.090> big<00:03:51.540> other

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
obviously endermen is the big other

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.539 
obviously endermen is the big other
thing<00:03:52.230> they<00:03:52.650> pick<00:03:52.920> up<00:03:53.069> blocks<00:03:53.340> they

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
thing they pick up blocks they

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.370 
thing they pick up blocks they
apparently<00:03:53.760> place<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.569> blocks<00:03:54.840> down<00:03:55.139> in

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
apparently place the blocks down in

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.220 
apparently place the blocks down in
random<00:03:55.799> places<00:03:56.150> under<00:03:57.150> men<00:03:57.329> died<00:03:57.750> when<00:03:58.079> they

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
random places under men died when they

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.979 
random places under men died when they
touch<00:03:58.530> water<00:03:58.920> which<00:03:59.910> is<00:03:59.940> an<00:04:00.269> interesting

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
touch water which is an interesting

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.349 
touch water which is an interesting
concept<00:04:01.380> also<00:04:02.310> apparently<00:04:02.730> I'm<00:04:02.849> just<00:04:03.090> read

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
concept also apparently I'm just read

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.030 
concept also apparently I'm just read
that<00:04:03.540> they<00:04:03.720> drop<00:04:03.989> diamonds<00:04:04.680> I<00:04:04.769> haven't

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
that they drop diamonds I haven't

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
also on biome says the mushroom biomes

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.470 
also on biome says the mushroom biomes
and<00:05:12.180> there's<00:05:12.930> deeper<00:05:13.620> oceans<00:05:14.250> and<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:15.240> deep

and there's deeper oceans and the deep
oceans<00:05:15.930> are<00:05:16.050> going<00:05:16.200> to<00:05:16.260> be<00:05:16.320> biomes<00:05:16.770> in<00:05:17.040> their

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
oceans are going to be biomes in their

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.850 
oceans are going to be biomes in their
own<00:05:17.370> right<00:05:17.760> so<00:05:18.240> there's<00:05:18.480> really<00:05:18.870> big<00:05:19.320> oceans
