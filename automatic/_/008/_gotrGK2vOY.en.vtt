00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
GameCube controller as you can see here

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.630 
GameCube controller as you can see here
that<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:34.079> button<00:00:34.410> replacements<00:00:37.399> so<00:00:38.399> we'll<00:00:38.550> be

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
that the button replacements so we'll be

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.459 
that the button replacements so we'll be
looking<00:00:38.760> at<00:00:38.910> some<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.360> upsides<00:00:40.350> and

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
looking at some of the upsides and

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.920 
looking at some of the upsides and
downsides<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.329> system<00:00:42.329> really<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.750> a

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
downsides of this system really it's a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.920 
downsides of this system really it's a
the<00:00:43.680> only<00:00:43.710> solution<00:00:44.460> out<00:00:44.579> at<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.879> moment<00:00:45.090> as

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the only solution out at the moment as

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.020 
the only solution out at the moment as
far<00:00:46.170> as<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.379> know<00:00:46.440> I<00:00:46.559> mean<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.829> think<00:00:46.890> they<00:00:47.730> sold

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
far as I know I mean I think they sold

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.580 
far as I know I mean I think they sold
them<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.300> Japan<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> bit<00:00:48.989> ago<00:00:49.200> but<00:00:49.410> I<00:00:49.440> don't

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
them in Japan a bit ago but I don't

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.760 
them in Japan a bit ago but I don't
think<00:00:49.680> they<00:00:49.829> sell<00:00:50.070> them<00:00:50.190> anymore

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:51.770 
think they sell them anymore

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.760 
think they sell them anymore
so<00:00:52.770> let's<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.160> take<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> look<00:00:54.379> all<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.620> need

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
so let's just take a look all you need

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.099 
so let's just take a look all you need
for<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.070> adaptor<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> work<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.660> single

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
for the adaptor to work is a single

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.979 
for the adaptor to work is a single
remote<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:59.850> GameCube<00:01:00.239> controller<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.899> want

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
remote the GameCube controller you want

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.189

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.390 
to use to play your game and the adapter
itself<00:01:04.500> I'm<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.949> flash<00:01:06.770> so<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> connect<00:01:08.189> them<00:01:08.310> in

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
itself I'm a flash so to connect them in

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.649 
itself I'm a flash so to connect them in
the<00:01:08.490> order<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.210> recommend<00:01:10.280> first<00:01:11.659> take

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the order that they recommend first take

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.520 
the order that they recommend first take
your<00:01:12.689> GameCube<00:01:13.200> controller<00:01:15.229> take<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> end

of<00:01:29.250> your<00:01:29.520> Wii<00:01:29.670> Remote<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.780> would<00:01:30.900> a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
of your Wii Remote like you would a

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.920 
of your Wii Remote like you would a
nunchuck<00:01:31.439> controller<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.430> another<00:01:33.030> classic

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
nunchuck controller or another classic

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.370 
nunchuck controller or another classic
controller<00:01:36.320> now<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:38.460> low<00:01:39.060> light<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.600> first

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
controller now the low light on first

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.770 
controller now the low light on first
connection<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.979> light<00:01:41.189> on<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.700> will<00:01:42.210> blink

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
connection the light on this will blink

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.100 
connection the light on this will blink
a<00:01:42.869> few<00:01:43.049> times<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.500> that's<00:01:43.619> calibrating<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
a few times and that's calibrating the

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:51.530 
a few times and that's calibrating the
classic<00:01:46.110> controller<00:01:46.369> there<00:01:50.299> once<00:01:51.299> that's

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
classic controller there once that's

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.770 
classic controller there once that's
finished<00:01:52.430> it<00:01:53.430> will<00:01:53.700> register<00:01:54.149> as<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.299> classic

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
finished it will register as a classic

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.319 
finished it will register as a classic
controller<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:57.000> let's<00:01:57.180> see<00:01:57.299> how<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.509> works<00:01:59.329> so

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
controller so let's see how it works so

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.870 
controller so let's see how it works so
here's<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.840> control<00:02:01.200> scheme<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.619> use<00:02:02.040> for

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
here's the control scheme that I use for

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.410 
here's the control scheme that I use for
the<00:02:03.090> classic<00:02:03.420> controller<00:02:03.860> and<00:02:05.180> I<00:02:06.180> will

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
the classic controller and I will

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.540 
the classic controller and I will
demonstrate<00:02:06.890> what<00:02:07.890> it's<00:02:08.009> like<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.280> use<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
demonstrate what it's like to use the

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.520 
demonstrate what it's like to use the
GameCube<00:02:08.940> controller<00:02:09.330> as<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.899> substitute<00:02:10.440> as

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
GameCube controller as a substitute as

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.580 
GameCube controller as a substitute as
you<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.770> see<00:02:11.000> picks<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.150> up<00:02:12.239> just<00:02:12.420> fine

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
you can see picks it up just fine

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:21.470 
you can see picks it up just fine
to<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> test<00:02:18.349> now<00:02:19.349> I<00:02:20.030> get<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> lot<00:02:21.209> of<00:02:21.239> questions

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
to a test now I get a lot of questions

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.670 
to a test now I get a lot of questions
like<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.940> there<00:02:23.940> lag<00:02:24.349> that's<00:02:25.349> the<00:02:25.500> biggest

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
like is there lag that's the biggest

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.030 
like is there lag that's the biggest
question<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:27.180> there<00:02:27.360> Rumble<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.319> I'll

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
question and is there Rumble and I'll

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.490 
question and is there Rumble and I'll
answer<00:02:29.220> those<00:02:29.459> for<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.819> right<00:02:30.299> now<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.690> there

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
answer those for you right now so there

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.830 
answer those for you right now so there
is<00:02:31.620> no<00:02:31.830> rumble

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
is no rumble

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.080 
is no rumble
although<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.349> Gamecube<00:02:34.799> can<00:02:35.099> controller<00:02:35.849> can

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
although the Gamecube can controller can

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.059 
although the Gamecube can controller can
Rumble<00:02:36.299> as<00:02:36.510> many<00:02:36.690> of<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:36.930> know<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
Rumble as many of you know the

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.479 
Rumble as many of you know the
functionality<00:02:38.670> has<00:02:38.819> been<00:02:39.180> disabled<00:02:39.690> because

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
functionality has been disabled because

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.880 
functionality has been disabled because
just<00:02:41.489> the<00:02:41.610> adapter<00:02:41.910> doesn't<00:02:42.180> permit<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.890> also

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
just the adapter doesn't permit it also

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.100 
just the adapter doesn't permit it also
shielding<00:02:44.430> doesn't<00:02:44.760> occur<00:02:45.120> until<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.930> press

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
shielding doesn't occur until you press

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.900 
shielding doesn't occur until you press
the<00:02:46.260> button<00:02:46.500> all<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.650> way<00:02:46.769> on<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.610> shoulder

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
the button all the way on the shoulder

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.870 
the button all the way on the shoulder
buttons<00:02:48.209> for<00:02:48.480> LNR<00:02:49.310> it's<00:02:50.310> another<00:02:50.519> small

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
buttons for LNR it's another small

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.600 
buttons for LNR it's another small
difference<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:52.799> biggest<00:02:53.190> difference

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
difference and the biggest difference

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.089 
difference and the biggest difference
and<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:54.090> my<00:02:54.180> opinion<00:02:54.510> what<00:02:54.890> what<00:02:55.890> is

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
and in my opinion what what is

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.819 
and in my opinion what what is
unfortunate<00:02:56.700> about<00:02:57.120> this<00:02:57.620> product<00:02:58.620> is<00:02:58.739> that

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
unfortunate about this product is that

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.440 
unfortunate about this product is that
they<00:02:58.950> haven't<00:02:59.190> calibrated<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.030> control

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
they haven't calibrated the control

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.300 
they haven't calibrated the control
stick<00:03:02.510> exactly<00:03:03.510> correctly<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.890> when<00:03:05.069> I<00:03:05.099> say

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
stick exactly correctly and when I say

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.339 
stick exactly correctly and when I say
that<00:03:05.459> I<00:03:05.489> mean<00:03:05.700> they<00:03:05.760> haven't<00:03:06.079> they<00:03:07.079> didn't

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
that I mean they haven't they didn't

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.780 
that I mean they haven't they didn't
take<00:03:07.440> into<00:03:07.590> account<00:03:07.680> the<00:03:08.099> different<00:03:08.400> size<00:03:08.640> of

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
take into account the different size of

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.170 
take into account the different size of
the<00:03:08.930> control<00:03:09.930> stick<00:03:10.579> it's<00:03:11.579> slightly<00:03:11.849> bigger

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the control stick it's slightly bigger

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.449 
the control stick it's slightly bigger
on<00:03:12.299> the<00:03:12.390> Gamecube<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.989> has<00:03:13.260> more<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.190> reach

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
on the Gamecube it has more of a reach

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.930 
on the Gamecube it has more of a reach
in<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.510> class<00:03:15.720> controller<00:03:16.230> so<00:03:17.220> stopping<00:03:17.850> your

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
in the class controller so stopping your

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.699 
in the class controller so stopping your
movements<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.660> going<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.109> be<00:03:19.170> a<00:03:19.200> little<00:03:19.530> bit

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
movements is going to be a little bit

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.539 
movements is going to be a little bit
delayed<00:03:20.069> as<00:03:20.540> you<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:21.660> see<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:22.500> sort<00:03:23.160> of<00:03:23.250> delays

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
delayed as you can see it sort of delays

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.539 
delayed as you can see it sort of delays
I'll<00:03:23.730> compare<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.209> with<00:03:24.329> a<00:03:25.069> actual<00:03:26.069> class<00:03:26.340> of

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
I'll compare that with a actual class of

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:29.960 
I'll compare that with a actual class of
controller<00:03:26.910> here<00:03:28.280> okay<00:03:29.280> here's<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.639> classic

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
controller here okay here's the classic

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.990 
controller here okay here's the classic
controller<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.739> let's<00:03:32.069> do<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.250> test<00:03:34.849> so<00:03:35.849> as<00:03:35.910> you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
controller and let's do a test so as you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.080 
controller and let's do a test so as you
can<00:03:36.060> see<00:03:36.120> that<00:03:36.450> the<00:03:36.599> stops<00:03:36.900> are<00:03:37.200> much<00:03:38.090> more

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
can see that the stops are much more

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:49.140 
can see that the stops are much more
sudden

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.369 

let's<00:03:50.150> do<00:03:50.239> another<00:03:50.269> test<00:03:52.810> as<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:54.170> can<00:03:54.260> see

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
let's do another test as you can see

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:05.949 
let's do another test as you can see
makes<00:03:54.650> much<00:03:55.180> farther<00:03:56.180> elites<00:03:56.810> so<00:04:04.959> despite

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
makes much farther elites so despite

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.720 
makes much farther elites so despite
some<00:04:06.170> minor<00:04:06.200> setbacks<00:04:06.890> there<00:04:07.579> is

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
some minor setbacks there is

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
some minor setbacks there is
surprisingly<00:04:08.360> no<00:04:08.750> lag<00:04:09.280> on<00:04:10.299> this<00:04:11.299> controller

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
surprisingly no lag on this controller

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.990 
surprisingly no lag on this controller
however<00:04:12.560> it<00:04:12.859> might<00:04:12.980> feel<00:04:13.400> like<00:04:13.609> there<00:04:13.819> is

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
however it might feel like there is

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.930 
however it might feel like there is
because<00:04:14.510> of<00:04:14.629> the<00:04:14.720> control<00:04:15.140> stick<00:04:15.880> there's<00:04:16.880> a

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
because of the control stick there's a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.330 
because of the control stick there's a
little<00:04:17.329> bit<00:04:17.479> it<00:04:17.840> seems<00:04:18.169> a<00:04:18.320> little<00:04:18.709> bit<00:04:19.220> like

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
little bit it seems a little bit like

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.520 
little bit it seems a little bit like
there's<00:04:19.609> a<00:04:19.699> delay<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.810> the<00:04:21.079> reason<00:04:21.350> for<00:04:21.380> that

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
there's a delay and the reason for that

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.170 
there's a delay and the reason for that
is<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:21.979> control<00:04:22.340> stick<00:04:22.490> is<00:04:22.639> larger<00:04:23.180> and<00:04:23.650> and

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
is the control stick is larger and and

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.760 
is the control stick is larger and and
has<00:04:26.180> more<00:04:26.419> reach<00:04:26.660> than<00:04:26.690> the<00:04:27.080> control<00:04:27.440> stick<00:04:27.590> on

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
has more reach than the control stick on

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.250 
has more reach than the control stick on
me<00:04:27.949> on<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.000> class<00:04:29.600> controller<00:04:29.990> as<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.169> can

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
me on the class controller as you can

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.430 
me on the class controller as you can
see<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.530> only<00:04:30.650> goes<00:04:30.919> to<00:04:31.280> a<00:04:31.310> certain<00:04:31.729> degree

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
see it only goes to a certain degree

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.300 
see it only goes to a certain degree
whereas<00:04:33.440> a<00:04:33.470> game<00:04:33.710> view<00:04:33.830> controller<00:04:33.860> goes<00:04:34.280> a

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
whereas a game view controller goes a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:39.810 
whereas a game view controller goes a
little<00:04:34.400> bit<00:04:34.580> farther<00:04:34.910> and<00:04:35.210> in<00:04:36.110> each<00:04:36.320> direction

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.430 

here<00:04:40.820> is<00:04:40.940> proof<00:04:41.300> that<00:04:41.600> the<00:04:41.990> controller

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
here is proof that the controller

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.950 
here is proof that the controller
doesn't<00:04:42.860> lag<00:04:43.400> or<00:04:44.380> is<00:04:45.380> on<00:04:45.860> par<00:04:46.310> with<00:04:46.669> the<00:04:47.479> actual

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
doesn't lag or is on par with the actual

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.830 
doesn't lag or is on par with the actual
classic<00:04:48.410> controller<00:04:49.449> I'll<00:04:50.449> hold<00:04:50.720> them

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
classic controller I'll hold them

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.420 
classic controller I'll hold them
sideways<00:04:51.289> so<00:04:51.470> it's<00:04:51.590> easy<00:04:51.740> for<00:04:52.039> me<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.160> grab

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
sideways so it's easy for me to grab

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.339 
sideways so it's easy for me to grab
them<00:04:52.729> and<00:04:53.000> press<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.599> button<00:04:53.690> at<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.199> same

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
them and press the a button at the same

00:04:54.349 --> 00:05:07.029 
them and press the a button at the same
time<00:04:58.000> no<00:04:59.139> perceivable<00:05:00.139> delay<00:05:00.530> there<00:05:05.889> so<00:05:06.889> is

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
time no perceivable delay there so is

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.300 
time no perceivable delay there so is
the<00:05:07.160> may<00:05:07.310> flash<00:05:07.610> adapter<00:05:08.180> a<00:05:08.210> bi<00:05:09.039> well<00:05:10.039> if

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
the may flash adapter a bi well if

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.860 
the may flash adapter a bi well if
you're<00:05:10.520> married<00:05:11.000> to<00:05:11.180> your<00:05:11.210> GameCube

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
controller than I'd say so

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.279 
controller than I'd say so
especially<00:05:14.120> for<00:05:14.270> Super<00:05:14.570> Smash<00:05:14.660> Brothers<00:05:14.960> or<00:05:15.260> a

especially for Super Smash Brothers or a
game<00:05:15.500> like<00:05:15.680> that<00:05:16.090> however<00:05:17.090> there<00:05:17.270> are<00:05:17.479> some

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
game like that however there are some

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.400 
game like that however there are some
defects<00:05:18.620> and<00:05:18.919> it's<00:05:19.760> so<00:05:20.300> close<00:05:20.690> to<00:05:20.720> perfect<00:05:21.110> but

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
defects and it's so close to perfect but

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.010 
defects and it's so close to perfect but
not<00:05:21.680> quite<00:05:22.070> there<00:05:22.400> if<00:05:22.699> you're<00:05:23.389> waiting<00:05:23.900> for

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
not quite there if you're waiting for

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
the upcoming Super Smash Brothers game I

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.450 
the upcoming Super Smash Brothers game I
would<00:05:26.570> recommend<00:05:27.020> trying<00:05:27.229> maybe<00:05:27.740> a<00:05:27.919> different

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
would recommend trying maybe a different

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.510 
would recommend trying maybe a different
control<00:05:28.820> scheme<00:05:29.360> or<00:05:29.570> the<00:05:29.949> Wii<00:05:30.949> U<00:05:31.250> pro

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
control scheme or the Wii U pro

control scheme or the Wii U pro
controller<00:05:32.169> now<00:05:33.169> it's<00:05:33.940> essentially

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
controller now it's essentially

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.260 
controller now it's essentially
blasphemy<00:05:36.530> that<00:05:36.680> I<00:05:36.710> say<00:05:37.010> that<00:05:37.250> because<00:05:38.060> I

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
blasphemy that I say that because I

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.240 
blasphemy that I say that because I
would<00:05:38.449> that<00:05:38.750> not<00:05:38.930> have<00:05:38.990> dreamed<00:05:39.560> of<00:05:40.010> using

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:40.250 
would that not have dreamed of using

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:41.620 
would that not have dreamed of using
anything<00:05:40.940> else<00:05:41.090> in<00:05:41.240> the<00:05:41.330> game<00:05:41.510> view

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
anything else in the game view

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:45.450 
anything else in the game view
controller<00:05:42.099> but<00:05:43.099> I'm<00:05:43.430> not<00:05:43.789> willing<00:05:44.180> to<00:05:44.419> have<00:05:45.380> a

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
controller but I'm not willing to have a

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:50.110 
controller but I'm not willing to have a
compromising<00:05:46.460> experience<00:05:47.530> with<00:05:48.530> the<00:05:49.120> control

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
compromising experience with the control

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.219 
compromising experience with the control
even<00:05:51.020> if<00:05:51.289> it's<00:05:51.440> with<00:05:51.590> my<00:05:51.770> favorite<00:05:52.159> controller

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
even if it's with my favorite controller

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.719 
even if it's with my favorite controller
so<00:05:54.229> I<00:05:54.260> will<00:05:54.500> continue<00:05:54.889> to<00:05:55.070> try<00:05:55.340> to<00:05:55.430> use<00:05:55.639> the

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
so I will continue to try to use the

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.610 
so I will continue to try to use the
GameCube<00:05:56.060> controller<00:05:56.419> but<00:05:57.080> it<00:05:57.200> just<00:05:57.409> isn't

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
GameCube controller but it just isn't

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.280 
GameCube controller but it just isn't
quite<00:05:58.219> the<00:05:58.460> same

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:00.290 
quite the same
