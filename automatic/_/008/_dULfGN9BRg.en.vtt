00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
section below I honestly don't really

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.449 
section below I honestly don't really
care<00:03:26.290> too<00:03:26.440> much<00:03:26.500> about<00:03:26.650> this<00:03:27.010> type<00:03:27.250> of<00:03:27.280> an

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
care too much about this type of an

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.370 
care too much about this type of an
argument<00:03:27.610> because<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.299> truth<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:29.140> last

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
argument because the truth is the last

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.570 
argument because the truth is the last
game<00:03:29.590> that<00:03:29.799> I<00:03:29.830> played<00:03:30.190> that<00:03:30.459> was

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
game that I played that was

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.250 
game that I played that was
traditionally<00:03:31.180> single-player<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:31.780> added<00:03:32.200> a

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
traditionally single-player and added a

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.840 
traditionally single-player and added a
multi<00:03:32.560> player<00:03:32.799> actually<00:03:33.310> turned<00:03:33.730> out

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
multi player actually turned out

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.820 
multi player actually turned out
fantastic<00:03:34.060> I'm<00:03:34.810> talking<00:03:35.170> about<00:03:35.320> mass<00:03:35.500> effect

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
fantastic I'm talking about mass effect

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.340 
fantastic I'm talking about mass effect
3<00:03:36.100> I<00:03:36.310> like<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.209> multiplayer<00:03:37.750> mass<00:03:38.049> effect

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350

3 I like to the multiplayer mass effect
3<00:03:38.590> more<00:03:38.920> than<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.160> liked<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:39.549> single-player

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
3 more than I liked the single-player

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.210 
3 more than I liked the single-player
campaign<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:40.930> that's<00:03:41.380> saying<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.769> lot<00:03:41.799> because

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
campaign and that's saying a lot because

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.430 
campaign and that's saying a lot because
I<00:03:42.790> actually<00:03:42.970> really<00:03:43.420> enjoyed<00:03:43.720> mass<00:03:43.959> effect<00:03:44.320> in

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
I actually really enjoyed mass effect in

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.380 
I actually really enjoyed mass effect in
the<00:03:44.530> past<00:03:44.769> so<00:03:45.370> what<00:03:45.820> do<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:45.970> guys<00:03:46.030> think<00:03:46.090> about

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
the past so what do you guys think about

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.330 
the past so what do you guys think about
this<00:03:46.630> argument<00:03:46.959> once<00:03:47.440> again<00:03:47.709> I'm<00:03:47.950> not<00:03:48.160> really

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
this argument once again I'm not really

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.070 
this argument once again I'm not really
too<00:03:48.549> concerned<00:03:48.580> about<00:03:49.030> it<00:03:49.180> I'm<00:03:49.630> not<00:03:49.810> going<00:03:50.019> to

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
too concerned about it I'm not going to

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.080 
too concerned about it I'm not going to
say<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:50.410> any<00:03:50.620> development<00:03:51.220> time<00:03:51.400> taken<00:03:51.880> away

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
say that any development time taken away

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.030 
say that any development time taken away
from<00:03:52.330> a<00:03:52.420> multiplayer<00:03:52.959> mode<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.410> going<00:03:53.920> to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
from a multiplayer mode is going to

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.830 
from a multiplayer mode is going to
completely<00:03:54.220> detract<00:03:54.970> from<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.180> story<00:03:55.570> in<00:03:55.780> the

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
completely detract from the story in the

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.990 
completely detract from the story in the
main<00:03:55.989> campaign<00:03:56.500> sure<00:03:57.220> it's<00:03:57.519> money<00:03:57.790> being

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
main campaign sure it's money being

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.490 
main campaign sure it's money being
spent<00:03:58.239> elsewhere<00:03:58.630> that<00:03:59.140> could<00:03:59.320> have<00:03:59.410> been

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
spent elsewhere that could have been

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.470 
spent elsewhere that could have been
pumped<00:03:59.890> into<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.130> main<00:04:00.340> campaign<00:04:00.820> but<00:04:01.360> that

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
pumped into the main campaign but that

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.580 
pumped into the main campaign but that
doesn't<00:04:01.750> mean<00:04:01.840> that<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.049> main<00:04:02.170> campaign

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
doesn't mean that the main campaign

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.590 
doesn't mean that the main campaign
would<00:04:02.830> have<00:04:02.980> been<00:04:03.130> any<00:04:03.310> better<00:04:03.580> just<00:04:04.330> maybe

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:04.600 
would have been any better just maybe

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.420 
would have been any better just maybe
would<00:04:04.870> have<00:04:04.959> cost<00:04:05.170> more<00:04:05.500> money<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:06.040> that's

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
would have cost more money and that's

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.680 
would have cost more money and that's
going<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.670> do<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:06.850> for<00:04:06.940> today's<00:04:07.180> episode<00:04:07.209> of
