me quite a bit to get this thing back

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.070 
me quite a bit to get this thing back
lined<00:01:21.560> up<00:01:21.760> I<00:01:22.760> don't<00:01:23.360> know<00:01:23.420> why<00:01:23.570> it<00:01:23.720> fought<00:01:23.930> me

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
lined up I don't know why it fought me

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.010 
lined up I don't know why it fought me
the<00:01:24.110> lot<00:01:24.320> of<00:01:24.410> time<00:01:24.670> thinking<00:01:25.720> maybe<00:01:26.720> because

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
the lot of time thinking maybe because

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.840 
the lot of time thinking maybe because
of<00:01:27.050> the<00:01:27.170> subframe<00:01:27.950> and<00:01:27.980> the<00:01:28.190> rad<00:01:28.340> cradle<00:01:28.730> was

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
of the subframe and the rad cradle was

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.140 
of the subframe and the rad cradle was
out<00:01:29.030> so<00:01:29.870> that<00:01:30.190> may<00:01:31.190> be<00:01:31.250> tweaked<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.760> little<00:01:31.790> bit

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
out so that may be tweaked a little bit

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:39.040 
out so that may be tweaked a little bit
but<00:01:32.780> I<00:01:32.840> had<00:01:33.020> to<00:01:36.820> move<00:01:37.820> my<00:01:37.880> whole<00:01:38.330> rad<00:01:38.570> cradle

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
but I had to move my whole rad cradle

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.970 
but I had to move my whole rad cradle
over<00:01:39.350> a<00:01:39.380> good<00:01:40.630> i'd<00:01:41.630> say<00:01:41.900> a<00:01:41.930> good<00:01:42.020> inch<00:01:42.500> to<00:01:42.830> get

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
over a good i'd say a good inch to get

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.030 
over a good i'd say a good inch to get
everything<00:01:43.250> back<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:43.610> square<00:01:44.560> the<00:01:45.560> gaps<00:01:45.770> are

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 
everything back to square the gaps are

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.380 
everything back to square the gaps are
back<00:01:46.940> to<00:01:47.120> the<00:01:47.210> where<00:01:47.360> to<00:01:47.810> where<00:01:47.900> i<00:01:47.960> had<00:01:48.080> them

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
back to the where to where i had them

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.770 
back to the where to where i had them
this<00:01:50.390> size<00:01:50.660> just<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.200> tad<00:01:51.440> tighter<00:01:52.030> but<00:01:53.030> i'll

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
this size just a tad tighter but i'll

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.300 
this size just a tad tighter but i'll
see<00:01:53.990> if<00:01:54.080> i<00:01:54.200> can<00:01:54.380> play<00:01:54.560> with<00:01:54.740> that<00:01:54.770> a<00:01:54.920> little<00:01:55.070> bit

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
see if i can play with that a little bit

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.620 
see if i can play with that a little bit
more<00:01:55.810> but<00:01:56.810> other<00:01:56.930> than<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.880> cows<00:01:59.090> fit<00:01:59.510> in

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
more but other than that the cows fit in

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.200 
more but other than that the cows fit in
okay<00:01:59.920> seems<00:02:00.920> a<00:02:01.040> little<00:02:01.250> wide<00:02:01.580> right<00:02:01.940> in<00:02:02.090> the

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
okay seems a little wide right in the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.320 
okay seems a little wide right in the
center<00:02:02.540> there<00:02:02.720> i<00:02:04.000> don't<00:02:05.000> know<00:02:05.180> if<00:02:05.300> that<00:02:05.330> thing

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
center there i don't know if that thing

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.580 
center there i don't know if that thing
maybe<00:02:08.330> distort<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.899> little<00:02:09.110> bit<00:02:09.230> when<00:02:09.380> I<00:02:09.410> was

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
maybe distort a little bit when I was

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:15.130 
maybe distort a little bit when I was
standing<00:02:09.980> it<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:12.100> pretty<00:02:13.100> flimsy<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:14.020> what<00:02:15.020> the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
standing it is pretty flimsy so what the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.030 
standing it is pretty flimsy so what the
gaps<00:02:15.320> are<00:02:15.650> good<00:02:15.830> on<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.640> doors<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.239> hood<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:18.790> I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
gaps are good on the doors the hood so I

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.930 
gaps are good on the doors the hood so I
think<00:02:22.040> I'll<00:02:22.220> leave<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.459> like<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:22.580> for<00:02:22.760> now

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
think I'll leave it like this for now

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.820 
think I'll leave it like this for now
maybe<00:02:23.239> block<00:02:23.630> it<00:02:23.840> and<00:02:23.870> see<00:02:24.470> how<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.650> turns

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
maybe block it and see how that turns

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.930 
maybe block it and see how that turns
out<00:02:25.190> after<00:02:25.670> what<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.230> other<00:02:27.230> than<00:02:27.380> that

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
out after what the other than that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.410 
out after what the other than that
everything<00:02:28.940> looks<00:02:29.060> pretty<00:02:29.300> good<00:02:29.570> so

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.080
