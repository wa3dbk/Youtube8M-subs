 Welcome to the information of who 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.770
 I slept hart 3 finally guys has announced 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.750
 this great game is not announced 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.670
 but a new trailer has come out and has 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.740
 finally left some history and something 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.360
 more than what had already finally come out 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.520
 you see that the game is much more solid and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.859
 there are also new things like the new 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880
 disney world of entangled of the world 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.350
 tangled up the truth that I did not expect 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.449
 for nothing that was entangled this 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.980
 I expected more frozen but I think 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.810
 that if it's tangled, be sure it's going 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.369
 to be frozen in this game let's go I'm 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.900
 practically sure finally I'm 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.189
 watching gameplay is boiling two 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.559
 people who have left at the beginning of 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.510
 bring talking and playing chess is 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.430
 The young man was Cino de Kino at Harvard 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.660
 lose and sleep that is older and the young 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.460

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.320
 from that scene of why are you scene 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.879
 they do playing chess and that 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.500
 big sword that comes out I do not know if he has 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.000
 seen already but good comes out of everything 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.860
 the gameplay I repeat the gameplay is here 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.629
 see it more detailed and with money with the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.340
 sound say of one 's own 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.600
 trailer touches the protection because if 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.070
 they do not catch me copyright you know how it goes 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.449
 the theme of this youtube I get caught 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.010
 extra copyright and mention the channel and 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.350
 take for what the purpose as I say the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.450
 trailer is spectacular the gameplay me 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.219
 I loved it, I know what 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.140
 nomura that is the developer of this 

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:12.450
 game always goes one step further each 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.920
 who hard it creates and this I repeat is 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.140
 spectacular as you see this is the new 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.880
 It is now considerably higher than in who 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.259
 a hard 2 with new clothes that is the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.990
 new design is now the new 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.189
 hairstyle now is cool mola I like it 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.380
 2 is now this saying was not controlled 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.210
 God you notice the change but never 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.979
 I thought or did not think God did not 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.409
 like this change but with a change 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.179
 and let's say that the change was not accepted 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.890
 like the time is that I do not know maybe the 

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:36.420
 hype that is consuming me may 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.159
 be the hype I mean it but the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.080
 game itself I loved the tereré 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.520
 I'm stupid, I do not know if I'm 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.619
 Well, I think it made me cry 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.869
 I do not know maximum will be in tears uff 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.369
 clear that there is still brutal that 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.750
 say they have repeated as a thing 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.640
 negative have repeated several worlds in 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.090
 this world already twilight already then already what 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.439
 put in the 2013 teler and have also 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.119
 repeated the world of hercules that the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.209
 culés was also confirmed was confirmed 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.789
 there were twilight hercules and entangled there 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.920
 I know what worlds or what more world will know but 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.630
 basically I'm sure they're going to be 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.700
 typical of always and some other 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.590
 new there are hints invocation of pegasus 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.970
 those that do not session in magical vocations or 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.920
 that damn 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.780
 I do not know what it is exactly but your mind 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.760
 be something playable or something new here is 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.760
 the sword that I have commented before I do not know 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.220
 who is perhaps the father of xian 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.410
 port in works that I have no idea 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.750
 Maybe it's already known, but I do not think 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.610
 knows and is let's say the secret of the game 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.440
 you see because we know who is good 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.260
 because we know that it will be cus and sir 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.000
 the eyes basically and here ends the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.960
 teino de kino heart is pretty short 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.610
 but God knows what I'm looking forward to 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.230
 the issue of when many people will leave 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.450
 Many people have asked me 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.180
 question already in his own house and that is 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.380
 nobody knows it salsero knows nomura that is 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.860
 the creator the developer of this 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.810
 game 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.920
 you know what nomura is doing or good 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.330
 finished a few months ago 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.720
 develop or good went the 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.920
 development let's say of final fantasy 15 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.230
 He said that he had finished his work and 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.030
 started to develop in a hard 3 leads 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.680
 already a few months or you can even 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.390
 carry some other year one so 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.740
 least I believe between eight months and 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.230
 One year carries or should carry more or 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.760
 less developing this game and I do not know 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.800
 how long do you have to take with how long 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.090
 in developing this game this that wet 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.370
 three why 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.080
 is that yesterday it was confirmed that it will come out 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.209
 the remake of final fantasy 7 and the 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.650
 director is nomura also then no 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.209
 I know how the thing is going I do not know when it's going 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.910
 to be this game I think that outside 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.349
 15 fantasy due out in early 2016 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.959
 this team hard 3 I think it's going to 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:33.030
 leave or at the end of 2017 with water to 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:36.959
 late 2000 or early 2016 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.910
 2017 and the remake of final fantasy 7 knew 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.910
 which will be released at the beginning of 17-oa 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.530
 end of the 17th is that there is no more is that 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.670
 I deduce that I infer that the final fantasy 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.360
 7 has to leave on the 20th anniversary 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.980
 not in 2017 because it came out in 1997 I do not know 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.840
 we'll see guys there are a lot 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.459
 work ahead but what should be 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.410
 what you are seeing from whom a hard 3 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.099
 the story we know that it will be fine 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.540
 that is 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.310
 nomura knows how to make good stories or for 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:01.379
 annoy of kingdom hearts if I follow 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.190
 doing wrong is not going to be not 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.480
 the pot is going to go 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.040
 everyone knows it so the game 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.510
 guys is in good hands because it's 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.370
 in the hands of the creator and that always 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.769
 it's fine so nothing we'll see the subject 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.299
 of final fantasy 15 the final fantasy 7 a 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.829
 see how it goes but I'm from 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.450
 then in Nomura he will do a good 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.709
 fifth hard 3 I'm pretty sure 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.539
 when it's going to come out we have no idea 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.639
 but well at least we have 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.170
 contented with a trailer in this 3 and 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.580
 what a damn trailer 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.020
 you can leave a layman a comment all 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.180
 what you want and see you tomorrow with 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.180
