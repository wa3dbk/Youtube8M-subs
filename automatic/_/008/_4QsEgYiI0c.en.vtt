00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.420 
have been playing ever since I got this
like<00:01:42.540> two<00:01:42.689> weeks<00:01:42.869> ago<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.159> fun

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
like two weeks ago so it's really fun

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.550 
like two weeks ago so it's really fun
I've<00:01:44.579> been<00:01:44.700> doing<00:01:44.909> be<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> pro<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:46.200> ultimate

I've been doing be a pro the ultimate

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.219 
I've been doing be a pro the ultimate
team<00:01:46.799> whatever<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.750> really<00:01:48.990> fun

team whatever this that it's really fun
so<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.439> thought<00:01:49.680> I'd<00:01:49.799> make<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> series<00:01:50.579> about

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
so I thought I'd make a series about

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.770 
so I thought I'd make a series about
this<00:01:50.880> because<00:01:51.030> I'm<00:01:51.090> having<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.299> blast<00:01:51.450> playing

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
this because I'm having a blast playing

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.380 
this because I'm having a blast playing
it<00:01:52.079> maybe<00:01:52.560> I'd<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.399> blast<00:01:53.700> making<00:01:54.180> video

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
it maybe I'd have a blast making video

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.980 
it maybe I'd have a blast making video
so<00:01:54.689> I'm<00:01:55.229> gonna<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:55.740> art<00:01:56.540> yes<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.810> don't
