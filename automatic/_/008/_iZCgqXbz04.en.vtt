00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.350
 for his boys to the house of the fruit 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.090
 and here me that this is new more than play 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.650
 for fake that to start as you see 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.910
 this is the team we say in the first 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.980
 game I tell you this will be the last 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.400
 episode of forfait in up to 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.400
 Monday because hopefully Saturday is hoped 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.010
 hopefully you a little prayer make it that 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.050
 Andre uploading his video and then Friday 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:34.090
 or tomorrow or the opposite tomorrow 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.370
 he is saved this other there will be a 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.500
 another video that will be for some of you 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.350
 very interesting then in then state 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.420
 be careful not for everyone will be a video 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.909
 let's say there will be gameplay though 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.780
 we will say some very interesting things to 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:52.479
 for some people these people maybe 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.699
 are you said this let's start with 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:55.870
 the episode will be three games considering that 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:58.120
 the last episode decided to make three 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.030
 leave and start well with this one 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.799
 first game 1 0 after a while then pass 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.540
 second time shooting of a piece of furniture arrives 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:06.130
 cassano cassano you said to be discharged 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.260
 the whole team is not true 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.260
 but only one shot is nice to say e 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.390
 to make the goal of two to zero is the hotel 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.609
 fantastic that wo n't last yet 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.590
 very much I say it because it is anyway 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:21.430
 slow, however, clicks are phenomenal 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:24.399
 look at this cassano tac try one 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.750
 reversed abbot abbot case at random 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.450
 Abbot starts the save shot 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.420
 arrive from game three to zero then a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.359
 71ยบ game enough we say in 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.750
 safety put in safety by 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:38.829
 this team a little bit 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:43.149
 remodeled with reservations was 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:45.909
 the reds were still there 4 3 3 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.740
 and when there is not 4 3 3 why those 4 3 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.439
 3 rest we don't say for that 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.869
 period is like this and here is the 4 to 0 with 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.569
 reds that by now you know it doesn't me 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.210
 going crazy though is really very precise 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:00.759
 and 80 finalization now I don't know about 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.500
 paper as I have but let's say if it arises 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.840
 on the field to that 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.399
 action 40 this game ends here 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.509
 so we start very very well and 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.850
 we make the second victory of the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.670
 division we are two wins are sheet 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.580
 and then you see change a little bit I leave the 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.220
 module because it was intriguing anyway 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.690
 I take off or maybe I had already taken off and I didn't 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.680
 I said ok however I return to 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.330
 bonaventura instead of jerseys 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.550
 because there is something to say that is not 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.900
 I can support goes to balotelli al 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.350
 place of reds because in any case balotelli 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.030
 always holder and between red and mobile 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.340
 I prefer to remove reds also because 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.970
 however the furniture in the field is also there 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.239
 maybe try to see some sort of 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.820
 fence here here look at who 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.590
 with that daddy who goals later after only 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.270
 three minutes and then I changed 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.120
 something else but nothing that anyway 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.620
 the team more or less is that and second 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.840
 game we leave immediately as strong as you have 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.330
 seen the goals of real estate after three minutes 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.980
 and then you go to the fortieth for the goal 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.620
 which closes the game 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.930
 balotelli long long va of left 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.640
 that's just that sweet one 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.590
 that arrives slowly plan but that the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.739
 goalkeeper ca n't get two to zero 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.780
 at the fortieth then I can no longer 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.610
 let us penetrate his defenses 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.890
 he closes well but fails to 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.320
 do lots of throws or rather fails to 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.120
 make dangerous shots and I do the 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.769
 third win third win that I did 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.900
 leads to nine points so we are a point 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.630
 from salvation but salvation we say 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.580
 which is not really our goal 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.799
 we absolutely want to be 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.180
 promoted and win the division because 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.190
 we want to win everything we are 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.049
 Italy must always win everything and 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.519
 you go to play the third game three 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:43.239
 game I play against this team 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:45.220
 which he first says 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.989
 it's not much but I assure you that 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.209
 Portuguese shore really a dam 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.549
 very strong morning partly very strong 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.049
 after five minutes if I type I have to do one 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.760
 statistics of goals taken within the first 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.410
 ten minutes I think 70 percent 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.460
 of goals taken 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.240
 let's say in the first half 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:03.620
 gives us an absurd thing I always take goals 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.240
 but fortunately the ca equalize to 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.040
 3 balotelli great acceleration cross 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.250
 essre oil in for a goal a little 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.380
 ugly you do not get angry 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.260
 I could not pull from the line of 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:18.070
 in short, I don't get pissed off either 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:21.140
 is crossed to score goals is cooked 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.690
 sorry if the goal will not go but he will 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.150
 incazza unleashes all the power of 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.100
 varela what kind looks like a charter of 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.870
 magic common diego with a bar and the e 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.500
 looks like a wild monster 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.080
 ugliness stuff and he makes me 2 1 and then me 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.080
 it will also do the 31st identical action 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.240
 no throw for varzi jokes but 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.910
 above all the tension that perhaps was de 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.650
 in this game or in between 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.570
 decides abbot forget 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.620
 completely of varela do not mark it 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:56.330
 also because it was aps and therefore not 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.770
 in short, there is some space between the marking 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.040
 the fullback the defender of the thing 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.470
 let's say more complicated than defending 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.130
 against the module than at the half points and at me 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.180
 does the 3 2 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.770
 second time I can do this 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.150
 shorten the result with this one 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.800
 then beautifully decorated with balotelli 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.510
 I can even draw with cerci 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.370
 concepts that everyone discards 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.910
 great parade then comes the sharaawy for 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:24.890
 the brace maybe I remember well between 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:27.410
 unfortunately he manages to get me 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.260
 43 in fact or let's say I try to 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.360
 win this game because anyway 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.880
 in short, three against a team almost 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.590
 the whole gold does not look bright 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.150
 not even mentally win you 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.510
 satisfied with the draw even if type 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.950
 the strong opponent for example 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.540
 much stronger than me because anyway 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.190
 had the weakest team has me 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.870
 beaten then technically stronger than 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:52.940
 me you when you see the gold gold team not 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.940
 brilliant you want to beat it for, say 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.690
 because you want to beat her because the truth 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.680
 is lower than the values โโthrow ahead e 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:00.780
 I take the goal 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.660
 claro on the break as all the 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.040
 other inter alia test first defeat 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:07.950
 in this division we are between victory 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:10.680
 a defeat 9 points as always vi 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.150
 let's say the usual directions for 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.830
 put I like to comment etc. e 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.830
 we can't feel it
