billed did a video about running using
an<00:00:30.960> external<00:00:31.260> battery<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.250> UPS<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.329> I

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
an external battery with a UPS and I

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.830 
an external battery with a UPS and I
decided<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.200> was<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.530> do<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.920> same<00:00:35.219> thing

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
bought some wire a few connectors i

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.529 
bought some wire a few connectors i
didn't<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:44.489> lawn<00:00:44.789> tractor<00:00:44.820> battery

didn't have and a lawn tractor battery

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.830 
didn't have and a lawn tractor battery
that's<00:00:46.850> twenty<00:00:47.850> eight<00:00:48.000> dollars<00:00:48.030> for<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that's twenty eight dollars for that

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.560 
that's twenty eight dollars for that
battery<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.710> proper<00:00:50.370> replacement<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.120> cheaper

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
battery a proper replacement is cheaper

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.529 
battery a proper replacement is cheaper
but<00:00:51.750> one<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.710> these<00:00:52.860> should<00:00:53.190> run<00:00:53.520> longer<00:00:53.820> I've

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
but one of these should run longer I've

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
but one of these should run longer I've
gotta<00:00:56.930> also<00:00:57.930> bought<00:00:58.140> some<00:00:58.469> crimp<00:00:58.739> connectors

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
gotta also bought some crimp connectors

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.080 
gotta also bought some crimp connectors

now internally the UPS is wired with 14
gauge<00:01:03.739> however<00:01:04.739> because<00:01:05.100> of<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.610> link<00:01:05.880> i

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
gauge however because of the link i

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.020 
gauge however because of the link i
wanted<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.229> have<00:01:07.409> plenty<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.920> why<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.220> case<00:01:08.670> of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
wanted to have plenty of why in case of

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.570 
wanted to have plenty of why in case of
the<00:01:09.780> battery<00:01:10.229> had<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.710> some<00:01:11.010> distance<00:01:11.490> from

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
the battery had to be some distance from

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.340 
the battery had to be some distance from
the<00:01:11.880> UPS<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.810> i<00:01:13.080> went<00:01:13.290> ahead<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.500> use<00:01:13.710> 12<00:01:14.189> gauge

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
the UPS so i went ahead and use 12 gauge

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.580 
the UPS so i went ahead and use 12 gauge
however<00:01:16.350> for<00:01:16.970> safety<00:01:17.970> i<00:01:18.180> did<00:01:18.540> use<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> 15<00:01:19.380> amp

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
however for safety i did use a 15 amp

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.800 
however for safety i did use a 15 amp
fuse<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.509> see<00:01:21.659> i<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:22.080> used<00:01:23.810> just

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
fuse so and you can see i just used just

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.840 
fuse so and you can see i just used just
crimp<00:01:25.110> connectors<00:01:25.560> right<00:01:25.770> onto<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> fuse<00:01:26.549> which

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
crimp connectors right onto a fuse which

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.160 
crimp connectors right onto a fuse which
actually<00:01:28.490> you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.180> junk<00:01:30.630> AP

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
actually you can see on this junk AP

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.060 
actually you can see on this junk AP
much<00:01:31.740> larger<00:01:32.280> junked<00:01:32.700> APC<00:01:33.299> UPS<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:34.110> exactly

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
much larger junked APC UPS is exactly

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.030 
much larger junked APC UPS is exactly
how<00:01:35.369> they<00:01:35.610> did<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.380> however<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.590> course<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
how they did it however of course on a

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.130 
how they did it however of course on a
much<00:01:38.280> larger<00:01:38.490> scale<00:01:38.729> that's<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.450> 60<00:01:39.900> right

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
much larger scale that's a 60 right

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.609 
much larger scale that's a 60 right
there<00:01:42.710> but<00:01:43.710> anyway<00:01:44.220> i<00:01:44.930> just<00:01:45.930> ran<00:01:46.229> right<00:01:46.259> out

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
there but anyway i just ran right out

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.069 
there but anyway i just ran right out
the<00:01:46.920> vent<00:01:47.159> holes<00:01:47.460> i<00:01:47.700> didn't<00:01:48.450> grum<00:01:48.689> at<00:01:48.899> this

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
the vent holes i didn't grum at this

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.840 
the vent holes i didn't grum at this
side<00:01:49.320> i<00:01:49.350> probably<00:01:49.829> should<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.340> however<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
side i probably should have however the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.020 
side i probably should have however the
other<00:01:51.000> side<00:01:51.299> is<00:01:51.540> grommeted<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.619> hot<00:01:52.860> glued<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
other side is grommeted and hot glued to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.840 
other side is grommeted and hot glued to
make<00:01:54.420> sure<00:01:54.570> it<00:01:54.689> doesn't<00:01:54.899> rub<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:56.280> fuse<00:01:56.579> acts

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
make sure it doesn't rub the fuse acts

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.060 
make sure it doesn't rub the fuse acts
as<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> quick<00:01:57.390> disconnect<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.380> case<00:01:58.619> i<00:01:58.799> need<00:01:58.829> to

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
as a quick disconnect in case i need to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.190 
as a quick disconnect in case i need to
move<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.430> two<00:01:59.640> and<00:02:00.000> then<00:02:00.570> i've<00:02:00.719> got<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.930> quick

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
move to two and then i've got a quick

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.560 
move to two and then i've got a quick
disconnect<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.250> negative<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.030> i<00:02:03.090> can<00:02:03.360> just

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
disconnect on negative so i can just

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.859 
disconnect on negative so i can just
unhook<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.610> separate<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> two<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.390> case<00:02:06.719> i

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
unhook it and separate the two in case i

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.230 
unhook it and separate the two in case i
need<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.170> move<00:02:07.350> them<00:02:07.649> makes

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
need to move them makes

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.350 
need to move them makes
moving<00:02:08.420> around<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.690> lot<00:02:08.780> easier<00:02:09.080> but<00:02:10.360> anyway

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
moving around a lot easier but anyway

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.940 
moving around a lot easier but anyway
that's<00:02:11.570> what<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:11.810> got<00:02:12.050> going<00:02:12.080> I've<00:02:14.620> I've<00:02:15.620> got<00:02:15.830> it
