00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.270
 hi guys this is the new blog of 

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:06.109
 anime and manga ita because I'm doing 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.720
 this blog 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.950
 because there is this light that does so well 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.100
 there are so many things we need to know about 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.300
 we have to talk number one there is phone 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.790
 what I use beautiful shots has 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.500
 practically half impallato therefore can 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.710
 be that the audio of this video is 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.720
 a little for his dicks 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.820
 but I can't edit the video because 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.470
 I find myself with a computer in the case 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.329
 how my nexus two the point is 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.090
 find with the appropriate computer in 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:42.290
 this moment to understand this by 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.430
 when book of the case to call is also 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.950
 my 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.950
 and therefore and therefore and therefore and therefore 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.579
 sticazzi I can't count anything then 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.270
 you will tell yourself 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:56.450
 so this week nothing milan 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.170
 bortel no the video maybe there will be but not 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.489
 my 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:05.479
 I think cusa magicians because I have my him 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:09.429
 mount someone else and be careful 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.429
 to the problem of audio you create a slaughterhouse 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.810
 or someone or another 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.549
 video of course not what we are 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.579
 because what they want at all 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.579
 costs 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.899
 having said that I hope I have given you so many 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.329
 information this video probably 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:32.549
 despite two minutes at 20 it will be 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:35.369
 kind of 250 mega 300 mega that usually 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.479
 since they can't render it goes 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.460
 all screwed up and nothing nothing at all 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.450
 I hope I told you all I hope there is 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.850
 keep following and here you find the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.229
 new crazy video for sdr boys 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.830
 channel 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.479
 go look at I talk about something that 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.159
 this channel we will never deal with 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.619
 of a soul and mainstream that keeps in 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.869
 gurren lagann patch will be there in the future 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.459
 my comment spoilers like what 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.979
 some believe for the guillotine of 

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:06.509
 mainstream which of course will be positive 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.799
 since in the review he talked about it 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.959
 positively 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.690
 having said this guys thank you again 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.740
 why you follow us 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.600
 because you follow us but you are given us not 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.090
 I can edit the video of course because 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.490
 so i'm improvising all that 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.550
 which I wanted to say and thanks me again e 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.080
 we feel at the next opportunity 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:29.730
 hoping that my computer rises again and 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.690
 that next week may 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.520

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:40.170
