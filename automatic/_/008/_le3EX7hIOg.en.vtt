to making mango in mind locking cream

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.140 
to making mango in mind locking cream
wax<00:02:04.990> and<00:02:05.410> that's<00:02:06.280> before<00:02:06.550> I<00:02:06.820> did<00:02:07.000> my<00:02:07.120> research

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
wax and that's before I did my research

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.260 
wax and that's before I did my research
I<00:02:07.630> don't<00:02:07.780> really<00:02:07.870> know<00:02:08.430> too<00:02:09.430> much<00:02:09.460> about<00:02:09.850> the

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
I don't really know too much about the

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.480 
I don't really know too much about the
whole<00:02:10.420> wax<00:02:10.750> thing<00:02:11.080> but<00:02:11.400> surprisingly<00:02:12.400> it

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
whole wax thing but surprisingly it

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.340 
whole wax thing but surprisingly it
didn't<00:02:12.790> really<00:02:12.910> have<00:02:13.150> any<00:02:13.300> build-up<00:02:13.690> but<00:02:14.290> I

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
didn't really have any build-up but I

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.750 
didn't really have any build-up but I
didn't<00:02:14.560> want<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.710> continue<00:02:15.100> using<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.520> if<00:02:15.670> it

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
didn't want to continue using it if it

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.780 
didn't want to continue using it if it
was<00:02:15.850> going<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.030> be<00:02:16.120> powerful<00:02:17.190> so<00:02:18.190> that's<00:02:18.640> when

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
was going to be powerful so that's when

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.100 
was going to be powerful so that's when
I<00:02:18.820> switched<00:02:19.270> to<00:02:19.540> what<00:02:20.350> I<00:02:20.380> supposed<00:02:20.740> to<00:02:20.920> UM

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
chemicals so I'm going to be refreshing

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:18.729 
chemicals so I'm going to be refreshing
my<00:04:12.500> lock<00:04:13.190> coloring<00:04:13.700> with<00:04:13.910> henna<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:17.739> we'll

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
my lock coloring with henna and we'll

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.229 
my lock coloring with henna and we'll
see<00:04:18.890> how<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.040> works<00:04:19.250> i<00:04:19.340> know<00:04:19.400> hannah<00:04:19.760> has<00:04:19.970> like

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
see how it works i know hannah has like

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.120 
see how it works i know hannah has like
a<00:04:20.420> reddish<00:04:20.840> tint<00:04:21.110> to<00:04:21.260> it<00:04:21.290> but<00:04:21.590> they<00:04:21.680> say<00:04:21.860> the

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
a reddish tint to it but they say the

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.990 
a reddish tint to it but they say the
more<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.460> use<00:04:22.490> it<00:04:24.190> you<00:04:25.190> know<00:04:25.280> it<00:04:25.430> gets<00:04:25.550> darker

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
more you use it you know it gets darker

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.630 
more you use it you know it gets darker
each<00:04:26.150> time<00:04:26.450> so<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:27.020> guess<00:04:27.800> it<00:04:27.980> won't<00:04:28.130> be<00:04:28.280> jet

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
each time so I guess it won't be jet

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.520 
each time so I guess it won't be jet
black<00:04:28.940> I'll<00:04:29.150> just<00:04:29.300> have<00:04:29.450> like<00:04:29.600> a<00:04:29.660> red<00:04:29.960> tint<00:04:30.230> to

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.210 
black I'll just have like a red tint to
it<00:04:30.560> but<00:04:30.860> I<00:04:30.890> don't<00:04:31.010> mind<00:04:31.340> that<00:04:31.580> um<00:04:33.160> the<00:04:34.160> only

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
it but I don't mind that um the only

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.090 
it but I don't mind that um the only
problem<00:04:34.760> is<00:04:34.880> that<00:04:35.330> it<00:04:35.570> leaves<00:04:36.410> your<00:04:36.710> hair<00:04:37.040> a
