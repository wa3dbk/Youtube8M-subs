use it to record a movie online all we
could<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.170> like<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.649> hulu<00:00:47.100> here<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:48.360> can

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
could do that like on hulu here you can

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.549 
could do that like on hulu here you can
just<00:00:48.570> press<00:00:48.989> play<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:50.690> I<00:00:51.690> think<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.350> pretty

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
just press play and I think it's pretty

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.850 
just press play and I think it's pretty
cool<00:00:52.829> because<00:00:53.039> it's<00:00:53.250> resizable<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.590> what<00:00:55.590> I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
cool because it's resizable and what I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.069 
cool because it's resizable and what I
think<00:00:56.699> most<00:00:56.910> people<00:00:57.239> use<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.809> simply

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
think most people use it for is simply

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.799 
think most people use it for is simply
to<00:00:58.230> record<00:00:58.680> their<00:00:58.829> skype<00:00:59.129> videos<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
to record their skype videos and you

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.660 
to record their skype videos and you
just<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.039> set<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.460> full

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
just go out here to set it to full

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.479 
just go out here to set it to full
screen<00:01:03.199> but<00:01:04.199> what's<00:01:04.500> cool<00:01:04.799> about<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.430> that

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
screen but what's cool about it is that

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.149 
screen but what's cool about it is that
it's<00:01:05.909> resizable<00:01:06.659> and<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:07.439> allows<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.130> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
it's resizable and that allows you to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.620 
it's resizable and that allows you to
say<00:01:08.850> have<00:01:09.750> personal<00:01:10.650> information<00:01:11.280> down<00:01:12.180> here
