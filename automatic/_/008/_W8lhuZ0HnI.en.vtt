what's going on guys Keaton here from

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.700 
what's going on guys Keaton here from
techsmartt<00:00:05.750> and<00:00:05.930> today<00:00:06.080> we're<00:00:06.439> going<00:00:06.470> to<00:00:06.590> be

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
techsmartt and today we're going to be

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.440 
techsmartt and today we're going to be
looking<00:00:06.830> at<00:00:07.099> a<00:00:07.130> tweak<00:00:07.399> called<00:00:07.640> turn<00:00:08.300> off

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
looking at a tweak called turn off

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.110 
looking at a tweak called turn off
button<00:00:08.889> so<00:00:09.889> what<00:00:10.009> turn<00:00:10.219> off<00:00:10.309> button<00:00:10.639> does<00:00:10.849> it

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
button so what turn off button does it

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.329 
button so what turn off button does it
allows<00:00:11.419> you<00:00:11.660> to<00:00:11.839> assign<00:00:12.469> a<00:00:12.530> specific<00:00:12.860> command

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:13.339 
allows you to assign a specific command

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:16.209 
allows you to assign a specific command
to<00:00:13.820> your<00:00:14.030> power<00:00:14.299> on<00:00:14.570> and<00:00:14.749> power<00:00:14.929> off<00:00:15.169> button<00:00:15.219> so

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
to your power on and power off button so

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.620 
to your power on and power off button so
the<00:00:16.340> best<00:00:16.460> part<00:00:16.700> about<00:00:16.760> this<00:00:17.000> tweak<00:00:17.300> is<00:00:17.480> the

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
the best part about this tweak is the

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.269 
the best part about this tweak is the
fact<00:00:17.900> that<00:00:18.019> it's<00:00:18.199> free<00:00:18.470> and<00:00:18.619> it's<00:00:18.769> hosted<00:00:19.130> on

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
fact that it's free and it's hosted on

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.220 
fact that it's free and it's hosted on
the<00:00:19.430> bigboss<00:00:19.910> repo<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:20.810> once<00:00:20.960> you<00:00:21.050> have<00:00:21.140> this

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
the bigboss repo so once you have this

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.810 
the bigboss repo so once you have this
tweet<00:00:21.470> downloaded<00:00:21.949> let's<00:00:22.310> take<00:00:22.460> a<00:00:22.519> closer

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
tweet downloaded let's take a closer

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.700 
tweet downloaded let's take a closer
look<00:00:22.939> so<00:00:23.539> we're<00:00:23.689> going<00:00:23.779> to<00:00:23.900> touch<00:00:24.080> in<00:00:24.289> to<00:00:24.650> it

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
look so we're going to touch in to it

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.470 
look so we're going to touch in to it
here<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:24.949> immediately<00:00:25.939> we're<00:00:26.179> greeted<00:00:26.330> with

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
here and immediately we're greeted with

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.109 
here and immediately we're greeted with
seven<00:00:26.840> options<00:00:27.259> not<00:00:28.099> only<00:00:28.250> about<00:00:28.490> one<00:00:29.089> of

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
seven options not only about one of

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.640 
seven options not only about one of
these<00:00:29.330> actually<00:00:29.900> work<00:00:30.109> and<00:00:30.289> this<00:00:30.349> is<00:00:30.529> really

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
these actually work and this is really

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.560 
these actually work and this is really
unfortunate<00:00:31.070> with<00:00:31.460> this<00:00:31.580> application<00:00:31.730> but

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
unfortunate with this application but

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.570 
unfortunate with this application but
the<00:00:32.660> one<00:00:32.780> that<00:00:32.900> works<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:33.290> best<00:00:33.440> is<00:00:33.740> due<00:00:34.460> every

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:34.580 
the one that works the best is due every

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.770 
the one that works the best is due every
spring<00:00:34.970> so<00:00:35.180> if<00:00:35.240> you're<00:00:35.390> someone<00:00:35.630> who

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
spring so if you're someone who

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.140 
spring so if you're someone who
constantly<00:00:36.140> needs<00:00:36.830> their<00:00:37.310> device<00:00:37.610> respring

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
constantly needs their device respring

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.900 
constantly needs their device respring
say<00:00:38.480> you've<00:00:38.690> got<00:00:38.830> some<00:00:39.830> major<00:00:40.160> tweaks<00:00:40.580> going

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
say you've got some major tweaks going

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.460 
say you've got some major tweaks going
and<00:00:41.090> they<00:00:41.360> need<00:00:41.600> your<00:00:41.780> device<00:00:42.020> we<00:00:42.200> sprung

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
and they need your device we sprung

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.200 
and they need your device we sprung
constantly<00:00:43.070> I<00:00:43.160> can't<00:00:43.520> really<00:00:43.610> think<00:00:43.790> of<00:00:43.910> any

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
constantly I can't really think of any

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.030 
constantly I can't really think of any
off<00:00:44.510> the<00:00:44.540> top<00:00:44.690> of<00:00:44.840> my<00:00:44.930> head<00:00:45.110> you<00:00:45.590> can<00:00:45.740> just<00:00:45.860> hold

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
off the top of my head you can just hold

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.880 
off the top of my head you can just hold
down<00:00:46.130> the<00:00:46.340> power<00:00:46.370> button<00:00:46.610> at<00:00:46.970> the<00:00:47.000> top<00:00:47.890> it

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
down the power button at the top it

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.830 
down the power button at the top it
won't<00:00:49.670> turn<00:00:49.820> into<00:00:49.850> myself<00:00:50.360> but<00:00:50.570> it's<00:00:50.690> just

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
won't turn into myself but it's just

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.410 
won't turn into myself but it's just
going<00:00:50.960> to<00:00:51.020> respring<00:00:51.380> it<00:00:51.500> like<00:00:51.710> it<00:00:51.860> says<00:00:52.100> and

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
going to respring it like it says and

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.450 
going to respring it like it says and
then<00:00:53.420> it's<00:00:54.410> going<00:00:54.560> to<00:00:54.650> kick<00:00:54.830> on<00:00:55.010> your<00:00:55.190> device

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
then it's going to kick on your device

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.840 
then it's going to kick on your device
so<00:00:56.150> this<00:00:56.300> is<00:00:56.330> really<00:00:56.690> cool<00:00:57.080> and<00:00:57.610> then<00:00:58.610> you<00:00:58.730> go

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
so this is really cool and then you go

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.100 
so this is really cool and then you go
back<00:00:58.880> into<00:00:59.180> settings<00:00:59.570> and<00:00:59.720> then<00:00:59.810> you<00:00:59.960> got<00:01:00.080> to

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
back into settings and then you got to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.650 
back into settings and then you got to
refined<00:01:00.530> it<00:01:00.620> again<00:01:01.090> but<00:01:02.090> one<00:01:02.270> of<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.420> flaws

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
refined it again but one of the flaws

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.109 
refined it again but one of the flaws
about<00:01:03.020> this<00:01:03.260> is<00:01:03.500> how<00:01:04.100> it<00:01:04.280> lists<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.729> couple

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
about this is how it lists a couple

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.300 
about this is how it lists a couple
others<00:01:05.539> like<00:01:06.049> do<00:01:06.229> nothing<00:01:06.619> that<00:01:06.859> doesn't<00:01:07.189> work

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
others like do nothing that doesn't work

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:09.459 
others like do nothing that doesn't work
skip<00:01:07.789> a<00:01:07.820> cider<00:01:08.119> doesn't<00:01:08.420> work<00:01:08.570> and<00:01:08.780> every

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
skip a cider doesn't work and every

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.319 
skip a cider doesn't work and every
other<00:01:09.590> one<00:01:09.770> except<00:01:10.189> do<00:01:10.369> over<00:01:10.549> spring<00:01:10.700> doesn't

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:11.329 
other one except do over spring doesn't

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.080 
other one except do over spring doesn't
work<00:01:11.659> too<00:01:11.990> well<00:01:12.490> so<00:01:13.490> I'll<00:01:13.700> show<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:13.939> an

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
work too well so I'll show you an

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.010 
work too well so I'll show you an
example<00:01:14.210> we'll<00:01:14.780> go<00:01:15.700> launch<00:01:16.700> cydia<00:01:16.969> so<00:01:17.780> when<00:01:17.929> we

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
example we'll go launch cydia so when we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.489 
example we'll go launch cydia so when we
try<00:01:18.229> to<00:01:18.259> hold<00:01:18.469> down<00:01:18.560> the<00:01:18.740> power<00:01:18.770> button<00:01:18.979> and

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
try to hold down the power button and

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:23.800 
try to hold down the power button and
launch<00:01:21.499> a<00:01:21.619> cydia<00:01:22.030> but<00:01:23.030> you<00:01:23.240> have<00:01:23.329> to<00:01:23.450> pull<00:01:23.689> your

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
launch a cydia but you have to pull your

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.149 
launch a cydia but you have to pull your
finger<00:01:24.170> off<00:01:24.320> because<00:01:24.679> you're<00:01:24.770> going<00:01:24.920> to<00:01:24.979> want

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
finger off because you're going to want

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.209 
finger off because you're going to want
to<00:01:25.249> go<00:01:25.399> into<00:01:25.609> the<00:01:25.880> application<00:01:26.630> itself<00:01:27.219> so

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
to go into the application itself so

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:29.800 
to go into the application itself so
when<00:01:28.369> you<00:01:28.460> slide<00:01:28.700> to<00:01:28.789> unlock<00:01:28.820> it<00:01:29.090> it'll<00:01:29.689> be

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
when you slide to unlock it it'll be

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.230 
when you slide to unlock it it'll be
there<00:01:29.990> for<00:01:30.259> you<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:30.619> this<00:01:30.890> it<00:01:31.520> really<00:01:31.850> doesn't

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
there for you and this it really doesn't

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.059 
there for you and this it really doesn't
work<00:01:32.420> this<00:01:32.719> well<00:01:32.899> I<00:01:32.960> think<00:01:33.140> do<00:01:33.439> respring<00:01:33.859> is

00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:34.069 
work this well I think do respring is

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:35.980 
work this well I think do respring is
the<00:01:34.490> only<00:01:34.700> way<00:01:35.090> that<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.450> would<00:01:35.569> really<00:01:35.899> use

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
the only way that I would really use

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.800 
the only way that I would really use
this<00:01:36.469> tweak<00:01:36.770> to<00:01:36.890> its<00:01:37.009> maximum<00:01:37.429> potential<00:01:37.999> if

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
this tweak to its maximum potential if
