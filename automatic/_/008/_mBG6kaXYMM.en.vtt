00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.670
 there is a small problem 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.930
 I would like to have visual material something 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.930
 I can help 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.910
 we are all connected todam what 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:19.450
 remember we will see it 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.240
 great and well I was doing a routine 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.939
 radio update z when something 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.369
 went wrong and I found myself transported to 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.980
 another side of the galaxy to a planet 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.710
 called run there was a scientist in 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.019
 will come out he was making his own 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.960
 advanced experiment today in launch the 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:40.090
 z- ray technology it took weeks 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.160
 in establishing the most basic communication 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.680
 but it will come out finally gave me to understand 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.170
 what part of your zeta ray technology 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.420
 had been stolen goes with the modus 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.860
 operandi of the grohl oceans all their 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.250
 culture revolves around technology 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.649
 stolen sardÃ¡ detected transmissions between 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.610
 One place in RNE and several places in 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.469
 the earth 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.840
 he was trying to track them when 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.869
 by accident while medium side RNE 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.729
 this detects traces of zeta radiation and 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.530
 identify the places where the protea 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.810
 they have transmitted us to the earth then 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.640
 they ordered attack on two fronts we're going to 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.410
 organize windows in each goal crawl 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.840
 oean or on earth while a 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.090
 contingent of the league will travel with you 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.700
 to prevent the Koreans from leaving 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.009
 maybe we have a problem with that 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.200
 second front the reason is not 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.469
 totally clear but the earthlings are 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.149
 people not happy in the terra galaxy and 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:36.920
 these six members of the league are 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:39.200
 wanted batman criminals are the 16 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.179
 missing hours of agreement five years ago 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.609
 years wild vandals took total 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:45.560
 mental control of the league of justice 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:48.679
 these same six members were 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.390
 lost for 16 hours we did not even know 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.090
 it happened that vandal could have 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.890
 sent to space I will notify jal league and 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.289
 they are in sheet with the other lanterns 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.939
 meanwhile we have 15 members of the 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.489
 active league to send to rne to 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.899
 investigate are not understanding there is a 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:04.770
 planetary alarm enter for each 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.200
 member of the league 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.700
 we are not all members of the league can 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.500
 send a team to handle the 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.750
 rne problems and to find out more 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.120
 about those 16 hours lost without causing 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.120
 an intergalactic incident do it 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.130
 If you go, come on, it 's that shirt 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.660
 of that thing of not being a member of the league 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:32.570
 you three still have an invitation 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.720
 open we know but we're good 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.700
 where are we and justices four 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.130
 first eight first and the team attack 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.660
 at 14 z locations and the Koreans at 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.030
 same time your priorities are 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.260
 destroy all had z platforms and 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.940
 look for any human that 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.800
 aliens may have abducted badly 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.560
 will be the head of the coordinating operation 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.440
 from here we go alpha girl squad 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.170
 wonder you and I will be alpha and for the 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.480
 beards of neptune mission philadelphia 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.470
 Philadelphia January 4 10 55 problem 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.710
 it's okay 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.010
 give me beta batichica bumblebee you 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:09.410
 two and wolves are beta or not mission silver 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.110
 the lid was enough stoxx 5 January 5 57 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.360
 abdomen the big beetle are range 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.460
 prepares the bird plane will go to new 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.320
 orleans do more is always in what 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.370
 boring team you are the boss of gamut me 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.260
 Ricardo I have never been a leader 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.790
 squadron is a good opportunity to 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.560
 make experience as a boss of a 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.300
 operation because it's the squadron range and 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.680
 you are not expecting problems or because 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.130
 lack personal and you have no other option 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.500
 just do not die is clear 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.450
 and without unnecessary risks for the 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.450
 squad you see an order 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.620
 new orleans January 4 9 59 pm 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.680
 a shed there is not enough space 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.780
 for a z tube and I knew it would not be 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.140
 the easiest thing for me however I do not have 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.920
 problems with that if I have it if I 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.900
 I have if I have it 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.970
 gamma squad the cave we are in 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.650
 delivery position program 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.510
 squads and located in the law are 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.510
 instead it's time to act 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.540
 congratulations blue destroy you a 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.390
 real shed calls the cave 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:41.980
 new z there our lot years there is no 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.500
 hidden input the sensors of the 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:47.860
 proven capturing traces of rodeos in the 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.930
 site confirmed however the signal of 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.490
 radiation comes from below the line of 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.490
 floating touches you
