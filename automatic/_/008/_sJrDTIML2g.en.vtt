00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.719
 ok then answering a friend who 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:13.010
 put out there a comment about to 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.680
 lincoln navigator 2003 to be battled 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.930
 to make oil change is the 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.269
 part that takes down that is the part 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:26.539
 that takes a little bit of the oil filter 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:32.390
 I took it off I took it off 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:35.540
 screw here with me here so not like that 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.790
 if it's all that up to now it 's from here 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.960
 this supposedly what they did is 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.280
 remove the filter from here and put it towards 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.309
 above 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.410
 this up here and that 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.399
 drained the oil actually in the 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.260
 system is very bad I removed it and this 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:57.289
 it is much easier to remove what also 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.470
 he told me he took it off ok a little bit with 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:04.790
 these clamps these clamps this one 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:08.899
 they grab yes and it is already spinning 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.610
 loosen it and this one the first time he told me 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:13.930
 what tool you use to remove the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:17.600
 spark plugs is this tool 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.990
 more than anything is this this one that is given 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.990
 return 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.950
 number 8 while and had to be giving 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.470
 turned around and was turning around then 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:35.460
 with this one is very good and for those 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.190
 corners what is back there the 8 and the 4 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.090
 It is very good also if you have the option 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:46.350
 to buy like this kind of adapters 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.830
 for almost all oil filters or 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.370
 buy them plus the one you occupy you do not put it 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.370
 behind the filter and with a flush of these 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:59.940
 so you get easy going down there 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.500
 serve this information and said this is 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.270
 the part that takes away if you look also 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.760
 I removed the other part that comes up 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.000
 they are pure plastics that really do not 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.750
 They are served just nothing weight and this one hopefully 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.360
 say it to all this information 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.080
 anything and we are because thank you 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.080
