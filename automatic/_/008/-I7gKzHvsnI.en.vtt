00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 or the burning youtuber I invite you to 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.819
 subscribe to my channel in a video 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.589
 inside before it teaches you how to upload a 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.840
 photo of the gallery and how the photo was uploaded 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.700
 of the camera in this language be that how 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.779
 upload a photo avoiding being 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.300
 avoiding being cut in shape 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.700
 square that is as typical as you will see 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.360
 this photo the upload before in this photo 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.400
 the original is full size on 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.860
 size the card cb completely but 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.809
 in this great what he did can cut back 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.850
 melo but that what we do not want 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.820
 then basically to do 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.160
 get photos without being cropped 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.280
 we must download all applications that 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.230
 they are very specific specific for this 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.690
 the first one is called fit free list 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.530
 and the second one is mixed size 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.000
 and this number urges saiz who do 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.000
 these applications what they do is 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.700
 Fill 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.200
 space 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.690
 creating a photo completely stable 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.720
 square then what we do 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.480
 using this figure is entering by 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.610
 here above and selecting the photo 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.040
 let's select again the camera 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.910
 Red 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.280
 as you will see the filling the color of the 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:24.010
 fill can be modified with the 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.390
 version x 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.240
 I think that in this version does not allow 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.730
 fill with another black color is very 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.790
 limited but for now we do the and you 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.260
 we say here save and was saved 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.240
 in lcd 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.370
 sure we want to go out we give that 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.410
 if we are going to upload the instagram of the 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.690
 same way and this 6 does the same 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.300
 option what I do not like in these birds 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:51.210
 is that I automatically upload it to the 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.670
 instagram social network without asking 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.260
 and let's go to instagram let's see the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.340
 result 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.760
 let's upload it 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.820
 we say gallery 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.780
 we look for the photo 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.780
 insta feat 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.340
 as we will see the picture is completely 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.940
 square so we do not have to 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:21.870
 modify what is common that happens 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.340
 with instagram that I cut the photo 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.450
 he says he loses all the information we 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.489
 they come to lose all those who 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.890
 were present in the photo to 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.680
 our family friends apply 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.920
 any filter and the product apply 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.350
 edge or we do not give you shared here 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.010
 little arrow here to follow 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.610
 we say photo with 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.780
 complete 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.780
 and we publish it 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.550
 as you will see this time we were able to publish 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.140
 our distracts the whole picture without 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.750
 cut out we basically use 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.840
 applications that what they do is add 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.220
 the square size to our photo that 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.040
 it was all for this video I invite you to 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.680
 subscribe to the channel 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.980
 he had forgotten that the advantage 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.190
 ista ista size is that it allows us 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.040
 take the photo 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:21.000
 while the other one here we can not 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.050
 take the picture completely 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.090
 directly the cameras we say 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.950
 save 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.760
 we tell him to turn 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.650
 we arrange it and we select here between 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.730
 the black and white version but not 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.730
 it allows us to use background 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.730
 configurable 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.830
 we need advertising 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.040
 advertising and that 's how simple we give 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.320
 cut back that increased in the application not 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.580
 is directly on our twitter 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.050
 went directly to twitter took it I've 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.450
 been using the application of 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:01.450
 twitter we give you next 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:13.450
 another photo always 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.940
 without cutting we share it 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.200
 and as you can see we can upload a photo 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.910
 complete 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.150
 previously we have uploaded one but 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.500
 we had only been able to upload one 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.720
 portion of the photo since being 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.280
 cropped per loses information thanks 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.280
