through it to secure it if you want to

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.240 
through it to secure it if you want to
make<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.269> really<00:02:48.480> simple<00:02:48.900> one<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:49.680> what<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:49.890> have

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
make a really simple one but what I have

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.070 
make a really simple one but what I have
here<00:02:50.549> as<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.760> can<00:02:50.790> see<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:51.090> actually<00:02:51.360> have<00:02:51.600> only

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
here as you can see I actually have only

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.229 
here as you can see I actually have only

a couple contact points well three

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.600 
a couple contact points well three
technically<00:02:54.840> but<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.530> fourth<00:02:55.799> one<00:02:56.069> the<00:02:56.400> major

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
technically but the fourth one the major

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.420 
technically but the fourth one the major
ones<00:02:56.970> being<00:02:57.120> taken<00:02:57.660> up<00:02:57.810> by<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.290> pressure<00:02:58.620> from

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
ones being taken up by the pressure from

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.039 
ones being taken up by the pressure from
the<00:02:59.580> elastic<00:02:59.819> on<00:03:00.150> the<00:03:00.209> back<00:03:00.420> of<00:03:00.569> my<00:03:00.660> hands<00:03:00.900> what

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
the elastic on the back of my hands what

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.960 
the elastic on the back of my hands what
I'm<00:03:01.140> able<00:03:01.260> to<00:03:01.410> do<00:03:01.680> if<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.340> up<00:03:02.459> against<00:03:02.760> my

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
I'm able to do if this is up against my

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.300 
I'm able to do if this is up against my
face<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:04.140> very<00:03:04.380> very<00:03:04.830> minimal<00:03:05.190> I'm

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
face is have very very minimal I'm

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.770 
face is have very very minimal I'm
having<00:03:05.670> I'm<00:03:05.880> actually<00:03:06.090> letting<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.540> camera

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
having I'm actually letting the camera

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.990 
having I'm actually letting the camera
float<00:03:07.380> I'm<00:03:07.739> obviously<00:03:07.890> still<00:03:08.340> grabbing<00:03:08.849> it

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
float I'm obviously still grabbing it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.890 
float I'm obviously still grabbing it
but<00:03:09.720> I'm<00:03:09.840> letting<00:03:10.049> the<00:03:10.290> camera<00:03:10.500> float<00:03:11.099> on<00:03:11.900> the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
but I'm letting the camera float on the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.680 
but I'm letting the camera float on the
elastic<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.920> elasticity<00:03:14.280> of<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.970> band<00:03:15.209> here

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
elastic the elasticity of the band here

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.039 
elastic the elasticity of the band here
and<00:03:15.900> I<00:03:16.440> can<00:03:16.769> get<00:03:17.280> much<00:03:17.940> slower<00:03:18.269> shutter<00:03:18.390> speeds

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
and I can get much slower shutter speeds

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:21.110 
and I can get much slower shutter speeds
and<00:03:19.290> much<00:03:19.440> steadier<00:03:19.769> shots<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.579> lot<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.000> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
and much steadier shots so a lot of the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.560 
and much steadier shots so a lot of the
other<00:03:21.239> contraptions<00:03:22.019> that<00:03:23.209> people<00:03:24.209> will<00:03:24.359> show

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
where you have to put one loop through

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.319 
where you have to put one loop through
your<00:03:30.030> foot<00:03:30.269> or<00:03:30.810> as<00:03:31.680> I<00:03:32.340> showed<00:03:32.609> you<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:32.850> double

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.729 
loop through either side of a belt loop
for<00:03:35.730> taking<00:03:36.299> really<00:03:36.540> really<00:03:36.900> steady<00:03:37.170> shots<00:03:37.500> at

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
for taking really really steady shots at

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.099 
for taking really really steady shots at
very<00:03:38.010> low<00:03:38.160> shutter<00:03:38.400> speeds<00:03:38.790> I'm<00:03:39.480> able<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:39.930> do

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
very low shutter speeds I'm able to do

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.920 
very low shutter speeds I'm able to do
the<00:03:40.260> same<00:03:40.560> thing<00:03:40.920> here<00:03:41.400> not<00:03:41.970> as<00:03:42.269> slow<00:03:42.690> but<00:03:42.900> I

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
the same thing here not as slow but I

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.629 
the same thing here not as slow but I
can<00:03:43.049> get<00:03:43.170> down<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.590> like<00:03:43.680> a<00:03:43.739> tenth<00:03:44.040> of<00:03:44.160> a<00:03:44.250> second

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
can get down to like a tenth of a second

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.699 
can get down to like a tenth of a second
easy<00:03:44.970> because<00:03:45.600> I'm<00:03:45.930> reduced<00:03:46.319> all<00:03:46.560> these

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
easy because I'm reduced all these

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.379 
easy because I'm reduced all these
contact<00:03:47.280> points<00:03:47.639> I'm<00:03:47.790> letting<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.150> camera

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
contact points I'm letting the camera

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.539 
contact points I'm letting the camera
float<00:03:48.870> on<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.230> elasticity<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.040> band<00:03:50.340> so

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
float on the elasticity of the band so

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.699 
float on the elasticity of the band so
you're<00:03:50.670> able<00:03:50.790> to<00:03:50.940> make<00:03:51.180> one<00:03:51.420> of<00:03:51.569> these<00:03:51.709> very

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
you're able to make one of these very

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.910 
you're able to make one of these very
very<00:03:53.160> very<00:03:53.430> quickly<00:03:53.730> very<00:03:54.209> easy<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.139> you<00:03:55.440> know

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
very very quickly very easy and you know

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.590 
very very quickly very easy and you know
if<00:03:55.980> it<00:03:56.069> gets<00:03:56.220> dirty<00:03:56.519> so<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:56.910> just<00:03:57.090> by<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.269> black

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
if it gets dirty so it just by the black

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.259 
if it gets dirty so it just by the black
elastic<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.440> get<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.620> off<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.769> ebay<00:03:59.130> I<00:03:59.489> have

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
elastic and get it off of ebay I have

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.180 
elastic and get it off of ebay I have
white<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.569> had<00:04:00.900> some<00:04:01.079> black<00:04:01.260> elastic<00:04:01.590> before

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190

know then make sure you measure whether

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.600 
know then make sure you measure whether
they've<00:04:28.110> got<00:04:28.289> gorilla<00:04:28.680> hands<00:04:29.039> or<00:04:29.220> not<00:04:29.370> you're

they've got gorilla hands or not you're

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.490 
they've got gorilla hands or not you're
gonna<00:04:29.700> have<00:04:29.970> to<00:04:30.120> actually<00:04:30.270> change<00:04:30.780> how<00:04:31.140> much

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:31.500 
gonna have to actually change how much

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.589 
gonna have to actually change how much
elastic<00:04:32.099> and<00:04:32.460> actually<00:04:32.880> comes<00:04:33.090> out<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.419> here

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
elastic and actually comes out of here

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.240 
elastic and actually comes out of here
but<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:33.990> get<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.710> point

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
but you get the point

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.760 
but you get the point
I<00:04:35.630> hope<00:04:36.630> and<00:04:36.870> made<00:04:36.990> things<00:04:37.260> abundantly<00:04:37.710> clear

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
I hope and made things abundantly clear

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.440 
I hope and made things abundantly clear
without<00:04:38.190> repeating<00:04:38.430> myself<00:04:38.909> too<00:04:39.090> much<00:04:39.120> that

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
without repeating myself too much that

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.279 
without repeating myself too much that
you're<00:04:39.570> able<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.750> take<00:04:39.900> slower<00:04:40.169> shutter

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
you're able to take slower shutter

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.680 
you're able to take slower shutter
speeds<00:04:40.919> and<00:04:41.490> we're<00:04:41.640> talking<00:04:41.849> about<00:04:42.090> single

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
speeds and we're talking about single

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.670 
speeds and we're talking about single
hand<00:04:43.909> held<00:04:44.909> shots<00:04:45.720> at<00:04:45.930> slower<00:04:46.140> shutter<00:04:46.229> speeds

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
hand held shots at slower shutter speeds

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:47.990 
hand held shots at slower shutter speeds
I'm<00:04:46.740> not<00:04:46.860> talking<00:04:47.220> about<00:04:47.310> doing<00:04:47.490> this<00:04:47.700> number

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
I'm not talking about doing this number

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.820 
I'm not talking about doing this number
with<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.180> second<00:04:48.599> hand<00:04:48.690> also<00:04:48.960> because<00:04:49.680> that

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
with a second hand also because that

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.350 
with a second hand also because that
eliminates<00:04:50.250> the<00:04:50.370> purpose<00:04:50.729> of<00:04:50.849> what<00:04:50.909> I'm<00:04:51.030> doing

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
eliminates the purpose of what I'm doing

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.120 
eliminates the purpose of what I'm doing
here<00:04:51.570> obviously<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:52.110> have<00:04:52.289> a<00:04:52.320> retention<00:04:52.740> point

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
here obviously I have a retention point

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.469 
here obviously I have a retention point
here<00:04:53.310> in<00:04:53.370> case<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.580> ever<00:04:53.700> dropped<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.270> camera

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
here in case I ever dropped the camera

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.719 
here in case I ever dropped the camera
what<00:04:55.409> I'm<00:04:55.500> able<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.800> do<00:04:56.010> in<00:04:56.250> lower<00:04:56.460> light

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
what I'm able to do in lower light

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.540 
what I'm able to do in lower light
situations<00:04:57.479> is<00:04:57.840> actually<00:04:58.800> let<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.130> camera

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
situations is actually let the camera

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.390 
situations is actually let the camera
float<00:04:59.880> on<00:05:00.270> the<00:05:00.870> elastic<00:05:01.409> at<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.620> bottom<00:05:01.740> here

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
float on the elastic at the bottom here

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.339 
float on the elastic at the bottom here
and<00:05:02.580> have<00:05:02.729> minimal<00:05:03.180> contact<00:05:03.240> points<00:05:04.110> up<00:05:04.289> here

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
and have minimal contact points up here

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.380 
and have minimal contact points up here
with<00:05:04.770> my<00:05:04.950> hands<00:05:05.370> so<00:05:05.520> instead<00:05:06.150> of<00:05:06.210> mean

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
with my hands so instead of mean

with my hands so instead of mean
normally<00:05:06.750> gripping<00:05:07.080> the<00:05:07.200> camera<00:05:07.530> like<00:05:07.680> this

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
normally gripping the camera like this

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.070 
normally gripping the camera like this
and<00:05:08.099> shaking<00:05:09.000> where<00:05:09.180> it<00:05:09.510> doesn't<00:05:09.810> matter<00:05:09.930> how

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
and shaking where it doesn't matter how

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.719 
and shaking where it doesn't matter how
steady<00:05:10.440> you<00:05:10.590> are<00:05:10.800> how<00:05:10.950> much<00:05:11.099> caffeine<00:05:11.370> you

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:11.729 
steady you are how much caffeine you

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:14.120 
steady you are how much caffeine you
have<00:05:11.909> or<00:05:12.150> haven't<00:05:12.479> had<00:05:12.659> you<00:05:13.620> have<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:13.770> bunch<00:05:14.010> of

muscles fighting each other and so even

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.570 
muscles fighting each other and so even

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
with the vibration reduction lens you

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.010

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
just a hand strap for attention in case

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:06.560 
just a hand strap for attention in case
they<00:06:05.310> drop<00:06:05.490> the<00:06:05.610> camera<00:06:05.909> no<00:06:06.030> that's<00:06:06.270> not<00:06:06.419> all

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
they drop the camera no that's not all

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.990 
they drop the camera no that's not all
this<00:06:06.690> is<00:06:06.750> good<00:06:07.050> for<00:06:07.289> the<00:06:07.440> other<00:06:07.469> ones<00:06:07.979> are<00:06:08.669> not

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 
this is good for the other ones are not

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.240 
this is good for the other ones are not
along<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:09.599> they<00:06:10.380> don't<00:06:10.560> have<00:06:10.770> stretch

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
along and they don't have stretch

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.270 
along and they don't have stretch
they're<00:06:11.700> simply<00:06:12.210> cinches<00:06:12.810> for<00:06:13.710> securing<00:06:14.219> the

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
they're simply cinches for securing the

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.279 
they're simply cinches for securing the
camera<00:06:14.789> but<00:06:15.360> this<00:06:15.450> one<00:06:15.659> serves<00:06:15.930> a<00:06:16.110> dual

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
camera but this one serves a dual

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.969 
camera but this one serves a dual
purpose<00:06:16.650> it<00:06:17.010> actually<00:06:17.370> acts<00:06:17.610> at<00:06:18.210> X<00:06:18.870> and<00:06:19.409> as<00:06:19.950> a

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:19.979 
purpose it actually acts at X and as a

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.430 
purpose it actually acts at X and as a
security<00:06:20.640> for<00:06:20.849> camera<00:06:21.240> drop<00:06:21.510> but<00:06:22.169> it<00:06:22.260> also

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
security for camera drop but it also

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.570 
security for camera drop but it also
acts<00:06:23.039> as<00:06:23.460> a<00:06:24.390> it<00:06:25.020> does<00:06:25.320> attention<00:06:25.979> point<00:06:26.219> since

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
acts as a it does attention point since

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.680 
acts as a it does attention point since
it's<00:06:26.760> elastic<00:06:27.060> for<00:06:27.600> slower<00:06:27.990> shutter<00:06:28.639> speeds

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
it's elastic for slower shutter speeds

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.070 
it's elastic for slower shutter speeds
okay

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
okay

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.439 
okay
so<00:06:31.440> that<00:06:31.560> makes<00:06:31.800> us<00:06:31.949> a<00:06:32.009> dual-purpose<00:06:32.449> hand

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449 
so that makes us a dual-purpose hand

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.100 
so that makes us a dual-purpose hand
strap<00:06:33.840> which<00:06:34.440> none<00:06:34.800> of<00:06:34.919> the<00:06:35.009> other<00:06:35.190> ones<00:06:35.430> are
