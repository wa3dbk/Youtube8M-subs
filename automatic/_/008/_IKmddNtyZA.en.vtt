spot gadgets the mavs it can be very
very<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.530> powerful<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.630> while<00:02:07.110> I'm<00:02:07.260> not

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
very very powerful so while I'm not

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.190 
very very powerful so while I'm not
taking<00:02:07.800> shots<00:02:08.100> with<00:02:08.220> my<00:02:08.429> rifle<00:02:08.940> I'm<00:02:09.630> position

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
cover to my advantage so I can take

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.530 
cover to my advantage so I can take
choice<00:02:15.690> shots<00:02:16.020> at<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.320> enemy<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:18.240> while<00:02:18.390> it's
