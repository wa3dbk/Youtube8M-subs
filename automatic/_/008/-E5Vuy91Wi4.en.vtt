00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.060
 choreography that we show it more or less 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.880
 two months or things like that and we did not want it 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.950
 work because we had left a little 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.270
 here from Granada and we wanted to do something 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.580
 well done 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.200
 and we thought that those from Malaga were going to 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.240
 fats to win because there were several 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.700
 choreographies that were very well done 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.740

 after competing with 20 groups have 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.330
 be finalists the key is in 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.200
 rehearse and they dance every afternoon 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.830
 although it is not always easy to have a 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.850
 physical activity and the strong stay 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:29.970
