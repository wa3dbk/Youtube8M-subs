made die rise a fan favorite map now as

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.419 
made die rise a fan favorite map now as
a<00:00:09.240> lot<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.900> know<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.260> like<00:00:10.650> die<00:00:10.830> rise<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.070> lot

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
a lot of you know I like die rise a lot

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.430 
a lot of you know I like die rise a lot
just<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.849> way<00:00:11.969> it<00:00:12.090> is<00:00:12.179> well<00:00:12.690> maybe<00:00:13.170> without

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
just the way it is well maybe without

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.470 
just the way it is well maybe without
the<00:00:13.679> bank<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.160> weapons<00:00:14.700> Locker<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.389> get

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
the bank and weapons Locker but you get

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.359 
the bank and weapons Locker but you get
the<00:00:15.540> idea<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.740> my<00:00:16.830> favorite<00:00:17.160> maps

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
the idea it's one of my favorite maps

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.820 
the idea it's one of my favorite maps
but<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.090> definitely<00:00:18.779> believe<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.260> treyarch

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
but I definitely believe that treyarch

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.800 
but I definitely believe that treyarch
left<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.490> lot<00:00:20.699> of<00:00:20.730> room<00:00:21.000> for<00:00:21.029> improvement<00:00:21.240> and

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
left a lot of room for improvement and

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.210 
left a lot of room for improvement and
it<00:00:21.930> could<00:00:22.140> be<00:00:22.260> better<00:00:22.470> than<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.769> actually<00:00:22.920> is

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
it could be better than it actually is

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.759 
it could be better than it actually is
so<00:00:23.850> let's<00:00:24.029> get<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.510> into<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.500> first

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
so let's get right into it the first

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.470 
so let's get right into it the first
thing<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.279> sink<00:00:26.699> track<00:00:26.939> should<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.300> done

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
thing that I sink track should have done

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.540 
thing that I sink track should have done
to<00:00:27.510> die<00:00:27.840> rise<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.230> make<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> awesome<00:00:28.680> is<00:00:29.250> to

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
to die rise to make it awesome is to

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.550 
to die rise to make it awesome is to
reduce<00:00:29.699> fall<00:00:30.449> damage<00:00:30.810> or<00:00:31.019> get<00:00:31.199> rid<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.410> it

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
reduce fall damage or get rid of it

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.950 
reduce fall damage or get rid of it
altogether<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.250> yes<00:00:32.579> yes<00:00:32.910> many<00:00:33.570> people<00:00:33.780> have

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
altogether and yes yes many people have

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.690 
altogether and yes yes many people have
said<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.320> before<00:00:34.380> i'm<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.250> original<00:00:35.430> i

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
said this before i'm not that original i

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
said this before i'm not that original i
didn't<00:00:35.940> come<00:00:36.059> up<00:00:36.180> with<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.420> idea<00:00:36.540> myself<00:00:36.899> but

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
didn't come up with this idea myself but

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.619 
didn't come up with this idea myself but
the<00:00:38.100> way<00:00:38.309> they<00:00:38.850> should<00:00:38.910> have<00:00:39.149> gone<00:00:39.270> about<00:00:39.570> it

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
the way they should have gone about it

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.780 
the way they should have gone about it
is<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.230> putting<00:00:40.559> PhD<00:00:41.040> flopper<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
is not just putting PhD flopper in the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.819 
is not just putting PhD flopper in the
map<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.510> really<00:00:42.840> wouldn't<00:00:43.020> change<00:00:43.350> much<00:00:43.620> at

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
map that really wouldn't change much at

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.069 
map that really wouldn't change much at
all<00:00:43.980> because<00:00:44.579> if<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.940> think<00:00:44.969> about<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.390> when

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
all because if you think about it when

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990 
all because if you think about it when
people<00:00:46.440> die<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.620> fall<00:00:46.920> damage<00:00:47.250> it's<00:00:47.430> usually

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
people die of fall damage it's usually

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.119 
people die of fall damage it's usually
before<00:00:48.180> round<00:00:48.719> five<00:00:49.020> before<00:00:49.469> you're<00:00:49.649> even<00:00:49.680> set

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
before round five before you're even set

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.650 
before round five before you're even set
up<00:00:50.160> or<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.579> your<00:00:50.670> Juggernog<00:00:51.210> or<00:00:51.360> any<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.629> that

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
up or have your Juggernog or any of that

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.959 
up or have your Juggernog or any of that
adding<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.620> perk<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.070> reduce<00:00:53.340> fall<00:00:53.579> damage<00:00:53.879> is

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
adding a perk to reduce fall damage is

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.540 
adding a perk to reduce fall damage is
not<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.510> help<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.989> at<00:00:55.199> all<00:00:55.460> what<00:00:56.460> they

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
not going to help that at all what they

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.420 
not going to help that at all what they
should<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.789> done<00:00:56.879> instead<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.780> either

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
should have done instead is either

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.920 
should have done instead is either
barricaded<00:00:59.430> certain<00:00:59.820> drop-off<00:01:00.510> point<00:01:00.750> so

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
barricaded certain drop-off point so

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.810 
barricaded certain drop-off point so
that<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.170> can't<00:01:01.379> fall<00:01:01.590> off<00:01:01.620> through<00:01:02.250> such<00:01:02.609> as

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
that you can't fall off through such as

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.539 
that you can't fall off through such as
invisible<00:01:03.359> barrier<00:01:03.960> maybe<00:01:04.650> where<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.129> an-94

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
invisible barrier maybe where the an-94

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.550 
invisible barrier maybe where the an-94
is<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.270> whole<00:01:06.450> area<00:01:06.720> there's<00:01:07.200> really<00:01:07.320> no

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
is that whole area there's really no

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.230 
is that whole area there's really no
point<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.920> having<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.340> open<00:01:08.369> because<00:01:08.850> people

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
point in having that open because people

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.490 
point in having that open because people
will<00:01:09.299> just<00:01:09.479> back<00:01:09.720> off<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.170> edge<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
will just back off the edge of the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.020 
will just back off the edge of the
building<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.040> there's<00:01:11.460> nothing<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.850> catch

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
building and there's nothing to catch

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.000 
building and there's nothing to catch
them<00:01:12.270> there's<00:01:12.450> no<00:01:12.630> point<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.350> being<00:01:13.530> open

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
them there's no point of that being open

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.969 
them there's no point of that being open
and<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.580> causes<00:01:15.000> frustration<00:01:15.979> however

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and it just causes frustration however

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.710 
and it just causes frustration however
there<00:01:17.220> are<00:01:17.369> certain<00:01:17.640> drop<00:01:18.000> downs<00:01:18.240> which<00:01:18.479> are

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
there are certain drop downs which are

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.630 
there are certain drop downs which are
very<00:01:19.170> important<00:01:19.710> such<00:01:19.920> as<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> elevator

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
very important such as the elevator

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.310 
very important such as the elevator
shaft<00:01:20.729> where<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.420> parkour<00:01:22.020> your<00:01:22.200> way

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
shaft where you have parkour your way

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.990 
shaft where you have parkour your way
down<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.799> when<00:01:23.369> you're<00:01:23.490> jumping<00:01:23.820> from

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
down and when you're jumping from

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270 
down and when you're jumping from
building<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.420> building<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.770> maybe

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
building to building and for that maybe

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.890 
building to building and for that maybe
they<00:01:26.460> should<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.759> added<00:01:27.119> some<00:01:27.299> sort<00:01:27.509> of<00:01:27.630> zip

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
they should have added some sort of zip

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.109 
they should have added some sort of zip
line<00:01:28.110> system<00:01:28.530> such<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:28.829> in<00:01:29.189> call<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.909> dead

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
line system such as in call of the dead

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
worked I really see no reason why trick

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.710 
worked I really see no reason why trick
couldn't<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.909> may<00:01:45.119> be<00:01:45.180> because<00:01:45.360> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
couldn't do this may be because the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.840 
couldn't do this may be because the
multiplayer<00:01:46.140> engine<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:47.070> still<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> zipline

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.569 
multiplayer engine but still the zipline
system<00:01:48.270> should<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.600> worked<00:01:48.780> just<00:01:48.990> fine<00:01:49.110> and

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
system should have worked just fine and

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.340 
system should have worked just fine and
let's<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.700> honest<00:01:51.090> here<00:01:51.299> zip<00:01:51.750> lines<00:01:51.990> are<00:01:52.140> cool

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
let's be honest here zip lines are cool

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.170 
let's be honest here zip lines are cool
so<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> next<00:01:52.920> point<00:01:53.280> I'm<00:01:53.460> about<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.850> bring<00:01:54.030> up

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
so the next point I'm about to bring up

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.969 
so the next point I'm about to bring up
is<00:01:54.360> going<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.630> make<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.780> lot<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.200> wonder<00:01:55.590> why

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
is going to make a lot of you wonder why

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.940 
is going to make a lot of you wonder why
I'm<00:01:56.159> talking<00:01:56.640> about<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.030> but<00:01:57.329> box<00:01:58.140> location

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
I'm talking about it but box location

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.000 
I'm talking about it but box location
can<00:01:59.219> make<00:01:59.490> or<00:01:59.759> break<00:01:59.790> a<00:02:00.090> map<00:02:00.450> depend

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010

that really seems broken to me I don't
really<00:02:39.620> see<00:02:39.710> why<00:02:40.220> they<00:02:40.460> did<00:02:40.520> this<00:02:40.700> except<00:02:41.300> to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
really see why they did this except to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.940 
really see why they did this except to
make<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.750> player<00:02:41.960> feel<00:02:41.990> bad<00:02:42.740> about

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
themselves I mean honestly it just seems

less fun however I know this is not the

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
fun at their fans but honestly it did

good<00:03:10.310> weapons<00:03:10.820> in<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.300> box<00:03:11.510> in<00:03:11.780> general<00:03:12.200> but

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
good weapons in the box in general but

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.229 
good weapons in the box in general but
that's<00:03:12.800> in<00:03:13.010> a<00:03:13.100> completely<00:03:13.489> different<00:03:13.580> video

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
that's in a completely different video

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.870 
that's in a completely different video
so<00:03:15.020> for<00:03:15.380> my<00:03:15.500> third<00:03:15.800> and<00:03:15.830> final<00:03:16.040> point<00:03:16.610> we're

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
so for my third and final point we're

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.640 
so for my third and final point we're
going<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.209> be<00:03:17.330> looking<00:03:17.690> at<00:03:17.900> one<00:03:18.140> of<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.380> least

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
going to be looking at one of the least

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.580 
going to be looking at one of the least

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
follow the path may be spending a little

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.430 
follow the path may be spending a little
bit<00:03:52.190> more<00:03:53.180> of<00:03:53.450> your<00:03:53.480> points<00:03:53.989> than<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.290> would

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
bit more of your points than you would

like<00:03:54.950> to<00:03:55.430> go<00:03:55.700> down<00:03:55.880> and<00:03:56.120> back<00:03:56.239> up<00:03:56.269> again<00:03:56.720> but

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
like to go down and back up again but

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.050 
like to go down and back up again but
that<00:03:57.470> would<00:03:57.620> definitely<00:03:57.980> be<00:03:58.310> better<00:03:58.670> than<00:03:58.880> the

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
that would definitely be better than the

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.120 
that would definitely be better than the
system<00:03:59.360> we<00:03:59.450> have<00:03:59.480> now<00:03:59.600> where<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.680> elevators

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
system we have now where the elevators

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.100 
system we have now where the elevators
just<00:04:01.400> run<00:04:01.640> on<00:04:01.760> their<00:04:01.940> own<00:04:02.060> schedules<00:04:02.660> which<00:04:02.930> is

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
just run on their own schedules which is

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.509 
just run on their own schedules which is
very<00:04:03.320> inconvenient<00:04:04.040> for<00:04:04.220> the<00:04:04.280> player

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
very inconvenient for the player

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.430 
very inconvenient for the player
especially<00:04:05.450> when<00:04:05.540> you're<00:04:05.690> trying<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.989> build<00:04:06.260> a

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
especially when you're trying to build a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.410

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
of the map while being chased by zombies

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.699 
of the map while being chased by zombies
as<00:04:10.850> a<00:04:10.910> bit<00:04:11.480> of<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:11.690> bonus<00:04:12.200> this<00:04:12.320> would<00:04:12.530> also

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
as a bit of a bonus this would also

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.530 
as a bit of a bonus this would also
provide<00:04:13.310> a<00:04:13.370> bunch<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:13.790> camping<00:04:14.269> spot

three<00:04:32.539> things<00:04:32.570> would<00:04:32.990> make<00:04:33.259> die<00:04:33.470> rise<00:04:33.680> better

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
three things would make die rise better

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.460 
three things would make die rise better
and<00:04:34.250> if<00:04:34.820> these<00:04:35.060> three<00:04:35.419> things<00:04:35.449> happened<00:04:36.139> would

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
and if these three things happened would

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.279 
and if these three things happened would
you<00:04:36.620> play<00:04:36.860> die<00:04:37.070> rise<00:04:37.310> more<00:04:37.669> so<00:04:38.509> if<00:04:38.810> you<00:04:38.960> enjoy

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
you play die rise more so if you enjoy

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:40.600
