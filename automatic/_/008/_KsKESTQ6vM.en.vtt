have<00:04:50.280> headsets<00:04:50.790> on<00:04:51.110> because<00:04:52.110> you<00:04:52.230> could<00:04:52.350> hear

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
have headsets on because you could hear

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.800 
have headsets on because you could hear
players<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.280> can't<00:04:53.520> hear<00:04:53.700> yourself<00:04:53.810> and

if you have marathon it's really good

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.920 
if you have marathon it's really good
because<00:04:56.730> you<00:04:57.030> don't<00:04:57.180> have<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.390> hear<00:04:57.600> yourself

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930

i like using scavenger and marathon

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.710 
i like using scavenger and marathon
because<00:05:05.400> i<00:05:05.610> think<00:05:05.820> those<00:05:06.120> are<00:05:06.150> the<00:05:06.360> two<00:05:06.540> best

classes side hands really good but if

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.900 
classes side hands really good but if
you<00:05:09.630> think<00:05:09.840> about<00:05:09.930> it<00:05:10.110> it<00:05:10.920> doesn't<00:05:11.280> really

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
you think about it it doesn't really
