00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
we've seen several proxy brushes on this

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.830 
we've seen several proxy brushes on this
map<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.640> only<00:00:38.850> one<00:00:38.969> I've<00:00:39.180> seen<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.510> hasn't

basically<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.680> don't<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:47.550> advise

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
basically I don't know if it's so advise

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.500 
basically I don't know if it's so advise
doing<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.840> quick<00:00:49.590> rush<00:00:49.829> vs<00:00:50.579> terran<00:00:50.820> Terran<00:00:51.329> I

doing a quick rush vs terran Terran I

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.830 
doing a quick rush vs terran Terran I
think<00:00:51.750> being<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.260> easiest<00:00:53.100> race<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.360> fend<00:00:54.690> off

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
think being the easiest race to fend off

we even the first link can basically be

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.540 
we even the first link can basically be
produced<00:02:08.610> again<00:02:09.860> really<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:10.890> feel<00:02:10.950> like<00:02:11.280> cheese

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
produced again really I feel like cheese

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.100 
produced again really I feel like cheese
is<00:02:11.819> kind

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
is kind

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.720 
is kind
the<00:02:12.200> reaction<00:02:12.530> of<00:02:12.830> either<00:02:13.040> wanting<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:13.550> quick

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
the reaction of either wanting a quick

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.040 
the reaction of either wanting a quick
victory<00:02:13.910> because<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.510> you're<00:02:14.810> playing

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
victory because you you're playing

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.600 
victory because you you're playing
against<00:02:15.290> someone<00:02:15.350> who's<00:02:15.740> very<00:02:15.830> good<00:02:16.340> with

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
against someone who's very good with

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.580 
against someone who's very good with
macro<00:02:17.030> in<00:02:17.270> a<00:02:17.360> lot<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:17.660> very<00:02:18.020> good<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.440> long

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
macro in a lot and very good in the long

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.290 
macro in a lot and very good in the long
game<00:02:18.800> where<00:02:19.310> you<00:02:19.400> feel<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.610> just<00:02:19.970> can't<00:02:20.150> beat

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
game where you feel you just can't beat

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.030 
game where you feel you just can't beat
them<00:02:20.450> heads<00:02:20.660> up<00:02:20.840> so<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.350> might<00:02:21.650> as<00:02:21.770> well<00:02:21.920> go

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
them heads up so you might as well go

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.250 
them heads up so you might as well go
with<00:02:22.070> cheese<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.670> feel<00:02:22.880> that's<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.360> former

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
with cheese and I feel that's the former

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.840 
with cheese and I feel that's the former
or<00:02:24.470> i<00:02:24.740> should<00:02:24.860> say<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.220> latter<00:02:25.400> is<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.670> case

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
or i should say the latter is the case

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.310 
or i should say the latter is the case
here<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.860> don't<00:02:27.860> think<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.150> MST<00:02:29.150> can<00:02:29.810> take<00:02:30.140> go

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:30.320 
here I don't think the MST can take go

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.050 
here I don't think the MST can take go
rushing<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.710> heads-up<00:02:30.980> battle<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.730> he's<00:02:31.940> going

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
rushing a heads-up battle so he's going

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.340 
rushing a heads-up battle so he's going
to<00:02:32.150> go<00:02:32.270> with<00:02:32.420> this<00:02:32.540> cheese<00:02:32.810> attack<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.290> it

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
to go with this cheese attack and it

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
to go with this cheese attack and it
looks<00:02:33.500> like<00:02:33.650> he's<00:02:33.770> gonna<00:02:33.860> pull<00:02:34.160> it<00:02:34.190> off

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
looks like he's gonna pull it off

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.010 
looks like he's gonna pull it off
gathering<00:02:34.940> that<00:02:35.030> SCV<00:02:35.450> those<00:02:35.600> two<00:02:35.780> Marines

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
gathering that SCV those two Marines

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.740 
gathering that SCV those two Marines
going<00:02:36.620> up<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.920> that<00:02:37.100> second<00:02:37.430> hatchery<00:02:37.850> go<00:02:38.540> rush

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
going up to that second hatchery go rush

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.750 
going up to that second hatchery go rush
actually<00:02:39.200> just<00:02:39.440> now<00:02:39.740> got<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.130> Overlord<00:02:40.520> in

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
actually just now got that Overlord in

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.220 
actually just now got that Overlord in
the<00:02:41.120> base<00:02:41.270> I<00:02:41.420> think<00:02:41.600> that's<00:02:41.750> why<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.959> dropped

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
the base I think that's why I dropped

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.750 
the base I think that's why I dropped
that<00:02:42.320> spawning<00:02:42.800> pool<00:02:42.980> lang<00:02:43.130> did<00:02:43.340> he<00:02:43.430> sees<00:02:43.670> that

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
that spawning pool lang did he sees that

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.370 
that spawning pool lang did he sees that
attack<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.209> he's<00:02:44.510> putting<00:02:44.780> a<00:02:44.840> hatchery<00:02:45.020> at

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
attack you he's putting a hatchery at

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.170 
attack you he's putting a hatchery at
that<00:02:45.800> choke<00:02:46.070> that's<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.340> very<00:02:46.580> good<00:02:46.670> maneuver

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
that choke that's a very good maneuver

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.000 
that choke that's a very good maneuver
gonna<00:02:47.720> make<00:02:48.080> sure<00:02:48.230> that<00:02:48.410> those<00:02:48.560> Marines<00:02:48.890> those
