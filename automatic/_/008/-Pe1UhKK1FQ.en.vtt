00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.370
 youtube we razor friends 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.730
 I have just come home from work and 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.900
 Find 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:17.190
 respect as before mourinho 4 pp ramiro 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:21.449
 bought knife and he has me very much 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.550
 I packed in very well 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:30.150
 had been around this before now 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:32.009
 package of uncut now watch 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.399
 I even if I on here somehow 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.350
 this is especially true of the 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.040
 cut open the right place 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:46.160
 that that was really the cover but it was 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.239
 Seems like that and I'm afraid of them 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:01:00.809
 I will not wrap a second one 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:01:05.400
 can use times there comes that children 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:10.790
 love and as already announced one 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.790
 Save Kean 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.320
 if I try it then 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:38.939
 but here is the knife in it 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:41.299
 a train from father jessup and tension 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.299
 increases 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:19.580
 the good piece in sofia 70 with carbon 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:23.390
 handle shells have these handle shells 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:30.920
 significantly more structure than the carbon 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:33.410
 scarf of it suddenly with me that 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.049
 Because so much like to compare times 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:43.069
 really want to in a separate video 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:46.010
 already so much of the production quality 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.709
 heard of the enzo knife 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.630
 as well as the knives of 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.580
 suddenly but still exists 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.019
 of course a considerable one 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:01.400
 price difference to either measure or 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.230
 between the two houses and wanted 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:09.760
 I like to take a closer look 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:15.950
 is that really true? 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:19.060
 What's over here? 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.060
 see first sight 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:31.390
 there are no mistakes 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:36.850
 The blade is really determined 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.160
 between the two boards in the booklet 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.510
 only thing that bothers me personally 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.130
 it now here again this knew that 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:49.050
 is in my opinion one of the 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:53.700
 biggest design mistake the the 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:56.530
 can make messemacher 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:59.610
 it just looks ugly, though 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.650
 then in the open state 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:08.410
 the lily of the knife restored 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:12.880
 and it will be nice again 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:15.340
 but overall picture gives the most time 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:19.440
 you have a knife so closed too 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:23.250
 and I think it should be there too 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.250
 to look good 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:42.530
 the first pocketknife with candy that 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:49.590
 i have tpms 30 v the same penalty 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:54.409
 My name is called to me but 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:59.720
 through the scanndy connection i believe 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:05:03.960
 to hone relatively well too 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:05.069
 now only a guess at him 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.030
 I had that a bit 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:08.030
 hard to do 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.990
 Thank you for the great trade and 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:24.060
 it all worked so smoothly 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:29.719
 I am glad that I have this 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.719
 have and as I said soon 

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:39.680
 the end again with mine suddenly 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.680
 to compare something more closely 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:48.039
 until then I would be glad if you 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.979
 also be there again next time 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.400
 if it means new youtube love my 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.400
 friends
