from Oscar's Hotel yesterday we've
worked<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.520> much<00:01:38.880> on<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.540> before<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.799> long<00:01:41.070> that

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
worked so much on it before so long that

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.580 
worked so much on it before so long that
a<00:01:41.790> lot<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.240> what<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.509> were<00:01:42.540> writing<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:43.110> kind<00:01:43.470> of

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
a lot of what we were writing we kind of

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770 
a lot of what we were writing we kind of
like<00:01:43.770> stopped<00:01:44.340> seeing<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.880> funny<00:01:45.119> side<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.600> it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
like stopped seeing the funny side of it

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.510 
like stopped seeing the funny side of it
and<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.229> knew<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.799> was<00:01:47.070> still<00:01:47.159> there

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
and we knew that that was still there

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.399 
and we knew that that was still there
but<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:47.939> haven't<00:01:48.180> think<00:01:48.600> so<00:01:48.780> practically

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
but we haven't think so practically

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.440 
but we haven't think so practically
about<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:50.820> actually<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.329> being

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
about it and now actually just being

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.710 
about it and now actually just being
able<00:01:51.540> to<00:01:51.659> watch<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.950> feels<00:01:53.399> real<00:01:54.270> again<00:01:54.570> it

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
able to watch it it feels real again it

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.330 
able to watch it it feels real again it
feels<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.320> we're<00:01:55.530> watching<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.189> an

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
feels like we're watching it as an

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.980 
feels like we're watching it as an
audience<00:01:56.759> I<00:01:57.030> guess<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.390> feels<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
audience I guess it feels like the

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.530 
audience I guess it feels like the
culmination<00:01:58.920> of<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.790> many<00:01:59.909> months<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.360> work

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
culmination of so many months of work

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.939 
culmination of so many months of work
and<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.920> very<00:02:02.219> exciting<00:02:02.759> field
