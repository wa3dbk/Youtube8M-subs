00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 to youtube and welcome to this video 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.450
 that is part of a new series in my 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.250
 channel that is called I am invito and I the 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.750
 today we are going to talk about challenges to 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.750
 get dressed in a bikini 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.490
 being my cousin my body does not respond to 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.640
 patterns so that the industry 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.770
 fashion offers however I love fashion and 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.920
 Do not go shopping then always 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.689
 I'm like in a constant struggle 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.820
 I want to talk to you about some of the challenges 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.640
 with which I face when I go out to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.280
 buy clothes because good like you 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.380
 you can identify yourself with some and you 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.079
 can help a little bit you feel such 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.590
 which identified do not feel alone or 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.300
 You can even have some tip I do not know 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.760
 then nothing to write like to talk 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.070
 a little bit of this topic first of all 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.470
 I want to leave you something well and good in 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.360
 Of course you can not find clothes that 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.280
 look good to your body 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.610
 in no time does it mean that you 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.150
 body is ugly or has failed or is not 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.559
 well proportioned upside down means 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.150
 that the fashion industry is 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.159
 Failing because he is not responding to 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.280
 your needs and the needs of 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.740
 chabás with your body you're not alone there 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.900
 many chavas of any type 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.510
 body that often the industry does not 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.490
 responds to your needs 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.010
 designers of these great brands are 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.500
 they face a challenge they do not want to take 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:29.460
 which is to cut clothes well for us 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.340
 because it is difficult to design the cutting 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.230
 assemble it choose the textile we 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.680
 we need special treatment that does not 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.720
 are giving that the industry does not have no 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.340
 it's easy to make a pair of pants for 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.530
 someone who has small waist and 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.270
 the biggest legs in the world ni 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.220
 It is not easy to make a blouse that 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.160
 Be well someone who has a bust 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.710
 very pronounced and then he has it 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.810
 normalito is also super difficult to do 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.110
 a jacket that suits the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.960
 strong arms to big ones and one 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:04.020
 waist well waist goes clothes 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.200
 difficult to do that we do not find well 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.780
 done that does not mean that our 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.750
 body is bad I want to tell you 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.550
 some of my most common problems in 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.420
 regarding clothes that I use all 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.970
 day ordinary people 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.069
 for example the pants are left 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.739
 always very good from the legs up 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.940
 tight but waist left 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.910
 great because I'm more tender nothing than 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.459
 belt to the blouses that fit me 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.160
 of taste I have super super sleeves 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.739
 and they do not enter me and they lose a 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.690
 little the figure of my torso and for 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.840
 last one of the things that most 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.610
 sad are the jackets that barely 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.739
 I have arms that do not even 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.110
 I can do this movement freely 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.200
 but from here below I have left until 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.590
 even bigbirds or is badly made 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:01.640
 the clothes and the worst is that it's not cheap 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.010
 but a person can change their mind 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.200
 if you change your attitude for more than you 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.970
 it costs work and believes that and believe me that 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.430
 I also have a hard time 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.090
 get to the square with the best 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.980
 self-esteem feeling beautiful but here 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.430
 is the hard part you have to get out of the 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.799
 plaza feeling the same or better 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.140
 now it is very difficult because minimum 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.000
 to me you girls but we took 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.730
 the plaza very well very happy and in the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.890
 tester I start to feel bad and bad and 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.719
 bad and saying this I do not stay from here 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.260
 this moment from here this is what I have left 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:37.879
 big here and so on then 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.430
 I arrived super happy to the square and 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:43.430
 feeling beautiful and what and that I am 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.670
 perfect as I am and I go out with my hands 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.219
 empty and frustrated and sad for me 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.230
 body and that is not father because the 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.349
 fashion is made to enjoy the 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.590
 fashion is made to express itself not 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.840
 to feel bad another challenge without a doubt is 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.090
 choose the size when you're in the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.730
 store in the dresser what I do and 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.459
 I pass the tip is take a size e 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.859
 go one up and one down and put three 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.969
 pieces of the same model but different 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:15.950
 size to the tester prove me the three see 

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.199
 which one fits me well where and where 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.269
 I prefer that I stay better and where I 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:23.360
 do waist and so on 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:26.479
 and choose the size that best suits me 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.090
 for that garment that model please do not 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:32.419
 get married with a size number does not have 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.090
 meaning is just a number and these 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:37.580
 numbers vary according to the places 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.610
 where are you going to buy according to the fabric 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:44.990
 as the cut makes a lot 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:47.240
 things is just a number is a guide you 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.940
 you can move from that number and not pass 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.919
 nothing is to leave here the link to 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.130
 a video I made pants 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:58.220
 denim I use showing them what use 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:05:00.440
 of super varied sizes from 12 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.789
 until the 14th some of them fit me well 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.710
 Some legs love me well 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.240
 Some of my waist are some long 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.460
 I fall short and so on 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.960
 the last challenge that I want to tell you and 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.910
 is I think one of the most challenges 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.850
 difficult to overcome 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:17.180
 is that the plus size clothes are 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.890
 super aseñorada I am a girl of 20 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.100
 I do not want to dress like a 

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:25.610
 lady in this extra size clothes 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.440
 for my age and my lifestyle about 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.030
 everything in department stores like 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.460

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.580
 some the clothes and extra size is of 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.430
 lady but part of bored lady ni 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.010

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.740

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.580
 buy extra clothing 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:52.700
 basically but in summary you have to 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.740
 search locate and visit stores of 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.870
 clothes that are not as big are not the 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.140
 great boom nor the great brand but that 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.240
