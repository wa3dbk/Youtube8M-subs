00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.639 
Hoopa honestly the Hoopoe one comes off
as<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.670> most<00:00:41.879> underwhelming<00:00:42.649> legendary

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
as the most underwhelming legendary

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.610 
as the most underwhelming legendary
event<00:00:43.950> pokemon<00:00:44.399> probably<00:00:45.120> ever<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.870> cannot<00:00:46.350> see

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
event pokemon probably ever I cannot see

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.130 
event pokemon probably ever I cannot see
this<00:00:46.800> thing<00:00:47.010> as<00:00:47.309> an<00:00:47.789> event<00:00:48.090> Pokemon<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:48.840> all

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
this thing as an event Pokemon at all

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.869 
this thing as an event Pokemon at all
but<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.309> mean<00:00:50.910> apparently<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.899> is<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.219> even<00:00:53.730> if

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
but I mean apparently it is but even if

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.650 
but I mean apparently it is but even if
these<00:00:54.030> aren't<00:00:54.390> real<00:00:54.809> they're<00:00:55.140> still<00:00:56.660> like

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
these aren't real they're still like

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.389 
these aren't real they're still like
honestly<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.260> don't<00:00:58.500> know<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:58.859> even<00:00:58.890> believe

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
honestly I don't know if I even believe

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.279 
honestly I don't know if I even believe
them<00:00:59.609> because<00:00:59.850> they<00:01:00.239> just<00:01:00.449> come<00:01:00.690> off<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:01.050> such

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
them because they just come off as such

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.229 
them because they just come off as such
underwhelming<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.309> event<00:01:02.730> Pokemon

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
underwhelming of that event Pokemon

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.570 
underwhelming of that event Pokemon
however<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:04.409> main<00:01:04.589> thing<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.100> wanted<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
however the main thing that I wanted to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.420 
however the main thing that I wanted to
discuss<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.320> fact<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.799> they're

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
discuss is that the fact that they're

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.780 
discuss is that the fact that they're
able<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.270> release<00:01:09.720> Pokemon<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:11.520> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
able to just release Pokemon just you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.060 
able to just release Pokemon just you
know<00:01:11.909> through<00:01:12.630> mystery<00:01:13.080> gift<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.590> I

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
know through mystery gift like that I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.710 
know through mystery gift like that I
think<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:15.000> good<00:01:15.299> thing<00:01:15.509> because

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
think is a really good thing because

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.480 
think is a really good thing because
maybe<00:01:16.170> down<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.470> road<00:01:16.619> they<00:01:17.040> might<00:01:17.250> they

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
maybe down the road they might they

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.179 
maybe down the road they might they
might<00:01:17.820> release<00:01:18.180> another<00:01:18.689> Pokemon<00:01:19.290> with<00:01:19.740> um

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
might release another Pokemon with um

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.999 
might release another Pokemon with um
like<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> mega<00:01:21.330> stone<00:01:21.479> like<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> Pokemon<00:01:22.890> we

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
like a mega stone like a Pokemon we

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.710 
like a mega stone like a Pokemon we
haven't<00:01:23.369> already<00:01:23.490> seen<00:01:23.970> yet<00:01:24.180> just<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.570> they

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
haven't already seen yet just like they

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.570 
haven't already seen yet just like they
did<00:01:24.780> with<00:01:25.049> Torchic<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:26.130> might<00:01:26.369> release

did with Torchic they might release

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.550 
did with Torchic they might release
another<00:01:27.060> Pokemon<00:01:27.509> later<00:01:27.720> down<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:27.990> road<00:01:28.110> with

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
another Pokemon later down the road with

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.080 
another Pokemon later down the road with
like<00:01:28.710> a<00:01:28.740> mega<00:01:28.979> stone<00:01:29.100> that<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.729> haven't<00:01:30.000> seen

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
like a mega stone that we haven't seen

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
like a mega stone that we haven't seen
yet<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.659> they<00:01:30.780> have<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> ability<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.590> do

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
yet like they have the ability to do

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.560 
yet like they have the ability to do
that<00:01:32.130> which<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.430> which<00:01:32.759> i<00:01:32.939> think<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.270> really

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that which I which i think is really

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.510 
that which I which i think is really
cool<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:34.500> they<00:01:34.650> had<00:01:34.860> they<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> ability

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
cool like they had they have the ability

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.940 
cool like they had they have the ability
to<00:01:36.000> implement<00:01:36.450> Pokemon<00:01:37.170> later<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.799> game

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
to implement Pokemon later in the game

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.609 
to implement Pokemon later in the game
as<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.310> goes<00:01:38.460> on<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.360> feel<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.140> adds<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
as it goes on so I feel like it adds to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.950 
as it goes on so I feel like it adds to
the<00:01:40.799> longevity<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.970> game<00:01:42.150> if<00:01:42.450> they're

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the longevity of the game if they're

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.139 
the longevity of the game if they're
going<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.259> keep<00:01:43.500> um<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.460> they're<00:01:44.939> going<00:01:45.090> to

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
going to keep um if they're going to

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.499 
going to keep um if they're going to
wait<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> while<00:01:46.200> before<00:01:47.060> letting<00:01:48.060> us<00:01:48.240> actually

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
wait a while before letting us actually

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.480 
wait a while before letting us actually
have<00:01:48.720> access<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.590> these<00:01:49.680> Pokemon<00:01:50.220> because

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
have access to these Pokemon because

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.490 
have access to these Pokemon because
honestly<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.630> if<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.899> started<00:01:52.320> hacking

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
honestly like if we started hacking

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.350 
honestly like if we started hacking
Pokemon<00:01:53.070> now<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.640> found<00:01:54.000> everything

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
Pokemon now and just found everything

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.359 
Pokemon now and just found everything
out<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:54.869> at<00:01:55.049> once<00:01:55.079> I<00:01:55.590> feel<00:01:55.920> like<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.219> game

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
out all at once I feel like the game

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.109 
out all at once I feel like the game
would<00:01:56.579> get<00:01:56.790> pretty<00:01:57.689> stale<00:01:58.399> pretty<00:01:59.399> quick<00:01:59.729> so

like an what why like it's almost pretty
much<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.200> same<00:03:01.380> an<00:03:01.590> image<00:03:02.240> but<00:03:03.240> if<00:03:03.540> that

happens to be a mega form for it I be

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.250 
happens to be a mega form for it I be
very<00:03:08.310> I'm<00:03:09.210> not<00:03:09.360> sure<00:03:09.570> how<00:03:09.750> I'd<00:03:09.870> feel<00:03:09.900> about

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
very I'm not sure how I'd feel about

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.230 
very I'm not sure how I'd feel about
that<00:03:10.470> honestly<00:03:10.980> looks<00:03:11.310> like<00:03:11.490> an<00:03:11.610> airplane<00:03:11.910> to

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:12.240 
that honestly looks like an airplane to

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.830 
that honestly looks like an airplane to
me<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.660> I<00:03:13.470> don't<00:03:13.680> really<00:03:13.890> see<00:03:14.340> any<00:03:14.840> variation

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
me and I don't really see any variation

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.040 
me and I don't really see any variation
within<00:03:16.610> apparently<00:03:17.610> these<00:03:17.850> two<00:03:18.180> so<00:03:18.480> it<00:03:18.780> may<00:03:19.020> as

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
within apparently these two so it may as

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.930 
within apparently these two so it may as
well<00:03:19.290> be<00:03:20.150> fake<00:03:21.150> we<00:03:21.540> don't<00:03:21.660> know<00:03:21.959> but

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
well be fake we don't know but

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.979 
well be fake we don't know but
regardless<00:03:23.940> I<00:03:24.209> think<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.510> would<00:03:24.600> be<00:03:24.690> cool<00:03:24.930> if

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
regardless I think it would be cool if

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.500 
regardless I think it would be cool if
they<00:03:25.620> can<00:03:25.920> just<00:03:26.250> release<00:03:26.580> pokemon<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.270> that

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
they can just release pokemon like that

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.750 
they can just release pokemon like that
into<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.500> game<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.980> think<00:03:29.220> that'd<00:03:29.370> be<00:03:29.489> really

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
into the game I think that'd be really

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.840 
into the game I think that'd be really
really<00:03:30.060> awesome<00:03:30.650> um<00:03:31.650> you<00:03:32.220> guys<00:03:32.370> can<00:03:32.610> let<00:03:32.730> me

know what you think honestly this is
just<00:03:35.040> my<00:03:35.160> opinion<00:03:35.190> on<00:03:35.730> it<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:36.000> wanted<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.570> talk

about this because I have been thinking

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.420 
about this because I have been thinking
if<00:03:39.300> they<00:03:39.450> can<00:03:39.630> release<00:03:39.989> things<00:03:40.070> into<00:03:41.070> mystery

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
if they can release things into mystery

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.660 
if they can release things into mystery
gift<00:03:41.670> as<00:03:41.970> easy<00:03:42.660> as<00:03:43.140> they<00:03:43.739> can<00:03:43.980> with<00:03:44.190> Torchic
