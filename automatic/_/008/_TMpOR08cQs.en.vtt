00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.800
 forgiveness serves for all the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.090

 stressed no cases put that 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.100
 It's good for Wii and well, nothing will be 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.530
 she to light boxing that you see here also 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.900
 the quality that it has puts it here sound 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.900
 surround and all that and nothing 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.249
 Yeah sure 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.300
 we take out here 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.120
 in the helmet logo 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:19.259
 and well here we have pretty good 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.190
 come on I'm going to leave the helmets here at 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.190
 Tuesday and here you have the cables 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.760
 6 instruction manual 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.840
 later I will also tell you in another video 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.410
 how it works so it's worth it and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.410
 all that in nothing 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.560
 let's see the cables 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.260
 m 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:56.220
 this if I remember correctly for equipment to 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.220
 connect the others 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:02.409
 this acts as a bluetooth receiver in 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.219
 the computer 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:11.170
 a usb mini usb cable to recharge 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:13.330
 the helmets and this can be normal or 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.450
 type say to connect it to any 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.550
 basis for listening to music or any 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.850
 thing 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.850
 as I've said before 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.990
 It serves for everyone in general 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.290
 backwards 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.900
 do not leave here apart 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.200
 and nothing like that with the plastic well 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.380
 retained the truth is that it shows that 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.610
 It is of very good quality 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.590
 it looks like it has to be super comfortable 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.920
 here is the retractable mic that is 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.870
 that are stored in the own has dock 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.760
 which is putting where you 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.670
 want but also saved in the 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:03.070
 own helmet good I'll try 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.070
 turn it on so you can see the I do not know what 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.340
 it turns on and the truth is quite 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.040
 pretty handsome have several lights 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.130
 they have red means that the micro is 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.270
 silence in green that you can not know if 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.640
 I would appreciate kilos 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.200
 here is detecting the play but not what 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.200
 I have it is the day so it will be thrown here 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.740
 a while and it lights up here for this 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.270
 edeeste by this button and nothing with this 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.330
 means that when it is in red it brings 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.460
 least do not hear you in green means 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.710
 they hear you everything that everything that happens 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.830
 and in blue they only listen to you that is 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.570
 that only in the micro concentrates your voice 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.270
 so that they listen to you nothing but you 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.270
 not what happens throughout the rest of your 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.680
 home and nothing I'll try it and I'll tell you in 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.980
 the next video how are they so 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.980
 good 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.610
 I'm going to turn it off 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:00.490
 I leave it with the title of there are cables the 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:02.890
 box and the instruction manual 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.660
 and well nothing more kids I hope that 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.210
 I'm going to like a bag and I'll tell you 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.210
 how is it so nothing until the next
