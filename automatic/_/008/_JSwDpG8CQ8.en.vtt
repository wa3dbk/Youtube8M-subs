roserade and he actually goes for an
extreme<00:00:37.410> speed<00:00:37.710> probably<00:00:38.250> predicting<00:00:38.969> the

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
extreme speed probably predicting the

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.840 
extreme speed probably predicting the
sleep<00:00:39.300> powder<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.079> do<00:00:40.440> go<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
sleep powder and I do go for it and

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.240 
sleep powder and I do go for it and
right<00:00:42.210> now<00:00:42.300> he's<00:00:42.480> gonna<00:00:42.629> switch<00:00:43.020> well<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:43.829> I

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
right now he's gonna switch well as I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.279 
right now he's gonna switch well as I
actually<00:00:44.550> predicted<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.390> well<00:00:45.539> looking<00:00:46.260> back

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
actually predicted it well looking back

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.220 
actually predicted it well looking back
then<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.160> should<00:00:47.460> have<00:00:47.579> gone<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.629> release<00:00:49.020> to

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
then I should have gone for release to

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.889 
then I should have gone for release to

really<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.869> switch<00:02:01.320> so<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.280> was<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> cool

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
really a switch so there was a cool

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.670 
really a switch so there was a cool
prediction<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.869> still<00:02:04.170> doesn't<00:02:04.290> do<00:02:04.560> much

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
prediction but it still doesn't do much

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.100 
prediction but it still doesn't do much
the<00:02:04.979> heat<00:02:05.250> right<00:02:05.460> unfortunately<00:02:05.640> so<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.659> go<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the heat right unfortunately so I go to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.809 
the heat right unfortunately so I go to
my<00:02:07.259> special<00:02:07.680> ball<00:02:07.890> mr.<00:02:08.250> Ben

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
my special ball mr. Ben

my special ball mr. Ben
the<00:02:09.119> dragonite<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.079> he<00:02:10.229> actually<00:02:10.379> makes<00:02:11.129> a

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the dragonite and he actually makes a

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.550 
the dragonite and he actually makes a
double<00:02:11.609> switch<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.090> he's<00:02:12.390> like<00:02:12.629> out

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
double switch so he's like out

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.619 
double switch so he's like out
predicting<00:02:14.430> me<00:02:14.549> right<00:02:14.790> now<00:02:14.999> and<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.599> don't

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629

spit<00:03:42.090> on<00:03:42.239> my<00:03:42.389> table<00:03:42.659> fuck<00:03:43.879> okay<00:03:45.139> so<00:03:46.139> I<00:03:46.169> have<00:03:46.409> my

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
spit on my table fuck okay so I have my

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.249 
spit on my table fuck okay so I have my
ride<00:03:46.859> out<00:03:47.189> and<00:03:47.489> he<00:03:48.000> switches<00:03:48.269> into<00:03:48.479> break<00:03:48.840> they

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:49.259 
ride out and he switches into break they

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.459 
ride out and he switches into break they
rose<00:03:49.530> rate<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.659> well<00:03:51.659> I<00:03:51.689> think<00:03:51.840> it's<00:03:52.109> a<00:03:52.169> double

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:52.469 
rose rate and well I think it's a double

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:54.379 
rose rate and well I think it's a double
switch<00:03:52.620> or<00:03:52.829> something<00:03:52.979> but<00:03:53.370> you<00:03:54.120> probably

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
switch or something but you probably

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.939 
switch or something but you probably
already<00:03:54.629> guessed<00:03:54.959> he's<00:03:55.229> raping<00:03:55.620> me<00:03:55.739> at<00:03:55.829> this

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:55.949 
already guessed he's raping me at this

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.800 
already guessed he's raping me at this
point<00:03:56.250> because<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.549> can<00:03:56.759> do<00:03:57.000> nothing<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.629> him

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
point because I can do nothing to him

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.399 
point because I can do nothing to him
well<00:03:58.879> yeah<00:03:59.879> if<00:04:00.090> I<00:04:00.239> started<00:04:00.629> using<00:04:00.750> my<00:04:01.049> fucking

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:01.409 
well yeah if I started using my fucking

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:03.979 
well yeah if I started using my fucking
head<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:02.040> think<00:04:02.639> a<00:04:02.759> bit<00:04:02.790> before<00:04:03.419> clicking

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
head and think a bit before clicking

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.469 
head and think a bit before clicking
moves<00:04:04.349> then<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.680> probably<00:04:05.189> can<00:04:05.639> like<00:04:05.969> win<00:04:06.269> this

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
moves then I probably can like win this

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:09.529 
moves then I probably can like win this
but<00:04:06.979> probably<00:04:07.979> you'll<00:04:08.159> know<00:04:08.310> why<00:04:08.459> i<00:04:08.489> am<00:04:08.939> i'm

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:09.539 
but probably you'll know why i am i'm

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:12.369
