in very easily

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.660 
in very easily
and<00:02:07.820> it<00:02:08.629> keeps<00:02:08.869> it<00:02:09.020> very<00:02:09.050> nice<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.250> securely

and it keeps it very nice and securely
covered<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.720> thick<00:02:12.110> faux<00:02:12.800> leather

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
covered this is a thick faux leather

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.199 
covered this is a thick faux leather
outside<00:02:14.319> and<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:16.160> killer<00:02:16.400> feature<00:02:16.760> on<00:02:17.030> this

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
outside and the killer feature on this

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.460 
outside and the killer feature on this
and<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.569> guess<00:02:17.720> that's<00:02:17.840> why<00:02:18.019> they<00:02:18.170> call<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.349> the

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
and I guess that's why they call it the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.059 
and I guess that's why they call it the
convertible<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:20.360> has<00:02:21.019> a<00:02:21.050> couple<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.709> different

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
convertible it has a couple of different

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.089 
convertible it has a couple of different
ways<00:02:22.099> where<00:02:22.430> it<00:02:22.489> opens<00:02:22.580> up<00:02:22.879> and<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:24.260> will<00:02:24.739> sit

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
ways where it opens up and it will sit

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.800 
ways where it opens up and it will sit
at<00:02:25.340> different<00:02:26.060> viewing<00:02:26.239> angles<00:02:26.660> there's

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
at different viewing angles there's

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.750 
at different viewing angles there's
these<00:02:26.870> little<00:02:26.930> grooves<00:02:27.560> right<00:02:27.980> here<00:02:28.519> that

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
these little grooves right here that

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.979 
these little grooves right here that
allowed<00:02:29.060> to<00:02:29.269> sit<00:02:29.480> at<00:02:29.569> different<00:02:29.840> viewing

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
allowed to sit at different viewing

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.600 
allowed to sit at different viewing
angles<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:30.890> can<00:02:31.040> have<00:02:31.190> it<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.340> little<00:02:31.430> bit

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
angles so I can have it a little bit

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.089 
angles so I can have it a little bit
more<00:02:31.760> upright<00:02:32.060> further<00:02:32.989> down<00:02:33.290> right<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:33.769> then

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
more upright further down right and then

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.380 
more upright further down right and then
further<00:02:34.310> downward<00:02:34.549> again<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.120> it<00:02:35.180> usually

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
further downward again and it usually

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.110 
further downward again and it usually
does<00:02:35.810> not<00:02:35.840> slip<00:02:36.410> sometimes<00:02:36.769> well<00:02:37.640> just<00:02:37.970> look

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
does not slip sometimes well just look

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.610 
does not slip sometimes well just look
right<00:02:38.360> there<00:02:38.599> definitely<00:02:38.840> get<00:02:39.140> in<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.379> groove

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
right there definitely get in the groove

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.009 
right there definitely get in the groove
I<00:02:40.370> think<00:02:40.819> this<00:02:40.880> is<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.060> good<00:02:41.209> case<00:02:41.450> I'd

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
I think this is a good case I'd

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.630 
I think this is a good case I'd
recommend<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.650> anybody<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.160> really

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
recommend this to anybody that really

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.960 
recommend this to anybody that really

like is that when you have it in this

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.569 
like is that when you have it in this
position<00:02:55.819> for<00:02:56.030> amount<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:56.840> time<00:02:57.110> your<00:02:57.920> iPad

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
case because they had this guard

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.990 
case because they had this guard
installed<00:03:06.380> where<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:06.980> can<00:03:07.099> flip<00:03:07.370> it<00:03:07.400> under
