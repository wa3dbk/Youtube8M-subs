00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:06.340
 today we are going to prepare the green fairy 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:09.070
 basically we are going to prepare the torch 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.280
 of absinthe for this we must have a 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.019
 more or less thick cup 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.700
 this is to support the flames of 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.260
 the torch 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.940
 we have to have the spoon for 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.390
 absinthe 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:25.320
 in the case that they do not have this spoonful 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.320
 they can also use two forks 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.890
 in this way they will get the base 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.180
 perfect to put a dark blue on the 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.180
 if they do not have the spoon 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.350
 the sugar that I recommend is sugar 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.539
 blonde brown sugar 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.059
 we give more roasted flavor karam way 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.250
 ice cream and it also melts faster with 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.740
 water and fire 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.380
 we add the accent 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:57.600
 I recommend it to be a song of measure 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.600
 sixty by three water 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.320
 we handle 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.920
 we are the ones who touch a little sugar 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.240
 it looks like caramel flavor 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 and we add the water 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.330
 It is important 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.330
 that absinthe take the ether as milk 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.760
 of bon to be whitish when 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.950
 it's good quality 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.080
 this is because the oils of the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.470
 accident or the one that is sensitive to 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.470
 Water 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.869
 as long as the solution contains it or 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.770
 agents contain your 80 is going to take a 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.770
 whiter color 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.800
 [Laughs] 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.080
 I'm creating is now ready to be 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.080
 served
