00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:04.120
 Welcome to the first Simon Franz Tutorial 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.790
 not sure that it has enough industries and that the number 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.079
 the power plants is not too low 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:15.079
 the rest of the setting should be the first so 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.220
 The production of the card may take a while depending on what you do 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.380
 has set 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.259
 We are now trying to provide a picture power plant with money 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:27.900
 this would be the first time on the 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.300
 Lists administration and then on the branches of the factories 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.129
 Then scroll down to the bottom and hopefully find no luck there 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:37.320
 power plant 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.660
 with a click on the arrow for how long then also Werk exceeded a click on 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.680
 the image power plant then opens the info window and shows us below 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.120
 Others who delivered this power plant in the case 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.120
 exactly one ornament Kropfmühl points 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.170
 There we click again on the small arrow and the camera as a cult immediately 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.000
 End zero points 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.310
 here again we have 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.310
 the possibility AFP info-window it 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.270
 If you click on the picture I am an info window sculptures again in addition one 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.300
 returned the object 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.390
 Now we have to find out where the maps are in the case 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.909
 simply because everything is so close together 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.720
 That does not have to be that way 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.640
 "We want to let a train go now and of course we need it first 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.920
 rails 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.580
 we go to that railroad tooling and then the cheapest 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:30.750
 seemed to be deep 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.400
 These are the very left 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.860
 Sheen are relatively expensive so you should start with the cheapest 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.410
 to take 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.750
 with it we now connect the mates with the power plant, then both of them 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.080
 Factories each have a straight piece of rails available 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 Stations can be built not only on straight lines 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.030
 Next we need the stations 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.610
 There are essentially two Günther stations to choose from which one 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.479
 now - simply serve a matter of taste 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.479
 apart from the ones they are both identical 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:18.229
 pay close attention to this orange area and from it 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:22.579
 The station definitely sion that the particular bends in the area 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.529
 We are now starting from a train station 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:31.489
 two boxes and at the power plant then again a station with two 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.489
 casket 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:40.980
 Now we need the PUK and the PUK you can only at one 

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:41.999
 Build dead end 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:45.079
 That's why there were a few extra tracks 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:48.079
 where to start build that relatively no matter 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:52.609
 and at the end we were then that cow 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.859
 with a left click come the cow 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.239
 Window into it 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.859
 There you can start putting together work of the 5 step on all the ads 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.829
 so that not all are displayed 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.829
 then turn off an e-lok 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.839
 and there is also a whole 

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:19.899
 Lot of loxten we can choose from, we have to be very precise here 

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:24.509
 Make sure that the lure does not cost too much, especially in maintenance 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:30.219
 bottom left you can see how much the individual Glocks or wagons 

00:03:30.219 --> 00:03:31.399
 costs 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:36.139
 in the far left is the purchase price and in brackets right next to it you can see 

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:39.139
 the maintenance costs 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:43.559
 Damian us now just the cheapest he certainly does not look for it 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.559
 but howling will do his service 

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:52.009
 Of course we need a locomotive and we are all there 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:55.009
 relatively large selection for different sizes 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.840
 «Our power plants consumed oil 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.999
 and our cows buddy produced furniture 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:04.099
 that means we will definitely be one 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.790
 Mill and 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.459
 when pulling wagon 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.439
 use 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.939
 and there are currently three of them to choose from and here we are 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.929
 again the cheapest and two of them
