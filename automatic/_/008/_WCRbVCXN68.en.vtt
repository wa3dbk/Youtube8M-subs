00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:07.200
 Good morning, everyone, today I talk to you about 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.900
 lotion mix of haven ie this 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.929
 let's say makeup remover 3 in 1 that 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.599
 face and eye makeup without rinsing 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.690
 for sensitive skin event inside 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.070
 the water is in fact in the thermal water 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.689
 of haven 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.060
 there is no need even for the tonic 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.210
 so really a 3 in 1 I have the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.119
 400 ml pack but there is also the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.130
 200 ml pack as well as a small one 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.140
 travel that is usually given as a present 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.940
 near the big the average 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.960
 its price hovers this from here 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.690
 400 ml on the 15 euros while that of 200 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.290
 ml can be found in circulation around 10 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.870
 EUR 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.079
 the deadline is six months then one 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.969
 deadline really passes to me it has me 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.860
 even the plug broke suddenly 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.960
 decided to abandon it there 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.180
 so I usually keep it with a 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.820
 hood over so that it does not enter 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.399
 the area perfectly removes his own 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.159
 eyes without leaving residues though 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.689
 unfortunately I have to say about the wording for 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.110
 sensitive skin 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.960
 I don't have very sensitive skin eyes 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.880
 in fact I consider myself lucky because I can 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.759
 to wear makeup with all kinds of makeup 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.540
 I almost never had any problems with 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.960
 allergies 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.330
 however unfortunately this water mix goes 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.240
 well that perfectly exploits me however 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.030
 it makes a lot of eyes redden and if 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.009
 goes inside the eye pinches in 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.570
 an impressive way not the 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.299
 advice to those with sensitive skin 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.329
 but also to those who do not have it in the sense that 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.720
 now I bought it I don't think of 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.189
 to be able to buy it back because anyway 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.590
 they burn their eyes with everything I don't have 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.350
 I like a sensitive skin because 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.360
 however it removes makeup well but I don't like it 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.120
 because my eyes pinch so 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.940
 always better 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.620
 not micellar, maybe from other companies a 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.160
 slightly more delicate than on the cable as well 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.160
 eyes and face 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.450
 let me know if you have tried 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.000
 micellar water de ven 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.629
 see you at the next video a big kiss 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.260
 to the next 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.260
 Hello
