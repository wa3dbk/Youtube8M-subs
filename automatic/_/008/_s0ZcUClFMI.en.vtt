00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.250 

LED<00:00:07.500> lights<00:00:07.740> have<00:00:08.040> grown<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.849> long<00:00:09.360> way<00:00:09.720> since

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
LED lights have grown a long way since

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.259 
LED lights have grown a long way since
their<00:00:10.470> initial<00:00:10.920> inception<00:00:11.340> for<00:00:11.730> our<00:00:11.820> industry

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
their initial inception for our industry

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.080 
their initial inception for our industry
now<00:00:12.720> we<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:13.230> lights<00:00:13.920> like<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.639> is<00:00:14.820> the

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
now we have lights like this this is the

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.930 
now we have lights like this this is the
out<00:00:15.300> sight<00:00:15.690> cream<00:00:16.170> source<00:00:16.470> with<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.340> row<00:00:17.730> of

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
out sight cream source with a row of

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.570 
out sight cream source with a row of
little<00:00:18.869> LED<00:00:19.530> emitters<00:00:19.949> like<00:00:20.190> we're<00:00:20.340> used<00:00:20.460> to

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
little LED emitters like we're used to

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.880 
little LED emitters like we're used to
seeing<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.210> now<00:00:21.420> they<00:00:22.020> are<00:00:22.260> not<00:00:22.650> only

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
seeing but now they are not only

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.290 
seeing but now they are not only
high-efficiency<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:23.880> they<00:00:24.000> have<00:00:24.150> these

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
high-efficiency but they have these

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.640 
high-efficiency but they have these
little<00:00:24.480> lenses<00:00:25.050> on<00:00:25.170> them<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.380> can<00:00:25.529> actually

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
little lenses on them I can actually

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.830 
little lenses on them I can actually
show<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.130> what<00:00:26.460> these<00:00:27.090> little<00:00:27.270> lenses<00:00:27.689> look

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
show you what these little lenses look

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.429 
show you what these little lenses look
like<00:00:28.020> here<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.119> spot<00:00:30.119> version<00:00:30.630> here<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.410> a

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
like here is the spot version here is a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.110 
like here is the spot version here is a
flood<00:00:32.099> version<00:00:32.489> which<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.789> little<00:00:33.030> bit

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
flood version which is a little bit

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.690 
flood version which is a little bit
conical<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:34.020> gives<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:34.829> bigger<00:00:35.280> spread

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
conical that gives you a bigger spread

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.780 
conical that gives you a bigger spread
of<00:00:35.970> the<00:00:36.090> light<00:00:36.270> but<00:00:37.010> it's<00:00:38.010> like<00:00:38.190> having<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.579> lens

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
of the light but it's like having a lens

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.510 
of the light but it's like having a lens
on<00:00:38.970> any<00:00:39.180> light<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:39.840> are<00:00:40.079> controlling<00:00:41.040> where

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
on any light you are controlling where

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.400 
on any light you are controlling where
all<00:00:41.790> that<00:00:41.940> light<00:00:42.180> goes<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.870> get<00:00:43.110> great

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
all that light goes and so you get great

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.530 
all that light goes and so you get great
efficiency<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.489> light<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> equivalent

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
efficiency this light is the equivalent

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.280 
efficiency this light is the equivalent
of<00:00:45.600> about<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.920> 575<00:00:46.920> watt<00:00:47.190> HMI<00:00:47.670> which<00:00:48.629> is<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> lot

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
of about a 575 watt HMI which is a lot

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.520 
of about a 575 watt HMI which is a lot
it<00:00:50.100> only<00:00:50.309> eats<00:00:50.460> about<00:00:50.730> 300<00:00:51.300> watts<00:00:51.540> but<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.410> can

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
it only eats about 300 watts but you can

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.260 
it only eats about 300 watts but you can
see<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.860> puts<00:00:53.039> out<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> heck<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.850> lot<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.120> light

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
see it puts out a heck of a lot of light

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.319 
see it puts out a heck of a lot of light
now<00:00:54.809> at<00:00:54.989> 10<00:00:55.320> feet<00:00:55.620> how<00:00:55.920> much<00:00:56.160> light<00:00:56.430> at<00:00:56.760> 10<00:00:57.059> feet

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
now at 10 feet how much light at 10 feet

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.630 
now at 10 feet how much light at 10 feet
I<00:00:57.539> had<00:00:57.960> about<00:00:59.629> 525<00:01:00.629> foot<00:01:01.079> candles<00:01:01.440> spread<00:01:02.129> over

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
I had about 525 foot candles spread over

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.050 
I had about 525 foot candles spread over
a<00:01:03.210> six<00:01:03.600> foot<00:01:03.870> range<00:01:04.170> that's<00:01:04.829> great<00:01:05.549> efficiency

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
a six foot range that's great efficiency

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.910 
a six foot range that's great efficiency
that's<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> spot<00:01:06.689> version<00:01:07.079> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.259> light<00:01:07.439> if

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that's the spot version of the light if

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.639 
that's the spot version of the light if
you<00:01:08.130> have<00:01:08.399> some<00:01:09.179> diffusion<00:01:09.539> on<00:01:09.929> it<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.380> soften

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
you have some diffusion on it to soften

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:13.219 
you have some diffusion on it to soften
the<00:01:10.889> light<00:01:11.039> I<00:01:11.279> put<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.700> some<00:01:12.119> 216<00:01:12.840> common

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the light I put a some 216 common

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.440 
the light I put a some 216 common
diffusion<00:01:13.679> about<00:01:14.340> 8<00:01:14.520> inches<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.969> front<00:01:15.209> which

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
diffusion about 8 inches in front which

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.779 
diffusion about 8 inches in front which
was<00:01:15.569> just<00:01:15.779> enough<00:01:16.079> to<00:01:16.139> really<00:01:16.799> soften<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
was just enough to really soften out the

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.029 
was just enough to really soften out the
light<00:01:17.969> and<00:01:17.999> hide<00:01:18.689> any<00:01:18.959> shadows<00:01:19.380> whatsoever<00:01:19.829> I

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
light and hide any shadows whatsoever I

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.179 
light and hide any shadows whatsoever I
got<00:01:20.819> a<00:01:20.849> 10<00:01:21.270> foot<00:01:21.509> spread<00:01:21.929> at<00:01:22.259> 10<00:01:22.499> feet<00:01:22.679> away<00:01:22.859> I

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
got a 10 foot spread at 10 feet away I

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.459 
got a 10 foot spread at 10 feet away I
got<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.399> 10<00:01:23.700> foot<00:01:23.880> spread<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.779> had<00:01:24.929> 80<00:01:25.200> foot

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
got a 10 foot spread and so had 80 foot

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:28.069 
got a 10 foot spread and so had 80 foot
candles<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.369> light<00:01:26.609> so<00:01:26.819> a<00:01:27.029> great<00:01:27.450> efficiency

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
candles of light so a great efficiency

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.870 
candles of light so a great efficiency
out<00:01:28.109> of<00:01:28.319> this<00:01:28.590> light<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.639> run<00:01:29.759> off

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
out of this light which can be run off

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.669 
out of this light which can be run off
battery<00:01:30.240> power<00:01:30.419> by<00:01:30.569> the<00:01:30.630> way<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.590> is

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
battery power by the way you can this is

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:33.169 
battery power by the way you can this is
run<00:01:31.859> off<00:01:31.889> the<00:01:32.069> AC<00:01:32.219> power<00:01:32.429> right<00:01:32.669> now<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:32.969> I<00:01:32.999> can

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
run off the AC power right now but I can

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:34.669 
run off the AC power right now but I can
just<00:01:33.419> plug<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.719> into<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.899> big<00:01:34.049> block<00:01:34.289> battery

connections<00:01:50.819> of<00:01:50.999> you<00:01:51.149> had<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.419> up<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.599> a<00:01:51.659> grid

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:52.169 
connections of you had it up on a grid

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:55.550 
connections of you had it up on a grid
system<00:01:52.639> other<00:01:53.639> controls<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:55.079> with<00:01:55.349> is

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
system other controls is that with is

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.169 
system other controls is that with is
dimmer<00:01:55.859> right<00:01:56.219> now<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.849> in<00:01:56.969> what's

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
dimmer right now I have it in what's

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.499 
dimmer right now I have it in what's
called<00:01:57.329> dual<00:01:57.779> mode<00:01:58.079> for<00:01:58.770> exposure<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.729> on<00:02:00.029> this

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
called dual mode for exposure so on this

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.789 
called dual mode for exposure so on this
button<00:02:00.809> I<00:02:00.929> could<00:02:00.989> do<00:02:01.169> it<00:02:01.259> on<00:02:01.349> the<00:02:01.439> remote<00:02:01.679> as

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
button I could do it on the remote as

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.379 
button I could do it on the remote as
well<00:02:01.829> change<00:02:02.609> the<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.880> brightness<00:02:03.179> there's<00:02:03.359> a

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:03.389 
well change the to brightness there's a

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.959 
well change the to brightness there's a
little<00:02:03.599> I<00:02:03.779> can<00:02:04.679> switch<00:02:05.369> between<00:02:05.639> two

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
little I can switch between two

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.489 
little I can switch between two
brightnesses<00:02:06.389> that's<00:02:06.599> that's<00:02:06.929> not<00:02:07.109> going<00:02:07.380> off

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:07.499 
brightnesses that's that's not going off

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.380 
brightnesses that's that's not going off
let's<00:02:07.739> say<00:02:07.859> here<00:02:08.069> that<00:02:08.099> that's<00:02:08.700> turned<00:02:09.000> off<00:02:09.149> so

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
let's say here that that's turned off so

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.929 
let's say here that that's turned off so
I<00:02:09.420> can<00:02:09.629> actually<00:02:10.110> control<00:02:10.439> it<00:02:10.860> with<00:02:11.700> two

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:11.939 
I can actually control it with two

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:13.190 
I can actually control it with two
different<00:02:12.239> brightnesses<00:02:12.629> there's<00:02:12.840> also<00:02:13.049> a

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
different brightnesses there's also a

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.940 
different brightnesses there's also a
strobing<00:02:13.890> mode<00:02:14.129> I<00:02:14.430> can

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
strobing mode I can

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.040 
strobing mode I can
the<00:02:15.310> speed<00:02:15.610> of<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.970> strobe<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.540> then<00:02:17.020> a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
the speed of the strobe and then a

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.960 
the speed of the strobe and then a
random<00:02:17.680> mode<00:02:17.890> with<00:02:18.069> the<00:02:18.190> strobe<00:02:18.459> that<00:02:18.489> you<00:02:18.819> can

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
random mode with the strobe that you can

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.300 
random mode with the strobe that you can
then<00:02:19.090> shift<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:20.019> relative<00:02:20.860> frequency

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
then shift the relative frequency

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.570 
then shift the relative frequency
between<00:02:21.610> them<00:02:22.080> another<00:02:23.080> function<00:02:24.040> on<00:02:24.220> this

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
between them another function on this

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.229 
between them another function on this
light<00:02:24.910> which<00:02:25.209> is<00:02:25.360> really<00:02:25.569> unique<00:02:25.840> is<00:02:26.140> this<00:02:26.769> box

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
light which is really unique is this box

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.080 
light which is really unique is this box
which<00:02:28.239> is<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:29.110> sync<00:02:29.530> box<00:02:29.800> for<00:02:30.310> it<00:02:30.400> plugs<00:02:30.879> in

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
which is the sync box for it plugs in

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.820 
which is the sync box for it plugs in
right<00:02:31.239> here<00:02:31.780> now<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:31.959> can<00:02:32.140> plug<00:02:32.470> the<00:02:32.560> remote

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
right here now I can plug the remote

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.559 
right here now I can plug the remote
into<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.190> what's<00:02:33.580> important<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.269> plug

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
into it what's important is this plug

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.080 
into it what's important is this plug
that<00:02:35.019> is<00:02:35.319> where<00:02:35.620> your<00:02:35.950> genlock<00:02:36.550> connection

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
that is where your genlock connection

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.570 
that is where your genlock connection
goes<00:02:37.300> or<00:02:37.989> black<00:02:38.319> bursts<00:02:38.620> from<00:02:39.099> your<00:02:39.310> video

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
goes or black bursts from your video

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.539 
goes or black bursts from your video
camera<00:02:39.880> because<00:02:40.870> all<00:02:41.680> of<00:02:42.069> these<00:02:42.250> lights

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
camera because all of these lights

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.270 
camera because all of these lights
pretty<00:02:43.299> much<00:02:43.510> anything<00:02:43.750> but<00:02:44.019> daylight<00:02:44.830> or<00:02:44.950> a

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
pretty much anything but daylight or a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.180 
pretty much anything but daylight or a
tungsten<00:02:45.910> light<00:02:46.060> all<00:02:46.720> have<00:02:47.560> their<00:02:48.160> own

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
tungsten light all have their own

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.820 
tungsten light all have their own
flicker<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.150> that's<00:02:50.110> just<00:02:50.349> the<00:02:50.590> way<00:02:50.680> the

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
flicker and that's just the way the

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.339 
flicker and that's just the way the
technology<00:02:51.130> works<00:02:51.519> they're<00:02:51.730> pulsing<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.349> if

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
technology works they're pulsing and if

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.300 
technology works they're pulsing and if
they're<00:02:54.010> not<00:02:54.280> synced<00:02:54.819> properly<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.560> camera

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
they're not synced properly to a camera

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.430 
they're not synced properly to a camera
in<00:02:57.489> particular<00:02:57.849> a<00:02:58.060> CMOS<00:02:58.660> camera<00:02:59.260> with<00:02:59.410> a

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
in particular a CMOS camera with a

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.559 
in particular a CMOS camera with a
rolling<00:03:00.099> shutter<00:03:00.130> which<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.120> what<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.329> lot<00:03:01.540> of

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569 
rolling shutter which is what a lot of

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:03.660 
rolling shutter which is what a lot of
the<00:03:01.720> new<00:03:01.810> technology<00:03:02.380> is<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:02.920> can<00:03:03.099> get<00:03:03.370> either

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
the new technology is you can get either

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.759 
the new technology is you can get either
a<00:03:03.790> flicker<00:03:04.209> in<00:03:04.329> your<00:03:04.630> image<00:03:04.900> or<00:03:05.230> sort<00:03:05.560> of<00:03:05.650> a

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
a flicker in your image or sort of a

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.789 
a flicker in your image or sort of a
shifting<00:03:06.760> wave<00:03:07.209> of<00:03:07.630> brightness<00:03:08.140> where<00:03:08.380> the

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
shifting wave of brightness where the

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.140 
shifting wave of brightness where the
top<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.250> screen<00:03:09.459> looks<00:03:09.700> really<00:03:10.030> bright

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
top of the screen looks really bright

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.180 
top of the screen looks really bright
and<00:03:10.269> then<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:10.870> gets<00:03:11.049> as<00:03:11.260> a<00:03:11.290> dark<00:03:11.620> band<00:03:11.920> and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
and then it gets as a dark band and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.949 
and then it gets as a dark band and
might<00:03:12.340> pass<00:03:12.670> through<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.540> your<00:03:13.630> framer

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
might pass through and your framer

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.780 
might pass through and your framer
strange<00:03:14.560> things<00:03:14.829> like<00:03:15.010> that<00:03:15.190> we<00:03:15.370> then<00:03:15.610> have<00:03:15.760> to

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
strange things like that we then have to

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.370 
strange things like that we then have to
control<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.599> electronic<00:03:17.019> shutter<00:03:17.110> and<00:03:17.260> your

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
control the electronic shutter and your

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.020 
control the electronic shutter and your
camera<00:03:17.620> trying<00:03:17.890> to<00:03:17.980> get<00:03:18.099> rid<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.549> if<00:03:18.940> you

camera trying to get rid of it if you
have<00:03:19.120> multiple<00:03:19.420> lights<00:03:19.660> they<00:03:19.840> might<00:03:19.989> do<00:03:20.170> it

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
have multiple lights they might do it

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.840 
have multiple lights they might do it
different<00:03:20.620> rates<00:03:20.799> and<00:03:21.010> lots<00:03:21.519> of<00:03:21.609> strange

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
different rates and lots of strange

different rates and lots of strange
phasing<00:03:22.420> effects<00:03:22.720> well<00:03:23.430> generally<00:03:24.430> you<00:03:24.459> don't

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
phasing effects well generally you don't

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.910 
phasing effects well generally you don't
have<00:03:24.819> it<00:03:24.940> with<00:03:25.030> this<00:03:25.150> light<00:03:25.389> but<00:03:25.930> if<00:03:26.200> you<00:03:26.739> have

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
have it with this light but if you have

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.050 
have it with this light but if you have
a<00:03:26.950> particular<00:03:27.160> camera<00:03:27.609> that's<00:03:27.760> really

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
a particular camera that's really

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.180 
a particular camera that's really
sensitive<00:03:28.389> to<00:03:28.600> it<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:28.959> plug<00:03:29.170> in<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.769> sync<00:03:29.980> box

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
sensitive to it you plug in the sync box

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.699 
sensitive to it you plug in the sync box
and<00:03:30.459> then<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:31.180> light<00:03:31.450> will<00:03:31.480> be<00:03:31.720> controlled<00:03:32.260> by

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
and then the light will be controlled by

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.979 
and then the light will be controlled by
the<00:03:32.769> camera<00:03:33.280> will<00:03:33.730> completely<00:03:34.120> lock<00:03:34.480> out<00:03:34.720> any

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
the camera will completely lock out any

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.199 
the camera will completely lock out any
frequency<00:03:35.319> issues<00:03:35.739> because<00:03:35.950> it<00:03:36.190> will<00:03:36.430> set

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
frequency issues because it will set

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.440 
frequency issues because it will set
itself<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:37.810> pulse<00:03:38.079> based<00:03:39.069> on<00:03:39.340> the<00:03:39.700> rate<00:03:39.940> that

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
itself to pulse based on the rate that

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.870 
itself to pulse based on the rate that
the<00:03:40.600> camera<00:03:41.019> is<00:03:41.170> shooting<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.980> so<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:42.730> will

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
the camera is shooting and so it will

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.789 
the camera is shooting and so it will
protect<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.660> in<00:03:43.900> that<00:03:44.109> way<00:03:44.230> and<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.440> can<00:03:44.650> then

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
protect you in that way and you can then

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.890 
protect you in that way and you can then
go<00:03:45.190> into<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.430> menu<00:03:45.639> here<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:46.060> shift<00:03:46.510> it<00:03:46.690> if<00:03:46.780> you

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
go into a menu here and shift it if you

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.150 
go into a menu here and shift it if you
want<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.139> create<00:03:47.470> a<00:03:47.530> weird<00:03:47.769> effect<00:03:48.010> or
