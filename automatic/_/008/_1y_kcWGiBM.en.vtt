00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello everyone since I just did the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.200
 video taste of the cosetta beretta al cous 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.320
 type cous 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.590
 now I eat a nice ice cream I took 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.220
 to the leader I will eat my own I have not 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.840
 still tasted actually however it is not 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.699
 a passage this ones with solo 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:28.529
 show you that they have these implications 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:30.900
 leaders are these minigelates that in the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.360
 brand freezes that is the same as that 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.070
 I had a sorbet this is 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.820
 drowned in chocolate they come 49 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.430
 cents 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:45.629
 if I am not mistaken here, however, 50 cents 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:49.950
 here and they have also done this 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.510
 marina or have the croissants there for you 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.149
 they sell to women in confessions 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.660
 I don't really have girls like that 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.210
 but I say loose eaten ciotti 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.829
 they look like type choices in the sun instead 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.829
 in the meantime, we don't have a package 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.470
 how to explain but you feel it anyway 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.470
 diotti you understand 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.700
 there were croissants 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.580
 then there were the bis here ice cream biscuits 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.910
 then there were 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.010
 they are then calistas with the magno a 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:28.280
 all that you could take then 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:31.880
 they came on 50 cents or all 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.119
 a little more a little less short shit though 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.270
 go to the bar definitely a few more than one 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.970
 euros for an appearance for a cone and here 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.610
 in short, it's cool but the times line up 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.610
 it was not that but also this thing 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.840
 do not make it home do not open the things of 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.550
 said ok the loser is that if you are in 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.260
 around and you want an ice cream with 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.840
 many pay a lot however for a project 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.790
 good go to the lidl you take the 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.760
 ice cream and then you can eat it 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.130
 comfortably because they put 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.100
 inside the spoon like the kinder 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:15.230

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.150
 teaspoon ie led are too far ahead 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.900
