yourself<00:00:26.820> down<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.660> floor<00:00:27.869> because<00:00:28.050> we're

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
yourself down on the floor because we're

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.800 
yourself down on the floor because we're
going<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.529> some<00:00:28.560> press-ups<00:00:29.010> today<00:00:29.789> and<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
going to do some press-ups today and the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.600 
going to do some press-ups today and the
reason<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.199> we're<00:00:31.410> doing<00:00:31.529> press-ups<00:00:32.160> is

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
reason that we're doing press-ups is

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.139 
reason that we're doing press-ups is
because<00:00:33.390> after<00:00:33.960> we've<00:00:34.110> had<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.380> baby<00:00:34.739> it's<00:00:35.640> very

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
because after we've had a baby it's very

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.030 
because after we've had a baby it's very
common<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:36.719> us<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.200> develop<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.710> slouch

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
common for us to develop a slouch

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.549 
common for us to develop a slouch
because<00:00:38.489> our<00:00:38.610> shoulders<00:00:39.149> start<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.690> just

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
because our shoulders start to just

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.770 
because our shoulders start to just
curve<00:00:40.860> for<00:00:41.309> words<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> chest<00:00:42.120> gets<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.629> bit

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
curve for words and the chest gets a bit

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.380 
curve for words and the chest gets a bit
tight<00:00:43.140> now<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:43.559> press<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.430> do<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:44.940> all

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
tight now what press up or do is all

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.380 
tight now what press up or do is all
open<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.590> chest<00:00:46.860> area<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:48.059> you'll<00:00:48.180> get<00:00:48.360> a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
open out the chest area so you'll get a

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.389 
open out the chest area so you'll get a
nice<00:00:48.660> stretch<00:00:48.899> there<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.680> hopefully<00:00:49.890> push

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
nice stretch there and hopefully push

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.760

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.650 
those shoulders back a bit more and a
press-up<00:00:53.129> sounds<00:00:53.399> scary<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.270> needn't
