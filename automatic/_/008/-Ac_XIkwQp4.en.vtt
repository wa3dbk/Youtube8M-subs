00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.170 

this<00:01:48.530> is<00:01:48.740> supposed<00:01:48.980> to<00:01:49.100> be<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.520> belt<00:01:49.880> and<00:01:50.120> I

this is supposed to be a belt and I

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.200 
this is supposed to be a belt and I
think<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.480> back<00:01:50.660> piece<00:01:50.960> feels<00:01:51.440> off<00:01:51.680> or

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
think the back piece feels off or

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.870 
think the back piece feels off or
supposed<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.270> be<00:01:53.390> a<00:01:53.420> part<00:01:53.750> of<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:53.900> pants<00:01:54.880> fell

supposed to be a part of the pants fell
off<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.420> think<00:01:58.840> this<00:01:59.840> is<00:01:59.960> just<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.260> little

paste is for its for figurines but I use
fondant<00:02:40.040> just<00:02:40.640> because<00:02:41.060> that's<00:02:41.690> what<00:02:42.560> I'm

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
fondant just because that's what I'm

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.030 
fondant just because that's what I'm
most<00:02:42.860> used<00:02:43.250> to<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:43.730> gum<00:02:44.660> paste<00:02:44.840> for<00:02:45.590> me<00:02:45.770> when<00:02:46.010> I

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
most used to and gum paste for me when I

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.170 
most used to and gum paste for me when I
use<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.370> it<00:02:46.730> dries<00:02:47.090> way<00:02:47.600> too<00:02:47.660> fast<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:49.580> if<00:02:49.820> I<00:02:49.970> use

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
use it it dries way too fast so if I use

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.530 
use it it dries way too fast so if I use
it<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.510> make<00:02:50.690> one<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:50.989> these<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.970> set

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
it to make one of these and then I set

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.180 
it to make one of these and then I set
it<00:02:53.660> down<00:02:53.690> for<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:54.200> couple<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.530> seconds<00:02:54.830> it<00:02:54.980> gets

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
it down for a couple of seconds it gets

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.330 
it down for a couple of seconds it gets
really<00:02:55.459> hard<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.060> then<00:02:56.530> when<00:02:57.530> you<00:02:57.650> work<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.190> in

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
really hard and then when you work it in

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.060 
really hard and then when you work it in
its<00:02:58.790> really<00:02:59.090> crumbly<00:02:59.600> so<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.900> loses<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:00.320> lot<00:03:00.560> of

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
its really crumbly so it loses a lot of

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.970 
its really crumbly so it loses a lot of
what's<00:03:01.760> there<00:03:01.970> so<00:03:02.299> I<00:03:02.330> just<00:03:02.540> use<00:03:02.720> bondic<00:03:03.170> it's
