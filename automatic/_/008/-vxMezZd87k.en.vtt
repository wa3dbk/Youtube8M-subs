mid<00:00:39.239> only<00:00:39.840> got<00:00:39.989> zero<00:00:40.410> chemistry<00:00:41.010> because<00:00:41.130> he's

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
mid only got zero chemistry because he's

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.310 
mid only got zero chemistry because he's
an<00:00:41.430> absolute<00:00:41.910> beast<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.450> was<00:00:42.810> absolutely

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
an absolute beast and was absolutely

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
appalling in goal left back we have

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.000 
appalling in goal left back we have
Ashley<00:00:45.420> Cole<00:00:45.870> he<00:00:46.050> was<00:00:46.200> actually<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.800> team

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
Ashley Cole he was actually in the team

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.410 
Ashley Cole he was actually in the team
it's<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.250> proper<00:00:47.579> one<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:47.940> he's<00:00:48.060> on<00:00:48.210> nine

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it's the proper one and he's on nine

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.050 
it's the proper one and he's on nine
chemistry<00:00:48.840> which<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> quite<00:00:49.350> nice<00:00:49.880> sent<00:00:50.880> back

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
chemistry which is quite nice sent back

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.270 
chemistry which is quite nice sent back
we<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.329> Fraser<00:00:51.600> Campbell<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.350> would<00:00:52.770> be<00:00:53.010> so

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
we have Fraser Campbell it would be so

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.040 
we have Fraser Campbell it would be so
Campbell<00:00:53.700> but<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.970> course<00:00:54.180> he<00:00:54.660> isn't<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
Campbell but of course he isn't in the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.229 
Campbell but of course he isn't in the
game<00:00:55.079> anymore<00:00:55.470> he<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.399> course<00:00:56.610> was<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:56.850> terrible

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
game anymore he of course was a terrible

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.180 
game anymore he of course was a terrible
defender<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.809> if<00:00:57.870> 87<00:00:58.380> pace<00:00:58.559> not<00:00:58.829> too<00:00:58.980> bad<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
defender but if 87 pace not too bad I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.729 
defender but if 87 pace not too bad I
guess<00:00:59.579> he<00:01:00.030> only<00:01:00.329> had<00:01:00.480> one<00:01:00.510> chemistry<00:01:01.380> as<00:01:01.500> well

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
guess he only had one chemistry as well

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.280 
guess he only had one chemistry as well
second<00:01:02.550> sent<00:01:02.730> back<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.120> Cola<00:01:03.480> Toria<00:01:03.840> actually

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
second sent back is Cola Toria actually

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.039 
second sent back is Cola Toria actually
in<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:04.620> team<00:01:04.860> 6<00:01:05.729> chemistry<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.390> too<00:01:06.540> bad

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
in the team 6 chemistry not too bad

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.690 
in the team 6 chemistry not too bad
scored<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> couple<00:01:07.710> headers<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.340> pretty<00:01:08.580> good

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
scored a couple headers and pretty good

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.060 
scored a couple headers and pretty good
defensively<00:01:09.180> right<00:01:10.049> back<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.440> had<00:01:10.560> this<00:01:10.799> guy

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
defensively right back we had this guy

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.070 
defensively right back we had this guy
Laura<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.909> guess<00:01:12.120> that's<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> closest<00:01:12.810> one<00:01:12.930> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
Laura I guess that's the closest one to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.200 
Laura I guess that's the closest one to
Lauren<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:13.650> could<00:01:13.890> get<00:01:14.220> not<00:01:14.610> Matt<00:01:14.790> not<00:01:15.060> much

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
Lauren I could get not Matt not much

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.010 
Lauren I could get not Matt not much
chemistry<00:01:15.510> just<00:01:15.920> 681<00:01:16.920> pace<00:01:17.190> pretty<00:01:17.520> terrible

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
chemistry just 681 pace pretty terrible

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.719 
chemistry just 681 pace pretty terrible
indeed<00:01:19.020> left<00:01:19.740> mid<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.190> Jeremy<00:01:20.460> alley

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
indeed left mid we have Jeremy alley

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.330 
indeed left mid we have Jeremy alley
idea<00:01:21.030> that<00:01:21.299> actual<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:21.990> only<00:01:22.590> free<00:01:22.830> chemistry

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
idea that actual one only free chemistry

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.149 
idea that actual one only free chemistry
so<00:01:23.610> he<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.000> course<00:01:24.180> was<00:01:24.420> absolutely<00:01:24.840> terrible

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
so he of course was absolutely terrible

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.990 
so he of course was absolutely terrible
second<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.280> center<00:01:26.780> that's<00:01:27.780> not<00:01:28.049> right<00:01:28.880> then<00:01:29.880> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
second a center that's not right then is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.120 
second a center that's not right then is
sent<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> mid<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.869> Vieira<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.860> guy<00:01:32.010> of

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
sent to mid we have Vieira this guy of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.830

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
Bergkamp we could find on the game and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.940 
Bergkamp we could find on the game and
again<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.600> guy<00:02:00.750> was<00:02:00.960> absolutely<00:02:01.650> terrible

again this guy was absolutely terrible

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.950 
again this guy was absolutely terrible
six<00:02:02.310> chemistry<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.180> felt<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.570> he<00:02:03.689> didn't

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
six chemistry but it felt like he didn't

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.590 
six chemistry but it felt like he didn't
have<00:02:04.079> legs<00:02:04.380> he<00:02:04.650> was<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.640> bad<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.150> then<00:02:06.329> up

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
front we have the main man Thierry on

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.120

rehab<00:02:09.060> salute<00:02:09.479> beast<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:10.560> saw<00:02:10.709> skills<00:02:10.979> he<00:02:11.099> was

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
rehab salute beast for saw skills he was

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.400 
rehab salute beast for saw skills he was
actually<00:02:11.430> pretty<00:02:11.849> good<00:02:12.000> only<00:02:12.810> shows<00:02:13.140> that<00:02:13.170> we

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
actually pretty good only shows that we

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.010 
actually pretty good only shows that we
played<00:02:13.620> one

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
played one

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.570 
played one
because<00:02:14.290> we<00:02:14.410> played<00:02:14.650> most<00:02:15.220> against

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
because we played most against

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.670 
because we played most against
subscribers<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:16.360> stuff<00:02:16.570> like<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.930> but<00:02:17.170> he

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
subscribers and stuff like that but he

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.810 
subscribers and stuff like that but he
was<00:02:17.830> actually<00:02:17.980> alright<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.580> you're<00:02:18.700> gonna

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
was actually alright and you're gonna

see<00:02:19.000> some<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.240> the<00:02:19.300> gameplay<00:02:19.450> now<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:19.960> let's

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
see some of the gameplay now so let's

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.410 
see some of the gameplay now so let's
move<00:02:20.320> on<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.740> that<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.640> as<00:02:21.910> you<00:02:22.030> can<00:02:22.150> see<00:02:22.300> on

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
move on to that so as you can see on

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.910 
move on to that so as you can see on
this<00:02:22.540> but<00:02:22.720> we<00:02:22.840> tried<00:02:23.110> playing<00:02:23.350> in<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.680> gold

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
this but we tried playing in the gold

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.770 
this but we tried playing in the gold
cup<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.400> just<00:02:24.580> was<00:02:24.730> not<00:02:24.880> successful<00:02:25.540> till

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
cup and it just was not successful till

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.800 
cup and it just was not successful till
we<00:02:25.900> lost<00:02:26.170> 11<00:02:26.650> nil<00:02:27.400> absolutely<00:02:28.300> appalling<00:02:28.540> so

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
we lost 11 nil absolutely appalling so

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.150 
we lost 11 nil absolutely appalling so
most<00:02:29.050> of<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.290> gameplay<00:02:29.560> is<00:02:29.740> actually

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
most of this gameplay is actually

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.190 
most of this gameplay is actually
against<00:02:30.430> subscribers<00:02:31.150> or<00:02:31.300> other<00:02:31.570> youtubers

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
against subscribers or other youtubers

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.260 
against subscribers or other youtubers
with<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.650> similar<00:02:33.160> chemistry<00:02:33.460> teams<00:02:33.880> we<00:02:34.060> just

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
with a similar chemistry teams we just

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.520 
with a similar chemistry teams we just
probably<00:02:34.390> be<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:34.600> nice<00:02:34.780> way<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:34.960> get<00:02:35.170> gameplay

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
probably be a nice way to get gameplay

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.620 
probably be a nice way to get gameplay
and<00:02:35.680> make<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:35.980> bit<00:02:36.160> more<00:02:36.310> even<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.300> in

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
and make it a bit more even and in

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.880 
and make it a bit more even and in
general<00:02:38.050> when<00:02:38.230> we<00:02:38.320> were<00:02:38.380> playing<00:02:38.560> against

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
general when we were playing against

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.800 
general when we were playing against
other<00:02:39.010> 50<00:02:39.430> chemistry<00:02:39.790> teams<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.420> team<00:02:40.600> wasn't

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
other 50 chemistry teams the team wasn't

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.570 
other 50 chemistry teams the team wasn't
too<00:02:41.020> bad<00:02:41.260> I<00:02:41.290> guess<00:02:41.650> like<00:02:41.890> oh<00:02:42.040> Marie<00:02:42.250> was<00:02:42.460> an

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
too bad I guess like oh Marie was an

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.090 
too bad I guess like oh Marie was an
absolute<00:02:43.150> monster<00:02:43.540> up<00:02:43.810> front<00:02:44.020> with<00:02:44.380> far<00:02:44.890> and

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
absolute monster up front with far and

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.460 
absolute monster up front with far and
away<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.910> best<00:02:46.090> player<00:02:46.390> absolutely<00:02:47.080> mentor

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
away the best player absolutely mentor

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.650 
away the best player absolutely mentor
just<00:02:47.680> like<00:02:47.800> he<00:02:47.950> was<00:02:48.100> in<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.400> actual<00:02:48.610> season<00:02:49.090> he

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
just like he was in the actual season he

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.630 
just like he was in the actual season he
was<00:02:49.780> so<00:02:49.960> so<00:02:50.140> good<00:02:50.440> Clara<00:02:50.950> Tori<00:02:51.250> was<00:02:51.430> pretty

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
was so so good Clara Tori was pretty

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.210 
was so so good Clara Tori was pretty
decent<00:02:51.880> Ashley<00:02:52.510> Cole<00:02:52.750> was<00:02:52.900> alright<00:02:53.260> Vieira

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
decent Ashley Cole was alright Vieira

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.740 
decent Ashley Cole was alright Vieira
scored<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.670> few<00:02:54.880> nice<00:02:55.000> goals<00:02:55.300> I<00:02:55.420> think<00:02:55.450> there's

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
scored a few nice goals I think there's

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.090 
scored a few nice goals I think there's
a<00:02:55.780> really<00:02:56.020> nice<00:02:56.140> one<00:02:56.320> coming<00:02:56.590> up<00:02:56.680> here<00:02:56.890> but

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
a really nice one coming up here but

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.740 
a really nice one coming up here but
other<00:02:57.220> than<00:02:57.520> that<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.940> team<00:02:58.180> was<00:02:58.450> really<00:02:58.660> a

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
at the beginning it's basically just the

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.490 
at the beginning it's basically just the
11<00:03:25.300> players<00:03:25.480> that<00:03:25.720> played<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.050> most<00:03:26.200> games

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500

11 players that played the most games
during<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:26.860> season<00:03:27.070> not<00:03:27.430> even<00:03:27.700> the<00:03:27.820> best<00:03:28.000> 11

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
during the season not even the best 11

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.660 
during the season not even the best 11
because<00:03:28.990> like<00:03:29.140> alia<00:03:29.500> D<00:03:29.680> hare<00:03:29.890> is<00:03:30.040> included<00:03:30.550> and

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
because like alia D hare is included and

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.700 
because like alia D hare is included and
he<00:03:30.850> was<00:03:31.090> without<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.720> doubt<00:03:31.870> not<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.530> best

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
he was without a doubt not the best

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.350 
he was without a doubt not the best
player<00:03:32.950> in<00:03:33.190> that<00:03:33.220> season<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:34.060> there's<00:03:34.240> some

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
player in that season so there's some

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.360 
player in that season so there's some
players<00:03:34.570> like<00:03:34.630> Perez<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:35.260> stuff<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.650> sadly

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
players like Perez and stuff that sadly

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.760 
players like Perez and stuff that sadly
don't<00:03:36.550> get<00:03:36.790> an<00:03:36.880> inclusion<00:03:37.390> but<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.530> team

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770
