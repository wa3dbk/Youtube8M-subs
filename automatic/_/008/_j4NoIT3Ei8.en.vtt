almost<00:00:47.420> better<00:00:47.629> than<00:00:47.750> none<00:00:48.019> and<00:00:48.379> so<00:00:48.739> they've

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
almost better than none and so they've

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.399 
almost better than none and so they've
made<00:00:49.250> made<00:00:49.430> a<00:00:49.460> significant<00:00:50.149> contribution<00:00:50.409> so

made made a significant contribution so

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:53.950 
made made a significant contribution so
we<00:00:51.559> in<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:51.949> game<00:00:52.159> we've<00:00:52.339> been<00:00:52.370> able<00:00:52.579> to<00:00:52.899> try<00:00:53.899> to

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
we in the game we've been able to try to

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.750 
we in the game we've been able to try to
understand<00:00:54.409> what<00:00:54.440> makes<00:00:54.890> parts<00:00:55.219> adventure

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
understand what makes parts adventure

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.219 
understand what makes parts adventure
different<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.420> some<00:00:56.719> of<00:00:56.780> the<00:00:56.839> other<00:00:56.870> types<00:00:57.140> of

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:57.229 
different to some of the other types of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:59.289 
different to some of the other types of
adventures<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:58.190> then<00:00:58.399> once<00:00:58.579> we<00:00:58.760> distill<00:00:59.269> that

00:00:59.289 --> 00:00:59.299 
adventures and then once we distill that

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:02.079 
adventures and then once we distill that
that<00:01:00.290> concept<00:01:00.860> we<00:01:01.399> then<00:01:01.549> project<00:01:01.670> that

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
that concept we then project that

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:03.969 
that concept we then project that
through<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.299> prism<00:01:02.659> of<00:01:02.690> Lego<00:01:03.049> to<00:01:03.559> create<00:01:03.860> an

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979 
through the prism of Lego to create an

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.520 
through the prism of Lego to create an
incredible<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:04.790> neo<00:01:05.059> dynamic<00:01:05.690> involving

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
incredible and neo dynamic involving

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.139 
incredible and neo dynamic involving
environment<00:01:07.130> which<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:07.460> know<00:01:07.549> young<00:01:07.880> gamers

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
environment which you know young gamers

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:10.120 
environment which you know young gamers
and<00:01:08.420> then<00:01:08.990> everyone<00:01:09.320> can<00:01:09.350> play<00:01:09.619> and

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
and then everyone can play and

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.520 
and then everyone can play and
experience<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.970> stories<00:01:11.390> from<00:01:12.050> there<00:01:12.320> from

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
experience the stories from there from

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.399 
experience the stories from there from
the<00:01:12.619> movies<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:14.509> characters<00:01:14.869> abilities<00:01:14.960> in

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
the movies the characters abilities in

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.249 
the movies the characters abilities in
ice<00:01:15.979> Caribbean<00:01:16.520> are<00:01:16.640> obviously<00:01:17.259> suitably

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
ice Caribbean are obviously suitably

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.230 
ice Caribbean are obviously suitably
nautical<00:01:18.890> so<00:01:19.069> they<00:01:19.190> the<00:01:19.520> game<00:01:19.729> is<00:01:19.880> all<00:01:20.210> about

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
nautical so they the game is all about

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.639 
nautical so they the game is all about
no<00:01:22.149> learning<00:01:23.149> or<00:01:23.539> traveling<00:01:24.170> out<00:01:24.289> on<00:01:24.409> the<00:01:24.470> high

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
no learning or traveling out on the high

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:26.889 
no learning or traveling out on the high
seas<00:01:25.009> and<00:01:25.310> buccaneering<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.210> you<00:01:26.630> can<00:01:26.750> do<00:01:26.840> all

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
seas and buccaneering so you can do all

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.050 
seas and buccaneering so you can do all
kinds<00:01:27.050> of<00:01:27.550> incredible<00:01:28.550> things<00:01:28.700> are<00:01:28.819> going<00:01:28.970> to

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
kinds of incredible things are going to

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.700 
kinds of incredible things are going to
climb<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.539> rigging<00:01:29.690> walking<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.440> plans

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
climb the rigging walking the plans

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.380 
climb the rigging walking the plans
swinging<00:01:31.490> from<00:01:31.580> the<00:01:31.640> yardarms<00:01:32.149> all<00:01:32.270> these

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
swinging from the yardarms all these

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.570 
swinging from the yardarms all these
things<00:01:32.600> that<00:01:32.659> expect<00:01:33.140> pirates<00:01:33.530> be<00:01:33.649> doing<00:01:33.950> find

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
things that expect pirates be doing find

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.910

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
a flintlock pistol skin cooling were

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.800 
a flintlock pistol skin cooling were
there<00:01:37.130> were<00:01:37.250> there<00:01:37.280> cutlasses<00:01:37.909> all<00:01:38.360> these<00:01:38.659> are

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
there were there cutlasses all these are

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.660 
there were there cutlasses all these are
basically<00:01:39.229> add<00:01:39.440> up<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.740> what<00:01:39.979> what<00:01:40.399> we<00:01:40.520> like

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
basically add up to what what we like

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.210 
basically add up to what what we like
think<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.090> I<00:01:41.270> kind<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.630> more<00:01:41.810> expanded<00:01:42.220> without

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
think so I kind of more expanded without

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.010 
think so I kind of more expanded without
forming<00:01:43.580> elements<00:01:43.849> it<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.239> the<00:01:44.330> game<00:01:44.509> while

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
forming elements it to the game while

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.139 
forming elements it to the game while
still<00:01:45.289> built<00:01:45.560> in<00:01:45.709> the<00:01:46.039> framework<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.910> them

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
still built in the framework of them

familiarity Albert Lego game so one of
the<00:01:51.470> ways<00:01:51.500> we've<00:01:51.800> tried<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.399> adapt<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.789> expand

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
the ways we've tried to adapt to expand

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.660 
the ways we've tried to adapt to expand
again<00:01:53.660> is<00:01:54.080> by<00:01:54.259> taking<00:01:54.560> another<00:01:54.920> look<00:01:55.039> at<00:01:55.250> the

again is by taking another look at the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.999 
again is by taking another look at the
platform<00:01:55.849> sides<00:01:56.390> of<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.569> game<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.500> in<00:01:57.739> the<00:01:57.920> in
