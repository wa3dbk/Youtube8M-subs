 in comparison to the 2 2-endstand 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.780
 At this stage, these were Billens patzt goal-guaranteed Cacau attack with an almost

 with the g 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.100
 Unfortunately, you helped the opponent to get back into the game 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.100
 since one made own attacks too early production 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.110
 favored by lack of concentration in the defense, the guests came from Stuhr

 and to score 2 for his team 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.809
 the guests seemed to have to

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:07.339
 but the Bittenfeld shooter showed Mörsen 

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:09.259
 and grazed his deep fall 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:12.259
