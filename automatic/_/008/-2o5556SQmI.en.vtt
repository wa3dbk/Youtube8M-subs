00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.870
 Ah 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.230
 Hello is a table 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:21.990
 This is the last post in the Launcher 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:26.849
 It's August 2013, and it's been two years since I wrote this bulletin. 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.960
 So, in those two years, the blonchers have changed a lot, plus more menus 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.769
 Many 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:36.059
 This is a new course jjikge 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.690
 This time it's presented the video and the article has sseuneunge hard deoni photos posted in the past 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.750
 It's hard 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.320
 Rather fast, so words like direct view 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 I do not think you should go to the enemy. 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.120
 4 You are so sad that the Blue Launcher. 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.989
 You'll have a lot of taste from the pictures. 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.149
 Anyway, there are many who would crack a friend ttokgatahyo 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.010
 4 Now let's hit the basic blogger if you are like me, the icon above 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.110
 I do not see you. 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:10.110
 Above the top I press in the middle of the top of the menu pops up 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:17.060
 Mode patch in game p skate Bali 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:21.680
 I have a launcher setup that takes a screenshot , but it gets set first . 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.950
 The important thing is it's situation seemed ruined party menu 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.780
 I can see the talk. 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:33.020
 First, the first menu texture pack literally removes the tag. 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.660
 It's a little different now than before . 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:41.570
 Also several important and multiple others, rather than texture packs thumbnail preview 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:45.410
 It looks easy to have to show thumbnails 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:49.700
 When you get to choose under what is now the primary use is 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:54.470
 The original blush 's default texture pack is what I'm picking up literally 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:59.360
 I can choose this way . I feel like Astro . 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:03.920
 And safety helmets do not need any safety mode 4 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.770
 Now look full blown self-proclaimed gonna spend all day doing when almost no sseulil 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.530
 I wonder if patch management 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:12.500
 It is literally to remove everything 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.880
 By putting files in dot mod format 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:21.680
 What can I write additional 250 won to the player then this applies to Knit 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:26.400
 Unbreakable Bubble Reflection This now has 4 nexus jobs 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.549
 And I do not have a mode that is currently applied lacquer 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.469
 Anyway, today's party hot money, tight swing 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.700
 Manage add-ons Now here 's the edited by Teenhalf 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:40.950
 To Manny Item 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:44.069
 And what do we already have in our cafe 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.930
 What you see is suede p 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:55.640
 4 residents and cut 100 yen forgotten addon to save such things 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:03:01.100
 You can register l turn it will be applied to the installation apk format 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.730
 Then do not know the street point js file created with javascript file 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.209
 It's 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:10.730
 Now, if you look at it now , 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:16.640
 Yesterday was a texture pack evening skate. So, for example, 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:21.560
 What do I got psychic Stiff Knit the lanes doing things like Brood War 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:26.900
 Itguyo will not be viewed very long five-fold over the length of the oscillating vibration 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:31.550
 No need to control the player by rotating the sensor spindle 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:35.660
 It's now literally shaking when we play games like asphalt 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:41.480
 Game Tea party oh tilt type culmination tip type to adjust 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:43.640
 How is that going to the same user tpi What is now adjusting its resolution 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.620
 It's called Resolution Life 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:52.519
 But what did that have to get the icon size Del ah anyway dpr 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:57.019
 Try adjusting it when you get that one pixel in . Try it yourself. 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:04:01.900
 Of course it is. But you do not have to make it. 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:07.150
 Next easy to breed brief Everyone Now I do not know this 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:11.500
 I do not need a star . Chahha putt. Vertical . 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.870

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:18.280

 Become a team that will have to go over the woods and become a speler team Hiding the spanner shaped icon 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.130

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.690
 Hiding Voyager's concubine'll know Tex Wasabi This required the old chat 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:30.460
 I'm not good at chatting in Korea 2 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:35.830
 But now there is no need to get old Kip to collapse 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:42.639
 Well, no need to p historic Yeah, why can not you this feature 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:48.639

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:49.960
 Next Blue Moon Apartments Introduction Introduction What you need to go to a forum thread torn down 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:55.420

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:59.560
 Yes, this is the way Glenn Blurlane emphasized. 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.570
 Anyway, I do not know if the latest version is very simple separation in fact or do not cry 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:07.500
 Do you need to have a social updates 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:10.750
 I've done an update. Now, the configuration is the same. It's the same . 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:15.070
 There's nothing wrong with play. 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:18.550

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.740
 As you can see before , Street should be applied to eleven twelve distant distances 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.980
 It is. 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:34.150
 Everyone now has all of the water reflections. 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:37.240
 As mentioned before, this is only supported by the Nexus 6. 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:42.610
 Open 3.1 Open Notes 3.1 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:46.030
 So what if there are disadvantages, one color is gray 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:49.750
 In addition, at night, this application orange effect is solved 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:53.020
 Eopjyo what little lucky not to write anything, no matter how out of view 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:57.760
 For reference, my model is Samsung Galaxy s6 Edge 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:02.840
 It's water. It's water. Now we can see the water. 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:07.790
 In the early days, there was no water. I've got it . But now I can see the water . 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.870
 I told you that the trade femo is still down, 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.160

 I'll fix my position. 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:20.440
 Stepping this way, what did the baby trade 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:24.430

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:27.280

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:01.150
