00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.170 
a no-brainer basically anyhow this is

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
all I have for the day and under tree

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.270 
all I have for the day and under tree
now<00:04:14.720> I'm<00:04:14.870> going<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.170> close<00:04:15.380> this<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:15.890> go<00:04:16.040> play

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.610 
now I'm going to close this and go play
in<00:04:16.400> myself
