00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.960
 greet you friends my name is denis 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.880
 Borisov you are on the FIFA channel 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.590
 life.ru I now we will consider 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.020
 bodybuilding execution 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.960
 such an important exercise as oblique 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.189
 bench press this exercise 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.779
 fundamentally different from 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.430
 classic barbell bench press where 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.099
 used horizontal bench 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.710
 differ in that in this exercise 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.980
 pectoral muscles work better and 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.170
 better than horizontal press 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.450
 what makes it happen i already 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.649
 explained in several plots enough 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.600
 in detail if it is very short then the meaning 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.039
 is that when horizontal 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.160
 the form of doing the press we have a load 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.410
 trying to go down the chest bottoms of the chest and 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.390
 in the triceps but as soon as we start 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.489
 use a slight tilt up a 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.370
 the most optimal slope in this regard 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.050
 is a slope of 30 degrees so here 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.870
 as soon as it begins to take place in 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.390
 us triceps and start gradually 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.970
 shut down and earn that is what 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.890
 higher slope of the bench upside down 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.650
 our triceps work less 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.600
 and since we have less triceps work 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.610
 so this job someone owes them 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.740
 do this job for them 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.350
 begin to perform nursing 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.840
 so on the inclined bench press 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.670
 when the tilt gene 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.710
 head you can never shake 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.649
 as much weight as horizontal 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.729
 life because in this form 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.619
 bench press 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.140
 work less muscle work 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.100
 fundamentally many other muscles but 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.360
 work substantially 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.759
 significantly less our triceps and here 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.990
 so it all looks about 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.990
 like this 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.479
 now let's get the most nuanced 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.850
 important in tilting your head up 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.520
 is that the triceps we have 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.800
 start working less but more with us 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.840
 the deltas start working accordingly 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.270
 the higher the slope is upside down 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.850
 the less we work triceps and 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.630
 more work front deltas therefore 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:16.420
 it is very important to choose the optimal slope 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.090
 when you have triceps and smaller 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.190
 work and the deltas have not had time 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.650
 turn on to the fullest with this 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.580
 coal best will shrink your 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.580
 chest muscles 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.790
 most often this angle is approximately 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.250
 30 degrees in terms of bodybuilding 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.630
 exactly this angle is most favorable 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.950
 for the development of your pectoral muscles so tooth 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.900
 everything is clear from an angle 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.150
 continue to act all the same 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.940
 rules as in the classic barbell press 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.519
 lying on a horizontal bench that is 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.830
 the smaller we have the bridge the more we have 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.540
 pectoral muscles work i mean i don't 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.850
 bend like this for 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:57.310
 in order to secure a great power 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.590
 in motion I try the opposite task 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.560
 complicate for their infants so do 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.140
 me loin pressed no gaps 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.120
 I have no lower back I can even 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.090
 to some extent raise your legs to 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.310
 I have a gap gone such conditions are not 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.230
 it will be harder to compress but in such conditions 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.140
 it will be better to focus on 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.709
 my nursing that is no bridge 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.829
 legs can even be slightly raised 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.500
 about grip grip can be used 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:29.049
 slightly worse than horizontal press 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.549
 why because we use slope 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.980
 upside head at which triceps 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.850
 work less and we know what than already 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.200
 grip the more we work triceps 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.150
 horizontal press you problem for us 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.920
 and in tilt this lived for us not 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.109
 the problem is because the triceps are a little bit 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.080
 partially off so if in 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:47.690
 horizontal bench press 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.470
 we took about here such a grip but 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.830
 for example 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.230
 then in the bench press we can 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.870
 Grab narrower and it will be very 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.700
 good because what is the grip of 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.200
 more amplitude of movement and so much the better 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.200
 contractions of our pectoral muscles 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:11.650
 moreover, with a barbell bench press 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.380
 we don't have to head up 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.800
 set the barbell to eye level we can 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.709
 her 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.820
 shake vertically upwards 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.250
 because we have less triceps 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.760
 work accordingly they won't be able to 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.700
 pick up 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:33.310
 steal them from us this load that is 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.710
 grip we can take a pause 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.330
 barbell we can squeeze on my own 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:44.050
 away not necessarily here and here 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:48.230
 wind up the lower back we press about 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.419
 amplitude heights we work the same as 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.460
 and in the horizontal barbell press inside 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:55.040
 amplitudes that is to the end we are not 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.830
 unbend because we will turn on 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.210
 triceps we stop more often until the end 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.790
 without reaching 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:06.919
 the lower point can also not touch even 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.380
 nursing to work inside amplitude here 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.500
 what it looks like 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:13.290
 so I stopped at the lowest point 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.360
 upper I do not unbend to the end 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:21.550
 load persisted exhale on effort 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:25.570
 exhale scored air exhale movement 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:30.810
 smoothly exhale smoothly 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.810
 with dots top and bottom 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.600
 loin pressed 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.030
 chest we can fill 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.980
 fill the cage with air 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.870
 stretch the air accordingly 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:42.520
 pectoral muscles as soon as we stretch 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.620
 pectoral muscles occur more 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.990
 we do not need a quality reduction 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.810
 to bring the shoulder blades together our task on 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:52.200
 the floor of the chest air 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:57.840
 accordingly we have a very happening 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:06:00.820
 qualitatively and shorthand we summarize 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.030
 inclined bench press barbell up from head 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.930
 we work triceps less 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.770
 accordingly therefore we can 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.000
 use narrower grip 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.970
 Accordingly, we increase the length 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.670
 amplitude improves muscle contraction 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.530
 moreover we have more 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.570
 high-quality contraction of the pectoral muscles 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:21.730
 because the load is distributed more 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:28.630
 evenly not only in the lower sections 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:31.750
 as with a horizontal press in general 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:35.410
 friends on this exercise were very 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.940
 a lot of information already I think you need 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:39.220
 be sure to try different 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.530
 options grip learn how to work 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.390
 inside amplitude 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.940
 learn to breathe properly learn 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:48.910
 fill your chest with oxygen 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:53.350
 for a better cut and then you have everything 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:56.430
 It will in general is under the barbell bench press 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.430
 baby tilt
