00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.010
 Rollers will be healthy today 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.800
 talk about how to minimize the chance 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.219
 get your x-box 360 xbox ban 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.619
 live on lt 30 firmware immediately say that 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.410
 nullify this chance anyway 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.840
 it will turn out as you go to xbox 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.170
 live with a pirate console on which 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.570
 the probability of a ban exists always but 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.340
 there are also some helpful tips and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.740
 recommendations that will allow you 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.800
 significantly reduce the probability of a ban 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.750
 your xbox 360 xbox live 1 such 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.600
 The recommendation is that you should not 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.790
 play games watch dogs live up to 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.950
 official release in your country i 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.750
 I think it's no secret that often 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.940
 Pirates Spread 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.260
 images of games that are not yet officially 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.719
 went out and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.149
 the mistake of many is that they and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.070
 joyful download all this good to yourself 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.649
 on the computer and then roll on 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.420
 pigs and go to xbox live and make 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.199
 just plain blatant by 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.059
 ignorance 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.769
 Do you know what they say ignorance is not 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.110
 exempts from liability 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.180
 after such actions there 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.760
 quite high probability 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.770
 that your console may be banned in 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.869
 xbox live and so should not 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.430
 The next helpful tip would be 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.170
 be that you should 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.619
 drive the image through the program 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.509
 abgx360 disk 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.729
 I would also advise you to do this. 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.220
 after recording that is after you 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.650
 downloaded any game on your computer 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.000
 chase this image just in case 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.680
 through both gx take offense that all is well 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.350
 write this image any 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.810
 your favorite program for disc 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.130
 and after recording check recorded 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.869
 image again in bpx to be sure 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.909
 that the image matches the topology 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.329
 license disk after which you can 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.070
 play the next useful recommendation 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.860
 is that you should always 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.680
 have the latest official version 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.020
 xbox 360 firmware i.e. version even 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.329
 bard I think on this parameter strongly 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.220
 focus does not make sense so 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.259
 how everyone who has 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.230
 xbox 360 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.379
 they know what it is and the last thing 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.700
 I would like to say here I would advise 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:20.310
 you do not use 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.459
 singed broken points in xbox live and 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.189
 all sorts of clothes there for avatar and so 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.680
 further in order not to cause unnecessary 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:30.780
 suspicions of x-box live and now let's 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.610
 consider such a phenomenon that in 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.430
 lately increasingly exposed 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.890
 doubt this is of course the waves of bans 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.780
 which is conducted by microsoft two 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.000
 times a year i.e. 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.720
 total illness on certain days 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.549
 and hours of pirate consoles which in this 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.239
 time lapse lit up in the xbox 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.519
 live and 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.159
 There are two main topics on this topic. 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.959
 point of view, I will voice them 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.849
 but not directly make a decision 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.670
 as to whether it happens 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.980
 now or not you so reliable 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.079
 information about this I find in 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.599
 Internet failed first point of view 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.989
 this is what these waves of bans are still 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.790
 exist and they are held twice in 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.579
 year in some forums even 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.370
 laid out certain dates days and 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:19.889
 watches when these ban waves themselves pass 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.069
 The second point of view states that 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:26.819
 these waves of bans do not take place with 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.680
 the end of 2009 as supposedly very 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.560
 a lot of complaints came to the company 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.919
 microsoft from users exclusively 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.010
 licensed content that in these 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:40.620
 most waves of bans also fell and not 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.980
 stitched prefix which of course entailed 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.049
 very many dissatisfied people and 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.010
 because of this , bans waves stop 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:52.650
 believe it or not you decide I just 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.440
 gave the alignment as I said accurate 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:58.260
 information about this I do not 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.760
 I have and sum up I want 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.459
 say about that if you will 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.859
 neat and really gonna play 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.199
 license unmodified images 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.049
 then you have a good chance to play your 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:13.620
 pleasure on lt30p firmware box 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.079
 Live and not to be banned by them in 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.120
 this system as usual if you 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.070
 liked this video like 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.079
 You can also ask your questions in 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.790
 comments and subscribe of course 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.410
 on this to 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.870
 cash to keep abreast of all new 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.870
