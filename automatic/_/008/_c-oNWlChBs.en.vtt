welcome back and today we're going to be
taking<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.490> look<00:00:08.670> at<00:00:08.790> add<00:00:08.910> this<00:00:09.059> relatively

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
taking a look at add this relatively

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.390 
taking a look at add this relatively
boring<00:00:09.840> looking<00:00:10.260> house<00:00:10.440> but<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:11.070> course<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
boring looking house but of course the

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400 
boring looking house but of course the
looks<00:00:11.580> can<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.790> deceptive<00:00:12.090> because<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:13.080> is<00:00:13.290> a

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
looks can be deceptive because this is a

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.200 
looks can be deceptive because this is a
piston<00:00:13.860> house<00:00:14.009> now<00:00:14.639> for<00:00:14.670> those<00:00:14.849> who<00:00:15.030> don't

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
piston house now for those who don't

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.279 
piston house now for those who don't
know<00:00:15.240> what<00:00:15.389> a<00:00:15.420> piston<00:00:15.750> house<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.109> it's

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
know what a piston house is it's

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.900 
know what a piston house is it's
essentially<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> house<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.160> build<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.789> you

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
essentially a house you build the you

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.090 
essentially a house you build the you
cram<00:00:18.180> as<00:00:18.420> many<00:00:18.750> redstone<00:00:19.289> contraptions<00:00:19.859> into

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
cram as many redstone contraptions into

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.580 
cram as many redstone contraptions into
as<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.730> possibly<00:00:21.060> can<00:00:21.359> seriously<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.470> go

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
as you possibly can seriously just go

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.259 
as you possibly can seriously just go
hand<00:00:22.830> with<00:00:23.010> them<00:00:23.160> now<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> used<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.970> build<00:00:24.090> these

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
hand with them now I used to build these

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.609 
hand with them now I used to build these
all<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> time<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.080> my<00:00:25.199> early<00:00:25.439> days<00:00:25.590> of

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
all the time in my early days of

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.500 
all the time in my early days of
redstone<00:00:26.070> but<00:00:26.220> since<00:00:26.430> then<00:00:26.609> haven't<00:00:27.180> really

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
redstone but since then haven't really

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.790 
redstone but since then haven't really
done<00:00:27.660> one<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> while<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.470> what<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.619> thought

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
done one for a while so what I thought

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.349 
done one for a while so what I thought
I'd<00:00:28.920> do<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.189> give<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.730> another<00:00:29.880> shot

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
I'd do is give it another shot

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.359 
I'd do is give it another shot
but<00:00:30.689> issue<00:00:30.840> myself<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.320> bit<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> challenge<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
but issue myself a bit of a challenge to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.100 
but issue myself a bit of a challenge to
try<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.669> build<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.969> within<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.480> nine<00:00:33.719> by<00:00:33.899> nine

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
try and build it within a nine by nine

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.840 
try and build it within a nine by nine
area<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.770> pretty<00:00:35.219> happy<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:35.640> I've

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
area I'm pretty happy with what I've

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.370 
area I'm pretty happy with what I've
come<00:00:35.969> up<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.630> let's<00:00:36.809> take<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> closer<00:00:37.260> look

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
come up with so let's take a closer look

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.440 
come up with so let's take a closer look
now<00:00:37.770> obviously<00:00:38.640> when<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.879> comes<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.149> piston

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
now obviously when it comes to piston

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420 
now obviously when it comes to piston
houses<00:00:39.809> first<00:00:40.079> impressions<00:00:40.620> are<00:00:40.860> fairly<00:00:41.129> key

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
houses first impressions are fairly key

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.069 
houses first impressions are fairly key
you<00:00:41.579> want<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:41.820> make<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> grand<00:00:42.239> entrance<00:00:42.660> so

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
you want to make a grand entrance so

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.479 
you want to make a grand entrance so
that<00:00:43.200> everyone<00:00:43.590> knows<00:00:43.800> they're<00:00:43.980> an<00:00:44.100> absolute

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that everyone knows they're an absolute

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.970 
that everyone knows they're an absolute
Pro<00:00:44.730> redstone<00:00:45.300> which<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.719> why<00:00:45.899> I<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.770> taken

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
Pro redstone which is why I have taken

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.740 
Pro redstone which is why I have taken
the<00:00:47.280> opposite<00:00:47.730> route<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:48.059> want<00:00:48.239> people<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.570> get

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the opposite route I want people to get

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.299 
the opposite route I want people to get
their<00:00:48.930> expectations<00:00:49.590> nice<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.039> low<00:00:50.160> when

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
their expectations nice and low when

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.189 
their expectations nice and low when
they<00:00:50.430> walk<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.270> I've<00:00:51.390> gone<00:00:51.629> up<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.079> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
they walk in so I've gone up for the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.770 
they walk in so I've gone up for the
wooden<00:00:52.440> door<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:53.460> oh<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:54.390> weren't<00:00:54.600> expecting

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
wooden door but oh you weren't expecting

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.779 
wooden door but oh you weren't expecting
that<00:00:55.020> well<00:00:55.350> yeah<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.680> door<00:00:55.890> isn't<00:00:56.190> actually

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
that well yeah the door isn't actually

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.819 
that well yeah the door isn't actually
the<00:00:56.940> door<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.390> door<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.840> actually<00:00:58.260> next<00:00:58.649> to

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the door the door is actually next to

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.049 
the door the door is actually next to
the<00:00:58.920> door<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.520> walk<00:00:59.670> through<00:00:59.699> here

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the door so you just walk through here

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.639 
the door so you just walk through here
you<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.300> see<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.899> our<00:01:01.260> little<00:01:01.469> room

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
you can see if this is our little room

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.650 
you can see if this is our little room
we've<00:01:02.070> got<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.520> light<00:01:02.760> switch<00:01:03.030> up<00:01:03.270> at<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> top

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
we've got a light switch up at the top

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
we've got a light switch up at the top
here<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.229> fully<00:01:04.470> functional<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.189> can

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
here which is fully functional and can

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.700 
here which is fully functional and can
turn<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.180> off<00:01:06.360> all<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.750> these<00:01:06.900> lights<00:01:07.110> we

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
turn on and off all of these lights we

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.230 
turn on and off all of these lights we
also<00:01:07.830> have<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.340> few<00:01:08.580> little<00:01:08.700> bits<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
also have a few little bits in this

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.330 
also have a few little bits in this
corner<00:01:09.570> here<00:01:09.720> which<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.320> non<00:01:10.530> redstone<00:01:10.950> related

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
corner here which a non redstone related

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.130 
corner here which a non redstone related
so<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.610> have<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> chair<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.390> table<00:01:12.540> because

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
so we have a chair and a table because

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.660 
so we have a chair and a table because
this<00:01:13.439> wouldn't<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> house<00:01:14.040> without<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.430> chair

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
this wouldn't be a house without a chair

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.460 
this wouldn't be a house without a chair
and<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.790> table<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.299> we<00:01:15.659> also<00:01:15.810> have<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.290> guy

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
and a table and we also have this guy

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.679 
and a table and we also have this guy
his<00:01:16.890> name<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.100> Bob<00:01:17.400> he<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.790> creeper<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.390> he

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
his name is Bob he is a creeper and he

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.390 
his name is Bob he is a creeper and he
is<00:01:18.810> stuck<00:01:19.110> inside<00:01:19.350> there<00:01:19.799> which<00:01:19.979> means<00:01:20.189> even

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
is stuck inside there which means even

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.590 
is stuck inside there which means even
if<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:20.700> were<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.820> survival<00:01:21.180> mode

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
if we were in survival mode

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.330 
if we were in survival mode
he<00:01:21.960> wouldn't<00:01:22.259> actually<00:01:22.380> explode<00:01:22.920> which<00:01:23.189> I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
he wouldn't actually explode which I

and then over here we have got this

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.180 
and then over here we have got this
lever<00:02:21.510> we<00:02:21.960> give<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.290> flick<00:02:22.500> you'll<00:02:22.920> see<00:02:23.070> that

lever we give it a flick you'll see that

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.490 
lever we give it a flick you'll see that
a<00:02:23.250> staircase<00:02:23.640> unfolds<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.900> we<00:02:25.170> can<00:02:25.320> head

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
a staircase unfolds out and we can head

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.350 
a staircase unfolds out and we can head
down<00:02:25.530> into<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.220> bottom<00:02:26.550> section<00:02:26.910> of<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.210> base

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
down into the bottom section of the base

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.990 
down into the bottom section of the base
now<00:02:28.290> what<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:28.560> have<00:02:28.740> down<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.460> few<00:02:29.880> of

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
now what we have down here is a few of

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.190 
now what we have down here is a few of
the<00:02:30.090> farms<00:02:30.450> that<00:02:30.510> are<00:02:30.660> involved<00:02:31.050> because

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the farms that are involved because

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.870 
the farms that are involved because
otherwise<00:02:31.590> of<00:02:31.890> course<00:02:32.100> we<00:02:32.220> wouldn't<00:02:32.400> have<00:02:32.640> any

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
otherwise of course we wouldn't have any

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.730 
otherwise of course we wouldn't have any
resources<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:33.960> out<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.140> back<00:02:34.320> here<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.710> can

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
resources so out the back here you can

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.290 
resources so out the back here you can
see<00:02:34.890> we've<00:02:35.190> got<00:02:35.310> ourselves<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.760> chicken<00:02:36.060> farm

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
see we've got ourselves a chicken farm

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.360 
see we've got ourselves a chicken farm
I've<00:02:36.480> actually<00:02:36.840> turned<00:02:37.230> off<00:02:37.530> friendly<00:02:38.190> mob

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
I've actually turned off friendly mob

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.040 
I've actually turned off friendly mob
noise<00:02:38.640> because<00:02:39.090> it's<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.450> little<00:02:39.600> bit<00:02:39.720> too<00:02:39.900> much

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
noise because it's a little bit too much

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.990 
noise because it's a little bit too much
I<00:02:40.320> think<00:02:40.410> we<00:02:40.710> have<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.130> couple<00:02:41.730> hundred

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
I think we have a couple hundred

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.970 
I think we have a couple hundred
chickens<00:02:42.660> up<00:02:42.840> there<00:02:43.080> so<00:02:43.560> it's<00:02:43.800> pretty

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
chickens up there so it's pretty

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.680 
chickens up there so it's pretty
efficient<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.700> produces<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.180> decent

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
efficient and it produces a decent

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.840 
efficient and it produces a decent
amount<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:46.050> cooked<00:02:46.650> chicken<00:02:46.710> as<00:02:47.160> well<00:02:47.700> as<00:02:47.820> a

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
amount of cooked chicken as well as a

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.850 
amount of cooked chicken as well as a
decent<00:02:48.180> amount<00:02:48.390> of<00:02:48.480> feathers<00:02:48.840> then<00:02:49.440> in<00:02:49.680> this

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
decent amount of feathers then in this

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.440 
decent amount of feathers then in this
section<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.370> we<00:02:50.520> have<00:02:50.610> got<00:02:50.790> our<00:02:51.030> bread<00:02:51.240> maker

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
section here we have got our bread maker

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.030 
section here we have got our bread maker
so<00:02:51.930> we<00:02:52.020> have<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.200> do<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.470> flick<00:02:52.740> this<00:02:52.830> lever

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
so we have to do is flick this lever

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.949 
so we have to do is flick this lever
that<00:02:53.520> turns<00:02:53.850> on<00:02:54.000> all<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.300> bone<00:02:54.450> meal<00:02:54.660> then<00:02:54.840> if

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
that turns on all the bone meal then if

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.270 
that turns on all the bone meal then if
we<00:02:55.050> hit<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.320> button<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:56.010> can<00:02:56.130> actually

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
we hit this button you can actually

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.920 
we hit this button you can actually
harvest<00:02:56.850> all<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.300> which<00:02:57.390> I<00:02:57.570> find<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:57.900> be

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
harvest all of it which I find to be

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.170 
harvest all of it which I find to be
very<00:02:58.170> useful<00:02:58.590> but<00:02:58.980> also<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.400> little<00:02:59.850> bit<00:03:00.000> noisy

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
very useful but also a little bit noisy

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.150 
very useful but also a little bit noisy
then<00:03:01.020> if<00:03:01.170> we<00:03:01.290> spin<00:03:01.500> it<00:03:01.530> round<00:03:01.709> we've<00:03:01.980> got

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
then if we spin it round we've got

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.650 
then if we spin it round we've got
something<00:03:02.340> really<00:03:02.670> cool<00:03:02.850> over<00:03:02.910> here<00:03:03.300> if<00:03:03.630> you

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
something really cool over here if you

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.090 
something really cool over here if you
just<00:03:03.840> place<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.080> redstone<00:03:04.320> torch<00:03:04.530> down<00:03:04.920> here

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
just place a redstone torch down here

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.650 
just place a redstone torch down here
you<00:03:05.220> can<00:03:05.370> see<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.970> our<00:03:06.060> hidden<00:03:06.330> storage

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
you can see that our hidden storage

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.660 
you can see that our hidden storage
opens<00:03:07.110> up<00:03:07.230> once<00:03:07.380> again<00:03:07.500> we<00:03:08.040> have<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.459> couple

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
opens up once again we have a couple

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.190 
opens up once again we have a couple
extra<00:03:08.940> chests<00:03:09.450> for<00:03:09.570> storing<00:03:09.870> all<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.020> our

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
extra chests for storing all of our

items as well as another ender chest and

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.210 
items as well as another ender chest and
also<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> little<00:03:13.230> furnace<00:03:13.680> down<00:03:13.860> at<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.070> bottom

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
also a little furnace down at the bottom

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.340 
also a little furnace down at the bottom
in<00:03:14.550> case<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.120> wanted<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.480> do<00:03:15.660> some<00:03:15.870> precious

in case you wanted to do some precious

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.770 
in case you wanted to do some precious
item<00:03:16.770> smelting<00:03:17.310> which<00:03:17.880> is<00:03:18.030> pretty<00:03:18.209> cool<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.510> if

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
item smelting which is pretty cool so if

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:19.759 
item smelting which is pretty cool so if
you<00:03:18.870> just<00:03:19.019> place<00:03:19.200> down<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.440> redstone<00:03:19.739> torch

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
you just place down the redstone torch

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.740 
you just place down the redstone torch
once<00:03:20.130> again<00:03:20.370> all<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:21.060> gets<00:03:21.300> completely

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
once again all of that gets completely

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.090 
once again all of that gets completely
hidden<00:03:21.930> away<00:03:22.080> stand<00:03:22.410> we<00:03:22.470> can<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.739> head<00:03:22.890> up

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
hidden away stand we can just head up

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.310 
hidden away stand we can just head up
back<00:03:23.340> up<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.730> top<00:03:23.910> and<00:03:24.150> then<00:03:24.870> once<00:03:25.110> we<00:03:25.230> get

Bob walk over our pressure plate and the
wall<00:03:32.100> is<00:03:32.340> restored<00:03:32.820> just<00:03:33.120> out<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.019> interest

wall is restored just out of interest

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.680 
wall is restored just out of interest
I've<00:03:34.650> used<00:03:34.920> mcedit<00:03:35.489> to<00:03:35.760> copy<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.150> pasted<00:03:36.480> that

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
I've used mcedit to copy and pasted that

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.420 
I've used mcedit to copy and pasted that
little<00:03:36.959> house<00:03:37.080> down<00:03:37.110> there<00:03:37.530> out<00:03:37.709> into<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
little house down there out into the

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.920 
little house down there out into the
open<00:03:38.730> world<00:03:38.880> then<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.300> removed<00:03:39.630> all<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
open world then I removed all the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.330 
open world then I removed all the
sandstone<00:03:40.350> so<00:03:40.560> you<00:03:40.680> can<00:03:40.830> see<00:03:41.010> all<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.220> the

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
sandstone so you can see all of the

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.009 
sandstone so you can see all of the
Redstone<00:03:41.760> obviously<00:03:42.480> removing<00:03:42.900> the

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
Redstone obviously removing the

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.449 
Redstone obviously removing the
sandstone<00:03:43.410> has<00:03:43.650> caused<00:03:43.920> a<00:03:44.040> few<00:03:44.280> little

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
sandstone has caused a few little

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.160 
sandstone has caused a few little
problems<00:03:44.640> with<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.420> fact<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.660> we<00:03:45.780> now<00:03:45.930> have

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
problems with the fact that we now have

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.110 
problems with the fact that we now have
a<00:03:46.200> bit<00:03:46.380> of<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.500> floating<00:03:46.890> stuff<00:03:47.130> but<00:03:47.850> if<00:03:48.000> we

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
a bit of the floating stuff but if we

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.220 
a bit of the floating stuff but if we
take<00:03:48.269> a<00:03:48.330> look<00:03:48.450> around<00:03:48.570> you<00:03:48.840> can<00:03:48.959> see<00:03:49.110> that

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
take a look around you can see that

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.570 
take a look around you can see that
there's<00:03:49.350> actually<00:03:49.739> quite<00:03:49.920> a<00:03:50.040> lot<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.430> this

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
there's actually quite a lot to this

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.040 
there's actually quite a lot to this
bill<00:03:50.790> despite<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.300> fact<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.750> all<00:03:51.870> looked

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
bill despite the fact that it all looked

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.630 
bill despite the fact that it all looked
fairly<00:03:52.260> simple<00:03:52.709> there's<00:03:53.190> quite<00:03:53.459> a<00:03:53.489> lot<00:03:53.610> of

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
fairly simple there's quite a lot of

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.680 
fairly simple there's quite a lot of
stuff<00:03:53.850> going<00:03:54.030> on<00:03:54.209> we've<00:03:54.420> got<00:03:54.510> hidden

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
stuff going on we've got hidden

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.960 
stuff going on we've got hidden
staircases<00:03:55.290> armories<00:03:56.010> we<00:03:56.160> got<00:03:56.310> farmed<00:03:56.790> and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
staircases armories we got farmed and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.850 
staircases armories we got farmed and
hidden<00:03:57.570> storage<00:03:57.870> systems<00:03:58.350> and<00:03:58.470> all<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:58.680> good

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
hidden storage systems and all that good

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.650 
hidden storage systems and all that good
stuff<00:03:58.920> all<00:03:59.340> comes<00:03:59.880> together<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.269> create<00:04:00.390> a

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
stuff all comes together to create a
