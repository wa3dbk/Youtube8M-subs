00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
lights but you know not too bad you know

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.140 
lights but you know not too bad you know
I<00:02:31.140> was<00:02:31.349> thinking<00:02:31.620> about<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:31.950> in<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.489> yeah<00:02:32.910> I

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
I was thinking about this in that yeah I

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.699 
I was thinking about this in that yeah I
would<00:02:33.450> like<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.720> go<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.050> moon<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.349> mean<00:02:34.530> from

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
would like to go to the moon I mean from

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.470 
would like to go to the moon I mean from
photos<00:02:35.160> it<00:02:35.340> seems<00:02:35.550> kind<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.819> boring<00:02:36.090> just<00:02:36.390> a

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
photos it seems kind of boring just a

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.089 
photos it seems kind of boring just a
bunch<00:02:36.660> of<00:02:36.750> dust<00:02:37.110> but<00:02:37.380> it'll<00:02:37.530> be<00:02:37.620> cool<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.890> go

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
bunch of dust but it'll be cool to go

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.680 
bunch of dust but it'll be cool to go
and<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.340> know<00:02:38.459> just<00:02:38.700> jump<00:02:39.090> around<00:02:39.209> and<00:02:39.569> maybe

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
and you know just jump around and maybe

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.420 
and you know just jump around and maybe
see<00:02:39.930> where<00:02:40.080> that<00:02:40.170> whole<00:02:40.500> Dark<00:02:40.920> Side<00:02:41.190> of<00:02:41.250> the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
see where that whole Dark Side of the

technology can be implemented in future
spacecrafts<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:46.830> implications<00:02:47.549> could<00:02:47.819> mean

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
spacecrafts the implications could mean

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.330

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
it is impossible and this technology

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.339 
it is impossible and this technology
seems<00:03:02.940> way<00:03:03.180> different<00:03:03.630> than<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.959> warp<00:03:04.260> drive

scientific discoveries are made all the

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.430 
scientific discoveries are made all the
time<00:04:05.430> let's<00:04:06.060> not<00:04:06.120> be<00:04:06.329> so<00:04:06.480> arrogant<00:04:06.690> to<00:04:07.109> think

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440
