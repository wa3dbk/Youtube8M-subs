00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.640
 the pass with max payne one of the 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.930
 most important tactics in sport 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.300
 of football is to pass 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.490
 an effective pass needs years of 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.430
 practice with thousands of attempts to 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.790
 do it well there are many ways to pass 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.650
 a ball just like billiards or golf 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.050
 certain twists that you can put him to 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.660
 ball for maximum control here is a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.850
 precise 25-yard pass is not just a 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.920
 pass of 25 yards but it is a pass with 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.140
 bucks ping the pack without controlling the ball 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.090
 and puts it in the aim 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.190
 this is important when it is needed 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.470
 give the ball to his partner so that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.690
 can have the maximum control after 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.489
 that receives the ball in the air there 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.470
 many forces but two important ones that 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.180
 they are against each other the direction of the 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.980
 ball that is traveling and the direction 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.170
 of the ball that is rotating the direction 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.450
 opposite will cause the ball to return to the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.969
 land but when the forces land 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.100
 will be diminished by the severity and 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.980
 earth is to say if done correctly 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.930
 what slows forward momentum and 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.000
 place the ball on the feet of your 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.039
 partner this is important so that your 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.700
 partner has maximum control of the ball 

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:15.330
 When a ball is kicked the foot is 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.920
 on the ball for only 16 milliseconds this 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.049
 it does not give you much time to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.170
 and the brain has to take a 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.049
 decision within 1.1 seconds that this 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.600
 is going to be the pass that will achieve the foot 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.630
 it has to be between the bottom of the ball 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.330
 and the ground as well as the swing must 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.000
 decrease after the foot hits the 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.280
 ball and you must make sure that you do not follow 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.770
 running the leg and hold the swing 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.590
 so that this one passes work to his 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.689
 perfection the back spain pass can be 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.700
 very dangerous especially when 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.890
 defenses are in an attack 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.409
 complete with precise techniques 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.659
 quick decisions and with enough 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.789
 practice the defense will be lost and with 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.470
 this tool can benefit your 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.470
 party and all his team
