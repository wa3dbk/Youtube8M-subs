brush<00:04:14.400> i<00:04:14.549> just<00:04:14.760> used<00:04:15.030> with<00:04:15.239> the<00:04:15.450> hottie<00:04:15.989> color

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
brush i just used with the hottie color

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.120 
brush i just used with the hottie color
which<00:04:18.630> is<00:04:18.660> actually<00:04:18.959> from<00:04:19.320> avon<00:04:19.799> if<00:04:19.979> you're

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
which is actually from avon if you're

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:32.380 
which is actually from avon if you're
curious<00:04:21.680> all<00:04:22.680> right

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.000 

so<00:04:32.960> now<00:04:33.080> if<00:04:33.200> you<00:04:33.350> have<00:04:33.500> kind<00:04:33.680> of<00:04:33.770> clothes<00:04:33.980> that

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
so now if you have kind of clothes that

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:35.680 
so now if you have kind of clothes that
eyes<00:04:34.400> like<00:04:34.700> ID<00:04:34.940> you<00:04:35.180> can<00:04:35.210> just<00:04:35.480> go<00:04:35.600> about

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
eyes like ID you can just go about

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.040 
eyes like ID you can just go about
three-quarters<00:04:36.560> of<00:04:36.590> the<00:04:36.830> way<00:04:36.950> in<00:04:37.750> just<00:04:38.750> making

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
three-quarters of the way in just making

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.480 
three-quarters of the way in just making
sure<00:04:39.110> to<00:04:39.260> make<00:04:39.440> it<00:04:39.620> thinner<00:04:39.890> as<00:04:40.160> you<00:04:40.190> get

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
sure to make it thinner as you get

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.760 
sure to make it thinner as you get
closer<00:04:40.730> to<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:43.010> the<00:04:43.040> nose<00:04:44.170> that<00:04:45.170> works<00:04:45.380> I

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
closer to the to the nose that works I

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.500 
closer to the to the nose that works I
always<00:04:46.130> try<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.400> figure<00:04:46.640> out<00:04:46.790> how<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.000> what<00:04:47.360> you

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
always try to figure out how to what you

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.200 
always try to figure out how to what you
know<00:04:47.540> what<00:04:47.810> how<00:04:48.170> to<00:04:48.230> say<00:04:48.440> that<00:04:48.650> but<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:50.030> nose

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
know what how to say that but the nose

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:56.270 
know what how to say that but the nose
makes<00:04:50.570> sense

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.620 

okay<00:04:57.280> so<00:04:57.340> as<00:04:57.640> you<00:04:57.760> can<00:04:57.880> see<00:04:58.090> the<00:04:58.210> difference

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
okay so as you can see the difference

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:01.160 
okay so as you can see the difference
just<00:04:58.930> adding<00:04:59.230> a<00:04:59.290> little<00:04:59.320> bit<00:04:59.620> of<00:04:59.740> color<00:05:00.220> there

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
just adding a little bit of color there

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.330 
just adding a little bit of color there
and<00:05:02.170> I'm<00:05:02.290> just<00:05:02.440> going<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.590> kind<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:02.860> go<00:05:02.980> over<00:05:03.250> it

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
and I'm just going to kind of go over it

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.220 
and I'm just going to kind of go over it
a<00:05:03.430> few<00:05:03.580> times<00:05:03.640> you<00:05:04.000> can<00:05:04.150> do<00:05:04.240> this<00:05:04.390> wet<00:05:04.750> if<00:05:05.050> you

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230 
a few times you can do this wet if you

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.990 
a few times you can do this wet if you
want<00:05:05.410> it<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.620> be<00:05:05.740> a<00:05:05.770> little<00:05:05.860> bit<00:05:06.100> more<00:05:06.610> harsh

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
want it to be a little bit more harsh

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.790 
want it to be a little bit more harsh
but<00:05:07.330> I<00:05:07.360> just<00:05:07.600> kind<00:05:07.780> of<00:05:07.810> want<00:05:07.990> it<00:05:08.050> softer<00:05:08.560> for

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
but I just kind of want it softer for

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:17.010 
but I just kind of want it softer for
this<00:05:09.240> for<00:05:10.240> what<00:05:10.450> I'm<00:05:10.570> doing<00:05:10.870> today<00:05:14.880> ok<00:05:15.880> so<00:05:16.270> once

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
this for what I'm doing today ok so once

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.990 
this for what I'm doing today ok so once
again<00:05:17.170> it's<00:05:17.530> really<00:05:17.920> simple<00:05:18.160> at<00:05:18.400> this<00:05:18.580> point

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
again it's really simple at this point

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.970 
again it's really simple at this point
but<00:05:19.600> I<00:05:19.660> am<00:05:19.900> going<00:05:20.230> to<00:05:20.290> make<00:05:20.440> it<00:05:20.560> a<00:05:20.650> little<00:05:20.800> bit

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
but I am going to make it a little bit

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.330 
but I am going to make it a little bit
more<00:05:21.160> dramatic<00:05:21.840> by<00:05:22.840> taking<00:05:23.350> a<00:05:23.650> tapered

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
more dramatic by taking a tapered

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.700 
more dramatic by taking a tapered
blending<00:05:24.490> brush<00:05:24.730> kind<00:05:25.540> of<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.690> smaller<00:05:26.020> one<00:05:26.380> I

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
blending brush kind of a smaller one I

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.790 
blending brush kind of a smaller one I
think<00:05:27.640> that's<00:05:27.790> what<00:05:27.940> I<00:05:27.970> want<00:05:28.210> yeah<00:05:28.540> and<00:05:28.900> just

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
think that's what I want yeah and just

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.170 
think that's what I want yeah and just
getting<00:05:30.100> a<00:05:30.160> little<00:05:30.190> bit<00:05:30.610> of<00:05:30.700> the<00:05:30.790> color<00:05:30.820> and

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
getting a little bit of the color and

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.300 
getting a little bit of the color and
the<00:05:31.210> brush<00:05:31.390> not<00:05:31.660> too<00:05:31.840> much<00:05:31.960> at<00:05:32.170> all<00:05:32.290> so<00:05:33.250> you

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
the brush not too much at all so you

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.090 
the brush not too much at all so you
know<00:05:33.400> you<00:05:33.730> can<00:05:33.760> always<00:05:34.000> add<00:05:34.210> more<00:05:34.890> so<00:05:35.890> I'm<00:05:35.950> just

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
know you can always add more so I'm just

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.890 
know you can always add more so I'm just
basically<00:05:36.490> going<00:05:36.700> to<00:05:36.790> do<00:05:36.940> kind<00:05:37.180> of<00:05:37.240> an<00:05:37.360> outer<00:05:37.570> V

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
basically going to do kind of an outer V

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.730 
basically going to do kind of an outer V
type<00:05:38.170> thing<00:05:38.410> I<00:05:38.530> think

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.159 

so<00:05:45.280> it's<00:05:45.940> kind<00:05:46.210> of<00:05:46.240> doing<00:05:46.539> this<00:05:46.660> little<00:05:46.930> outer

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
so it's kind of doing this little outer

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.969 
so it's kind of doing this little outer
corner<00:05:47.740> here<00:05:48.069> going<00:05:48.370> diagonally<00:05:49.680> and<00:05:50.680> then

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
corner here going diagonally and then

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.589 
corner here going diagonally and then
bring<00:05:51.250> it<00:05:51.340> just<00:05:51.460> a<00:05:51.639> little<00:05:51.669> bit<00:05:52.150> into<00:05:52.509> the

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
bring it just a little bit into the

00:05:52.599 --> 00:06:01.590 
bring it just a little bit into the
crease<00:05:52.900> just<00:05:53.530> on<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:53.740> outer<00:05:54.009> crease<00:05:54.490> part

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.840 

so<00:06:02.170> that<00:06:02.320> just<00:06:02.350> makes<00:06:02.830> it<00:06:03.070> a<00:06:03.220> little<00:06:03.400> bit<00:06:03.610> more

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:03.850 
so that just makes it a little bit more

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.000 
so that just makes it a little bit more
dramatic<00:06:04.110> without<00:06:05.110> making<00:06:05.500> your<00:06:05.650> eyes<00:06:05.680> look

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010 
dramatic without making your eyes look

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.520 
dramatic without making your eyes look
close<00:06:06.400> set<00:06:06.790> or<00:06:07.030> really<00:06:07.360> deep<00:06:07.660> set<00:06:08.020> or<00:06:08.200> anything

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
close set or really deep set or anything

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:17.370 
close set or really deep set or anything
like<00:06:08.560> that

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.730 

okay<00:06:17.980> okay<00:06:18.760> and<00:06:19.090> I'll<00:06:19.330> do<00:06:19.480> the<00:06:19.510> other<00:06:19.720> side<00:06:19.930> all
