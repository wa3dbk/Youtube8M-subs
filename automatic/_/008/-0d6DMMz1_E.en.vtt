00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.720
 it is known that they prolonged this game 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.879
 that everything was controlled in 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.320
 team a very hard opponent I think we 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.480
 generated many goal situations but 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.770
 beyond that the team after 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.770
 goal was to look and that the important thing 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.300
 well fine now that when it's 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.619
 between the court I try to be 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.900
 concentrated 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.470
 it was my turn to play in the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.789
 Saints 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.730
 and the truth that very happy very 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.500
 grateful for this opportunity to the club 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.460
 and well, God willing, it 's the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.460
 next date as anam 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.559
 saved 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.690
 so one goes off with anger is not so that 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.149
 One plays very nice but it does not help 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.390
 when not when the result is adverse 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.890
 out there the good interventions this 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.890
 personally does not serve me 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.050
 the truth that one does not think does not think 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.780
 never start losing the game 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.760
 but but it's a young group that with 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.200
 much ambition wanting to turn 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.370
 the page and I think that the most 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.320
 important this now what we have to do is 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.270
 on Tuesday we have another final we have them 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.070
 play as well as how all each part and 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.440
 face it as a final and we need 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.240
 win I think the soccer player lives 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.460
 of winning and of the victories you live 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.590
 play having fun and one when you do not win 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.940
 it does not go well 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.630
 after all 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.610
 it generates certain 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.259
 the pressure to always win but it's a 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.100
 nice pressure because I think that winning 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.270
 it's kind of cute 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.219
 we have to be calm we have 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.170
 be concentrated to see what 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.340
 there's still a lot of game left 15 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.530
 dates still in what is the tournament 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.990
 local so let's try to give what 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.270
 better for what's coming is to try 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.500
 mature as a group mature as a team and 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.149
 know that we have a great template 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.149
 as to overcome this moment 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.280
 and it is difficult now to make an analysis in 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.500
 hot so to call it by the party 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.810
 because we had to lose it becomes difficult 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.690
 know that whatever it is to improve out there 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.120
 they will not come out 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.130
 so predictable sometimes sometimes I'm very 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.630
 predictable in terms of attack but what 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.670
 we have as I said a great staff that 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.050
 we have very unbalanced players and 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.440
 I have no doubt that we are going to get this out 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.520
 forward we have no doubt that 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.480
 we have a group like to enter and 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.480
 we are going to achieve it 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.019
 and reserving date but I think it 's a 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.819
 very even level of all teams 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.190
 for what I've been seeing for a long time and 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.780
 have activated with paolo goltz that have 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.209
 a good relationship that I pizarro that 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.540
 I was in tiger 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.760
 I think they are paid 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.750
 a guide in which is very even very 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.670
 similar to argentina 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.610
 I wish god wanted as I said we can 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.220
 overcome this moment that is not good at 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.570
 the personal of losing matches but the 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.490
 group is tactile and calm and the 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.720
 I have a quiet moment 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.280
 results will arrive and when they arrive 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.810
 the results to give greater tranquility 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.140
 and we are going to leave very quiet of the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.140
 departure
