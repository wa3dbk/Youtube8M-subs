00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
if if you still need it to be a little

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.350 
if if you still need it to be a little
bit<00:05:31.010> lighter<00:05:31.250> you<00:05:31.400> can<00:05:31.730> just<00:05:31.940> use<00:05:32.090> whatever

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
bit lighter you can just use whatever

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.070 
bit lighter you can just use whatever
you<00:05:32.660> have<00:05:32.690> left<00:05:33.200> over<00:05:33.440> on<00:05:33.980> your<00:05:34.880> tray<00:05:35.540> and<00:05:35.810> then

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.080 
you have left over on your tray and then

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.510 
you have left over on your tray and then
just<00:05:36.320> do<00:05:36.500> it<00:05:36.590> again<00:05:36.800> for<00:05:37.010> a<00:05:37.040> couple<00:05:37.400> more

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
just do it again for a couple more

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.400 
just do it again for a couple more
minutes<00:05:37.670> until<00:05:38.360> you<00:05:38.570> get<00:05:38.780> your<00:05:39.050> desired

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
minutes until you get your desired

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.670 
minutes until you get your desired
lightness<00:05:40.420> so<00:05:41.420> I'm<00:05:41.630> gonna<00:05:41.750> go<00:05:41.930> ahead<00:05:42.020> and<00:05:42.170> wash

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 
lightness so I'm gonna go ahead and wash

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.500 
lightness so I'm gonna go ahead and wash
my<00:05:42.920> face<00:05:43.130> and<00:05:43.490> I<00:05:43.610> will<00:05:43.790> be<00:05:43.910> right<00:05:44.030> back

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
my face and I will be right back

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.840 
my face and I will be right back
so<00:05:45.080> this<00:05:45.350> is<00:05:45.470> the<00:05:45.620> final<00:05:45.830> result<00:05:46.370> as<00:05:46.550> you<00:05:46.580> can

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
so this is the final result as you can

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.480 
so this is the final result as you can
see<00:05:47.090> there's<00:05:47.720> not<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.020> huge<00:05:48.860> difference<00:05:48.920> but

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
see there's not a huge difference but

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.490 
see there's not a huge difference but
there<00:05:49.670> is<00:05:49.820> enough<00:05:50.150> of<00:05:50.240> a<00:05:50.390> difference<00:05:50.810> to

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:51.500 
there is enough of a difference to

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.650 
there is enough of a difference to
notice<00:05:51.920> that<00:05:52.580> it<00:05:52.820> just<00:05:52.850> looks<00:05:53.210> a<00:05:53.330> little<00:05:53.360> bit

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
notice that it just looks a little bit

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:55.750 
notice that it just looks a little bit
less<00:05:53.870> harsh<00:05:54.350> than<00:05:54.590> having<00:05:54.890> like<00:05:54.920> a<00:05:55.040> super<00:05:55.520> dark

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
less harsh than having like a super dark

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.660 
less harsh than having like a super dark
eyebrow<00:05:56.210> so<00:05:56.900> this<00:05:57.170> is<00:05:57.320> it<00:05:57.620> after<00:05:58.130> I've<00:05:58.310> got<00:05:58.340> my

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.460 
eyebrow so this is it after I've got my
makeup<00:05:58.880> on<00:05:59.150> in<00:05:59.390> my<00:05:59.510> eyebrows<00:05:59.930> filled<00:06:00.260> in
