you<00:00:04.620> may<00:00:04.770> think<00:00:04.830> you<00:00:05.339> have<00:00:05.370> nothing<00:00:05.910> in<00:00:06.000> common

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
you may think you have nothing in common

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.169 
you may think you have nothing in common
with<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.509> creature<00:00:06.810> that<00:00:07.080> lives<00:00:07.290> underwater

00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:08.179 
with a creature that lives underwater

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.879 
with a creature that lives underwater
but<00:00:09.179> at<00:00:09.420> some<00:00:09.900> point<00:00:09.929> in<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.469> distant<00:00:10.620> past

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
but at some point in the distant past

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.940 
but at some point in the distant past
all<00:00:11.820> mammals<00:00:12.570> shared<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:12.870> common<00:00:13.080> ancestor<00:00:13.320> and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
all mammals shared a common ancestor and

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.210 
all mammals shared a common ancestor and
that<00:00:14.460> ancestor<00:00:15.030> was<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> fish

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
that ancestor was a fish

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.160 
that ancestor was a fish
it<00:00:18.220> turns<00:00:18.460> out<00:00:18.640> our<00:00:18.880> shared<00:00:19.330> brain<00:00:19.630> structures

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
it turns out our shared brain structures

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.050 
it turns out our shared brain structures
are<00:00:20.349> one<00:00:20.650> of<00:00:20.740> the<00:00:20.859> best<00:00:21.160> places<00:00:21.520> to<00:00:21.730> see<00:00:22.029> a

remnant of our fishy past this is a trip

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.950 
remnant of our fishy past this is a trip
to<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.489> beginning<00:00:27.880> this<00:00:28.000> is<00:00:28.150> as<00:00:28.300> basic<00:00:28.480> as<00:00:28.810> it

by a car latinus fish a shark on the
right<00:00:33.790> you<00:00:34.600> see<00:00:34.629> the<00:00:34.900> muscles<00:00:35.230> and<00:00:35.800> nerves<00:00:35.980> and

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
right you see the muscles and nerves and

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.400 
right you see the muscles and nerves and
organs<00:00:36.280> inside<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.329> shark<00:00:37.570> head<00:00:37.780> but

organs inside the the shark head but

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.560 
organs inside the the shark head but
importantly<00:00:38.860> you<00:00:39.370> see<00:00:39.670> this<00:00:39.879> yellow<00:00:40.210> tissue

spinal cord it's the brain doesn't look

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.240 
spinal cord it's the brain doesn't look
like<00:00:44.290> much<00:00:44.470> but<00:00:44.500> it's<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:44.920> shark<00:00:45.129> Brendon

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
like much but it's the shark Brendon

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.740 
like much but it's the shark Brendon
this<00:00:48.250> is<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.460> human<00:00:48.640> right<00:00:48.850> this<00:00:49.390> is<00:00:49.539> where<00:00:49.690> it

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
this is the human right this is where it

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.180 
this is the human right this is where it
all<00:00:49.809> happens<00:00:50.140> for<00:00:50.289> us<00:00:50.350> where<00:00:50.710> our<00:00:50.829> memories

shark head yet when you know how to look

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.650 
shark head yet when you know how to look
you<00:01:02.019> find<00:01:02.289> a<00:01:02.440> very<00:01:03.039> profound<00:01:03.489> similarity<00:01:04.449> and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
you find a very profound similarity and

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.410 
you find a very profound similarity and
that<00:01:05.110> similarity<00:01:05.710> lies<00:01:05.890> in<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:06.820> overall

architecture of the brain itself in the
human<00:01:10.539> we<00:01:11.350> have<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.500> forebrain<00:01:11.560> and<00:01:12.340> that

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
human we have a forebrain and that

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.180 
human we have a forebrain and that
forebrain<00:01:12.940> consists<00:01:13.690> of<00:01:13.810> this<00:01:14.320> folded<00:01:15.009> to

forebrain consists of this folded to
shoot<00:01:15.460> here<00:01:15.759> where<00:01:16.240> much<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.420> our<00:01:16.600> conscious

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
shoot here where much of our conscious

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.169 
shoot here where much of our conscious
thought<00:01:17.200> happens<00:01:17.670> then<00:01:18.670> there's<00:01:18.850> a<00:01:18.910> midbrain

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
thought happens then there's a midbrain

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.999 
thought happens then there's a midbrain
this<00:01:19.600> walnut-sized<00:01:20.380> area<00:01:20.920> in<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.340> middle<00:01:21.810> and

this walnut-sized area in the middle and
