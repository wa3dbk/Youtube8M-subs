00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.559 
and on these uh robot masters figures if
you<00:03:27.010> come<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:28.400> can<00:03:28.579> combine<00:03:28.790> their<00:03:29.209> weapons

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569

robot masters figures he's the only one
I<00:03:42.440> have<00:03:42.769> so<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.400> choose<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.299> pick<00:03:44.480> up<00:03:44.630> more<00:03:45.220> that

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.400 
I have so I choose to pick up more that
would<00:03:46.310> be<00:03:46.370> interesting<00:03:46.850> to<00:03:46.940> see<00:03:47.150> yeah<00:03:48.049> great

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
would be interesting to see yeah great

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.910 
would be interesting to see yeah great
great<00:03:49.250> attention<00:03:49.730> to<00:03:49.819> detail<00:03:50.180> on<00:03:50.209> this<00:03:50.540> figure

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
great attention to detail on this figure

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.559 
great attention to detail on this figure
great<00:03:51.920> amount<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:54.430> how<00:03:55.430> do<00:03:55.489> you<00:03:55.579> say<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:56.420> ball

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
great amount of how do you say the ball

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.240 
great amount of how do you say the ball
joints<00:03:57.049> which<00:03:57.230> which<00:03:57.530> I'm<00:03:57.680> not<00:03:57.829> a<00:03:57.859> big<00:03:58.010> fan<00:03:58.220> of

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
joints which which I'm not a big fan of

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.410 
joints which which I'm not a big fan of
but<00:03:58.609> you<00:03:59.209> do<00:03:59.329> get<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.510> lot<00:03:59.660> of<00:03:59.780> pose<00:03:59.930> ability

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
but you do get a lot of pose ability

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.030 
but you do get a lot of pose ability
because<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.569> the<00:04:02.630> ball<00:04:02.780> joints<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.470> like<00:04:03.889> I

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
because of the ball joints and like I

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.890 
because of the ball joints and like I
said<00:04:05.680> I'm<00:04:06.680> a<00:04:06.739> big<00:04:06.950> fan<00:04:07.190> for<00:04:07.750> seekers<00:04:08.750> and

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
said I'm a big fan for seekers and

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.319 
said I'm a big fan for seekers and
seekers<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:09.769> jets<00:04:10.009> and<00:04:10.340> I<00:04:10.729> think<00:04:11.120> he's<00:04:11.299> a

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 
seekers and jets and I think he's a

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.789 
seekers and jets and I think he's a
really<00:04:11.570> cool<00:04:11.690> one<00:04:11.959> he<00:04:12.109> stands<00:04:12.380> out<00:04:12.560> pretty

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
really cool one he stands out pretty

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:13.300 
really cool one he stands out pretty
nicely

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
nicely

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.040 
nicely
so<00:04:14.269> let's<00:04:14.840> get

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
so let's get

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:41.899 
so let's get
the<00:04:15.290> transformation<00:04:15.920> this<00:04:16.070> guy

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:43.619 

all<00:04:42.909> right<00:04:42.999> so<00:04:43.149> that's<00:04:43.239> the<00:04:43.389> transformation

00:04:43.619 --> 00:04:43.629 
all right so that's the transformation

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.009 
all right so that's the transformation
pretty<00:04:44.409> simple<00:04:44.830> as<00:04:44.919> you<00:04:45.039> guys<00:04:45.189> can<00:04:45.429> see

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:46.019 
pretty simple as you guys can see

00:04:46.019 --> 00:04:48.449 
pretty simple as you guys can see
nothing<00:04:47.019> much<00:04:47.199> to<00:04:47.229> it<00:04:47.439> he<00:04:47.619> just<00:04:47.830> kind<00:04:48.009> of<00:04:48.099> folds

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:48.459 
nothing much to it he just kind of folds

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:50.399 
nothing much to it he just kind of folds
into<00:04:48.610> place<00:04:48.939> in<00:04:49.179> one<00:04:49.389> spot<00:04:49.779> and<00:04:49.839> then<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:50.169> just

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
into place in one spot and then you just

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.579 
into place in one spot and then you just
tuck<00:04:50.589> his<00:04:50.800> legs<00:04:51.839> into<00:04:52.839> these<00:04:53.080> little<00:04:53.259> slots

00:04:53.579 --> 00:04:53.589 
tuck his legs into these little slots

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:55.799 
tuck his legs into these little slots
right<00:04:53.830> there<00:04:54.129> you<00:04:55.029> tuck<00:04:55.209> his<00:04:55.360> orange<00:04:55.599> to<00:04:55.689> the

00:04:55.799 --> 00:04:55.809 
right there you tuck his orange to the

00:04:55.809 --> 00:05:00.659 
right there you tuck his orange to the
side<00:04:57.659> so<00:04:58.659> yeah<00:04:58.899> great<00:04:59.830> little<00:05:00.189> seeker<00:05:00.550> and

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
side so yeah great little seeker and

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:01.919 
side so yeah great little seeker and
like<00:05:00.819> I<00:05:00.939> said<00:05:01.149> I<00:05:01.179> really<00:05:01.269> like<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.719> attention

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:01.929 
like I said I really like the attention

00:05:01.929 --> 00:05:05.579 
like I said I really like the attention
to<00:05:02.139> detail<00:05:03.419> nice<00:05:04.419> translucent<00:05:04.749> plastic<00:05:05.139> on

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:05.589 
to detail nice translucent plastic on

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:06.449 
to detail nice translucent plastic on
the<00:05:05.679> cockpit

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:06.459 
the cockpit

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:11.189 
the cockpit
once<00:05:07.330> again<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.809> Decepticon<00:05:08.679> logo<00:05:10.079> and<00:05:11.079> he's

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
once again the Decepticon logo and he's

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:14.069 
once again the Decepticon logo and he's
just<00:05:11.349> a<00:05:11.499> very<00:05:11.800> tight<00:05:12.189> little<00:05:12.459> jet<00:05:13.079> modeled

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:14.079 
just a very tight little jet modeled

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:16.949 
just a very tight little jet modeled
after<00:05:14.229> I<00:05:14.529> think<00:05:14.889> like<00:05:15.039> an<00:05:15.159> f-18<00:05:15.689> Raptor<00:05:16.689> I

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:16.959 
after I think like an f-18 Raptor I

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:23.669 
after I think like an f-18 Raptor I
