00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
width to 460 now you can adjust that if

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.130 
width to 460 now you can adjust that if
you<00:02:32.700> like<00:02:32.910> because<00:02:33.390> it<00:02:33.630> doesn't<00:02:33.900> have<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.110> be

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
text but these are the ones that we've

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.680 
text but these are the ones that we've
used<00:02:37.530> by<00:02:37.770> default<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.880> we've<00:02:39.210> also<00:02:39.390> made<00:02:39.630> it

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
used by default so we've also made it

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.090 
used by default so we've also made it
easier<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.380> because<00:02:40.560> we<00:02:40.710> include<00:02:41.070> the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
easier for you because we include the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.250 
easier for you because we include the
sample<00:02:41.670> images<00:02:42.060> that<00:02:42.270> we've<00:02:42.360> created<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.110> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
sample images that we've created and the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.040 
sample images that we've created and the
sample<00:02:43.500> text<00:02:44.090> super<00:02:45.090> simple<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.690> work

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
sample text super simple to work

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.530 
sample text super simple to work
backwards<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.100> simply<00:02:47.760> replace<00:02:48.150> your<00:02:48.420> own

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
backwards and simply replace your own

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.230 
backwards and simply replace your own
stuff<00:02:48.900> watch<00:02:49.500> how<00:02:49.710> I<00:02:49.740> do<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.070> so<00:02:50.700> once<00:02:51.090> I've

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
stuff watch how I do that so once I've

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.790 
stuff watch how I do that so once I've
established<00:02:51.450> that<00:02:52.020> I<00:02:52.080> have<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.500> height<00:02:52.680> and

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
established that I have the height and

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.710 
established that I have the height and
width<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.610> say<00:02:53.790> how<00:02:53.970> many<00:02:54.030> slides<00:02:54.480> I'm

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
width and I say how many slides I'm

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.180 
width and I say how many slides I'm
going<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.960> use<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.500> in<00:02:55.680> this<00:02:55.740> case<00:02:55.980> it's

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
going to use and that in this case it's

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.640 
going to use and that in this case it's
three<00:02:56.580> I<00:02:56.760> can<00:02:57.300> select<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.750> transition<00:02:58.350> type

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
three I can select the transition type

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.040 
three I can select the transition type
so<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.100> have<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.580> nice<00:02:59.760> fade<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.420> I<00:03:00.690> can<00:03:00.960> do

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
so I have that nice fade but I can do

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.020 
so I have that nice fade but I can do
something<00:03:01.290> more<00:03:01.560> dramatic<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.670> can<00:03:02.850> change

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
something more dramatic and I can change

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.750 
something more dramatic and I can change
the<00:03:03.210> speed<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.810> duration<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.860> slide<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.340> also

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
the speed and duration this slide I also

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.280 
the speed and duration this slide I also
can<00:03:06.030> decide<00:03:06.270> whether<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.540> want<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.870> have<00:03:07.080> the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
can decide whether I want to have the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.870 
can decide whether I want to have the
slideshow<00:03:07.770> navigation<00:03:07.920> with<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.640> little

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
slideshow navigation with the little

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.620 
slideshow navigation with the little
buttons<00:03:09.180> below<00:03:09.440> which<00:03:10.440> are<00:03:10.620> these<00:03:10.770> things<00:03:11.630> or

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
buttons below which are these things or

buttons below which are these things or
these<00:03:13.440> little<00:03:13.740> buttons<00:03:13.860> on<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.190> side<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.400> can

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
these little buttons on the side I can

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.520 
these little buttons on the side I can
have<00:03:14.880> either<00:03:14.910> one<00:03:15.270> or<00:03:15.330> both<00:03:15.480> or<00:03:15.900> none<00:03:16.290> at<00:03:16.320> all

have either one or both or none at all

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.130 
have either one or both or none at all
so<00:03:17.310> I<00:03:17.370> save<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.850> let<00:03:18.300> me<00:03:18.390> show<00:03:18.540> you<00:03:18.570> now<00:03:18.810> how<00:03:18.840> I

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
so I save that let me show you now how I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.220 
so I save that let me show you now how I
go<00:03:19.440> about<00:03:19.470> making<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.450> then<00:03:21.450> I<00:03:21.540> can<00:03:21.690> swap<00:03:22.020> out

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
go about making it then I can swap out

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.199 
go about making it then I can swap out
some<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.709> call<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:23.040> action<00:03:23.400> stuff<00:03:23.670> we've

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
some of the call to action stuff we've

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.910 
some of the call to action stuff we've
made<00:03:24.480> it<00:03:24.600> simple<00:03:25.020> because<00:03:25.110> we've<00:03:25.500> retained

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
made it simple because we've retained

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.699 
made it simple because we've retained
