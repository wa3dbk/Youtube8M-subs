also uh not a small number by any means
we're<00:00:36.270> seeing<00:00:36.600> now<00:00:36.719> because<00:00:37.020> we're<00:00:37.140> doing

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
we're seeing now because we're doing

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.680 
we're seeing now because we're doing
this<00:00:37.410> robot<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.040> we're<00:00:38.520> seeing<00:00:38.760> younger<00:00:39.210> women

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
this robot is we're seeing younger women

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.319 
this robot is we're seeing younger women
come<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.140> because<00:00:40.950> before<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:41.670> may<00:00:41.850> postpone

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
come in because before they may postpone

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.150 
come in because before they may postpone
surgery<00:00:43.110> because<00:00:43.379> they're<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
surgery because they're and the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.490 
surgery because they're and the
workforce<00:00:44.719> doing<00:00:45.719> their<00:00:45.899> normal<00:00:46.110> life

workforce doing their normal life
activities<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.520> would<00:00:47.760> not<00:00:47.969> want<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.390> have<00:00:48.480> a

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
activities they would not want to have a

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.569 
activities they would not want to have a
major<00:00:48.809> operation<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.920> would<00:00:50.010> put<00:00:50.250> them<00:00:50.399> out

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
major operation that would put them out

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.670 
major operation that would put them out
of<00:00:50.850> being<00:00:51.090> able<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.270> do<00:00:51.420> their<00:00:51.680> lifestyle

of being able to do their lifestyle
whatever<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:54.059> we're<00:00:54.420> able<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
whatever that is so now we're able to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.479 
whatever that is so now we're able to
provide<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:55.020> surgery<00:00:55.530> where<00:00:55.739> again<00:00:56.250> it's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
provide a surgery where again it's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.040 
provide a surgery where again it's
overnight<00:00:57.210> stay<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.570> hospital<00:00:57.719> and

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
overnight stay in the hospital and

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
overnight stay in the hospital and
they're<00:00:58.379> back<00:00:58.649> to<00:00:58.890> their<00:00:58.920> lifestyle<00:00:59.640> much

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
they're back to their lifestyle much

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.000 
they're back to their lifestyle much
more<00:01:00.210> rapidly<00:01:00.719> there's<00:01:01.379> still<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.920> be

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
more rapidly there's still have to be

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.439 
more rapidly there's still have to be
careful<00:01:02.190> there<00:01:02.460> still<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.789> recovery<00:01:03.270> time

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
careful there still is recovery time

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.119 
careful there still is recovery time
associated<00:01:04.019> with<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.739> at<00:01:04.799> least<00:01:04.890> it's

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
associated with this but at least it's

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.770 
associated with this but at least it's
significantly<00:01:06.090> less<00:01:06.299> than<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.479> was<00:01:06.630> before

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
significantly less than it was before

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.929 
significantly less than it was before
and<00:01:06.990> also<00:01:07.260> cosmetically<00:01:08.070> instead<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.700> having

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and also cosmetically instead of having

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.700 
and also cosmetically instead of having
a<00:01:08.970> big<00:01:09.150> incision<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.630> big<00:01:09.869> they<00:01:10.260> now<00:01:10.470> have

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
a big incision of this big they now have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
a big incision of this big they now have
like<00:01:10.860> four<00:01:11.159> or<00:01:11.189> five<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.670> tiny<00:01:11.970> dots<00:01:12.810> like

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
like four or five little tiny dots like

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.780 
like four or five little tiny dots like
this<00:01:13.049> around<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.680> it's<00:01:13.920> it's<00:01:14.189> that's<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.640> big

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
this around so it's it's that's a big

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.730 
this around so it's it's that's a big
advantage<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.720> robot<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:17.750> tool<00:01:18.750> to

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
advantage to the robot is a tool to

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.789 
advantage to the robot is a tool to
guide<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.400> surgeon<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.150> far<00:01:21.509> as<00:01:21.750> inside<00:01:22.439> the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
guide the surgeon as far as inside the

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.249 
guide the surgeon as far as inside the
abdomen<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.850> got<00:01:24.150> little<00:01:24.450> hands<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.020> look

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
abdomen it's got little hands that look

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.350 
abdomen it's got little hands that look
like<00:01:25.439> just<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:25.710> little<00:01:25.830> hands<00:01:26.310> they<00:01:27.119> can

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
like just like little hands they can

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.240 
like just like little hands they can
they<00:01:27.600> have<00:01:27.750> more<00:01:28.110> mobility<00:01:28.380> than<00:01:28.890> heel<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
they have more mobility than heel and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.730 
they have more mobility than heel and
wrist<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.119> major<00:01:30.360> problem<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
wrist so the major problem with the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.929 
wrist so the major problem with the
laparoscope<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.950> pure<00:01:35.220> laparoscope<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
laparoscope the pure laparoscope is the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
laparoscope the pure laparoscope is the
step<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:37.110> sewing<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.680> knitting

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
step it's like like sewing with knitting

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.069 
step it's like like sewing with knitting
needles<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.549> can't<00:01:38.790> tie<00:01:39.060> very<00:01:39.119> well<00:01:39.540> so

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
needles you can't tie very well so

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.420 
needles you can't tie very well so
subsequently<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:40.740> have<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.890> procedure<00:01:41.220> we

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
subsequently if you have a procedure we

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.120 
subsequently if you have a procedure we
have<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> do<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.729> lot<00:01:41.970> of<00:01:42.090> knots<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.960> very<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
have to do a lot of knots it's very it

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.069 
have to do a lot of knots it's very it
can<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.460> done<00:01:44.610> but<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.299> much<00:01:45.450> more<00:01:45.630> difficult

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
can be done but it's much more difficult

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.350 
can be done but it's much more difficult
so<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> robot<00:01:47.159> now<00:01:47.850> you've<00:01:48.149> got<00:01:48.329> a

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so now with the robot now you've got a

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.690 
so now with the robot now you've got a
procedure<00:01:48.780> where<00:01:49.229> like<00:01:49.530> no<00:01:49.710> hands<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.280> can<00:01:50.490> tie

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
procedure where like no hands it can tie

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
procedure where like no hands it can tie
knots<00:01:50.970> very<00:01:51.420> rapidly<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.680> why<00:01:52.829> with

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
knots very rapidly so that's why with

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.800 
knots very rapidly so that's why with
this<00:01:53.189> procedure<00:01:53.700> we're<00:01:54.030> able<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.360> do<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.659> in

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
this procedure we're able to do it in

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.469 
this procedure we're able to do it in
about<00:01:55.320> two<00:01:55.770> maybe<00:01:56.310> three<00:01:56.759> hours<00:01:56.790> which<00:01:57.329> is

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
about two maybe three hours which is

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.840 
about two maybe three hours which is
nearly<00:01:58.020> identical<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:59.070> doing<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.430> with<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
nearly identical to doing it with the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.110 
nearly identical to doing it with the
open<00:02:00.240> traditional<00:02:00.780> incision
