00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.169
 there is more broken his cali mysteries of the 84 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:22.460
 I hope you all go very well 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:24.140
 because I fart the form 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.949
 and today I find myself for a 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.679
 first tutorial on gta 5 a wonderful game 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.839
 I tell you by passing today I 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:35.210
 will teach you how to buy one of 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:36.920
 properties for free actually it's 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.839
 not quite for free because 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.420
 I will explain everything in this 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:43.790
 video 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.989
 in fact you are going to have it you need 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.100
 more money for example this 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.129
 property 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.660
 listen I think what counts 600 miles 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:56.000
 here you go you will have to do was 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.339
 have for example seven hundred thousand or six 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.999
 in fact you must have more than the 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.739
 sum is indicated to buy it so 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.269
 for example there you put in front of the 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.610
 panel you pressed twice on the 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.080
 right page on xbox I think that's it 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.470
 must be the same after you go 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.480
 of issues in charge of mission and he 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.220
 should you have done 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.220
 the mission hides but if you do not have it 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.560
 not done it does not matter you need 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.330
 a pretty short mission what will it be 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.460
 simply faster if you have 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.920
 does the mask mission after they do you 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.460
 say it's going to load the mission so 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:33.140
 you do 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.030
 yes of course that's after you go 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.930
 have a small hour of loading and 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.690
 there you will have to go there 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.610
 the kind of sail to kinematics 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:47.150
 so excuse me for the little lula 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.860
 was united here from me it's not 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.950
 grave then there you go buy that's it 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.290
 3 masc 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.330
 so that's the masks mission for 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.690
 the robbery here is then it's going to be 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.460
 finish 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.620
 it's going to be like you've finished 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.010
 mission it's not going to put you that you 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.600
 have succeeded there it's okay you 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.270
 reload the story mode and it's okay 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.850
 put it back where you were before 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.600
 the panel except that this time the the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:17.000
 property on the map will be blue so she 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.900
