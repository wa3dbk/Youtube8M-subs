student athlete planting coach rallies
often<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.010> definitely<00:00:38.460> tough<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.790> first<00:00:38.820> but

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
often it's definitely tough at first but

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.270 
often it's definitely tough at first but
once<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.480> eat<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.719> hang<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:41.070> feel

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
once you eat the hang of it you feel

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.709 
once you eat the hang of it you feel
like<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.489> pretty<00:00:41.700> much<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:42.149> control<00:00:42.600> any

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
like you pretty much can control any

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.360 
like you pretty much can control any
situation<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.469> thrown<00:00:43.680> at<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.010> in<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.129> game

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
situation and thrown at you in the game

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.479 
situation and thrown at you in the game
and<00:00:45.030> also<00:00:45.510> having<00:00:46.050> all<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.800> players<00:00:47.070> involved

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
and also having all the players involved

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.670 
and also having all the players involved
definitely<00:00:48.030> helps<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:48.360> well<00:00:48.480> because<00:00:49.440> you're

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
definitely helps as well because you're

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.380 
definitely helps as well because you're
not<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:50.070> dependent<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.520> one<00:00:50.760> person<00:00:51.149> so

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
not so dependent on one person so

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.189 
not so dependent on one person so
