00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:10.719
 hi girls girls to go karina garcÃ­a 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:12.690
 that was the one that made me a father that is 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:21.210
 true 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:21.210
 It exists as the plate 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:32.820
 the expert all this and that is going to be a 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.820
 hair 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.530
 if they are creating like that reddish decade 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.360
 of the hospital capital about the world goes and 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.239
 we're going to use a der vaart and we're going 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:54.460
 to make a combination of two tones a 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:57.039
 6 44 with a 6 43 so for that 44 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.860
 euros is too intense and the 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.960
 43 that had been eaten but with that 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.720
 that looks like a little copper 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.910
 interest in a tacho today but that the 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.830
 little shoe when the whistle obviously in the 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.350
 carl hair and that by the way is 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.790
 very healthy 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.740
 so you have to lower it you have to lower it 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.750
 until Qatar and France just give it a 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.430
 true captain tone inscribed as 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.490
 because it is important for all those 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.990
 have the hair 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.390
 they just want to bleach not 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.869
 despair what with a clear what 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.640
 crazy we already know that the dye if we 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.470
 we apply a lighter tint here we do not 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.960
 It will clear in his writings that will 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.759
 we need to make a shampoo 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.299
 corrective that is what we are going to handle 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.920
 here with corrective shampoo but 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.110
 corrective we will correct when 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.070
 you have the coffee root and the tips 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.070
 black with the root and brown and the ends 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.070
 dark 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.119
 This corrective shampoo will help us 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.250
 give what is being accountable a 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.159
 little bit of the color that the 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.350
 dark and zinc in color the limit that 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.610
 we are going to apply these facts now 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.989
 well, totally even yes then how 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.390
 we are going to do good now more 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.270
 We 'll explain later but let's go 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.940
 to use a little coloring 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:21.400
 of shampoo to have at home or that 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.400
 have at home and volume peroxide 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.860
 4 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:37.190
 ok i'm exploring way and star 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.819
 blue beige or powder then in this case 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.939
 We will use normal powder 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:46.409
 per second during normal equal and which 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:46.409
 it will be fine yesterday 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:53.100
 although we will not use 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.410
 everyday 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.410
 Well yes 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.620
 good is ready 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.270
 to see lupita you put here 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:26.400
 dust powder but it has been 20 volumes 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.590
 and shampoo and shampoo and how much amounts 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.190
 same from good the same from dust so 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.720
 same peroxide and shampoo nothing 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.490
 more than we are adding a bit a 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.310
 little that the mixture does not remain 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.800
 too liquid or thing if they are fixed 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.140
 this is still manageable perfect 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:47.300
 Now yes and abel and directed because I already 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.920
 add a little bit of paul ok 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.920
 stand out and it's not another life 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:04:01.880
 ok is the root application no or if 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:06.260
 in the root because as the powder gets 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.819
 and in dust they raise I understand very 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.450
 all right 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:13.639
 and then but next 20 I try 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.130
 girls and boys that are the same 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:19.670
 brands 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.630
 continue paying for the commercial front 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:26.960
 never 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.960
 and the shampoo and then we're going to fill 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.719
 so that it slides a little truth 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.350
 well this is the famous neither reactive 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.120
 What do I expect when you have the hair that 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:47.160
 is stained not like mapping milestone and 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.350
 look for example here search dies not 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.710
 limiting the day we have 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:51.710
 aggregate 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.440
 Excellent 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.910
 apply it only where you start to see 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:09.980
 obviously here you start to see that 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.400
 chop and had a little bit of not painting his 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.400
 hair 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.950
 and the shampoo for that is to soften and 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.449
 show off a little 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.360
 of coral 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:25.229
 also something very important that they should 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.229
 make at home 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.180
 to help someone or apply it 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:34.680
 fast because as it is decolorizing 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.680
 going down much faster 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.719
 Can you help them right now? 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.150
 and breathing and with water 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.660
 and that's mind vomit is what brings 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.660
 shampoo 

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.440
 and since he was still beheaded 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.360
 cast 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:14.620
 and since they are dani now 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.740
 if we apply a creame but it is 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.300
 any cream as one thing is to be 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.810
 enter a barrier called 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:32.450
 protective although of the brand 's time 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.350
 we apply in all the contour for 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.350
 that do not stain 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.690
 fernandito coming out well for 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:57.350
 and the hair is red 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:59.930
 I liked it is and red yes no 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:03.900
 and they give and now you 're doing nothing else 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:06.120
 the wavy the tips truth 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.830
 sir peter already cut him little hair 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.959
 nothing else number 3 of 20 to this one the 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.729
 evidence 

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:17.139
 good 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:22.060
 Car and short and the trip is over 

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:26.800
 cute makeup 

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.800
 to be painted by the next collections 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:44.790
 on the phone because then I say what 

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:44.790
 is going to paint and how are you wrong 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:53.430
