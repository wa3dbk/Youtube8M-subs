I'm<00:01:28.049> I<00:01:28.290> live<00:01:28.560> in<00:01:28.680> England<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.310> we've<00:01:30.270> had<00:01:30.450> like

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
I'm I live in England and we've had like

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.870 
I'm I live in England and we've had like
two<00:01:30.840> weeks<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.320> no<00:01:31.860> rain<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.610> know<00:01:32.729> if

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
two weeks of no rain and you know if

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.609 
two weeks of no rain and you know if
that<00:01:32.909> happens<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.659> have<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:33.930> get<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.170> three

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that happens you have to get like three

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.410 
that happens you have to get like three
months<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.070> straight<00:01:35.280> rains<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.060> think

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
months of straight rains so I think

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.270 
months of straight rains so I think
that's<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.680> be<00:01:37.740> happening<00:01:38.070> for<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that's going to be happening for the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.310 
that's going to be happening for the
next<00:01:38.460> three<00:01:38.640> months<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.970> guess<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.479> anyway<00:01:40.170> this

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
next three months I guess so anyway this

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.050 
next three months I guess so anyway this
gameplay<00:01:40.530> really<00:01:41.070> should<00:01:41.250> be<00:01:41.369> like<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.759> double

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
gameplay really should be like a double

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.639 
gameplay really should be like a double
nuclear<00:01:42.509> at<00:01:42.630> least<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> amount<00:01:43.530> of

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
nuclear at least because the amount of

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.260 
nuclear at least because the amount of
15<00:01:44.070> green<00:01:44.280> streaks<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.670> I've<00:01:44.759> gotten<00:01:45.119> and

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
15 green streaks that I've gotten and

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.389 
15 green streaks that I've gotten and
dyed<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.659> random<00:01:46.020> stuff<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.380> explosions<00:01:47.100> or

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
dyed to random stuff like explosions or

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.069 
dyed to random stuff like explosions or
you<00:01:47.880> know<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.000> dodgy<00:01:48.299> spawn<00:01:48.630> or<00:01:48.720> whatever<00:01:48.930> but

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
you know a dodgy spawn or whatever but

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.840 
you know a dodgy spawn or whatever but
let's<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.320> move<00:01:49.500> town<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.920> if<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.130> agreed

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
let's just move town and if you agreed

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.249 
let's just move town and if you agreed
to<00:01:50.939> play<00:01:51.060> nuke<00:01:51.270> town<00:01:51.450> you've<00:01:51.720> got<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.960> expect

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
to play nuke town you've got to expect

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.380 
to play nuke town you've got to expect
those<00:01:52.470> dodgy<00:01:52.710> spawns<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.399> random<00:01:53.729> explosives

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
those dodgy spawns and random explosives

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.179 
those dodgy spawns and random explosives
because<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:55.350> map<00:01:55.530> has<00:01:55.680> always<00:01:55.829> been<00:01:55.979> hectic

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
because this map has always been hectic

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.380 
because this map has always been hectic
and<00:01:56.460> I've<00:01:56.549> got<00:01:56.670> kind<00:01:56.850> of<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.030> love-hate

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
actually pretty fun to play but then I

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.710 
actually pretty fun to play but then I
went<00:02:16.250> into<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:16.580> domination<00:02:17.060> game<00:02:17.240> mode<00:02:17.480> where

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
went into a domination game mode where

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.030 
went into a domination game mode where
everyone<00:02:18.050> was<00:02:18.110> just<00:02:18.290> camping<00:02:18.650> in<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:18.800> back

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
everyone was just camping in the back

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.340 
everyone was just camping in the back
and<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.730> was<00:02:19.850> it<00:02:20.090> was<00:02:20.270> awful<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.020> if<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.200> watch

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
and it was it was awful and if you watch

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.380 
and it was it was awful and if you watch
my<00:02:21.380> road<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.950> Commander<00:02:22.370> you'll<00:02:23.000> know<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.180> I

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
my road to Commander you'll know that I

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.390 
my road to Commander you'll know that I
told<00:02:24.140> myself<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.740> I<00:02:24.770> was<00:02:24.860> never<00:02:25.040> playing<00:02:25.280> this

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
told myself and I was never playing this

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.190 
told myself and I was never playing this
map<00:02:25.550> again<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.060> I've<00:02:26.420> kind<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.690> realized<00:02:26.840> and

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
map again and I've kind of realized and

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.620 
map again and I've kind of realized and
I've<00:02:27.260> kind<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.470> decided<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:29.060> know<00:02:29.150> the<00:02:29.300> reason

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
I've kind of decided you know the reason

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.300 
I've kind of decided you know the reason
why<00:02:29.750> I<00:02:29.780> hated<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.350> game<00:02:30.530> if<00:02:30.710> you<00:02:30.740> saw<00:02:30.950> putting

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
why I hated this game if you saw putting

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.440 
why I hated this game if you saw putting
the<00:02:31.400> gameplay<00:02:31.700> right<00:02:31.820> there<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.150> because

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
the gameplay right there is because

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.840 
the gameplay right there is because
there<00:02:32.630> was<00:02:32.750> those<00:02:33.140> migration<00:02:33.710> so<00:02:34.400> I<00:02:34.460> just<00:02:34.640> cut

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
there was those migration so I just cut

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.220 
there was those migration so I just cut
out<00:02:34.880> because<00:02:35.150> obviously<00:02:35.480> they're<00:02:35.780> not<00:02:35.870> fun<00:02:36.110> to

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
out because obviously they're not fun to

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.560 
out because obviously they're not fun to
watch<00:02:36.260> so<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.860> found<00:02:37.310> out<00:02:37.430> why<00:02:37.640> sometimes<00:02:38.240> I

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
watch so I found out why sometimes I

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.150 
watch so I found out why sometimes I
love<00:02:38.690> this<00:02:38.840> map<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.170> sometimes<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.620> hate<00:02:39.800> it

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
love this map and sometimes I hate it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.980 
love this map and sometimes I hate it
I've<00:02:40.460> decided<00:02:40.820> that<00:02:41.090> in<00:02:41.360> game<00:02:41.570> modes<00:02:41.840> with

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
I've decided that in game modes with

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.930 
I've decided that in game modes with
fixed<00:02:42.290> spawns<00:02:42.530> like<00:02:42.830> a<00:02:42.860> demolition<00:02:43.490> or<00:02:43.880> a

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
fixed spawns like a demolition or a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.640 
fixed spawns like a demolition or a
domination<00:02:44.660> where<00:02:44.840> you<00:02:45.050> know<00:02:45.170> if<00:02:45.290> you<00:02:45.410> get<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
domination where you know if you get the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.040 
domination where you know if you get the
a<00:02:45.860> and<00:02:46.010> B<00:02:46.130> fly<00:02:46.340> can<00:02:46.550> spawn<00:02:46.790> at<00:02:46.910> sea<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.270> hate<00:02:47.870> it

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
a and B fly can spawn at sea I hate it
