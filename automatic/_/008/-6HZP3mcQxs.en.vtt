00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
hair this is Brazilian I have presented

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:56.989 
hair this is Brazilian I have presented
Peruvian<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:56.100> was<00:01:56.249> a<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.549> bit<00:01:56.670> nervous

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
Peruvian and I was a little bit nervous

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.910 
Peruvian and I was a little bit nervous
because<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.630> don't<00:01:57.689> like<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.049> hair<00:01:58.350> stuff<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
because I don't like my hair stuff and

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.889 
because I don't like my hair stuff and
I'm<00:01:59.069> Brazilian<00:01:59.429> or<00:01:59.909> proving<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:03.049> it<00:02:04.049> actually

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
I'm Brazilian or proving but it actually

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.700 
I'm Brazilian or proving but it actually
it<00:02:06.899> doesn't<00:02:07.259> look<00:02:07.859> bad<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.759> actually<00:02:09.710> because

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
it doesn't look bad it actually because

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.980 
it doesn't look bad it actually because
I<00:02:10.830> threw<00:02:11.160> that<00:02:11.220> like<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.819> highlights<00:02:12.240> in<00:02:12.630> and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
I threw that like the highlights in and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.710 
I threw that like the highlights in and
then<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.170> think<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.560> highlight<00:02:14.450> there's<00:02:15.450> like

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
then I think the highlight there's like

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.300 
then I think the highlight there's like
the<00:02:15.960> darker<00:02:16.920> hair<00:02:17.690> we<00:02:18.690> lifted<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.590> good<00:02:20.130> air

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
the darker hair we lifted the good air

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.300 
the darker hair we lifted the good air
and<00:02:21.110> I<00:02:22.110> think<00:02:22.350> we<00:02:22.530> used<00:02:22.740> 40<00:02:23.310> volume<00:02:24.050> lifter<00:02:25.310> I'm

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.480 
and I think we used 40 volume lifter I'm
pretty<00:02:26.520> sure<00:02:26.700> that's<00:02:26.850> what<00:02:27.030> we<00:02:27.150> used<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:29.280> I
