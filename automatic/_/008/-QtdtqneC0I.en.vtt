hi I'm Vic and today we're introducing

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.680 
hi I'm Vic and today we're introducing
you<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.170> game<00:00:07.350> of<00:00:07.589> backgammon<00:00:07.859> I<00:00:08.670> want<00:00:09.630> to

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
you to the game of backgammon I want to

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.950 
you to the game of backgammon I want to
show<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.170> position<00:00:11.040> where<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.969> hit<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.630> not

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
show you a position where a hit is not

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.099 
show you a position where a hit is not
an<00:00:13.200> advisable<00:00:13.980> thing<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.519> do<00:00:14.700> because<00:00:15.360> it

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
an advisable thing to do because it

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
involves hitting too early what we said

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.390 
involves hitting too early what we said
in<00:00:20.449> the<00:00:21.449> position<00:00:22.109> where<00:00:22.320> we<00:00:22.470> Illustrated<00:00:23.220> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
in the position where we Illustrated the

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.310 
goal was you you're trying in a back
game<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:26.910> a<00:00:26.970> late<00:00:27.869> hit<00:00:29.720> you'll<00:00:30.720> notice<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
game to get a late hit you'll notice the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.340 
game to get a late hit you'll notice the
position<00:00:31.470> we<00:00:32.009> displayed<00:00:32.640> was<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> position

partial prime in front of it by the way
this<00:00:48.090> is<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.329> best<00:00:48.690> way<00:00:48.899> to<00:00:48.930> defend<00:00:49.469> against<00:00:49.860> a

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
this is the best way to defend against a

this is the best way to defend against a
back<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.940> back<00:00:51.629> game<00:00:51.930> rather<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.520> try<00:00:53.789> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
back and a back game rather is to try to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.880 
back and a back game rather is to try to
build<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.300> prime<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.780> front<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.440> try<00:00:55.860> to

play a priming game against a back game
now<00:01:01.879> suppose<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.570> situation<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.769> this

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
now suppose in a situation like this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.469 
now suppose in a situation like this
blue<00:01:07.430> roles<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:09.090> only<00:01:09.960> number<00:01:10.520> which<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> 17

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
blue roles the only number which is a 17

other words the only number blue can

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.969 
other words the only number blue can
roll<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.950> would<00:01:23.220> hit<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:24.110> checker<00:01:25.110> would

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
roll that would hit that checker would

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.160 
roll that would hit that checker would
be<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.490> 6<00:01:27.000> &amp;<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.570> 1

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.499 
be a 6 &amp; a 1
now<00:01:28.590> suppose<00:01:29.159> blue<00:01:29.759> happens<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.720> roll<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.470> 6<00:01:31.829> 1

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
now suppose blue happens to roll the 6 1

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.880 
now suppose blue happens to roll the 6 1
well<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:35.250> hit<00:01:36.229> again<00:01:37.229> to

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
well just because you can hit again to

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.160 
well just because you can hit again to
review<00:01:38.400> what<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> rule<00:01:38.939> said<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:39.960> not

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
review what the rule said you are not

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.889 
review what the rule said you are not
forced<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.189> hit<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.700> checker<00:01:43.549> you<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.899> play

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
forced to hit a checker you can play

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.670 
forced to hit a checker you can play
elsewhere<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:47.369> your<00:01:47.549> board<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.360> it's<00:01:49.110> legal<00:01:49.439> to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
elsewhere in your board if it's legal to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.810 
elsewhere in your board if it's legal to
do<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:53.780> what<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.810> want<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.320> illustrate<00:01:55.640> here<00:01:56.640> is

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
do so what I want to illustrate here is

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.410 
do so what I want to illustrate here is
that<00:01:57.210> this<00:01:57.810> is<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.110> situation<00:01:58.530> where<00:01:59.460> even

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
that this is a situation where even

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.359 
that this is a situation where even
though<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.659> have<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.469> head<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.710> mean<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.159> looks

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
though you have the head I mean it looks

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.190 
though you have the head I mean it looks
like<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.090> blues<00:02:03.479> lucky<00:02:04.079> day<00:02:05.360> only<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.390> 17

to one shot hit and by golly blue rolled
the<00:02:11.819> 17<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.660> 1
