00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.250
 ah 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.369
 and 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.690
 years ago maybe it was very important 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.810
 complements the dress but now it's 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.590
 very important the set between or not a 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:52.260
 good hair says a lot about everything sometimes 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.809
 it may seem can make you even more 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.150
 older or younger is to find the look 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.610
 perfect for the person is the most 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.100
 important either a picked up a 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.510
 semirecogido a loose hair that 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.180
 when the client looks in the mirror 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.820
 do not feel disguised do not sit 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.890
 different and be as comfortable as 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.350
 important to advise a client of 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.570
 face an elk to a party is first 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.630
 talk to the customer I always say that 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.869
 losing five minutes is winning a lot 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.300
 time to know how she's going to be dressed how 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.540
 going to be made up what accessories goes to 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:30.270
 carry and with that we designed the hairstyle 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.550
 we are going to present a hairstyle for today 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.920
 which is one of the most demanded there is 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.350
 what all celebrities wear and in 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.180
 the catwalks at any event and it's 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.710
 a bit like the famous hairstyle that 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.110
 they carry the models of victoria's secret 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.930
 hair with a lot of volume in the area 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.780
 because that favors waves with a 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.030
 very disheveled effect because the secret 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.050
 of this hairstyle is that the hair you 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.330
 disheveled and then the final touch is 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.430
 put some extensions with some curtains 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.470
 of hair they put in two minutes the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.229
 effect is impressive what it does is 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.780
 have that combing effect with so much 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.320
 glamor and above all very elegant for 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.080
 begin the hairstyle first will be the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.650
 completely dry dry hair and 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.880
 with some plates or with a pincer 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.650
 we lightly mold the hair 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.380
 marking these waves that before 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.860
 we were talking and as we see here 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.970
 tufts we pray more others less 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.970
 we leave more natural 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.930
 to 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.930
 i 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.300
 the second step is to also perform the 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.490
 extensions that are with the same 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.950
 Nature that hair matters 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.260
 I think it's choosing the style of each 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.260
 person the color cut 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.650
 Yes Yes 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.550
 the secret to putting some extensions 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.430
 of curtain and that they do not fall is very 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.920
 important obviously is to prepare a 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.630
 little bit the root is to say we take the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.300
 strand where the extension is going to be 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.810
 and we created a little bit for 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.200
 that the gripper grip much better and not 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.620
 slide these extensions go with a few 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.989
 clip 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.909
 it is put in the root where we have created a 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.040
 little hair and they are 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.379
 perfectly according to what the 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.680
 client wants to get if she wants a 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:32.840
 more natural or striking effect on 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.540
 this case as good is a person who 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.280
 is a modern young man who is going to dress 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.799
 that with a little more sophisticated 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.900
 we can abuse and put all the hair 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.299
 we want, I think a woman with 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.180
 Hair never hurts, not because it favors 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.120
 It's very much better to have a lot of hair 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.620
 having scarce is very important this area 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.319
 up here from the occipital area 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.900
 top of the head that always goes 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.069
 with a lot of volume because that's what 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.950
 really stylized 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.700
 the face of a person you always hit 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.700
 with this hair 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.819
 the night 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:15.760
 and a lot 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.760
 Hello 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.990
 now I think it's the final touch more 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.289
 important the ending that is where 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.960
 we determine the exact volume the wave 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.900
 always also thinking that a hairstyle 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.000
 when it's freshly made a little more 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.860
 flamboyant and has much more volume there 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.930
 clients who say no does not put more 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.449
 volume because they know that right away it's a 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.659
 hairstyle that tends to fall is not looking 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.340
 well to the mirror to the client and the truth 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:49.960
 which is that it is a hairstyle that favors 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.240
 very much it is a party look 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.219
 perfect for the night for an event 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.099
 It is night that you go with a 

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:59.469
 very very tight dress very just not 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:02.139
 you can go with anything that is ostentatious with 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:05.110
 volumes or with lace has to be 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.060
 a very simple dress very close short 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.509
 long does not matter but with a little 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.800
 neckline if it can be and is suitable for 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.490
 night for an event of these 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.490
 characteristic
