that medium heat with no salt don't
insult<00:01:31.899> because<00:01:32.200> it<00:01:32.500> slows<00:01:32.740> down<00:01:32.770> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
insult because it slows down the

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
want to get these soft then I took an

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.340 
want to get these soft then I took an
immersion<00:01:38.829> blender<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:41.049> can<00:01:41.200> use<00:01:41.320> a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
immersion blender and you can use a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.899 
immersion blender and you can use a
potato<00:01:41.530> masher<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.310> doesn't<00:01:42.579> have<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.759> be<00:01:42.850> an

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
potato masher it doesn't have to be an

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.300 
potato masher it doesn't have to be an
immersion<00:01:43.359> blender<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.930> I<00:01:44.680> just<00:01:44.920> smoosh<00:01:45.130> them

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
immersion blender and I just smoosh them

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.090 
immersion blender and I just smoosh them
up<00:01:45.460> as<00:01:45.670> you<00:01:45.850> can<00:01:46.030> see<00:01:46.329> most<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.530> beans<00:01:47.740> are

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
up as you can see most of the beans are

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.969 
up as you can see most of the beans are
mush<00:01:48.399> flat<00:01:49.049> there<00:01:50.049> are<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.200> few<00:01:50.439> whole<00:01:50.710> beans

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
mush flat there are a few whole beans

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.690 
mush flat there are a few whole beans
not<00:01:51.609> a<00:01:51.670> big<00:01:51.939> deal<00:01:52.149> I<00:01:52.859> left<00:01:53.859> just<00:01:54.130> enough<00:01:54.250> water

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
not a big deal I left just enough water

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.870 
not a big deal I left just enough water
in<00:01:54.939> the<00:01:55.060> pot<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.570> cover<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:56.770> beans<00:01:56.950> prior<00:01:57.549> to

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
in the pot to cover the beans prior to

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.630 
in the pot to cover the beans prior to
them<00:01:58.090> being<00:01:59.039> pushed<00:02:00.039> by<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.310> immersion

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
them being pushed by the immersion

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.669 
them being pushed by the immersion
blender<00:02:00.820> I<00:02:01.770> added<00:02:02.770> 1/2<00:02:03.189> a<00:02:03.729> cup<00:02:03.909> of<00:02:03.969> lard<00:02:04.359> so<00:02:05.289> 1/2

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
blender I added 1/2 a cup of lard so 1/2

a cup of lard to 4 pounds of beans

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.260 
a cup of lard to 4 pounds of beans

this regular lard from the store and

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.670 
this regular lard from the store and
then<00:02:22.209> all<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.420> did<00:02:22.810> was<00:02:23.019> I<00:02:23.140> put<00:02:23.170> them<00:02:23.470> in<00:02:23.590> the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
then all I did was I put them in the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.250 
then all I did was I put them in the
refrigerator<00:02:24.340> overnight<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:25.209> harden<00:02:25.540> up<00:02:25.690> some

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
refrigerator overnight to harden up some

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.690 
refrigerator overnight to harden up some
and<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:29.470> then<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.770> just<00:02:30.010> smeared<00:02:30.340> him<00:02:30.459> on<00:02:30.580> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
and and then I just smeared him on the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
and and then I just smeared him on the
tray<00:02:31.050> hopefully<00:02:32.050> as<00:02:32.319> they<00:02:32.590> thaw<00:02:33.540> and/or<00:02:34.540> heat

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
tray hopefully as they thaw and/or heat

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.170 
tray hopefully as they thaw and/or heat
up<00:02:34.900> they<00:02:35.140> won't<00:02:35.349> run<00:02:35.590> off<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:36.099> tray<00:02:36.340> but<00:02:37.000> we're

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
up they won't run off the tray but we're

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.280 
up they won't run off the tray but we're
gonna<00:02:37.300> find<00:02:37.569> that<00:02:37.810> out

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
gonna find that out

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.070 
gonna find that out
I<00:02:38.319> did<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.459> with<00:02:39.670> beef<00:02:39.879> bouillon<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.390> the

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
I did that with beef bouillon and the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.690 
I did that with beef bouillon and the
beef<00:02:41.260> bouillon<00:02:41.709> ended<00:02:42.099> up<00:02:42.190> all<00:02:42.340> over<00:02:42.580> the

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
beef bouillon ended up all over the

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.210 
beef bouillon ended up all over the
floor<00:02:42.970> so<00:02:43.630> we'll<00:02:44.110> see<00:02:44.349> how<00:02:44.500> this<00:02:44.680> goes<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:45.160> think

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
floor so we'll see how this goes I think

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.190 
floor so we'll see how this goes I think
this<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.700> gonna<00:02:45.880> be<00:02:45.970> okay<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.450> think<00:02:46.750> it'll<00:02:46.870> dry

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
this is gonna be okay I think it'll dry

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.500 
this is gonna be okay I think it'll dry
quick<00:02:48.099> enough<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.670> not<00:02:49.480> run<00:02:50.370> now<00:02:51.370> a<00:02:51.790> few

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
quick enough to not run now a few

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.309 
quick enough to not run now a few

can or refried beans and dehydrate them
go<00:03:02.769> for<00:03:03.069> it<00:03:03.190> I<00:03:03.370> don't<00:03:04.209> add<00:03:04.750> salt<00:03:05.049> to<00:03:05.260> any<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.769> my

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
go for it I don't add salt to any of my

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.970 
go for it I don't add salt to any of my
dehydrated<00:03:06.790> items<00:03:07.150> because<00:03:07.799> when<00:03:08.799> you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
dehydrated items because when you

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.610 
dehydrated items because when you
dehydrate<00:03:09.640> foods<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:10.810> salt<00:03:11.140> turns<00:03:11.410> back

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
dehydrate foods that salt turns back

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.059 
dehydrate foods that salt turns back
into<00:03:11.650> granules<00:03:12.540> so<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.989> don't<00:03:14.620> like<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.950> little

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
into granules so I don't like the little

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.589 
into granules so I don't like the little
grains<00:03:15.430> in<00:03:15.760> it<00:03:15.910> so<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.150> don't<00:03:16.329> add<00:03:16.690> any<00:03:16.900> salt<00:03:17.310> and

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
grains in it so I don't add any salt and

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.839 
grains in it so I don't add any salt and
then<00:03:19.599> once<00:03:19.810> this<00:03:19.959> comes<00:03:20.260> out<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:21.430> can<00:03:21.610> just

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:21.849 
then once this comes out you can just

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.180 
then once this comes out you can just
break<00:03:22.060> it<00:03:22.269> into<00:03:22.420> big<00:03:22.630> pieces<00:03:22.840> like<00:03:23.500> they<00:03:23.890> do<00:03:23.950> in

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
break it into big pieces like they do in

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.800 
break it into big pieces like they do in
the<00:03:24.250> can<00:03:24.989> and<00:03:26.670> you're<00:03:27.670> done<00:03:27.910> so<00:03:28.360> well<00:03:28.540> but<00:03:28.720> I'll
