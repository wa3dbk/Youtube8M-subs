non-revenue water the first thing you
should<00:00:38.280> always<00:00:38.309> do<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.760> look<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.329> meters

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
should always do is look at the meters

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.420 
should always do is look at the meters
to<00:00:40.230> make<00:00:40.379> sure<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.980> meters<00:00:41.280> are

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
to make sure that the meters are

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.790 
to make sure that the meters are
accurate<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.809> will<00:00:43.020> then<00:00:43.170> allow<00:00:43.530> you<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
accurate and this will then allow you to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.040 
accurate and this will then allow you to
start<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.430> manage<00:00:44.850> where<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.480> non-revenue

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
start to manage where the non-revenue

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.440 
start to manage where the non-revenue
