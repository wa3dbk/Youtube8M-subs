00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 mai people I'm Steffen began to 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.360
 a new video material in this 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.700
 video provides you it to weapons before what 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.640
 putting up gadgets is there and how to do it 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.350
 So at all it gets a few 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.970
 things but always as a class freely on 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.670
 a few essays too thick for the weapons 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.680
 and the rest you have to buy so seen 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.050
 you deserve to be watched playing 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.150
 ingame cash you just have to pay the cash 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.710
 Pay for next to new pistols 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.260
 rocket launcher to buy 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.030
 Once you have that forever is one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.890
 very nice unlocking principle because 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.479
 I can choose what with the cs 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.710
 does not have to npd in the unlock 

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:42.479
 I'm supposed to play that class again and again 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.159
 the other class can play for the 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.540
 with the money and buy it for the 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:47.549
 Next class just the right one 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.049
 I am good with the class right away 

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:50.549
 so i can do a bit better 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.350
 I am now mainly there to divide 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:55.080
 just work off this path 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.670
 But let's start with the operator 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.400
 the new storm soldiers 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.510
 At the moment he has only storm rifles in the 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.369
 63 the ak m and the g36 c so weapons 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.830
 with higher middle and lower 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.850
 Fire rate as two weeks there is one 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.430
 revolver the point 38 shoots very 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.750
 fast the medi kit is also available again 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.390
 As always, you will work 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.920
 teenager closeness will be cured but now 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.150
 can also keywords dirt to go and 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.010
 be healed so easily 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.170
 There is also something to revive 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.460
 Although the defi or the syringe can 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.920
 one also like in battlefield 4 one 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.930
 a bit of a charge but my eyes 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.680
 even faster than just stopping in 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.260
 bell 4 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.030
 and there is the survival that is 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.610
 still very critical who cares if 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.470
 I'm dying and not critical 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.080
 Sores were not explosions, too 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.909
 no headshot then i can 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.790
 Just revive me 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.200
 itself only once and that is 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.270
 currently a bit criticized 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.940
 but that I should not take out 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.560
 it's funny because they are 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.320
 see that I revived from others 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.850
 I'll do that and not do it myself 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.750
 next class of mechanics so the 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.090
 new pioneer 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.860
 he also like the city of weapons in 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.629
 battlefield 4 pd wst 45 90 or too 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.810
 a uzi so there a bit too 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.280
 variation between the brave two for it 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.950
 there is currently only one and that 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.349
 The 92 fs is a semi-automatic 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.000
 great admits a muffler knows 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.709
 one actually resembles so close to 9 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.440
 as gadgets, there is not much new 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.000
 first we would have the apg normal 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.920
 we know rocket launcher 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.510
 dinger uses it to work like that 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920
 in battlefield 4 that's what I'm called like her 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.380
 once the heli and shoot directly 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.060
 then the thing is looking for your goal and 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.440
 last repair tool works 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.890
 also as always go to the vehicle 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.780
 fix it and make the thing next 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.090
 class the enforcer so the new 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.280
 utilities of the two types of arms, a 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.150
 lmg's currently this is the end 36 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.890
 and two shotguns 870 and the sword 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.370
 of scotland on shotgun had to 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.900
 ending 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.730
 afterwards it must always be reloaded 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.370
 So sometimes it takes longer 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.769
 I have time to get started though 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.010
 but also a bit of power for two 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.110
 the ihk 45c is also quite solid 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.519
 the amok list is back again 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.220
 works as you know it throws you 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.560
 People communicate or they go 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.810
 stop just to me just press the 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.920
 use button and get up soon 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.049
 ammunition 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.180
 then there are the palaces here 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.130
 sign me soon at dragon steve 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.530
 can see the beautiful balls 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.850
 intercept in explosions he will 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.459
 of course not quite as good 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.859
 and then the bleaching cards is 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.470
 Actually c4 comes immediately if it 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.850
 wants to stick to every wall immediately 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.650
 but it works the same way 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.630
 you go and then you can ignite the 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.910
 last class of the professional so the 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.510
 new rick worth once here ne bolt 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.109
 action that's the he 700 and 2 the first 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.970
 the saiga and the ptr are secondary 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.310
 it's up to something else the tech no 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.160
 is a fully automatic melee weapon 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.920
 is definitely for the rick or here 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.660
 Professional great addition to the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.359
 gadgets we have the first step main 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.880
 is little claymore in principle that will 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:07.889
 just glued on and that's pretty small 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.709
 So very inconspicuous and then she does 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:13.500
 of course, then there is the ground camera 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.389
 the spotted opponents 50 meters only after 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.979
 front so in the field of view of the camera 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.720
 not as well as the topjobs in a circle 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.209
 but really only where she looks 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.050
 but there really whole 50 meters long and 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.450
 Then there's the the koi that fade 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.300
 noises and manipulate that 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.819
 enemy radar that means opponent 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.430
 he hears shot noise through the thing 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:37.650
 and he gets stock on the minimap 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.199
 red arrows indicated where actually 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.060
 no player is there are still many 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.879
 things that are available for all classes 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.370
 are first the gas mask which ensures that 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.229
 It is very easy to make the driveway 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.000
 just a gas grenade no longer hurt 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:53.099
 there is a way to do that 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.020
 Can I shoot or run somewhere? 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.509
 I can climb the rope high 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.650
 the zip line that's the way to the edge 

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:59.879
 that means if I'm a little higher 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.550
 I am and want to lower myself 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:05.250
 I can fix the whole thing for a long time 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.259
 shoot down and then attach me and 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.560
 go over and finally it works 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.240
 at the moment also the taser well he needs 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.800
 not so i can see opponents like that 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.169
 they are unable to fight down 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.300
 I can interrogate to everything that goes 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.069
 I can for example hear that 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.879
 where the next opponents are because he yes 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:24.449
 chatting a bit 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:27.419
 because we currently have two grenades the m 67 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.090
 Frak normal free card we know and 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:32.460
 just three gas can be to the just in 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.800
 circumventing people harms them 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.479
 no gas mask on then there's 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.340
 of course also mini weapons so I talk 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.110
 for the melee once baseball bat 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.120
 and baton as the effect is the same 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.949
 a little bit batty and the knife 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.349
 If I still stop the sex there 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.039
 Clown wants only something to the weapons 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.020
 put on 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.569
 how do not differ at all 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.490
 to b4 what is possible except that it 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:56.550
 Still the extended magazine in the area 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.550
 There are accessories to equip 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.029
 a certain number of service saas 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.590
 to have 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:03.779
 and if you have them you can get one 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.060
 unlock category so accessories 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.639
 optics what you want and can then directly 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.310
 there all the essays we are with this 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.229
 buy ingame cash to understand that 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.210
 For example, if I have three stars 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.370
 So I can service for example 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:19.139
 all as they buy theirs the only ones 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.210
 which just wants to have quijote at 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.919
 i have five stars i can get 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.690
 for example all the selling goes 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.060
 then so far had at ten sternen 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.889
 Nevertheless, all the handles can buy and from 

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.680
 what there is such as assaults runs 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.330
 and so on the towers knows you 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.699
 just all closed battlefield 4 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.009
 the effects are also almost the same 

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:38.960
 you can be good or bad now 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:41.849
 Find 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.620
 so that was it with this video 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:45.449
 nice survey i hope i can 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.110
 you help up there would me 

00:06:45.449 --> 00:06:50.300
