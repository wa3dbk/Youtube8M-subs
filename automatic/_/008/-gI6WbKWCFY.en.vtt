00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.520 
so for each bucket of low-nutrient
material<00:02:15.670> such<00:02:16.270> as<00:02:16.450> garden<00:02:16.930> prunings

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
material such as garden prunings

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.980 
material such as garden prunings
you<00:02:18.100> should<00:02:18.340> then<00:02:18.550> add<00:02:18.760> a<00:02:18.790> similar<00:02:19.240> volume<00:02:19.600> of

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
you should then add a similar volume of

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.410 
you should then add a similar volume of
high<00:02:20.260> nutrient<00:02:20.980> irreal<00:02:21.430> such<00:02:22.030> as<00:02:22.210> your

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
high nutrient irreal such as your

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.990 
high nutrient irreal such as your
kitchen<00:02:22.900> scraps<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:24.040> then<00:02:24.100> follow<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.940> with

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
kitchen scraps and then follow that with

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.080 
kitchen scraps and then follow that with
more<00:02:25.480> low<00:02:25.840> nutrient<00:02:26.440> stuff<00:02:26.770> such<00:02:27.460> as<00:02:27.490> shredded

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
more low nutrient stuff such as shredded

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.830 
more low nutrient stuff such as shredded
paper<00:02:28.450> or<00:02:28.840> cardboard<00:02:29.730> it's<00:02:30.730> also<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.390> good<00:02:31.720> idea

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
paper or cardboard it's also a good idea

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.470 
paper or cardboard it's also a good idea
to<00:02:32.230> add<00:02:32.830> a<00:02:32.860> few<00:02:33.250> handfuls<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.940> well<00:02:34.210> rotted

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
to add a few handfuls of well rotted

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.840 
to add a few handfuls of well rotted
chicken<00:02:35.080> or<00:02:35.260> cow<00:02:35.500> manure<00:02:35.770> every<00:02:36.430> couple<00:02:36.790> of

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
chicken or cow manure every couple of

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.290 
chicken or cow manure every couple of
weeks<00:02:39.120> okay

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
weeks okay

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.520 
weeks okay
Angus<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.720> looks<00:02:40.840> like<00:02:40.990> you're<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.170> barrel

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
Angus it looks like you're the barrel

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.920 
Angus it looks like you're the barrel
boy<00:02:41.710> today<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.490> why<00:02:42.940> do<00:02:43.000> we<00:02:43.270> need<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.540> spin<00:02:43.780> the

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
boy today so why do we need to spin the

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.510 
boy today so why do we need to spin the
fabulous<00:02:44.290> wheel<00:02:44.500> of<00:02:44.590> compost<00:02:44.950> well<00:02:45.430> as<00:02:45.490> a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
fabulous wheel of compost well as a

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.520 
fabulous wheel of compost well as a
couple<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.880> reasons<00:02:46.300> firstly<00:02:46.870> we<00:02:47.170> need<00:02:47.350> to

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
couple of reasons firstly we need to

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.010 
couple of reasons firstly we need to
make<00:02:47.740> our<00:02:47.980> magic<00:02:48.550> compost<00:02:49.090> pudding<00:02:49.870> and

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
make our magic compost pudding and

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.750 
make our magic compost pudding and
really<00:02:50.440> mix<00:02:50.620> all<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:51.010> ingredients<00:02:51.040> together

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
really mix all the ingredients together

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.690 
really mix all the ingredients together
and<00:02:52.410> secondly<00:02:53.410> we<00:02:53.620> need<00:02:53.830> lots<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.430> oxygen

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
and secondly we need lots of oxygen

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.720 
and secondly we need lots of oxygen
there<00:02:55.360> because<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.290> good<00:02:56.590> microbes<00:02:56.890> are<00:02:57.520> dual

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
there because the good microbes are dual

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.200 
there because the good microbes are dual
of<00:02:57.970> composting<00:02:58.690> need<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.440> breathe<00:02:59.860> so<00:03:00.760> it's

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
of composting need to breathe so it's

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.940 
of composting need to breathe so it's
really<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.600> matter<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.900> just<00:03:02.170> kind<00:03:02.560> of<00:03:02.620> getting

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
really a matter of just kind of getting

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.830 
really a matter of just kind of getting
in<00:03:03.070> there<00:03:03.250> and<00:03:03.370> really<00:03:03.610> mixing<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.090> well<00:03:04.270> and

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
in there and really mixing it well and

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.540 
in there and really mixing it well and
now<00:03:04.960> is<00:03:05.110> there<00:03:05.260> an<00:03:05.320> art<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.800> doing<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.220> or<00:03:06.370> do<00:03:06.490> I

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
now is there an art to doing it or do I

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.700 
now is there an art to doing it or do I
just<00:03:06.820> spin<00:03:07.150> it<00:03:07.270> yeah<00:03:07.990> actually<00:03:08.260> the<00:03:08.560> reason

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
just spin it yeah actually the reason

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.970 
just spin it yeah actually the reason
are<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:09.850> we<00:03:10.360> need<00:03:10.570> to<00:03:10.750> sort<00:03:11.110> of<00:03:11.140> mix<00:03:11.709> it

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
are to it so we need to sort of mix it

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.660 
are to it so we need to sort of mix it
both<00:03:12.340> ways<00:03:13.000> so<00:03:13.930> that<00:03:13.959> you<00:03:14.230> get<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.950> really

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
both ways so that you get a really

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.850 
both ways so that you get a really
thorough<00:03:16.270> mixing<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:16.900> if<00:03:16.990> we<00:03:17.110> do<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.320> fairly

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
thorough mixing and if we do it fairly

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.910 
thorough mixing and if we do it fairly
slowly<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:19.120> composter<00:03:19.810> actually<00:03:20.200> falls<00:03:20.530> down

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
slowly the composter actually falls down

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.850 
slowly the composter actually falls down
and<00:03:21.190> helps<00:03:21.459> to<00:03:21.670> mix<00:03:22.000> it<00:03:22.209> really<00:03:23.170> thoroughly

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.280 

so<00:03:28.850> what<00:03:28.970> about<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.240> worm<00:03:29.420> farm<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:29.990> compost

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
so what about the worm farm and compost

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.770 
so what about the worm farm and compost
conditioner<00:03:30.710> Wow<00:03:31.310> well<00:03:31.640> that<00:03:31.850> is<00:03:32.060> what<00:03:32.630> you

garden straight away or do I have to

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.580 
garden straight away or do I have to
wait<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:04.580> basically<00:04:05.390> needs<00:04:05.690> about<00:04:06.050> six<00:04:06.470> weeks

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
wait it basically needs about six weeks

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.370 
wait it basically needs about six weeks
from<00:04:07.100> the<00:04:07.250> last<00:04:07.550> time<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.330> add<00:04:08.480> some<00:04:08.780> material

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
from the last time you add some material

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.100 
from the last time you add some material
you<00:04:10.070> need<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.520> just<00:04:10.760> keep<00:04:11.090> turning<00:04:11.750> the

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
you need to just keep turning the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.760 
you need to just keep turning the
tumbler<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:13.330> that<00:04:14.330> fully<00:04:14.870> matures<00:04:15.470> the

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
tumbler and that fully matures the

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.190 
tumbler and that fully matures the
compost<00:04:16.280> so<00:04:17.090> it's<00:04:17.450> really<00:04:17.810> ready<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.350> roll<00:04:18.709> and

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
at that point you up up the lead and

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.850 
at that point you up up the lead and
you're<00:04:23.150> able<00:04:23.300> to<00:04:23.450> extract<00:04:23.900> the<00:04:24.110> compost<00:04:24.590> and
