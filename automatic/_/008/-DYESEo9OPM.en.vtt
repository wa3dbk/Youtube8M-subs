00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.189
 the movie nonsense insider not so long ago we have on 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:06.410
 The channel already had a review of Chinese 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:09.380
 Smartphone with inappropriate for Russian 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.600
 the viewer's name is apa but the Chinese were not 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.240
 would be so Chinese if they did not try 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.730
 to forge everything that they see and 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.650
 It happened to the Chinese brand of a very 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.140
 it looks like deft chinese 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.740
 businessmen inspired by success opa 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.230
 west 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.060
 have launched their smartphone with more 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.779
 more fun for the Russian buyer 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.809
 name meet for phablet max 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.910
 Immediately dot everything and wait 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.670
 from this Chinese miracle of technology much 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.550
 not necessary since the price is phablet max 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.039
 hovers around 200 bucks and in this 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.050
 video we will try to figure out whether 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:47.300
 Chinese industry to offer 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.480
 the buyer for this so modest money 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:55.690
 at least something sensible let's go 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.690
 still at checkout 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.710
 so let's get started first take a look at 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.929
 package and delivery set for 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.850
 black cardboard box is 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:07.189
 actually the smartphone itself is charging 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.860
 device headphone cable micro usb 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:11.570
 which especially pleased the extra 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 back cover in the manner of 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.590
 samsung cover 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.110
 flip cover as for appearance 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.890
 smartphone it can be confused with 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.380
 laptop 2 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.740
 however, the similarity is quite deceptive 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.020
 taking a hand west immediately realize that with 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.360
 galaxy laptop he has in common 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.820
 only dimensions mda go not all 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.790
 the parameters match zopo and a bit 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.490
 heavier thicker and wider than the y-2 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.909
 such dimensions is a kind of reckoning 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.219
 behind a huge screen with a diagonal of 5.7 inches 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.259
 for comparison, the laptop screen 2 has 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.270
 diagonal is 5 and a half inches now 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.939
 A few words about the assembly of the hole for the device for 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.549
 200 bucks just fine and all the details 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.530
 tight-fitting gap play and other 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.479
 defects we could not be detected as 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.899
 We did not try for the assembly and five with 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.939
 plus 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.520
 I honestly did not expect such from 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.679
 cheap chinese smartphone which we 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.259
 took only to stupidly neighing 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.939
 As for the materials of the case, then here 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.019
 everything is pretty obvious everywhere 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:11.239
 glossy plastic 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.280
 back cover is removable but in order to 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.830
 you will have to attach it a little 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.690
 effort by the way again looking back on 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.690
 On y-2, I can say that the back cover 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.069
 zopo looks somehow safer than that 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.470
 thicker and tougher 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.390
 under the hood there is a battery for two s 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.030
 half a thousand milliampere hours what on 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.920
 600 milliampere hours less than 02 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.690
 With such a battery, zopo is capable 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.760
 work the whole working day on average 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.500
 by load mode for an hour 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.329
 video playback full hd on 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.329
 maximum brightness smartphone 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.220
 spent as much as 20 percent off 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.590
 full battery charge 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.660
 how are you ill besides the battery under 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.849
 the cover can be found two slots under the sim 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.069
 micro-sd card and slot 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.920
 above is the 8-megapixel module 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.200
 cameras he by the way bulges out considerably 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.000
 enclosures and will definitely be exposed 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.280
 various physical damage 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.099
 the word sensor camera has a resolution of 8 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.340
 megapixels but thanks to interpolation 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.590
 able to issue images with resolution 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.720
 12.6 megapixel special quality 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.120
 photos taken for and not 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.560
 the picture is soapy and not very different 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.030
 sharp and sometimes observed 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.609
 minor peresvet 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.980
 in general, get the camera to goiter and 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:24.380
 acceptable photo quality 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.019
 but this will require even and not 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.670
 too bright daylight right 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.280
 butt tooth and busy with adjustment buttons 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.310
 volume and lock button 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.049
 pour the end is completely empty the bottom of the microphone 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.239
 and micro usb connector 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.190
 on top of you nothing but no minijack 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.299
 almost the entire front of the smartphone 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:47.000
 occupies a screen with a diagonal of 5.7 inches 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:49.220
 it has a resolution of 720p and density 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.709
 pixels two hundred and fifty seven pieces on 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:53.590
 inch if not peer then separate 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.579
 pixel and in general how are you not visible 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.859
 the manufacturer claims that the screen 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.200
 made by ips technology 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:02.599
 but in practice the viewing angle and just 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.849
 terrible color rendition 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:07.810
 doubt that the matrix is made 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:10.060
 on this technology screen colors are whitish 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.370
 completely expressionless and at an angle 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.770
 the situation is aggravated by the image 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.680
 begins to fade and some colors and 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.090
 altogether distorted in the general screen phablet 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.130
 max is just dark 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.080
 The next drawback is that simpletons 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.300
 striking this strange 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.830
 the location of the control buttons they 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.410
 transferred to the operating interface 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.540
 systems and the home button is duplicated 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.940
 mechanical button below the screen is 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.310
 the decision is not logical and at least us 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.260
 it's not clear why the manufacturer 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.479
 did not use empty space on the sides 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.060
 from the mechanical home button remains 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.220
 mystery oh well to finish with 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.680
 the appearance is that the screen is closed 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.780
 protective glass which is very good for 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.970
 state employee located above the screen 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.610
 front camera and sensor set 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.010
 Now for the most interesting and 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:59.410
 just see how to behave 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.990
 in real life it works based on 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.580
 quad processor mtk and all 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.590
 his four cores work on frequency 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.720
 1.3 gigahertz 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.090
 is responsible for processing graphics 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.780
 not bad and you can say modern 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:16.960
 video accelerator sgx544 smartphone is equipped with 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.820
 one gigabyte of RAM and 16 gigabytes 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.620
 internal memory on paper 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.930
 characteristics look very even 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.419
 not bad but what you really ask 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.490
 well let's look like 200 bucks and 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.560
 budget chinese smartphone myself 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.770
 will lead in real work right away 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.380
 I note that zopo is running 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.630
 android 4 1 2 and the manufacturer did not 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.550
 significantly modify the standard 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.280
 system interface and by the way for that to him 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.020
 a big separate thank you difference from 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.060
 pure android can only be found in 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.550
 The menu settings menu is transparent and 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.380
 it looks even unusual as well 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.600
 small changes occurred in the blind 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.639
 Notifications more precisely the manufacturer is a bit 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.139
 changed icons toggle off interface 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.419
 very smart work tables 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:59.919
 turn over without lags and friezes and 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.720
 In general, the smartphone works very much 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.880
 responsive and smoothly in itself 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.190
 amazing for chinese noname 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.710
 Now let's go to the tests and start by 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.410
 traditions with antutu phablet max issued 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.990
 quite a decent result in almost 12 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:15.639
 thousand points for comparing samsung galaxy 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.610
 nexus gains around six s 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.250
 half a thousand points and worth 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.960
 by the way is much more expensive geekbench 2 test 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.319
 zopo passes with a decent result 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.449
 just over a thousand 400 points for 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:30.689
 Help for example the same iphone 5 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.550
 in this test is gaining 1700 points now 

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:34.650
 I propose to see how the smartphone leads 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.659
 yourself in games dead trigger goes on 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.789
 maximum settings just to cheer 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:41.099
 no hint of brakes or any 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.960
 glitches but it is more likely to affect 

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.860
 optimized games and even under 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.900
 microwave 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.849
 than the computing power of the device 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.409
 after dead trigger we decided to run 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.819
 real racing 3 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.969
 the game comes with maximum settings 

00:06:50.819 --> 00:06:56.099
 however , not as cheerful as dead trigger 

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:58.889
 there is still a slight shortage 

00:06:56.099 --> 00:07:01.080
 fps but despite this must notice 

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:03.150
 what to play on such a big screen one 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.090
 pleasure but if of course to drop 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.490
 no color reproduction per se in 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.949
 total for 200 bucks the buyer gets 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.719
 quite a good smartphone yes of course 

00:07:10.949 --> 00:07:13.860
 He has a number of drawbacks such as 

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:16.319
 for example a strange combination 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:19.529
 Navigation buttons and glare-catching screen 

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:22.289
 but all these minuses are capable in one fell swoop 

00:07:19.529 --> 00:07:24.599
 cross out the price of $ 200 for these 

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:27.330
 small money you get big and 

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.400
 smart enough smartphones while he 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:32.250
 quite a quality build and has 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:35.400
 rich bundle what do you think 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:37.139
 is phablet worth max their money 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.879
 you can leave the answers as always in 

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:40.770
 comments under this video and not 

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:42.990
 forget to go to our cool 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.949
 social points and subscribe to new 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.949
 video bye bye
