 hello I'm Isabella and in this tutorial I 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.420
 I'm going to teach how to make a little machine 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:22.720
 of candy or chewing gum is very easy 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:25.540
 the materials are a size pot 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.349
 that you want a cooler or a 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:35.140
 fish tank in my case I got only one 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:39.640
 just a cooler a dish is a dish a 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.610
 small jeweler or wooden buttons paper 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.530
 to wrap the pattern that you 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.270
 they like what it was with what a 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.870
 little cat 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.470
 one meter of ribbon 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:59.100
 in this case I chose this pattern 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.100
 but is it that you like scissors 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.270
 and a bag of chewing gum 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.870
 let's start now with your gun 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.870
 preheated 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.470
 allows a second 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:24.479
 let's turn the flower pot over head 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.740
 we are going to put in this part silicon for 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.880
 I tell them that with their 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:32.360
 with your preheated gun 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.140
 we only occupy a bar in any case 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.460
 we just want to make a one bar 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.460
 - a bar 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.200
 we stick the cooler or the fish tank over 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.150
 let's lose 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.180
 of belly gadita 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.160
 already wrapped his little dish 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:08.490
 we put the same hole together with 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:11.370
 silicon this I stuck it because it can be 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.310
 with tape with liquid silicone with what 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.340
 you want 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:20.150
 let's open the sweet turn 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:25.030
 not because it's very specific but I go to 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.030
 step then we put here your 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.980

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.980
 we put the cover 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.120
 I bought a meter but you can cut it 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.120
 by zizou 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:01.530
 your flowerpot is thinner 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:04.650
 you cut a little bit 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:08.360
 we make a nice 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.360
