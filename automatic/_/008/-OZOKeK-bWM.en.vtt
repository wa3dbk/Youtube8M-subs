00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.620
 while I was going with my cousin to do a 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.060

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:25.710

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.830
 a motorcycle turned off I did n't understand the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.160
 because I came home squeezing it 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.790
 because I had thought of a seizure 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.500
 because pulling the rope was very hard 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:56.130
