00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.740 
mm-hmm yeah my light got some stars of
their<00:03:29.230> from<00:03:29.469> the<00:03:29.590> previous<00:03:30.069> resident<00:03:30.909> they

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
their from the previous resident they

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.199 
their from the previous resident they
used<00:03:31.930> double-sided<00:03:32.290> tape<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.340> put<00:03:33.819> those<00:03:34.000> up

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
used double-sided tape to put those up

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.839 
used double-sided tape to put those up
so<00:03:34.709> that's<00:03:35.709> why<00:03:35.950> I<00:03:35.980> keep<00:03:36.400> them<00:03:36.489> off<00:03:36.640> there

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
so that's why I keep them off there

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.160 
so that's why I keep them off there
because<00:03:37.030> we<00:03:37.120> just<00:03:37.359> leave<00:03:37.540> residue<00:03:37.959> off<00:03:40.170> all

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
because we just leave residue off all

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.829 
because we just leave residue off all
right<00:03:41.319> the<00:03:41.530> next<00:03:41.680> time
