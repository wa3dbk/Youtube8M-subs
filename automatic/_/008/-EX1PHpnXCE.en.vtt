element<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:57.680> the<00:03:57.769> game<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.370> think<00:03:58.790> should<00:03:59.389> have

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
element of the game I think should have

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.809 
element of the game I think should have
been<00:03:59.569> just<00:04:00.019> a<00:04:00.200> visual<00:04:00.709> novel<00:04:01.010> like<00:04:01.430> keep<00:04:01.670> the

been just a visual novel like keep the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.910 
been just a visual novel like keep the
choice<00:04:02.150> system<00:04:02.450> of<00:04:02.989> whether<00:04:03.170> you<00:04:03.350> want<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.650> go

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
choice system of whether you want to go

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.910 
choice system of whether you want to go
one<00:04:04.489> way<00:04:04.700> or<00:04:04.850> another<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.500> make<00:04:06.500> it<00:04:06.620> more<00:04:06.799> like

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
one way or another and make it more like

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.199 
one way or another and make it more like
Phoenix<00:04:07.280> right<00:04:07.519> I<00:04:07.549> guess<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:07.880> could<00:04:08.000> say<00:04:08.180> I

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
Phoenix right I guess you could say I

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.660 
Phoenix right I guess you could say I
mean<00:04:08.389> you<00:04:08.750> take<00:04:08.959> the<00:04:09.109> like<00:04:09.889> not<00:04:10.040> investigative

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
mean you take the like not investigative

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.620 
mean you take the like not investigative
or<00:04:10.760> anything<00:04:10.940> like<00:04:11.120> that<00:04:11.180> but<00:04:11.329> you<00:04:11.420> know<00:04:11.510> what

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
or anything like that but you know what

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.940 
or anything like that but you know what
I<00:04:11.660> mean<00:04:11.810> basically<00:04:11.989> make<00:04:12.350> it<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.500> visual<00:04:12.680> novel

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
I mean basically make it a visual novel

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.340 
I mean basically make it a visual novel
where<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.340> can<00:04:13.600> explore<00:04:14.600> the<00:04:14.870> world<00:04:15.079> and

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
where you can explore the world and

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:17.379 
where you can explore the world and
choose<00:04:15.709> where<00:04:15.980> you<00:04:16.100> choose<00:04:16.910> what<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.180> want<00:04:17.329> to

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
choose where you choose what you want to

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.690 
choose where you choose what you want to
do<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:17.870> then<00:04:18.289> make<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.680> block<00:04:18.950> puzzles<00:04:19.400> of

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
do and then make the block puzzles of

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.819 
do and then make the block puzzles of
the<00:04:19.910> game<00:04:20.090> its<00:04:20.510> own<00:04:20.810> thing<00:04:21.200> like<00:04:21.440> it<00:04:21.620> feels

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:21.829 
the game its own thing like it feels

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:24.129 
the game its own thing like it feels
like<00:04:21.950> it's<00:04:22.070> two<00:04:22.669> separate<00:04:23.210> games<00:04:23.419> trying<00:04:24.050> to

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
like it's two separate games trying to

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.990 
like it's two separate games trying to
be<00:04:24.350> one<00:04:24.680> thing<00:04:25.039> and<00:04:25.310> it<00:04:25.370> honestly<00:04:25.580> feels

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
be one thing and it honestly feels

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.310 
be one thing and it honestly feels
really<00:04:26.450> clunky

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
really clunky

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.280 
really clunky
because<00:04:27.980> when<00:04:28.640> I<00:04:28.670> was<00:04:28.910> invested<00:04:29.720> in<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:29.900> story

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
because when I was invested in the story

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.130 
because when I was invested in the story
of<00:04:30.620> Catherine<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.640> felt<00:04:32.210> like<00:04:32.390> my<00:04:32.570> investment

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
of Catherine I felt like my investment

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.080 
of Catherine I felt like my investment
was<00:04:33.290> ripped<00:04:33.800> out<00:04:34.010> of<00:04:34.070> me<00:04:34.310> when<00:04:34.430> I<00:04:34.490> switched

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
was ripped out of me when I switched

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.760 
was ripped out of me when I switched
over<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.780> block<00:04:35.990> puzzles<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.650> it

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
over to the block puzzles and it

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.520 
over to the block puzzles and it
honestly<00:04:36.920> felt<00:04:37.490> really<00:04:38.090> really<00:04:38.570> mishmash<00:04:38.960> and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
honestly felt really really mishmash and

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.830 
honestly felt really really mishmash and
I<00:04:39.650> honestly<00:04:39.980> didn't<00:04:40.370> like<00:04:40.520> that<00:04:40.730> but<00:04:41.390> I<00:04:41.600> guess

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
I honestly didn't like that but I guess

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.630 
I honestly didn't like that but I guess
that's<00:04:41.960> sort<00:04:42.260> of<00:04:42.320> a<00:04:42.410> nitpick<00:04:42.830> on<00:04:43.010> my<00:04:43.310> part

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
that's sort of a nitpick on my part

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.880 
that's sort of a nitpick on my part
overall<00:04:44.150> and<00:04:44.360> objectively<00:04:44.900> I<00:04:45.320> think

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:45.890 
overall and objectively I think

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.410 
overall and objectively I think
Catherine<00:04:46.280> is<00:04:46.370> a<00:04:46.400> pretty<00:04:46.610> decent<00:04:46.820> game<00:04:47.210> it's

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
Catherine is a pretty decent game it's

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.300 
Catherine is a pretty decent game it's
got<00:04:47.630> great<00:04:47.900> visuals<00:04:48.380> it's<00:04:48.620> got<00:04:48.770> great<00:04:49.010> music

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
got great visuals it's got great music

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.270 
got great visuals it's got great music
and<00:04:49.790> one<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.660> the<00:04:50.720> more<00:04:51.080> compelling<00:04:51.500> stories

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
and one of the more compelling stories

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.220 
and one of the more compelling stories
I've<00:04:52.460> seen<00:04:52.760> in<00:04:52.910> video<00:04:53.150> games<00:04:53.360> in<00:04:53.510> a<00:04:53.600> long<00:04:53.870> time

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
I've seen in video games in a long time

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.530 
I've seen in video games in a long time
and<00:04:54.650> it<00:04:55.610> pretty<00:04:55.850> much<00:04:55.970> just<00:04:56.030> has<00:04:56.210> block

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
and it pretty much just has block

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.360 
and it pretty much just has block
puzzles<00:04:56.930> thrown<00:04:57.140> in<00:04:57.320> in<00:04:57.590> my<00:04:57.800> opinion<00:04:57.920> that's

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
puzzles thrown in in my opinion that's

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.450 
puzzles thrown in in my opinion that's
enough<00:04:58.640> for<00:04:58.760> me<00:04:58.850> to<00:04:58.940> say<00:04:59.090> give<00:04:59.270> it<00:04:59.330> a<00:04:59.420> shot
