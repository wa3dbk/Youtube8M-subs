 as soon as the green android indicates 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.180
 that all information is being erased 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.880
 of our device that is already 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.500
 leaving in factory values ​​I'm going to 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.970
 wait for it to finish and start the 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.530
 device already to be able to give 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.530
 finished this tutorial 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.060
 here as the boot device 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.410
 you can see the assistant appears 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.120
 configuration which means that 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.340
 the device is already at values ​​of 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.080
 factory and good as this would be all 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.319
