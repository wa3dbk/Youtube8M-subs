00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.970
 Hello my name is Michael 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.030
 Another review on the Chinese Lego in this 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.750
 time we will consider the set 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.969
 ninja turtles 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.309
 new entry is written here but on 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.379
 this time it will not brick but who 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.300
 the manufacturer is not written here because 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.230
 that perhaps he was ashamed to confess and 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.160
 on the package 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.769
 arte commander 79 104 and in principle 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.260
 there is no more data on the package 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.439
 the designer promises that there will be 3 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.180
 minifigures i.e. splinter shredder and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:39.480
 leonardo but is everything as beautiful as on 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.829
 picture now we look here there 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.629
 a sticker which says that 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.700
 made of high quality 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.100
 plastics let's see so yo then 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:52.110
 have inside inside we have instruction 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 assembly also we have here are two 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:01.109
 bag with mini figures and already seen 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:04.409
 that it is clear that it is just terrible yet 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:09.330
 there is another sachet and not even 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.430
 unpacking without unpacking the wrapper 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.610
 You can see the quality of the parts 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:17.310
 much worse than oleg of course and even 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.250
 worse than brick and in its 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.689
 I don’t even have such a quality brick 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.259
 closer than a colleague here in this so 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.380
 we also had cards 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:36.000
 apparently for the game so let's open 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.490
 let's see it here we have cards and here 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.860
 we have 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:49.380
 for some reason, so here you can see Raphael Schröder and 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.290
 Michelangelo can be like bookmarks 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.970
 use in principle is not so bad 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.690
 let's 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.410
 we unpack packages the first quality 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.560
 plastic 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.280
 awful nothing ok keeps everything 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.940
 falls off 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.740
 second all the details are divided into 3 colors i 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.630
 I think it's a bit strange considering 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.820
 that the picture is so colorful and in 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.990
 principle 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:16.640
 3 pictures look at the picture completely not 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.240
 coincides with what is inside that is 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.530
 we see that this is generally a complete deception 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.690
 quality plastic is bad everywhere 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.050
 burrs in minifigures 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.560
 arms don't move arms absolutely not 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.450
 corresponds to the one that should be 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.060
 But the worst thing is that they see 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.420
 done with the splinter what's the head 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.500
 dogs for some reason polex why u 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.080
 him has small legs 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.340
 gnome let's gather everything else i 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.959
 thought on this build completely 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.770
 stop now because I'm just 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.550
 with difficulty in this thing the court stuffed very 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.130
 poor quality 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.540
 that's why the platform is green patina 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.519
 why green why not 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.459
 make brown or why not 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.250
 there were instructions to do in the instructions 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.470
 make green 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.900
 that is why they do not do it like this 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.390
 as bad as I thought even this thing 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.580
 moves generally i fell asleep wrong 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:19.880
 one detail and and hike it all because 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:23.420
 that I no longer pull this end all i 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.940
 assembled get set I do not know what is not 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.320
 they wanted to say at all in the instructions 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.120
 here really is actually on 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:36.650
 in fact his fingers hurt terribly 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.000
 did about an hour terribly quality about what 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.680
 they thought I hardly know 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.070
 a four year old child can do it 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.260
 collect this is just the best league of which i 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.600
 saw here in general the spirit of the shredder 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.880
 Here is the Frederm instructions here is shorter 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.730
 worth Leonardo why it was impossible 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.620
 draw rafael and or put here 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.920
 Leonardo comin why is rafael here 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.460
 why does he have red dots on his face 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.040
 in short 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.990
 rafael stands somewhere here stands wider 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.860
 long shadra but there is Pauline cake with 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:07.910
 kicking hobbits 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:12.220
 also so logical and shorter so flies 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.220
 falls and just fuck it all
