00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:19.410
 once and I almost forgot it out of here 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:19.410
 evil style well I finished 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.560
 this is incredible 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.600
 He stayed at my house under the pretext of 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.160
 drive out evil spirits but in 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.500
 actually I just wanted a roof to 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.500
 sleep and eat and that's not all 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.970
 when he was in the village he spent 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:47.879
 courting the young girls here we are 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.879
 with crying do not resist and resist 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:01:02.130
 reputable follow all 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.130
 healthy women although see what it looks like 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.250
 put tied that way we want that 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:10.800
 define although I look with barbarities not 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.720
 It's very common in the truth, but the 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.950
 monk I look that he has never had so much 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.350
 changuito popularity that's not true 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.450
 so you're wrong if you think 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.340
 I do not have popularity but I do not 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.960
 I referred to that is the treatment that they are 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.869
 giving is unfair that I am tied up without 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.610
 ask what do you mean by that then 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.619
 I mean, this is the first time 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.650
 who stepped on this village and I do not know 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.650
 situation 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.280
 we do not want to hear lies that you do not 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.799
 tired of saying so much nonsense are you the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.479
 only one who behaves hypocritically 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.149
 I have told the truth that they want more than 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.579
 do yesterday do you behave yourself in a way 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:59.939
 and today from another I did not meet a monk like 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:02.340
 you do not care we throw the rivers what is 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.530
 what happens said between yesterday and 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.990
 today I change and that has to do with 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.780
 this still because yesterday and today also and 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.819
 what's been with us guys 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:17.370
 yes then and finally I thought that never 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.170
 they would understand if what they say is 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.670
 I really want to be a subject that is 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.670
 impersonating me crazy 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.440
 with you famous monk I look at you 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.660
 that's right and let's say monk I look at what 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.900
 you owe your visit in a humble village like 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.940
 that of us, they will see during my 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.590
 I passed by the outskirts of this 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.030
 village and I sensed an energy 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.030
 incredibly malignant 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.940
 How shrewd are you, what an admirable monk? 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.800
 He looked at me and surprised me that he had perceived 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.709
 the energy of a monster from the 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.330
 outside the village because we want to follow me 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.130
 to examine that threat as soon as possible 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.560
 how strange I think I've seen him fat 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.480
 for a few moments here but what 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.480
 things you say is impossible 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.360
 as they hear it, surely someone is 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.690
 using my name to impersonate 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.450
 my 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.790
 and please stop seeing me that way 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.600
 if you think about it carefully is the 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.480
 more logical explanation but is that it does not 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.060
 I believe and what is it that someone wins 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.780
 pretending to be the truth, I 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.460
 would transform into another person well team 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.680
 so first of all you have to 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.800
 investigate because they waste time in 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.530
 nonsense better throw it into the river not 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.630
 wait a moment please understand 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:55.920
 how they feel but he says he does not 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.740
 did so it would be better to host a 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:07.010
 Once the truth is discovered, do what 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:07.010
 who want but please really 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:17.120
 it's hard to check 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:20.359
 I am tired of your discussions answer 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:24.160
 if you assure that wall that was the 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.160
 guilty I demand hard evidence 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.840
 I knew they lived that 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.409
 that's why we will show you these are the 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.409
 tests 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:39.409
 good 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:55.880
 I already understand that was how it happened and 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.370
 deciphered the mystery 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.270
 but with that rope around his 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.290
 body will lose its conviction 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.390
 discharge 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.390
 the interior decree and more at home 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.580
 we are in a hurry the imposter must be in 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.580
 some nearby village 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:24.149
 the person who is being passed 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.589
 for you is beautiful like me and knows me 

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:27.380
 also that you can invite me to the 

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:31.690
 perfection 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.690
 those leaves reveal their identity 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:45.670
 / monk looked as if at the bottom of this 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.770
 cave there is a small offering there lives 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:50.280
 a monstrous raccoon is really 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.280
 abominable 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.170
 good if it is a raccoon will be 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:58.150
 easy would not cause us problems and only 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.770
 it will feed on wild animals but 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.050
 lately he has given to attack 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.090
 our houses and fields of cultivation you 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.410
 is a recognized monk I suppose not 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.650
 he is at no risk 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:11.370
 even so be very cautious of course can 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.370
 trust me 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:20.849
 ma pachito 123 for all my friends 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.840
 today is the offering 

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:31.539
 that you have come to reassure 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:35.020
 he is also a raccoon 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.020
 you are a demon 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.300
 can be solved here to look for the hand 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.569
 and canada 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.129
 how good you are a raccoon I am a 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:50.770
 weasel 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:53.950
 so your appearance is that of a 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:56.170
 raccoon that activates as many 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.410
 although I really like to eat the 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:58.410
 raccoons 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:08.110
 confess you are really human and for 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:10.830
 you play another kind of creature 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.830
 he discovered me 

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:17.190
 how dare my name is normally 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:21.569
 I do not usually say this but I'm a monk 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:23.719
 famous and brave I watch co 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:26.399
 you are the one who absorbs with his black hole 

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:29.509
 so if I will not hurt you if you 

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:29.509
 sorry with me 

00:07:31.429 --> 00:07:36.499
 to make me the fattest weasel
