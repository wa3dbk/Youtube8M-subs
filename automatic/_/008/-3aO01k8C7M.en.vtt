00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
coming along to the side here I think

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.480 
coming along to the side here I think
maybe<00:05:18.130> a<00:05:18.220> delivery<00:05:18.610> boy<00:05:18.639> or<00:05:18.940> somebody<00:05:19.450> caught

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
maybe a delivery boy or somebody caught

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.600 
maybe a delivery boy or somebody caught
the<00:05:21.490> door<00:05:21.760> with<00:05:21.910> their<00:05:22.060> pedal<00:05:22.389> and<00:05:23.460> then<00:05:24.460> I

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
the door with their pedal and then I

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.420 
the door with their pedal and then I
think<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:24.940> postman<00:05:25.450> did<00:05:25.630> this<00:05:25.810> one<00:05:26.050> I<00:05:26.430> think

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
think the postman did this one I think

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.710 
think the postman did this one I think
you<00:05:27.639> might<00:05:27.789> have<00:05:27.910> caught<00:05:28.090> that<00:05:28.240> with<00:05:28.360> this<00:05:28.510> bag

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
you might have caught that with this bag

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.650 
you might have caught that with this bag
or<00:05:28.930> something<00:05:29.110> just<00:05:29.889> there

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
or something just there

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.700 
or something just there
so<00:05:32.350> I<00:05:32.620> mean<00:05:32.770> for<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:34.660> year<00:05:34.870> of<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.050> car<00:05:35.350> for

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
so I mean for the year of the car for

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.640 
so I mean for the year of the car for
how<00:05:35.830> old<00:05:35.860> it<00:05:36.130> is<00:05:36.630> eight<00:05:37.630> year<00:05:37.930> old<00:05:38.080> car<00:05:38.350> I<00:05:38.380> think

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:38.650 
how old it is eight year old car I think

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.100
