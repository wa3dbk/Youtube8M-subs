00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.440

 he is the laser is the boto other we do not 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.730
 to freeze what put a 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.890
 business here so get the various 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:17.490
 now it's too late now was not the time 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:20.040
 to do it in a good college where 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.860
 came to produce a south reached 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.090
 produce a worker reached 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.090
 to produce 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:43.740

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:47.250
 door to door voice down here that 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:49.710
 You need to add 29 more here too. 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.400
 is more protected because I know that 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.400
 they want to know 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.060
 and I think I'm going to make laws here 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:06.140
 back here too, there's no money 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:09.050
 it is disputed that it has resources to 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:17.480
 so this is it 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:25.670

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:29.630

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:32.680
 The time we win your country is a 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.680
 time to buy time 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.990
 I thought of us here or else 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:47.930
 they will reinforce us here in the hard face 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.400
 who spent a lot of time debating the guy 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.010
 How do I have the onion that guy? 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:57.640

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.060
 There are no others, we all have one esac. 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:11.330
 of snow 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:13.729
 where is the one in which the button sebok to 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.169
 safety galley that we have and let's 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:21.680
 freezing the business here right? 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:24.560
 even with reinforcement I want to take risks 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.910
 there think that on top of not 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:33.220
 patience that does not have to be a 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:33.220
 highlight in business 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:44.430
 is the tropic change right guy puts so 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.360
 stay away, right? 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.000
 It's good that it does not help anyone freeze the 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:56.070
 Your good morning, let's see my friend. 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.030

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.860
 ostentation 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.950
 She's going to play here or the second one here. 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.220
 under the stained skin a second 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.220
 onion 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:12.850
 I thought I did not need it but I think 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.850
 what needed 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:22.210
 we have seen it does that clean 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:29.819
 I'll do the language with low 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:29.819
 safe here so I marked 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:44.100
 and went and went legal defense 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:45.330
 we won now business is the plan here 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.200
 for the front is to have a better 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.120
 result 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.040
 So, we did not care. 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:07:02.570
 generation ahead on this one using it has 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:07:05.850
