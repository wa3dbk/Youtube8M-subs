00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
life so this will be customized a little

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.139 
life so this will be customized a little
bit<00:00:44.420> to<00:00:47.360> to<00:00:48.360> an<00:00:48.480> actual<00:00:49.129> actually<00:00:50.129> more<00:00:50.700> common

53-foot trailer I'll probably end up

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.010 
53-foot trailer I'll probably end up
cutting<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.079> up<00:00:55.170> stretching<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.949> out<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:57.020> little

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
cutting it up stretching it out a little

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.139 
cutting it up stretching it out a little
bit<00:00:58.730> once<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.879> start<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.270> that

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
bit once I start on that

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.160 
bit once I start on that
that's<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.799> AMT<00:01:04.799> Kenmore<00:01:05.700> skate<00:01:06.000> 123<00:01:06.810> cab

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
that's the AMT Kenmore skate 123 cab

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.380 
that's the AMT Kenmore skate 123 cab
over<00:01:07.670> truck<00:01:08.670> that<00:01:08.909> I'm<00:01:09.030> gonna<00:01:09.150> build<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.930> it

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
over truck that I'm gonna build with it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.499 
over truck that I'm gonna build with it
that<00:01:12.390> will<00:01:13.670> that's<00:01:14.670> actually<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.299> be

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
that will that's actually gonna be

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.260 
that will that's actually gonna be
customized<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:17.630> I'm<00:01:18.630> actually<00:01:18.810> looking<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:20.270> do

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
customized to I'm actually looking to do

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.520 
customized to I'm actually looking to do
something<00:01:21.570> more<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.590> kayuu<00:01:23.840> 100<00:01:24.840> flat<00:01:25.200> top

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
something more like a kayuu 100 flat top

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.850 
something more like a kayuu 100 flat top
double<00:01:26.159> bunk<00:01:26.340> sleepers<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.470> that's<00:01:28.470> probably

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
double bunk sleepers so that's probably

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.380 
double bunk sleepers so that's probably
gonna<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.070> stretched<00:01:29.490> out<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> little<00:01:29.850> bit<00:01:30.180> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
gonna be stretched out a little bit and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.859 
gonna be stretched out a little bit and
cut<00:01:30.689> up<00:01:30.810> as<00:01:30.960> well<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.579> but<00:01:32.579> that's<00:01:32.970> that's<00:01:33.630> what

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
cut up as well so but that's that's what

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.620 
cut up as well so but that's that's what
it's<00:01:33.990> Travis

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
as you can see right there that's could

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.889 
as you can see right there that's could
be<00:01:38.220> my<00:01:38.610> basic<00:01:39.140> paint<00:01:40.140> layout<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:41.720> haven't<00:01:42.720> I
