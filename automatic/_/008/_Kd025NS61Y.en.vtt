from now on so to talk you through the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.079 
from now on so to talk you through the
features<00:00:13.049> first<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.710> all<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.370> comes<00:00:14.639> in<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.849> long

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
features first of all it comes in a long

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.120 
features first of all it comes in a long
thin<00:00:15.450> bag<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.199> reason<00:00:16.379> for<00:00:16.590> that<00:00:16.770> will

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
thin bag and the reason for that will

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.029 
thin bag and the reason for that will
become<00:00:17.279> apparent<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.510> second<00:00:18.990> inside<00:00:19.859> that

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
become apparent in a second inside that

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.470 
become apparent in a second inside that
bag<00:00:20.220> you've<00:00:20.430> got<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> ground<00:00:20.850> sheet<00:00:21.119> which<00:00:21.270> goes

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
bag you've got a ground sheet which goes

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.000 
bag you've got a ground sheet which goes
out<00:00:21.720> first<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.140> comes<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.590> its<00:00:22.710> own<00:00:22.830> little

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
out first that comes in its own little

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.830 
out first that comes in its own little
bag<00:00:23.279> which<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.640> nice<00:00:23.850> little<00:00:24.060> touch<00:00:24.330> because

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
bag which is a nice little touch because

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.000 
bag which is a nice little touch because
it<00:00:24.930> means<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.170> can<00:00:25.320> pack<00:00:25.500> it<00:00:25.680> way<00:00:25.800> at<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:25.949> end

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
it means you can pack it way at the end

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.290 
it means you can pack it way at the end
of<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.189> session<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> rest<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.090> Billy

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
of a session and the rest of Billy

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.599 
of a session and the rest of Billy
doesn't<00:00:27.510> get<00:00:27.750> dirty<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.470> just<00:00:29.130> like<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
doesn't get dirty so just like with the

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.700 
doesn't get dirty so just like with the
r-mo<00:00:30.000> take<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.900> ground<00:00:31.109> sheet<00:00:31.349> out<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.679> a

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
r-mo take the ground sheet out it's a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.190 
r-mo take the ground sheet out it's a
heavy-duty<00:00:32.009> groundsheet<00:00:32.910> throw<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:33.870> make

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
heavy-duty groundsheet throw it out make

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.720 
heavy-duty groundsheet throw it out make
sure<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.559> labels<00:00:34.920> at<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> front<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.489> track<00:00:35.700> a

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
sure the labels at the front the track a

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.280 
sure the labels at the front the track a
label<00:00:36.059> that's<00:00:36.149> at<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.390> front<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.140> can

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
label that's at the front and you can

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.110 
label that's at the front and you can
then<00:00:37.440> position<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.250> swim<00:00:38.520> exactly

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
then position it in the swim exactly

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.520 
then position it in the swim exactly
where<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:39.390> want<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:40.140> you<00:00:40.230> know<00:00:40.350> exactly

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
where you want it so you know exactly

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.619 
where you want it so you know exactly
what<00:00:40.920> space<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.730> baby<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.239> take<00:00:42.390> up

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
what space the baby is going to take up

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.170 
what space the baby is going to take up
now<00:00:42.780> what<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:42.930> do<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.770> put<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> first

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
now what I do is I put in to the first

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.180 
now what I do is I put in to the first
two<00:00:45.390> pigs<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.840> back<00:00:46.050> then<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> couple<00:00:46.980> of

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
two pigs at the back then a couple of

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.950 
two pigs at the back then a couple of
side<00:00:47.370> ones<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.000> then<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> couple<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.600> pegs<00:00:48.750> at

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
side ones and then a couple of pegs at

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.869 
side ones and then a couple of pegs at
the<00:00:49.050> front<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> hold<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.309> nice<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.700> flat

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
the front just to hold it nice and flat

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.340 
the front just to hold it nice and flat
so<00:00:50.940> if<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.270> really<00:00:51.510> windy<00:00:51.719> your

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
so if it's really windy your

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.229 
so if it's really windy your
groundsheets<00:00:52.890> not<00:00:53.100> blowing<00:00:53.430> away<00:00:53.520> while

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
groundsheets not blowing away while

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.340 
groundsheets not blowing away while
you're<00:00:54.420> getting<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.690> rest<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.020> video

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
you're getting the rest of the video

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.040 
you're getting the rest of the video
then<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.160> bivvy<00:00:56.370> itself<00:00:56.820> comes<00:00:57.090> out<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.780> this

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
then the bivvy itself comes out and this

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.200 
then the bivvy itself comes out and this
is<00:00:58.109> why<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.440> comes<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.920> long<00:00:59.129> thin<00:00:59.430> bag<00:00:59.699> it's

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
is why it comes in a long thin bag it's

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.209 
is why it comes in a long thin bag it's
three<00:01:00.600> poles<00:01:00.930> rather<00:01:01.350> than<00:01:01.530> five<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.039> there's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
three poles rather than five so there's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.160 
three poles rather than five so there's
only<00:01:02.309> two<00:01:02.609> connections<00:01:03.210> there<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> be<00:01:03.750> done<00:01:03.989> on

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
only two connections there to be done on

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.920 
only two connections there to be done on
each<00:01:04.739> of<00:01:04.949> those<00:01:05.100> ribs<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.570> then<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
each of those ribs and and then the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.080 
each of those ribs and and then the
bivvy<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.680> taking<00:01:08.159> its<00:01:08.280> shape<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
bivvy is taking its shape so it's a

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.910 
bivvy is taking its shape so it's a
little<00:01:09.270> bit<00:01:09.390> quicker<00:01:09.750> than<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.470> one<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.799> two

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
little bit quicker than the one and two

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.429 
little bit quicker than the one and two
man<00:01:11.159> almost<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.420> then<00:01:12.570> do<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.840> lift<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
man almost what you then do is lift the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.020 
man almost what you then do is lift the
groundsheet<00:01:13.770> up<00:01:14.070> underneath<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.850> there'll<00:01:15.000> be

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
groundsheet up underneath it there'll be

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.179 
groundsheet up underneath it there'll be
a<00:01:15.150> little<00:01:15.390> tiny<00:01:15.659> silver<00:01:16.020> hook<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.950> gets

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
a little tiny silver hook that gets

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.980 
a little tiny silver hook that gets
hooked<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.580> either<00:01:17.759> side<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.780> then

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
hooked on either side and that then

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.810 
hooked on either side and that then
gives<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.350> his<00:01:19.439> tension<00:01:19.799> gives<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.310> his<00:01:20.400> proper

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
gives it his tension gives it his proper

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.910 
gives it his tension gives it his proper
shape<00:01:21.060> I'll<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:22.020> pull<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.409> pigs<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.770> at<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
shape I'll then pull the pigs out at the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.800 
shape I'll then pull the pigs out at the
groundsheet<00:01:23.280> put<00:01:24.000> them<00:01:24.090> back<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
groundsheet put them back in in the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.090 
groundsheet put them back in in the
little<00:01:25.020> tiny<00:01:25.229> islets<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.040> the

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
little tiny islets that are on the

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.249 
little tiny islets that are on the
bottom<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.490> bivvy<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> back<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.869> first

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
bottom of the bivvy do the back to first

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.760 
bottom of the bivvy do the back to first
then<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.250> side<00:01:29.460> ones<00:01:29.759> next<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.360> go<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.290> next

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
then the side ones next to it go on next

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.230 
then the side ones next to it go on next
and<00:01:31.860> then<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.490> can<00:01:32.640> walk<00:01:32.790> around<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
and then you can walk around to the

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.899 
and then you can walk around to the
front<00:01:33.450> put<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.229> pigs<00:01:34.560> inside<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.520> eyelets

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
front put the pigs inside the eyelets

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.789 
front put the pigs inside the eyelets
and<00:01:36.000> literally<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.630> pull<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.110> bivvy<00:01:37.409> over

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
and literally just pull the bivvy over

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.580 
and literally just pull the bivvy over
and<00:01:38.009> up<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.790> goes<00:01:39.049> so<00:01:40.049> once<00:01:40.229> you've<00:01:40.380> done<00:01:40.530> that

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and up it goes so once you've done that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.260 
and up it goes so once you've done that
you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.040> carry<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.430> doing<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.790> pegs<00:01:42.030> at<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you can carry on doing the pegs at the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.480 
you can carry on doing the pegs at the
front<00:01:42.570> there's<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.259> couple<00:01:43.619> more<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:44.040> each<00:01:44.220> side

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
front there's a couple more on each side

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.950 
front there's a couple more on each side
at<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.759> front<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:45.570> can<00:01:45.720> put<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
at the front and then you can put the

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.590 
at the front and then you can put the
tension<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.439> bars<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.520> these<00:01:47.759> bars<00:01:48.090> keep

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
tension in bars on and these bars keep

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.389 
tension in bars on and these bars keep
it<00:01:48.750> lovely<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.110> rigid<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:50.009> they've<00:01:50.189> got

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it lovely and rigid because they've got

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.370 
it lovely and rigid because they've got
a<00:01:50.430> new<00:01:50.610> design<00:01:50.970> one<00:01:51.299> fits<00:01:51.600> inside<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.229> other

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
a new design one fits inside the other

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.410 
a new design one fits inside the other
one<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.159> there's<00:01:53.340> no<00:01:53.460> movement<00:01:53.790> left<00:01:54.210> and

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
one so there's no movement left and

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.899 
one so there's no movement left and
right<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.200> keeps<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.590> BB<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.520> solid

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
right and it keeps that BB really solid

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.429 
right and it keeps that BB really solid
and<00:01:57.360> that's<00:01:57.509> when<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.689> reason<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.079> use<00:01:58.290> this

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and that's when the reason I use this

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.109 
and that's when the reason I use this
baby<00:01:58.770> because<00:01:58.979> sometimes<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.759> might<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.000> going

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
baby because sometimes I might be going

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.120 
baby because sometimes I might be going
for<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.360> few<00:02:00.509> hours<00:02:00.619> sometimes<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.740> might<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.009> on

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
for a few hours sometimes I might be on

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.410 
for a few hours sometimes I might be on
a<00:02:02.159> session<00:02:02.520> not<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.210> wind

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
a session not this and if the wind

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.870 
a session not this and if the wind
springs<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:04.049> even<00:02:04.890> starts<00:02:05.189> blinding<00:02:05.549> my<00:02:05.640> face

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
springs up even starts blinding my face

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.449 
springs up even starts blinding my face
I<00:02:06.090> know<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:06.390> this<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.899> going<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.110> stay<00:02:07.320> put<00:02:07.590> so

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
I know that this is going to stay put so

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.669 
I know that this is going to stay put so
to<00:02:08.520> talk<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.149> through<00:02:09.450> some<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.530> other

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
to talk you through some of the other

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.890 
to talk you through some of the other
features<00:02:11.160> it's<00:02:11.340> got<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> peak<00:02:11.879> exactly<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
features it's got the peak exactly the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.880 
features it's got the peak exactly the
same<00:02:13.140> as

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
same as

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.130 
same as
my<00:02:13.950> man<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.550> man<00:02:14.760> r<00:02:14.970> mo<00:02:15.210> but<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:15.900> a<00:02:15.960> more

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
my man and so man r mo but it's a more

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.020 
my man and so man r mo but it's a more
curved<00:02:16.620> peak<00:02:16.920> because<00:02:17.550> there's<00:02:17.880> less

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
curved peak because there's less

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.180 
curved peak because there's less
sections<00:02:18.569> to<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.319> just<00:02:19.709> matches<00:02:19.890> the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
sections to it and that just matches the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.860 
sections to it and that just matches the
lovely<00:02:20.490> curve<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.000> bivvy<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.630> it<00:02:21.690> looks

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
lovely curve of the bivvy so it looks

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.960 
lovely curve of the bivvy so it looks
more<00:02:21.959> sleek<00:02:22.380> as<00:02:22.590> well<00:02:22.770> and<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.580> nice<00:02:23.730> thing

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
more sleek as well and the nice thing

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.760 
more sleek as well and the nice thing
about<00:02:24.030> this<00:02:24.390> one<00:02:24.600> is<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.170> don't<00:02:25.319> have<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.620> take

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
about this one is you don't have to take

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.380 
about this one is you don't have to take
the<00:02:25.920> polls<00:02:26.160> out<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.670> when<00:02:26.760> you've<00:02:26.910> taken<00:02:27.150> it

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
the polls out of it when you've taken it

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.390 
the polls out of it when you've taken it
down<00:02:27.420> obviously<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:28.470> tension<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:28.980> bar<00:02:29.160> has

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
down obviously that tension in bar has

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.550 
down obviously that tension in bar has
to<00:02:29.550> be<00:02:29.670> taken<00:02:30.030> out<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> poles<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.320> stay

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
to be taken out but the poles can stay

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.650 
to be taken out but the poles can stay
in<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.860> so<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.250> goes<00:02:32.880> together<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.480> that

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
in it so it goes together just that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.480 
in it so it goes together just that
little<00:02:33.750> bit<00:02:33.900> quicker<00:02:34.230> if<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:35.040> want<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.340> take

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
little bit quicker if you want to take

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.520 
little bit quicker if you want to take
the<00:02:35.610> peak<00:02:35.790> off<00:02:36.000> on<00:02:36.150> this<00:02:36.300> one<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.840> can<00:02:36.870> do<00:02:37.350> so

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the peak off on this one you can do so

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.990 
the peak off on this one you can do so
you<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:37.770> have<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:37.950> completely<00:02:38.400> open<00:02:38.820> at<00:02:38.910> the

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
you can have it completely open at the

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.570 
you can have it completely open at the
front<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.480> same<00:02:40.170> goes<00:02:40.200> for<00:02:41.130> me<00:02:41.220> in<00:02:41.340> fuel

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
front and the same goes for me in fuel

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.699 
front and the same goes for me in fuel

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
the super extended rep which has got

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.430 
the super extended rep which has got
another<00:03:50.970> poll<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.420> comes<00:03:51.690> out<00:03:51.870> even<00:03:52.019> further

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
another poll that comes out even further

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.979 
another poll that comes out even further
and<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.280> brings<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.760> down<00:03:53.940> even<00:03:54.329> further<00:03:54.750> out

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
and that brings it down even further out

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.810 
and that brings it down even further out
so<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.440> probably<00:03:55.620> got<00:03:55.829> another<00:03:56.040> foot<00:03:56.640> or<00:03:56.670> so

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
so you probably got another foot or so

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.250 
so you probably got another foot or so
and<00:03:57.299> that<00:03:57.450> would<00:03:57.570> enable<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:57.989> get<00:03:58.230> a

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
and that would enable you to get a

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.259 
and that would enable you to get a
couple<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.650> bed<00:03:58.799> chairs<00:03:59.070> in<00:03:59.250> there<00:03:59.489> I'm<00:03:59.850> pretty

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
couple of bed chairs in there I'm pretty

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.120 
couple of bed chairs in there I'm pretty
much<00:04:00.329> turn<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.870> into<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.079> two-man<00:04:01.530> Billy<00:04:01.799> now

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
much turn it into a two-man Billy now

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.280 
much turn it into a two-man Billy now
you<00:04:02.760> can't<00:04:03.030> get<00:04:03.239> these<00:04:03.360> into<00:04:03.600> men<00:04:03.989> and<00:04:04.230> the

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
you can't get these into men and the

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.229 
you can't get these into men and the
reason<00:04:04.620> for<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:05.070> the<00:04:05.459> polls<00:04:05.730> will<00:04:05.910> be<00:04:05.940> so

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
reason for that is the polls will be so

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.630 
reason for that is the polls will be so
long<00:04:06.570> you've<00:04:06.900> only<00:04:07.019> got<00:04:07.200> three<00:04:07.440> poles<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:08.310> just

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
long you've only got three poles it just

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.979 
long you've only got three poles it just
wouldn't<00:04:08.910> be<00:04:08.940> stable<00:04:09.420> enough<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.750> wouldn't

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
wouldn't be stable enough it wouldn't

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.140 
wouldn't be stable enough it wouldn't
work<00:04:10.140> so<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:11.010> is<00:04:11.190> only<00:04:11.340> available<00:04:11.640> in<00:04:11.880> amount

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
work so this is only available in amount
