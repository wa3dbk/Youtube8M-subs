00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.930
 hormone 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.669
 because this burner is much stronger 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.150
 and we just discovered the donkeys 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:38.419
 this program we have two rings if 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:43.970
 after three years we discover that 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:48.229
 increases the fire we did not say they're going to 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:52.190
 change since we're not going to change soon 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.660

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.520

 it's frying 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:16.020
 but these taquitos are going to be 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:19.259
 truth let's go to guacamole 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.720

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:25.490
 Kitty waters are soft data 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:29.720

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.950
 he puts the lemon juice the juice of 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.130
 lemon so that it prevents us from getting 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:47.230
 negrito and oxidized onions by 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:47.230
 supposed onion and finely chopped 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:56.460
 so also that more I disagree organic 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.500

 salmonella but the best can not have 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:36.339
 Salmonella I hope to avoid that 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:38.349
 quarrel because I want to recommend that it is 

00:06:36.339 --> 00:06:42.219
