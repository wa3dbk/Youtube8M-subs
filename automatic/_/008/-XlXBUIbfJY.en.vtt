around<00:01:44.950> in<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.190> world<00:01:45.370> before<00:01:45.810> me<00:01:46.810> and<00:01:46.870> they

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
around in the world before me and they

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.630 
around in the world before me and they
needed<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.260> track<00:01:47.440> walk<00:01:47.650> yesterday<00:01:48.130> and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
needed a track walk yesterday and

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.100 
needed a track walk yesterday and
discussed<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.120> few<00:01:49.150> things<00:01:49.450> had<00:01:49.690> a<00:01:49.720> plan<00:01:49.960> of

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
discussed a few things had a plan of

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.110 
discussed a few things had a plan of
attack<00:01:50.200> again<00:01:50.590> but<00:01:51.490> when<00:01:51.700> I<00:01:51.730> was<00:01:51.850> out<00:01:51.940> there<00:01:52.000> on

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
attack again but when I was out there on

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.400 
attack again but when I was out there on
circuit<00:01:52.510> I<00:01:52.570> just<00:01:52.750> follow<00:01:52.930> through<00:01:53.230> and

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
circuit I just follow through and

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.380 
circuit I just follow through and
execute<00:01:53.920> our<00:01:54.070> plan<00:01:54.130> of<00:01:54.370> attack<00:01:54.520> and<00:01:54.730> it<00:01:55.210> was

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
execute our plan of attack and it was

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.510 
execute our plan of attack and it was
the<00:01:56.260> right<00:01:56.440> theories<00:01:56.800> for<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.040> corners<00:01:57.310> here

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
the right theories for the corners here

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.830 
the right theories for the corners here
