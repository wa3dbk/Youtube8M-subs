production levels New Zealand is a fun
place<00:00:21.039> and<00:00:21.430> this<00:00:21.519> looks<00:00:21.699> like<00:00:21.789> a<00:00:21.849> fun<00:00:22.269> by<00:00:22.689> again

how<00:00:23.109> much<00:00:23.260> is<00:00:23.410> this<00:00:23.529> way<00:00:23.740> this<00:00:24.519> one<00:00:24.730> views<00:00:25.029> just

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
how much is this way this one views just

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.660 
how much is this way this one views just
under<00:00:25.599> 30<00:00:25.810> pounds<00:00:26.439> and<00:00:26.859> we<00:00:27.189> can<00:00:27.340> make<00:00:27.429> them<00:00:27.609> a

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
under 30 pounds and we can make them a

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.429 
under 30 pounds and we can make them a
lot<00:00:27.820> wider<00:00:28.029> obviously<00:00:28.630> if<00:00:28.689> you<00:00:28.810> have<00:00:28.960> a<00:00:28.990> carbon

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
lot wider obviously if you have a carbon

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:30.929 
lot wider obviously if you have a carbon
fiber<00:00:29.650> bike<00:00:29.920> it's<00:00:30.250> going<00:00:30.460> to<00:00:30.490> be<00:00:30.609> down<00:00:30.789> to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
fiber bike it's going to be down to

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:31.570 
fiber bike it's going to be down to
around<00:00:31.029> about

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
around about

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.550 
around about
rebounds<00:00:32.150> so<00:00:32.900> this<00:00:33.050> one's<00:00:33.230> a<00:00:33.290> bit<00:00:33.410> of<00:00:33.500> a

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:33.560 
rebounds so this one's a bit of a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.110 
rebounds so this one's a bit of a
mixture<00:00:33.800> over<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:34.250> specs<00:00:34.610> you<00:00:34.850> know<00:00:34.940> we're

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
mixture over the specs you know we're

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.270 
mixture over the specs you know we're
always<00:00:35.360> talking<00:00:35.570> about<00:00:35.810> wats<00:00:36.320> on<00:00:36.830> electric

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
always talking about wats on electric

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.950 
always talking about wats on electric
bike<00:00:37.460> motor<00:00:37.790> and<00:00:38.090> that<00:00:38.210> gives<00:00:38.360> you<00:00:38.510> an<00:00:38.630> idea<00:00:38.720> of

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
bike motor and that gives you an idea of

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.250 
bike motor and that gives you an idea of
how<00:00:39.260> strong<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.860> is<00:00:40.239> well<00:00:41.239> this<00:00:41.420> is<00:00:41.450> we're<00:00:42.140> not

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
how strong it is well this is we're not

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.660 
how strong it is well this is we're not
too<00:00:42.440> worried<00:00:42.650> about<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:43.010> speaker<00:00:43.340> the

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
too worried about the speaker the

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410 
performance is not quite as residential

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.530 
performance is not quite as residential
you're<00:00:45.680> sure<00:00:45.860> people<00:00:46.850> don't<00:00:46.940> understand

months they understand that at the end

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.670 
months they understand that at the end
of<00:00:56.480> six<00:00:56.629> miles<00:00:56.930> you<00:00:57.080> can<00:00:57.199> have<00:00:57.320> to<00:00:57.440> charge

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
of six miles you can have to charge

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.619 
of six miles you can have to charge
it'll<00:00:58.040> take<00:00:58.250> about<00:00:58.370> 50<00:00:58.820> or<00:00:58.910> 60<00:00:59.150> minutes<00:00:59.480> they

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
understand that about it for the lithium

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:02.770 
understand that about it for the lithium
battery<00:01:01.430> juice<00:01:01.730> of<00:01:02.000> some<00:01:02.150> of<00:01:02.269> the<00:01:02.360> inventory's

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
battery juice of some of the inventory's

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.119 
battery juice of some of the inventory's
with<00:01:02.960> the<00:01:03.050> option<00:01:03.470> you<00:01:03.739> are<00:01:03.860> new<00:01:04.010> you're

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
with the option you are new you're

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.149 
with the option you are new you're
pretty<00:01:04.430> lightweight<00:01:05.239> guys<00:01:05.780> like<00:01:06.440> super<00:01:06.830> big

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
pretty lightweight guys like super big

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:09.850 
pretty lightweight guys like super big
so<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:07.880> won't<00:01:08.330> still<00:01:08.600> get<00:01:08.720> that<00:01:08.900> kind<00:01:09.110> of<00:01:09.170> oh

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
so it won't still get that kind of oh

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.430 
so it won't still get that kind of oh
yeah<00:01:10.190> it<00:01:11.120> doesn't<00:01:11.420> change<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:11.960> performance

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
yeah it doesn't change the performance

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.130 
yeah it doesn't change the performance
much<00:01:12.970> so<00:01:13.970> basically<00:01:14.360> electric<00:01:14.750> motors<00:01:15.020> are

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
much so basically electric motors are

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.800 
much so basically electric motors are
like<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.409> so<00:01:15.830> in<00:01:16.460> terms<00:01:16.610> of<00:01:16.880> there<00:01:17.479> are<00:01:17.600> some

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
like that so in terms of there are some

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.270 
like that so in terms of there are some
weight<00:01:18.020> and<00:01:18.229> height<00:01:18.380> restrictions<00:01:18.890> like<00:01:19.040> are

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
weight and height restrictions like are

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.399 
weight and height restrictions like are
on<00:01:19.460> anything<00:01:19.760> so<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:20.390> know<00:01:20.630> great<00:01:21.020> big<00:01:21.229> guy

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
on anything so you know great big guy

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.260 
on anything so you know great big guy
250<00:01:22.220> pounds<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:22.610> gonna<00:01:22.729> struggle<00:01:22.940> roll

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
250 pounds is gonna struggle roll

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.969 
250 pounds is gonna struggle roll
probably<00:01:23.869> more<00:01:24.020> to<00:01:24.170> do<00:01:24.290> with<00:01:24.409> balance<00:01:24.799> and

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
probably more to do with balance and

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.770 
probably more to do with balance and
managing<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:25.400> then<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.940> bikes<00:01:26.150> performance

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
managing it then the bikes performance

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.740 
managing it then the bikes performance
it's<00:01:27.350> like<00:01:27.740> one<00:01:28.100> wheel<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:28.940> I'm<00:01:29.030> happy<00:01:29.510> should

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
it's like one wheel and I'm happy should

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.580 
it's like one wheel and I'm happy should
be<00:01:29.840> missing

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
be missing

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.639 
be missing
yeah<00:01:31.520> well<00:01:31.700> this<00:01:31.789> isn't<00:01:31.969> folded<00:01:32.420> up<00:01:32.539> sighs<00:01:33.350> and

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
yeah well this isn't folded up sighs and

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.289 
yeah well this isn't folded up sighs and
it's<00:01:34.280> designed<00:01:34.549> to<00:01:34.640> be<00:01:34.729> picked<00:01:34.969> up<00:01:35.060> by<00:01:35.119> the

it's designed to be picked up by the

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.999 
it's designed to be picked up by the
seat<00:01:35.570> here<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:35.960> just<00:01:36.109> carried<00:01:36.500> upstairs<00:01:36.649> if

give their flashing lights adjustable up
this<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> one<00:02:28.770> size<00:02:28.980> fits<00:02:29.160> all<00:02:29.460> but<00:02:29.850> it's

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
this is a one size fits all but it's

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.360 
this is a one size fits all but it's
most<00:02:31.050> people<00:02:31.350> you<00:02:31.530> know<00:02:31.620> initially<00:02:31.860> really

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
most people you know initially really

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.790 
most people you know initially really
short<00:02:32.640> you're<00:02:33.420> not<00:02:33.540> going<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.800> robotics

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
short you're not going to robotics

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.250 
short you're not going to robotics
interesting<00:02:35.610> as<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.760> whole<00:02:36.060> range<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:37.110> is

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
interesting as a whole range that is

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.680 
interesting as a whole range that is
retire<00:02:37.760> with<00:02:38.760> its<00:02:38.880> rear<00:02:39.120> wheel<00:02:39.150> goes<00:02:39.510> that's

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
retire with its rear wheel goes that's

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.450 
retire with its rear wheel goes that's
where<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.410> back<00:02:40.530> wheel<00:02:40.710> goes<00:02:40.920> when<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.280> folds

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
where the back wheel goes when it folds

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.980 
where the back wheel goes when it folds
up<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.090> want<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.360> see<00:02:42.480> it<00:02:42.570> for<00:02:42.720> but<00:02:42.780> up

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
up if you want to see it for but up

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.900 
up if you want to see it for but up
again<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.410> see<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.650> just<00:02:43.800> falls<00:02:44.160> into<00:02:44.340> place

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
again you see it just falls into place

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.120 
again you see it just falls into place
where<00:02:46.150> you<00:02:46.270> put<00:02:46.480> your<00:02:46.510> water<00:02:46.750> bottle<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:48.010> know

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
where you put your water bottle you know

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.800 
where you put your water bottle you know

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
seemed ok everybody is ok but clearly

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.450 
seemed ok everybody is ok but clearly
clearly<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.630> mic<00:02:52.870> doesn't<00:02:53.680> have<00:02:53.860> everything

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
clearly this mic doesn't have everything

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.710 
clearly this mic doesn't have everything
but<00:02:54.610> that's<00:02:54.760> part<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.120> benefit<00:02:55.510> it's

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
but that's part of the benefit it's

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.290 
but that's part of the benefit it's
lighter<00:02:55.990> right<00:02:56.560> it's<00:02:56.770> got<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.850> regenerative

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
lighter right it's got the regenerative

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.090 
lighter right it's got the regenerative
braking<00:02:58.840> it's<00:02:59.020> a<00:02:59.110> decent<00:02:59.650> amount<00:02:59.710> of<00:02:59.920> range

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
braking it's a decent amount of range

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.470 
braking it's a decent amount of range
and<00:03:00.370> carry<00:03:00.580> it<00:03:00.670> right<00:03:00.790> up<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.030> your<00:03:01.090> office<00:03:01.150> and

going to get
my<00:03:18.700> flight<00:03:19.090> case<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.780> this<00:03:19.900> fits<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.349> which

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
my flight case that this fits in which

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.010 
my flight case that this fits in which
is<00:03:20.950> like<00:03:21.099> a<00:03:21.220> travel<00:03:21.670> case<00:03:22.030> and<00:03:22.660> when<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:22.900> get

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
is like a travel case and when you get

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.720 
is like a travel case and when you get
to<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.500> other<00:03:23.590> end<00:03:23.709> you<00:03:23.950> consume<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.430> alcohol
