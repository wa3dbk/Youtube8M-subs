00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
way is have like a live stream when all

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.570 
way is have like a live stream when all
the<00:00:27.990> stuff<00:00:28.199> comes<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.710> so<00:00:28.859> we<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:29.070> all<00:00:29.310> kind<00:00:29.460> of

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
the stuff comes in so we can all kind of

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.400 
the stuff comes in so we can all kind of
build<00:00:29.789> it<00:00:29.939> together<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.449> see<00:00:30.660> how<00:00:31.260> it

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
build it together and see how it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.990 
build it together and see how it
performs<00:00:31.800> when<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.160> arrives<00:00:32.460> but<00:00:32.640> before<00:00:32.969> I

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
performs when it arrives but before I

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.940 
performs when it arrives but before I
order<00:00:33.059> all<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.750> stuff<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.140> wanted<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.469> throw

thought of it you can go to lon TV / pc

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.049 
thought of it you can go to lon TV / pc
build<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:40.110> see<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.800> comment<00:00:41.160> on<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.579> or

really<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.329> 1920<00:00:52.140> x<00:00:52.289> 1080<00:00:52.530> but<00:00:53.039> i<00:00:53.070> might<00:00:53.340> get

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
really like 1920 x 1080 but i might get

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.310 
of the sweet spot so I'll show you what
that<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:03.059> looks<00:01:03.090> like<00:01:03.480> here's<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.960> newegg

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
that one looks like here's is the newegg

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.560 
that one looks like here's is the newegg
link<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.700> got<00:01:05.850> three<00:01:06.090> fans<00:01:06.330> they

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
link to it so it's got three fans they

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.719 
link to it so it's got three fans they
said<00:01:06.720> it's<00:01:06.840> relatively<00:01:07.229> quiet<00:01:07.710> compared<00:01:08.640> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
said it's relatively quiet compared to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.820 
said it's relatively quiet compared to
some<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> other<00:01:09.080> video<00:01:10.080> cards<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.619> this

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
some of the other video cards of this

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.530 
some of the other video cards of this
class<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.700> pretty<00:01:11.850> beef<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> looking

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
class so this is pretty beef you looking

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.700 
class so this is pretty beef you looking
right<00:01:12.689> here<00:01:12.869> look<00:01:13.020> at<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> size<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.590> those

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
right here look at the size of those

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.800 
right here look at the size of those
fans<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.280> they<00:01:14.430> because<00:01:15.210> there's<00:01:15.360> more<00:01:15.630> than

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
fans but they because there's more than

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.510 
fans but they because there's more than
I<00:01:15.869> guess<00:01:16.049> they<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.350> cool<00:01:17.009> it<00:01:17.130> off<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.490> a

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
I guess they can cool it off with a

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.330 
I guess they can cool it off with a
little<00:01:17.790> less<00:01:18.210> less<00:01:18.960> sound<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.920> got<00:01:20.070> four

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
little less less sound it's got four

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.609 
little less less sound it's got four
gigabytes<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.000> RAM<00:01:21.270> on<00:01:21.479> board<00:01:21.869> too<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.500> think

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
gigabytes of RAM on board too so I think

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.649 
gigabytes of RAM on board too so I think
that<00:01:22.979> one<00:01:23.130> might<00:01:23.159> do<00:01:23.490> pretty<00:01:23.729> well<00:01:23.970> I'm<00:01:24.299> also

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
that one might do pretty well I'm also

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.690 
that one might do pretty well I'm also
looking<00:01:24.840> at<00:01:25.080> an<00:01:25.229> asus<00:01:25.680> motherboard<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.549> is

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
looking at an asus motherboard this is

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.840 
looking at an asus motherboard this is
the<00:01:26.990> z97<00:01:27.990> pro<00:01:28.650> I've<00:01:28.920> been<00:01:29.100> using<00:01:29.310> asus

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.850 
the z97 pro I've been using asus
motherboards<00:01:30.450> for<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> long<00:01:30.990> time<00:01:31.320> i've<00:01:31.740> been

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
motherboards for a long time i've been

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.590 
motherboards for a long time i've been
building<00:01:32.040> pcs<00:01:32.549> off<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.970> on<00:01:33.060> over<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.329> years

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
building pcs off and on over the years

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.170 
building pcs off and on over the years
and<00:01:33.810> I've<00:01:34.170> never<00:01:34.229> had<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.950> bad<00:01:35.189> asus<00:01:35.700> board<00:01:35.939> at

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
and I've never had a bad asus board at

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.730 
and I've never had a bad asus board at
you<00:01:36.270> know<00:01:36.360> back<00:01:36.570> even<00:01:36.900> when<00:01:37.079> i<00:01:37.140> was<00:01:37.290> doing<00:01:37.470> like

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
you know back even when i was doing like

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.649 
you know back even when i was doing like
pentium<00:01:38.159> tues<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.610> stuff<00:01:38.790> i<00:01:38.880> always<00:01:39.180> went<00:01:39.570> for

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
pentium tues and stuff i always went for

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.510 
pentium tues and stuff i always went for
their<00:01:39.869> stuff<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.860> just<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> little<00:01:41.130> brand

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
their stuff so just a little brand

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.060 
their stuff so just a little brand
loyalty<00:01:42.000> there<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.360> i<00:01:42.420> think<00:01:42.479> this<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
loyalty there so i think this is the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.649 
loyalty there so i think this is the
board<00:01:44.070> i'm<00:01:44.220> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.579> settle<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.000> now<00:01:45.420> a<00:01:45.450> lot

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
board i'm going to settle on now a lot

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.420 
board i'm going to settle on now a lot
of<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.840> had<00:01:45.990> talked<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.920> fact<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> i

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
of you had talked about the fact that i

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.399 
of you had talked about the fact that i
don't<00:01:47.610> really<00:01:47.759> need<00:01:47.970> an<00:01:48.149> i7<00:01:48.329> processor<00:01:49.229> for

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
don't really need an i7 processor for

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.539 
don't really need an i7 processor for
game<00:01:49.590> playing<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.009> i<00:01:50.040> would<00:01:50.159> probably<00:01:50.460> agree

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
game playing and i would probably agree

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.620 
game playing and i would probably agree
with<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.880> i<00:01:50.909> would<00:01:51.030> actually<00:01:51.090> wasn't<00:01:51.390> even

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
with you i would actually wasn't even

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.969 
with you i would actually wasn't even
aware<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.079> fact<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.409> games<00:01:52.710> really

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
aware of the fact that games really

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.499 
aware of the fact that games really
aren't<00:01:53.310> taking<00:01:53.610> advantage<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:54.180> everything

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
aren't taking advantage of everything

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.240 
aren't taking advantage of everything
intel<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.110> throwing<00:01:55.439> at<00:01:55.590> them<00:01:55.740> at<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.009> moment

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
intel is throwing at them at the moment

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.069 
intel is throwing at them at the moment
which<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.369> surprising<00:01:56.969> given<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.840> know<00:01:57.930> how

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
which is surprising given you know how

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.260 
which is surprising given you know how
much<00:01:58.860> power<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.670> these<00:01:59.820> things<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.240> i

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
much power is in these things but i

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.510 
much power is in these things but i
guess<00:02:00.509> there's<00:02:00.780> really<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.439> GPU<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:01.920> more<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
guess there's really the GPU is more the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.520 
guess there's really the GPU is more the
the<00:02:03.090> bottleneck<00:02:03.570> now<00:02:03.719> than<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.990> processor<00:02:04.500> is

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
the bottleneck now than the processor is

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.410 
the bottleneck now than the processor is
but<00:02:04.979> i<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.460> lot<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.670> video<00:02:05.909> work<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.360> I'd

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
but i do a lot of video work and I'd

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.819 
but i do a lot of video work and I'd
like<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.020> flexibility<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.680> a

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
like to have the flexibility of a

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.010 
like to have the flexibility of a
powerful<00:02:08.129> i<00:02:08.399> 7<00:02:08.819> device<00:02:09.090> available<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.720> me<00:02:09.840> so

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
powerful i 7 device available to me so

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.240 
powerful i 7 device available to me so
this<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> processor<00:02:10.800> I'm<00:02:10.890> looking<00:02:11.129> at

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
this is the processor I'm looking at

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.540 
this is the processor I'm looking at
here<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:12.470> 4790

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
here the 4790

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.000 
here the 4790
k<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.360> if<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.630> one<00:02:14.870> looks<00:02:15.650> good<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.980> you

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
k so if this one looks good to you

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.350 
k so if this one looks good to you
definitely<00:02:16.460> let<00:02:16.550> me<00:02:16.580> know<00:02:16.700> it's<00:02:16.940> number<00:02:17.210> one

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
definitely let me know it's number one

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.940 
definitely let me know it's number one
bestseller<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.080> it's<00:02:18.200> got<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.380> be<00:02:18.560> pretty

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
bestseller so it's got to be pretty

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.160 
bestseller so it's got to be pretty
popular<00:02:19.250> out<00:02:19.640> there<00:02:19.820> these<00:02:19.970> days<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.480> that's

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
popular out there these days so that's

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.380 
popular out there these days so that's
the<00:02:21.350> chip<00:02:21.560> I'm<00:02:21.710> looking<00:02:22.010> at<00:02:22.160> as<00:02:22.730> far<00:02:22.790> as<00:02:23.210> the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
the chip I'm looking at as far as the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.120 
the chip I'm looking at as far as the
cpu<00:02:23.960> cooler<00:02:24.230> goes<00:02:24.500> this<00:02:24.800> one<00:02:25.010> from

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
cpu cooler goes this one from

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.950 
cpu cooler goes this one from
coolermaster<00:02:25.820> for<00:02:25.970> 33<00:02:26.390> bucks<00:02:26.570> looks<00:02:26.810> like

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
coolermaster for 33 bucks looks like

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.690 
coolermaster for 33 bucks looks like
it'll<00:02:27.110> fit<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.950> bill<00:02:28.100> so<00:02:28.370> i<00:02:28.400> think<00:02:28.490> i'm

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
it'll fit the bill so i think i'm

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
it'll fit the bill so i think i'm
probably<00:02:28.880> going<00:02:29.090> to<00:02:29.180> go<00:02:29.300> with<00:02:29.450> that<00:02:29.660> one

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
probably going to go with that one

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.480 
probably going to go with that one
hopefully<00:02:30.230> we'll<00:02:30.380> find<00:02:30.410> one<00:02:30.740> that's<00:02:30.920> in<00:02:31.160> stock

got<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.370> pretty<00:03:04.580> adequate<00:03:04.880> power<00:03:05.150> supply<00:03:05.540> i

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
got a pretty adequate power supply i

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.390 
got a pretty adequate power supply i
think<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:05.900> is<00:03:05.960> a<00:03:06.110> 650<00:03:06.710> watt<00:03:07.040> power<00:03:07.280> supply

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
think this is a 650 watt power supply

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.060 
think this is a 650 watt power supply
for<00:03:07.730> about<00:03:08.000> 85<00:03:08.630> bucks<00:03:08.660> from<00:03:09.320> amazon<00:03:09.800> maybe<00:03:10.040> i

for about 85 bucks from amazon maybe i

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.290 
for about 85 bucks from amazon maybe i
can<00:03:10.190> find<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.400> cheaper<00:03:10.670> somewhere<00:03:10.850> else<00:03:11.090> but

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
can find a cheaper somewhere else but

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.120 
can find a cheaper somewhere else but
this<00:03:11.990> is<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.140> one<00:03:12.260> I'm<00:03:12.350> looking<00:03:12.380> at<00:03:12.710> for<00:03:12.980> the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
this is the one I'm looking at for the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.800 
this is the one I'm looking at for the
power<00:03:13.310> side<00:03:13.640> of<00:03:13.790> things<00:03:13.940> not<00:03:14.180> much<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.540> look<00:03:14.570> at

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
power side of things not much to look at

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.150 
power side of things not much to look at
their<00:03:15.050> it's<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.200> nice-looking<00:03:15.350> power<00:03:15.770> supply

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
their it's a nice-looking power supply

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.830 
their it's a nice-looking power supply
with<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.340> lot<00:03:16.460> of<00:03:16.490> plugs<00:03:16.820> on<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.090> so<00:03:17.570> hopefully

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
with a lot of plugs on it so hopefully

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.080 
with a lot of plugs on it so hopefully
that<00:03:18.020> will<00:03:18.170> work<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.650> then<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.580> case<00:03:19.820> you

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
that will work and then the case you

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.670 
that will work and then the case you
know<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.780> i<00:03:20.959> would<00:03:21.110> love<00:03:21.290> to<00:03:21.380> have<00:03:21.500> something

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
know it i would love to have something

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.320 
know it i would love to have something
compact<00:03:22.190> but<00:03:22.430> i<00:03:22.459> think<00:03:22.700> we've<00:03:22.880> got<00:03:23.060> heat

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
compact but i think we've got heat

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.940 
compact but i think we've got heat
problems<00:03:23.810> with<00:03:23.900> all<00:03:23.989> this<00:03:24.140> stuff<00:03:24.500> i'm<00:03:24.650> putting

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
problems with all this stuff i'm putting

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.710 
problems with all this stuff i'm putting
in<00:03:25.130> so<00:03:25.910> i<00:03:25.940> think<00:03:26.120> i'm<00:03:26.270> going<00:03:26.360> to<00:03:26.450> go<00:03:26.510> with<00:03:26.600> like

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
in so i think i'm going to go with like

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.199 
in so i think i'm going to go with like
a<00:03:26.780> mid<00:03:27.050> tower<00:03:27.260> like<00:03:28.100> this<00:03:28.310> one<00:03:28.520> here<00:03:28.700> from<00:03:28.880> from

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
a mid tower like this one here from from

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.570 
a mid tower like this one here from from
Coursera<00:03:29.630> also<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.050> looks<00:03:30.140> pretty<00:03:30.350> good<00:03:30.620> 70

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
Coursera also it looks pretty good 70

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.850 
Coursera also it looks pretty good 70
bucks<00:03:31.790> on<00:03:31.970> amazon<00:03:32.600> so<00:03:33.200> i<00:03:33.230> think<00:03:33.350> i'll<00:03:33.560> take<00:03:33.830> a

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
bucks on amazon so i think i'll take a

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.220 
bucks on amazon so i think i'll take a
look<00:03:34.070> at<00:03:34.190> that<00:03:34.370> for<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.120> hard<00:03:35.360> drive<00:03:35.420> I<00:03:35.750> have<00:03:36.020> a

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
look at that for a hard drive I have a

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.430 
look at that for a hard drive I have a
sandisk<00:03:36.920> extreme<00:03:37.480> 480<00:03:38.480> which<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.930> already<00:03:39.050> have

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
sandisk extreme 480 which I already have

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.870 
sandisk extreme 480 which I already have
so<00:03:39.739> I'm<00:03:39.800> going<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:39.980> use<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.220> one<00:03:40.640> I've<00:03:40.850> been

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
so I'm going to use that one I've been

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.910 
so I'm going to use that one I've been
using<00:03:41.090> it<00:03:41.270> for<00:03:41.300> recording<00:03:41.720> but<00:03:41.989> I've<00:03:42.080> got<00:03:42.260> two

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
using it for recording but I've got two

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.830 
using it for recording but I've got two
other<00:03:43.070> drives<00:03:43.459> that<00:03:43.640> I<00:03:43.700> can<00:03:43.910> use<00:03:43.940> as<00:03:44.360> well<00:03:44.570> so

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
other drives that I can use as well so

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.350 
other drives that I can use as well so
this<00:03:44.959> is<00:03:45.140> probably<00:03:45.320> just<00:03:45.500> better<00:03:46.190> used<00:03:46.550> inside

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
this is probably just better used inside

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.770 
this is probably just better used inside
a<00:03:47.420> pc<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.140> this<00:03:48.260> is<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.440> really<00:03:48.770> nice<00:03:49.040> drive

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
a pc so this is that really nice drive

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.770 
a pc so this is that really nice drive
480<00:03:50.780> gigabytes<00:03:51.489> solid-state<00:03:52.489> very<00:03:53.060> fast<00:03:53.450> but

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
480 gigabytes solid-state very fast but

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.080 
480 gigabytes solid-state very fast but
it's<00:03:53.930> also<00:03:54.170> got<00:03:54.410> a<00:03:54.470> 10<00:03:54.860> year<00:03:55.100> warranty<00:03:55.130> on<00:03:55.820> it

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
it's also got a 10 year warranty on it

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.750 
it's also got a 10 year warranty on it
so<00:03:56.330> I<00:03:56.510> think<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.830> know<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:57.980> can<00:03:58.220> really

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
so I think I you know you can really

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.920 
so I think I you know you can really
can't<00:03:59.000> go<00:03:59.060> wrong<00:03:59.090> with<00:03:59.450> that<00:03:59.570> I<00:03:59.630> mean<00:03:59.810> it'll

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
can't go wrong with that I mean it'll

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.660 
can't go wrong with that I mean it'll
last<00:04:00.080> me<00:04:00.200> longer<00:04:00.470> than<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.739> pc<00:04:01.100> will<00:04:01.250> last<00:04:01.430> so

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
last me longer than the pc will last so

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.400 
last me longer than the pc will last so
so<00:04:02.150> that's<00:04:02.300> kind<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.630> basic<00:04:03.020> build<00:04:03.260> that

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
so that's kind of the basic build that

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.630 
so that's kind of the basic build that
I'm<00:04:03.530> looking<00:04:03.680> at<00:04:04.010> I'd<00:04:04.160> love<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.459> hear<00:04:04.580> your

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
I'm looking at I'd love to hear your

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.640 
I'm looking at I'd love to hear your
feedback<00:04:04.790> on<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:06.050> I'll<00:04:06.230> give<00:04:06.350> it<00:04:06.380> a<00:04:06.500> day<00:04:06.620> or

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
feedback on and I'll give it a day or

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.990 
feedback on and I'll give it a day or
two<00:04:06.920> and<00:04:07.130> then<00:04:07.220> I'll<00:04:07.370> start<00:04:07.700> pulling<00:04:07.940> the

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
two and then I'll start pulling the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.949 
two and then I'll start pulling the
trigger<00:04:08.180> on<00:04:08.330> getting<00:04:08.660> some<00:04:08.780> of<00:04:08.870> these

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
trigger on getting some of these

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.810 
trigger on getting some of these
components<00:04:09.500> in<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.800> then<00:04:09.950> once<00:04:10.550> I<00:04:10.640> have<00:04:10.730> an

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
components in and then once I have an

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.220 
components in and then once I have an
idea<00:04:10.910> of<00:04:11.120> when<00:04:11.269> everything<00:04:11.600> is<00:04:11.690> showing<00:04:11.989> up<00:04:12.110> we

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
idea of when everything is showing up we
