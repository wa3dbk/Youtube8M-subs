00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.090 
realistic so what I got here is some
black<00:03:24.269> construction<00:03:24.600> paper<00:03:24.900> what<00:03:25.890> I'm<00:03:25.950> going

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
black construction paper what I'm going

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.920 
black construction paper what I'm going
to<00:03:26.130> do<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.430> let<00:03:26.640> my<00:03:26.730> fireplace<00:03:27.030> down<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.840> I'm

goes<00:03:31.620> to<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.280> I'm<00:03:32.400> gonna<00:03:32.580> just<00:03:32.940> line<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.900> up

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
goes to and I'm gonna just line it up

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.680 
goes to and I'm gonna just line it up
and<00:03:34.470> put<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.650> little<00:03:34.709> line<00:03:35.130> there<00:03:35.600> then<00:03:36.600> I'm

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
and put a little line there then I'm

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.420 
and put a little line there then I'm
going<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.900> measure<00:03:37.019> the<00:03:37.290> edges<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.040> know<00:03:38.160> how

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
going to measure the edges so I know how

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.729 
going to measure the edges so I know how
far<00:03:38.459> down<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:39.150> goes<00:03:39.480> on<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.140> side<00:03:40.380> of<00:03:40.620> where

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
far down that goes on the side of where

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.250 
far down that goes on the side of where
the<00:03:40.769> flame<00:03:41.100> is<00:03:41.660> maybe<00:03:42.660> I'll<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:42.930> go<00:03:43.080> like

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
the flame is maybe I'll just go like

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.350 
the flame is maybe I'll just go like
this<00:03:43.290> that<00:03:43.860> will<00:03:44.130> be<00:03:44.160> easier

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.730 

like<00:03:48.320> that<00:03:48.500> and<00:03:48.830> then<00:03:49.040> now<00:03:49.760> what<00:03:49.880> I'm<00:03:50.000> gonna<00:03:50.120> do

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
like that and then now what I'm gonna do

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.960 
like that and then now what I'm gonna do
just<00:03:51.740> you<00:03:52.100> don't<00:03:52.280> have<00:03:52.370> a<00:03:52.400> paper<00:03:52.670> cutter

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
just you don't have a paper cutter
