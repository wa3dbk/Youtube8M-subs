00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.390
 but 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.620
 motorcycle hammerman and 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.219
 style 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.360
 but having a suite means that it is one 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.779
 one of the most expensive 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.660
 ATV kits they that is 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.750
 what it includes is 10 light alloy 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.750
 discs 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.029
 with more expensive and high-quality rubber 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.349
 Here is a processor that fits 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:34.590
 whether the cookie is for and easy for more solid 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.590
 ground 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.650
 tires on all rear wheel drive on 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.260
 all for nasty quad bikes will 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.850
 a little narrower back there will be a lot of tailoring 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.360
 due to the fact that from the back acceptance of 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.360
 leading 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.149
 added this 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.590
 hand protection which is unimportant for 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.130
 the driver at the time drove 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.130
 road builder 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.620
 sacred to localities 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.950
 i.e 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.950
 my panel 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.830
 which will show momentum 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.770
 engine speedometer daily mileage and 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:24.000
 shared well and the same way which is included 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.930
 bend and high beam transmission 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.930
 and emergency gang spring 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:36.530
 and slightly improved the platform under 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.500
 front back mom now they did 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.090
 together with fixed anchorages 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.050
 coffers that are installed separately 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.000
 on all quad bike 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.450
 the engine remained the same ie it is 200 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.619
 cubic centimeters 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.899
 and one air forced 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.880
 cooling that is this impeller 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.899
 is engine cooling on 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.899
 constantly spinning 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:04.319
 carburetor injection in this engine 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.289
 about 17 stop on horsepower 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.849
 variable speed box 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.060
 saying a gun is a pass forward 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.459
 neutral transfer and transfer back and 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.690
 there is very comfortable it and very cool then 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.620
 what is this kickstarter on those 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.910
 cases when 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.680
 a battery can sit down 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.680
 suspension independent sphere 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.130
 the beach at this is figurative speeches which with 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.130
 ball 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.580
 here it will be for oil racks 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.019
 stand which can also be adjusted 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.250
 by preload 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.250
 at the expense of these 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.750
 at home will forget the front disc on each 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.240
 the wheel will brake 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.180
 they are hydraulic 1 piston disc 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.400
 caliper stand and will be back too 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.670
 installed 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.670
 disc brake 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.500
 he will be on the whole axis 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.920
 there will be no monoshock which too 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.580
 You can adjust the stiffness of it, too 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.580
 and for the mass 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.670
 there is also a pacifier 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.180
 that is, it depends on the load 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.080
 quad bike it will change the tension and 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.080
 coal and calm be 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.770
 ATV running 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:07.540
 what is telling us here 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.760
 formosa are on the steering wheel here it will be 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.400
 rear brake this will be the front brake 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.269
 There are such handbrake that they are on 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.310
 she both grip just grips the grip 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.990
 it is clamped 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.690
 from the board and do not let the quadric move here 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:29.470
 this button is a starter control 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:34.290
 light is dipped beam 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.290
 stop you one turn and 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.819
 control of the way at such a flag yes 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:45.830
 safest gas management 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:50.250
 square chain and about the gearbox 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:53.520
 very comfortable and very so of medium length 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.050
 and drawstring that is, it is easily controlled 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.360
 that is soft with one finger 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.419
 literally that is this position 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.810
 neutral forward and pass 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.810
 backwards 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.250
 there is again in this configuration 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.980
 quad bike have alarm 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:19.260
 that is, it can become a feat on 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.260
 guard and also run 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:28.700
 to drown out the same sleep 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:31.220
 remotely using this is convenient 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.380
 let's say if the children ride that is their 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.139
 can be controlled 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.039
 distances 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.530
 quadrics are controlled very easily cool 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.979
 see the role 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.979
 can handle even children 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.510
 good quality quad at them 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.940
 cool substrates are allowed 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:19.910
 even the most elemental foot traps 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.910
 it is very durable ie either i will get it 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.150
 either considered it does not break also 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:28.640
 It is very convenient that 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.710
 quad bike out that is completely it 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.010
 she is made of very cool plastic 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.870
 all plastic items from capron 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.490
 that is, they are as foolish as possible, that is 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.960
 they can fuck like 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.960
 anything they do not break 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:47.789
 maximum load on ATV 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:47.789
 about 200 kilograms there 183 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.770
 but it is quite possible to ride together that is 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:56.360
 here it sits 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:56.360
 king driver 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.530
 you 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.180
 equipment added new optics then 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.660
 there is now 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:12.690
 front optics it will be and that's it 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:14.610
 there is dipped at this will be at 6 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:17.030
 diodes and all the other diodes are already 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.030
 will be next 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:31.300
 and again quad bikes quad bikes 

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.060
 Hammer can not be registered + 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:35.830
 It comes with a certificate-by that is, 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.690
 all customs declaration that is full 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:41.530
 set of documents for registration 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:43.990
 and in this quad bikes there are also turns 

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:47.080
 emergency light stop signal that is here 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:49.500
 fully designed as for riding even 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.500
 weather
