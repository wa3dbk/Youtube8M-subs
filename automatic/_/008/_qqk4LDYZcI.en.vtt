00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
that everyone had forgotten the reason

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.380 
that everyone had forgotten the reason
we<00:01:10.799> brought<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.310> begin<00:01:11.520> with<00:01:11.670> there<00:01:12.180> was<00:01:12.270> this

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390

massive<00:01:12.750> battle<00:01:13.320> over<00:01:13.650> cooked<00:01:14.130> carbs<00:01:14.549> or

massive battle over cooked carbs or
avocados<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.900> was<00:01:16.409> always<00:01:16.590> thinking<00:01:16.890> why

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
avocados and I was always thinking why

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.859 
avocados and I was always thinking why
should<00:01:17.700> we<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:17.970> choose<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.540> know<00:01:18.659> why

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
should we have to choose you know why

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.539 
should we have to choose you know why
why<00:01:19.200> can't<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.619> eat<00:01:19.770> fruit<00:01:20.009> why<00:01:20.130> can't<00:01:20.430> we

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
why can't we just eat fruit why can't we

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.399 
why can't we just eat fruit why can't we
come<00:01:20.729> back<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> reason<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.750> we<00:01:22.229> found

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
come back to the reason that we found

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.660 
come back to the reason that we found
this<00:01:22.619> lifestyle<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.220> first<00:01:23.400> place<00:01:23.549> and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
this lifestyle in the first place and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.370 
this lifestyle in the first place and
the<00:01:23.880> reason<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.210> feel<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.659> good<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.229> that's

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
the reason we feel so good and that's

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.499 
the reason we feel so good and that's
fruits<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.950> vegetables<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.909> me<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.210> answer

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
fruits and vegetables to me the answer

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.390 
fruits and vegetables to me the answer
seems<00:01:27.659> simple<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.110> apparently<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.890> others<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
seems simple but apparently to others it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.580 
seems simple but apparently to others it
wasn't<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.390> there's<00:01:30.689> now<00:01:30.869> there's<00:01:31.140> drama<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
wasn't so there's now there's drama and

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
wasn't so there's now there's drama and
a<00:01:31.890> separation<00:01:32.610> again<00:01:32.939> between<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.479> cooked

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
a separation again between the cooked

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.170 
a separation again between the cooked
carbs<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.500> people<00:01:34.920> who<00:01:35.040> eat<00:01:35.159> me<00:01:35.700> higher<00:01:35.970> fat

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
carbs and people who eat me higher fat

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.870 
carbs and people who eat me higher fat
raw<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.540> another<00:01:36.810> option<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.430> just<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:38.640> it's

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
raw as another option I just think it's

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.740 
raw as another option I just think it's
so<00:01:39.560> petty<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.890> childish<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.700> silly<00:01:42.060> when

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
so petty and childish and so silly when

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.210 
so petty and childish and so silly when
we<00:01:43.020> should<00:01:43.229> really<00:01:43.380> be<00:01:43.590> promoting<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
we should really be promoting a

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.980 
we should really be promoting a
lifestyle<00:01:44.670> of<00:01:44.790> compassion<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:45.540> I<00:01:45.689> think<00:01:45.899> that

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
lifestyle of compassion and I think that

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.649 
lifestyle of compassion and I think that
the<00:01:46.110> solution<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.399> problem<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:48.000> actually

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the solution to this problem I actually

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.450 
the solution to this problem I actually
think<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:48.990> my<00:01:49.140> friends<00:01:49.560> freely<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.159> Harley

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
think that my friends freely and Harley

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.639 
think that my friends freely and Harley
are<00:01:50.579> handling<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.030> very<00:01:51.060> well<00:01:51.240> because<00:01:51.649> they

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
are handling it very well because they

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.260 
are handling it very well because they
are<00:01:52.710> leaning<00:01:52.950> towards<00:01:53.340> promoting<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.820> vegan

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
are leaning towards promoting a vegan

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.450 
are leaning towards promoting a vegan
diet<00:01:54.509> which<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.439> my<00:01:55.649> opinion<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.310> ultimate

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
diet which in my opinion is the ultimate

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.910 
diet which in my opinion is the ultimate
goal<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.149> this<00:01:57.180> because<00:01:57.630> we<00:01:57.780> want<00:01:58.020> people<00:01:58.229> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
goal with this because we want people to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.550 
goal with this because we want people to
not<00:01:59.040> eat<00:01:59.280> animals<00:01:59.670> t<00:02:00.090> healthier<00:02:00.630> TP<00:02:01.110> happier

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
not eat animals t healthier TP happier

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.590 
not eat animals t healthier TP happier
and<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:02.130> help<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> planet<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.939> animals<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:03.540> I

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and to help the planet and animals and I

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.330 
and to help the planet and animals and I
think<00:02:03.840> that's<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> goal<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.560> kind<00:02:05.040> of<00:02:05.130> lost

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
think that's the goal that kind of lost

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.880 
think that's the goal that kind of lost
somewhere<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:06.030> all<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.540> drama<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.680> went

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
somewhere in all this drama and I went

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.169 
somewhere in all this drama and I went
to<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.099> woodstock<00:02:08.429> fruit<00:02:08.610> festival<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.090> was

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
to the woodstock fruit festival it was

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.880 
to the woodstock fruit festival it was
actually<00:02:09.539> an<00:02:09.629> incredible<00:02:10.170> experience<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.800> was

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
actually an incredible experience it was

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.340 
actually an incredible experience it was
really<00:02:11.190> uplifting<00:02:11.730> at<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.270> same<00:02:12.480> time<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.780> also

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
really uplifting at the same time I also

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.140 
really uplifting at the same time I also
very<00:02:13.620> draining<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.580> also<00:02:14.730> had<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> lot<00:02:15.120> of

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
very draining and it also had a lot of

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.530 
very draining and it also had a lot of
politics<00:02:15.660> to<00:02:15.840> do<00:02:15.930> with<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:17.060> I'm<00:02:18.060> just<00:02:18.360> so

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
politics to do with it and I'm just so

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.450 
politics to do with it and I'm just so
amazed<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:19.260> be<00:02:19.290> honest<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.890> don't<00:02:20.070> know<00:02:20.280> maybe

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
amazed to be honest I don't know maybe

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.580 
amazed to be honest I don't know maybe
I'm<00:02:20.670> somewhere<00:02:21.420> else<00:02:21.570> entirely<00:02:21.930> but<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.320> think

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
I'm somewhere else entirely but I think

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.700 
I'm somewhere else entirely but I think
it<00:02:22.710> is<00:02:22.740> so<00:02:23.070> downright<00:02:23.880> stupid<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.960> argue<00:02:25.410> about

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
it is so downright stupid to argue about

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.490 
it is so downright stupid to argue about
going<00:02:26.190> to<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.370> place<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:26.850> eat<00:02:26.910> fruit<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:27.500> anyone

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
going to a place to eat fruit is anyone

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.190 
going to a place to eat fruit is anyone
with<00:02:28.740> me<00:02:28.890> on<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.130> because<00:02:29.630> it<00:02:30.630> seems<00:02:31.050> that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
with me on that because it seems that

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.260 
with me on that because it seems that
it's<00:02:31.320> so<00:02:31.500> important<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.100> everybody<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.850> I

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
it's so important to everybody and I

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.930 
it's so important to everybody and I
just<00:02:33.690> don't<00:02:33.900> give<00:02:34.350> a<00:02:34.710> like<00:02:35.040> yeah<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> went

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.390 
to the woodstock fruit festival it was
great<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.470> got<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.800> connect<00:02:38.010> with<00:02:38.070> so<00:02:38.280> many

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
great I got to connect with so many

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.700 
great I got to connect with so many
people<00:02:38.790> but<00:02:39.420> to<00:02:39.480> be<00:02:39.780> honest<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.230> probably<00:02:40.410> won't

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
people but to be honest I probably won't

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.230 
people but to be honest I probably won't
ever<00:02:40.920> go<00:02:41.220> into<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.490> fruit<00:02:41.700> festival<00:02:41.910> again

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
because usually the way that I justify

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.310 
because usually the way that I justify
that<00:02:45.000> kind<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.330> travel<00:02:45.690> getting<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:45.990> a<00:02:46.020> plane<00:02:46.080> a

that kind of travel getting on a plane a

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.280 
that kind of travel getting on a plane a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
because I actually felt pretty guilty

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.590 
because I actually felt pretty guilty
about<00:03:04.770> it<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.940> just<00:03:06.120> didn't<00:03:06.360> sit<00:03:06.540> right

when going to a place to eat fruit

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.390 
when going to a place to eat fruit
baffles<00:03:12.720> my<00:03:12.870> mind<00:03:12.900> it<00:03:13.320> seriously<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:13.740> it<00:03:14.190> just

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
baffles my mind it seriously I it just

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.370 
baffles my mind it seriously I it just
doesn't<00:03:15.240> make<00:03:15.300> any<00:03:15.360> sense<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:15.990> me<00:03:16.110> like

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.660 
doesn't make any sense to me like
couldn't<00:03:16.590> we<00:03:16.740> be<00:03:16.860> arguing<00:03:17.280> about<00:03:17.430> maybe

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
couldn't we be arguing about maybe

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.430 
couldn't we be arguing about maybe
something<00:03:17.970> that's<00:03:18.060> perhaps<00:03:18.540> more<00:03:18.840> meaningful

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
something that's perhaps more meaningful

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.140 
something that's perhaps more meaningful
I<00:03:19.650> don't<00:03:20.160> know<00:03:20.220> that's<00:03:20.460> just<00:03:20.550> my<00:03:20.760> thought<00:03:21.000> on

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
I don't know that's just my thought on

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.330 
I don't know that's just my thought on
it<00:03:21.180> but<00:03:21.480> why<00:03:22.320> are<00:03:22.410> we<00:03:22.440> arguing<00:03:22.650> over<00:03:23.280> it

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
it but why are we arguing over it

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.490 
it but why are we arguing over it
anyways<00:03:23.700> I<00:03:23.910> mean<00:03:24.140> people<00:03:25.140> should<00:03:25.170> be<00:03:25.350> allowed

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
anyways I mean people should be allowed

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.470 
anyways I mean people should be allowed
to<00:03:25.650> eat<00:03:25.890> what<00:03:26.010> they<00:03:26.100> want<00:03:26.310> you<00:03:26.850> know<00:03:26.940> at<00:03:27.270> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
to eat what they want you know at the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.910 
to eat what they want you know at the
fruit<00:03:27.660> festival<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:28.080> understand<00:03:28.500> it's<00:03:28.680> kind<00:03:28.860> of

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
fruit festival I understand it's kind of

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.110 
fruit festival I understand it's kind of
having<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.250> idea<00:03:29.490> of<00:03:29.610> everyone's<00:03:29.970> eating

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
having the idea of everyone's eating

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.780 
having the idea of everyone's eating
healthier<00:03:30.690> maybe<00:03:31.170> raw<00:03:31.440> or<00:03:31.710> bottle<00:03:32.100> for<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:32.640> to

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
healthier maybe raw or bottle for but to

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.730 
healthier maybe raw or bottle for but to
have<00:03:32.910> some<00:03:33.090> sort<00:03:33.240> of<00:03:33.330> standard<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.500> have

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
have some sort of standard that you have

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.230 
have some sort of standard that you have
to<00:03:34.920> eat<00:03:34.980> a<00:03:35.010> hundred<00:03:35.160> percent<00:03:35.370> raw<00:03:35.670> or<00:03:35.940> all<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.120> a

to eat a hundred percent raw or all of a
sudden<00:03:36.510> you're<00:03:36.630> inferior<00:03:37.020> that<00:03:37.770> just<00:03:38.010> never

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
sudden you're inferior that just never

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.040 
sudden you're inferior that just never
made<00:03:38.400> sense<00:03:38.610> to<00:03:38.790> me<00:03:38.970> because<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.510> used<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.020> eat

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
made sense to me because I used to eat

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.200 
made sense to me because I used to eat
cooked<00:03:40.320> food<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:41.400> use<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.820> eat<00:03:41.940> cooked<00:03:42.150> food

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
cooked food you use to eat cooked food

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.120 
cooked food you use to eat cooked food
if<00:03:42.480> you're<00:03:42.600> promoting<00:03:43.110> a<00:03:43.230> raw<00:03:43.410> food<00:03:43.680> diet<00:03:43.710> and

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
if you're promoting a raw food diet and

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.520 
if you're promoting a raw food diet and
you<00:03:44.190> think<00:03:44.400> it's<00:03:44.550> raw<00:03:44.790> or<00:03:45.000> die<00:03:45.300> you<00:03:46.110> used<00:03:46.410> to

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
you think it's raw or die you used to

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.260 
you think it's raw or die you used to
eat<00:03:46.620> cooked<00:03:46.950> food<00:03:47.010> at<00:03:47.310> one<00:03:47.520> point<00:03:47.760> unless<00:03:48.030> you

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
eat cooked food at one point unless you

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.180 
eat cooked food at one point unless you
were<00:03:48.390> raised<00:03:48.600> run<00:03:48.930> if<00:03:49.350> you<00:03:49.530> were<00:03:49.680> then<00:03:49.890> kudos

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
were raised run if you were then kudos

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.850 
were raised run if you were then kudos
to<00:03:50.370> you<00:03:50.460> but<00:03:50.730> most<00:03:50.910> of<00:03:51.180> us<00:03:51.270> weren't<00:03:51.600> so<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.770> have

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
to you but most of us weren't so to have

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.410 
to you but most of us weren't so to have
that<00:03:52.920> elitist<00:03:53.520> kind<00:03:53.670> of<00:03:53.760> attitude<00:03:54.180> and<00:03:54.330> say

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
that elitist kind of attitude and say

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:55.940 
that elitist kind of attitude and say
that<00:03:54.600> somebody<00:03:54.780> is<00:03:55.020> less<00:03:55.320> because<00:03:55.560> they<00:03:55.860> eat

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
that somebody is less because they eat

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.920 
that somebody is less because they eat
cooked<00:03:56.160> food<00:03:56.250> I<00:03:56.580> think<00:03:57.030> that's<00:03:57.750> and

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
cooked food I think that's and

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.990 
cooked food I think that's and
the<00:03:58.830> reason<00:03:59.100> I<00:03:59.220> don't<00:03:59.280> have<00:03:59.550> that<00:03:59.580> mentality

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
the reason I don't have that mentality

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.300 
the reason I don't have that mentality
because<00:04:00.270> my<00:04:00.870> partner<00:04:01.170> eats<00:04:01.560> cooked<00:04:01.830> food<00:04:02.070> I

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
because my partner eats cooked food I

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.090 
because my partner eats cooked food I
cook<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:03.120> for<00:04:03.390> him<00:04:03.630> he<00:04:04.020> feels<00:04:04.230> incredible<00:04:04.920> on<00:04:05.070> a

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
cook it for him he feels incredible on a

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.710 
cook it for him he feels incredible on a
cooked<00:04:05.370> vegan<00:04:05.580> diet<00:04:05.880> and<00:04:06.120> yeah<00:04:06.240> he<00:04:06.390> still<00:04:06.600> eats

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
cooked vegan diet and yeah he still eats

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.290 
cooked vegan diet and yeah he still eats
tons<00:04:06.990> of<00:04:07.230> raw<00:04:07.380> food<00:04:07.740> but<00:04:08.610> he<00:04:08.760> doesn't<00:04:09.030> want<00:04:09.210> to

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
tons of raw food but he doesn't want to

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.270 
tons of raw food but he doesn't want to
be<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.420> hundred<00:04:09.660> percent<00:04:09.810> raw<00:04:10.200> so<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.980> say<00:04:11.160> that

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
be a hundred percent raw so to say that

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.130 
be a hundred percent raw so to say that
someone<00:04:11.580> is<00:04:11.700> bad<00:04:11.940> or<00:04:11.970> less<00:04:12.450> because<00:04:12.690> of<00:04:12.990> that<00:04:13.110> I

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
someone is bad or less because of that I

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.140 
someone is bad or less because of that I
think<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.590> really<00:04:13.620> silly<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.490> I<00:04:14.640> really<00:04:15.060> don't

think is really silly and I really don't

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.430 
think is really silly and I really don't
