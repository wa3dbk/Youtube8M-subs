00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.499 
does come in a double size and I think
they<00:01:33.079> make<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:33.319> even<00:01:33.469> bigger<00:01:33.770> size<00:01:34.329> but<00:01:35.329> the

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
they make it even bigger size but the

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.719 
they make it even bigger size but the
two<00:01:35.810> sizes<00:01:36.259> so<00:01:36.380> this<00:01:36.530> one<00:01:36.709> is<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:36.950> 39<00:01:37.369> for<00:01:37.670> the

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
two sizes so this one is the 39 for the

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.389 
two sizes so this one is the 39 for the
120<00:01:38.119> mill<00:01:38.329> and<00:01:38.569> then<00:01:39.020> the<00:01:39.139> 240<00:01:39.740> ml<00:01:39.889> bat<00:01:40.219> one

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
120 mill and then the 240 ml bat one

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.789 
120 mill and then the 240 ml bat one
goes<00:01:40.579> for<00:01:40.819> just<00:01:41.030> under<00:01:41.179> 50<00:01:41.719> so<00:01:42.109> if<00:01:42.380> you<00:01:42.530> are

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
goes for just under 50 so if you are

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.069 
goes for just under 50 so if you are
comfortable<00:01:43.579> with<00:01:43.880> using<00:01:44.209> this<00:01:44.450> product<00:01:44.780> or

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
comfortable with using this product or

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.499 
comfortable with using this product or
using<00:01:45.380> regular<00:01:45.799> fake<00:01:46.009> tans<00:01:46.279> then<00:01:47.029> I<00:01:47.299> would

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:47.509 
using regular fake tans then I would

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:48.940 
using regular fake tans then I would
suggest<00:01:47.539> buying<00:01:47.959> the<00:01:48.289> bigger<00:01:48.499> version

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
suggest buying the bigger version

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.739 
suggest buying the bigger version
because<00:01:49.069> it<00:01:49.219> just<00:01:49.340> makes<00:01:49.579> more<00:01:49.759> sense<00:01:50.060> I<00:01:50.299> mean

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
because it just makes more sense I mean

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:53.019 
because it just makes more sense I mean
I<00:01:50.990> just<00:01:51.859> find<00:01:52.009> this<00:01:52.130> just<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.429> try<00:01:52.639> it<00:01:52.670> out<00:01:52.850> just

00:01:53.019 --> 00:01:53.029 
I just find this just to try it out just

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:54.399 
I just find this just to try it out just
to<00:01:53.149> show<00:01:53.299> you<00:01:53.329> guys<00:01:53.569> what<00:01:53.779> the<00:01:53.869> color<00:01:54.049> is<00:01:54.139> like

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
to show you guys what the color is like

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.349 
to show you guys what the color is like
and<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.979> problem<00:01:55.219> with<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.639> video<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:56.119> is

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:56.359 
and the problem with the video is is

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:58.389 
and the problem with the video is is
that<00:01:56.509> I<00:01:56.539> actually<00:01:56.779> did<00:01:57.109> it<00:01:57.139> on<00:01:57.350> my<00:01:57.529> arm<00:01:57.560> on<00:01:58.039> this

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
that I actually did it on my arm on this

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.219 
that I actually did it on my arm on this
side<00:01:58.609> but<00:01:58.819> you<00:01:58.909> can't<00:01:59.149> really<00:01:59.359> tell<00:01:59.689> so

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
side but you can't really tell so

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.349 
side but you can't really tell so
unfortunately<00:02:01.099> I'm<00:02:01.670> gonna<00:02:01.849> have<00:02:01.909> to<00:02:02.090> apply<00:02:02.299> it

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:02.359 
unfortunately I'm gonna have to apply it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.999 
unfortunately I'm gonna have to apply it
again<00:02:02.749> and<00:02:03.020> maybe<00:02:03.200> do<00:02:03.469> it<00:02:03.590> in<00:02:03.679> a<00:02:03.740> blog<00:02:03.979> post

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
again and maybe do it in a blog post

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.859 
again and maybe do it in a blog post
actually<00:02:04.729> show<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:04.969> the<00:02:05.090> before<00:02:05.209> and<00:02:05.509> after

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
actually show you the before and after

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.440 
actually show you the before and after
and<00:02:06.170> yeah<00:02:07.099> it<00:02:07.310> really<00:02:07.579> like<00:02:07.880> when<00:02:07.999> I<00:02:08.030> put<00:02:08.240> it<00:02:08.270> on

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
and yeah it really like when I put it on

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.210 
and yeah it really like when I put it on
initially<00:02:08.840> because<00:02:09.140> it<00:02:09.289> does<00:02:09.440> have<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.679> tint<00:02:10.009> to

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
initially because it does have a tint to

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.650 
initially because it does have a tint to
it<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.490> could<00:02:10.880> see<00:02:11.090> that<00:02:11.210> it<00:02:11.270> was<00:02:11.390> going<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.570> be

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
it I could see that it was going to be

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.910 
it I could see that it was going to be
nice<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.080> dark<00:02:12.260> but<00:02:12.500> I'm<00:02:12.590> gonna<00:02:12.740> have<00:02:12.830> to

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
nice and dark but I'm gonna have to

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.880 
nice and dark but I'm gonna have to
apply<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.160> again<00:02:13.430> tonight

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
apply it again tonight

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.720 
apply it again tonight
to<00:02:13.980> really<00:02:14.400> get<00:02:15.060> that<00:02:15.270> payoff<00:02:15.540> um<00:02:16.400> but<00:02:17.400> bottom

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
to really get that payoff um but bottom

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:18.800 
to really get that payoff um but bottom
line<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.090> probably<00:02:18.300> one<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.600> better

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
line this is probably one of the better

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.080 
line this is probably one of the better
fake<00:02:19.380> tans<00:02:19.620> out<00:02:19.860> there<00:02:20.190> because<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.730> have
