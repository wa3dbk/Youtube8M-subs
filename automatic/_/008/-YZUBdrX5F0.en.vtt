00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.879
 Today is finally the video for sepp 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:10.559
 Trumm those whom I have mine 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.360
 shipments of 12 mm what you do 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.099
 standard size is actually 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.699
 anyone in it has or stung 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.410
 gets stretched to 1.6 mm and not at all 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.010
 At some point in the comments you have yes 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.580
 just stick with the actual 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.630
 people are not with me and me 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.140
 also knows about other people 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.940
 It was not like that right now 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.040
 and that's why I thought so 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:44.480
 I have my video so at the very beginning 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:49.170
 was up so see are from each 1.2 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.079
 and that's how they look like in terms of their strength 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.440
 second lane really does look that out 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.190
 per 1.6 are I do not know how good 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.250
 now sharp her kettcar has something 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.719
 I mean 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.000
 yes, I just thought 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.479
 it just becomes so it was me 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.549
 However, at the beginning I thought 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.659
 so easy to open by inserting the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.770
 has this in here with 1.2 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.850
 was not so it did not have at all 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.130
 works then I tried 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.009
 So still knows at home and to a 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.320
 Plug it to the ear 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.580
 actually to two millimeters during 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.439
 it's just kind of stuck like that 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.990
 that wants to go a little bit myself too 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.329
 not really worked well then 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.450
 it has already hurt a lot and got sick 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.909
 nose is also sensitive and so and so 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.880
 so that 14 gone the next day also 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.420
 told 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.450
 he's clear and has it with him 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.740
 a very thin service off so 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.200
 Not at all that it was such a thing 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.810
 the state, so to speak, if I nose here 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.880
 is so stung by and then that's it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.219
 we immediately afterwards wins 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.390
 laptop because they are pushed through as well 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.520
 therefore also with a normal day 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:07.290
 do the merit yes and then it has 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.489
 First of all, it hurt a lot berlin and 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.170
 After that it was at least ten weeks 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.600
 again as if it had stuffed new 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.410
 tasted really vital and so on 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.810
 really stupid it's not taken so long 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.940
 long takes as important or so then 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.640
 lasts six weeks anyway 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.020
 four is free after one 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.270
 It was relatively good again this week 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:30.210
 it really hurt a lot more 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.670
 as a stinging than when that was in it was 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.500
 really very pleasant feeling 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.910
 I will definitely believe me 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.750
 let you stretch further example the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.750
 size actually good 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.190
 yes and that is 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.570
 I still have so little 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.350
 fawn and in the stone in it 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:54.450
 the still has the size of 1.6 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.910
 So 1.6 millimeters thick with it strength 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.470
 from this reports through which I believe 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.020
 that's eight millimeters at most 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.360
 not have or six here is the 96 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.010
 I think here is the 8 so now 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.930
 times to compare I think so too 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:12.780
 the 8 is always hard and this is the one 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.270
 ring 6 I still find the balls 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.350
 hard to pick 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.000
 I really like a whole 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.670
 small thin dapd i find myself 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.530
 actually the nicest I think 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.280
 Here is a centimeter or so 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.350
 also bent 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.450
 He is one centimeter in diameter 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.280
 he's really big, too, i find her 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.660
 with me because I'm not so much 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.840
 actually have a nice place if the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.330
 are small and that's why I have 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.910
 actually prefer these little ones just like that 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.770
 with small meadow clear that's okay 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.790
 now her thick ball but the 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.320
 silver bullet were made 'turn 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.800
 yes of course you have too 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.550
 experience in the sector to so I mean 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.580
 also served 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.170
 this is now one 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.760
 centimeters served there I have so all 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.680
 fans in the cinema 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.630
 ten days snail if you want 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.490
 you can also imagine that he needs for 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.660
 I can not do that too 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:11.870
 like to make a video like me 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:15.799
 tinkered off namely yes and yes on 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.390
 1.1 centimeters so stretched millimeters 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.770
 where was actually pretty easy 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.640
 But I did that pretty roughly 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:24.060
 made a lot of mistakes and fit that way 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.340
 would 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.389
 ten millimeters 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.310
 but it hurt much less 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.490
 I have some big steps and 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:39.039
 also done quickly and here I am wrong 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.470
 sometimes hurt too much like yourself 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.389
 So that was still personal with me 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.599
 Of course a lot of pain has to be done too 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:48.789
 so here is natural for everyone 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:52.090
 difference as always and always 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.069
 also on the subject yes why this martin 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.660
 I think these are a bit thick rings 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.979
 honestly just says nice than this 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.020
 very thin 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.080
 I know where I like you 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.880
 better and that's the point, ultimately 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.750
 he has to deal with it that they in themselves 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:12.099
 mirror sees what with what you in the 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.979
 mirror sees fits taken yes and yes 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:34.900
 However, we have such a tentacle bastl video 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:36.099
 somebody else wanted to write somehow 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.280
 my comments if you had her 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:45.490
 video you want to have tentacles 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:51.940
 video yes because I think that's it 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:55.000
 now and think about writing from the 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.009
 Day offers and what only me personally 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.949
 someone was very interested 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:03.099
 further served so on 2 mm or something 

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:06.159
 or so because I would like to know whether his 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:08.080
 worth less because no idea anyway 

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:10.900
 So first of all all the hat also mostly 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.419
 that's why most of the time I would 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.570
 I'm very interested in it but now for 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.570
 you
