river<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:42.540> river<00:00:42.780> would<00:00:43.260> encode<00:00:44.040> my

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
river and the river would encode my

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.610 
river and the river would encode my
screencast<00:00:45.120> into<00:00:47.120> what<00:00:48.120> friendly<00:00:49.079> Flash

and the closing object tag okay this is

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.700 
and the closing object tag okay this is
how<00:01:51.479> browser<00:01:51.780> knows<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:53.399> it's<00:01:53.700> an<00:01:54.060> object

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
how browser knows that it's an object

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.499 
how browser knows that it's an object
okay<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:57.500> it's<00:01:58.500> important<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.969> give

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
okay and it's important that you give

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:09.430 
okay and it's important that you give
the<00:02:00.719> object<00:02:00.869> a<00:02:01.409> width<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.340> height<00:02:03.110> okay

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.970 

so<00:02:10.700> let's<00:02:11.700> do<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:13.910> YouTube<00:02:14.910> flash<00:02:15.420> video<00:02:15.959> okay<00:02:16.770> a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
so let's do a YouTube flash video okay a

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.180 
so let's do a YouTube flash video okay a
very<00:02:17.430> simple<00:02:18.090> one<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:20.670> default<00:02:22.190> close

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
very simple one and the default close

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.640 
very simple one and the default close
snippet<00:02:24.260> always<00:02:25.260> sets<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:26.040> object<00:02:26.819> to<00:02:27.120> be

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
snippet always sets the object to be

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.620 
snippet always sets the object to be
width<00:02:28.650> of<00:02:29.060> 245<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.350> height<00:02:31.350> of<00:02:31.610> 355<00:02:33.290> okay<00:02:35.630> so

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
width of 245 and height of 355 okay so

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.190 
width of 245 and height of 355 okay so
once<00:02:37.530> we<00:02:37.680> have<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.010> width<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.550> height<00:02:39.200> we

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
once we have the width and the height we

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.390 
once we have the width and the height we
want<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.800> tell<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.250> browser<00:02:43.010> what<00:02:44.010> kind<00:02:44.280> of

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
want to tell the browser what kind of

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.900 
want to tell the browser what kind of
object<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.350> okay<00:02:46.350> and<00:02:46.560> this<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.459> when<00:02:47.700> the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
object it is okay and this is when the

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.520 
object it is okay and this is when the
parameters<00:02:48.810> tag<00:02:49.680> come<00:02:50.100> in<00:02:51.260> parameter<00:02:52.260> I

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
parameters tag come in parameter I

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.590 
parameters tag come in parameter I
program<00:02:53.390> okay

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
program okay

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:01.309 
program okay
and<00:02:56.030> inside<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.540> opening<00:02:58.200> per<00:02:58.500> am<00:02:58.739> tag<00:03:00.319> you

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
and inside the opening per am tag you

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.949 
and inside the opening per am tag you
have<00:03:01.440> to<00:03:01.739> give<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.069> name<00:03:02.549> equals<00:03:03.380> movie<00:03:05.959> value

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
have to give it name equals movie value

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.630 
have to give it name equals movie value
equals<00:03:07.850> think<00:03:08.850> of<00:03:08.970> value<00:03:09.360> as<00:03:09.569> the<00:03:10.170> SRC<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.280> the

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
equals think of value as the SRC and the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.509 
equals think of value as the SRC and the
image<00:03:11.970> tag<00:03:12.299> where<00:03:12.959> it's<00:03:13.260> trying<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.920> find<00:03:14.190> the

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
image tag where it's trying to find the

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.789 
image tag where it's trying to find the
path<00:03:14.730> to<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.480> image<00:03:15.660> okay

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
path to the image okay

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:24.680 
path to the image okay
in<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.880> case<00:03:21.290> we<00:03:22.290> do<00:03:23.160> this<00:03:23.459> have<00:03:24.359> a<00:03:24.390> little

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
in this case we do this have a little

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:32.560 
in this case we do this have a little
cheat<00:03:25.320> code<00:03:25.590> here<00:03:25.980> okay<00:03:27.000> I<00:03:29.930> like<00:03:30.930> cut<00:03:31.530> and

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:49.000 
same value as this in the parameter so
let's<00:05:43.030> copy<00:05:44.030> or<00:05:44.450> control<00:05:44.720> C<00:05:46.240> paste<00:05:47.560> or<00:05:48.560> control

V alright so now we have the most simple

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.850 
V alright so now we have the most simple
object<00:05:53.810> setup<00:05:54.820> I<00:05:56.350> wouldn't<00:05:57.350> say<00:05:57.470> the<00:05:57.650> most

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
object setup I wouldn't say the most

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.630 
object setup I wouldn't say the most
simple<00:05:58.340> but<00:05:59.500> simple<00:06:00.500> enough<00:06:00.530> okay

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
simple but simple enough okay

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.150 
simple but simple enough okay
so<00:06:01.850> let's<00:06:02.090> save<00:06:02.390> it<00:06:02.419> and<00:06:02.750> that's<00:06:03.260> view<00:06:03.770> it<00:06:03.890> in<00:06:04.040> a

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
so let's save it and that's view it in a

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:14.159 
so let's save it and that's view it in a
browser

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:19.529 

okay<00:06:14.939> so<00:06:15.939> you<00:06:16.900> see<00:06:17.110> this<00:06:17.289> video<00:06:17.939> it's<00:06:18.939> still<00:06:19.509> a

little<00:06:19.749> bit<00:06:19.960> too<00:06:20.110> big<00:06:20.349> so<00:06:20.830> let's<00:06:20.939> try<00:06:21.939> to<00:06:21.999> make

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
little bit too big so let's try to make

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.700 
little bit too big so let's try to make
it<00:06:22.330> smaller<00:06:22.719> let's<00:06:23.080> make<00:06:23.259> it<00:06:23.400> 400<00:06:25.409> and<00:06:26.409> then

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
it smaller let's make it 400 and then

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.040 
it smaller let's make it 400 and then
let's<00:06:27.099> make<00:06:27.400> it<00:06:27.779> 310

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
let's make it 310

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.879 
let's make it 310
I<00:06:30.330> made<00:06:31.330> the<00:06:31.509> number<00:06:31.779> up<00:06:31.900> so<00:06:32.319> it<00:06:33.310> might<00:06:33.520> not<00:06:33.759> be

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
I made the number up so it might not be

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:38.399 
I made the number up so it might not be
proportional<00:06:35.889> then<00:06:36.580> we<00:06:36.699> load<00:06:36.939> it<00:06:37.229> but<00:06:38.229> we'll

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
proportional then we load it but we'll

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:45.589 
proportional then we load it but we'll
see<00:06:40.110> you're<00:06:41.110> fresh<00:06:43.110> okay<00:06:44.139> it's<00:06:44.439> not<00:06:44.800> too<00:06:45.159> bad

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
see you're fresh okay it's not too bad

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:55.649 
see you're fresh okay it's not too bad
