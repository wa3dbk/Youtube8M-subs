00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:11.240

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
slave one Boba Fett's ship now I had

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.820 
slave one Boba Fett's ship now I had
done<00:00:19.710> review<00:00:20.160> earlier<00:00:20.490> on<00:00:21.380> the<00:00:22.380> Darth<00:00:22.710> Vader

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
done review earlier on the Darth Vader

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.779 
done review earlier on the Darth Vader
TIE<00:00:23.550> fighter<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:25.189> basically<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.550> was

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
TIE fighter and basically that was

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.210 
TIE fighter and basically that was
because<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.300> wanted<00:00:27.720> something<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.560> go<00:00:28.890> with

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
because I wanted something to go with

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.260 
because I wanted something to go with
the<00:00:29.970> display<00:00:30.689> of<00:00:31.320> my<00:00:31.710> life-size<00:00:32.279> bust<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:35.270> my

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
the display of my life-size bust and my

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.090 
the display of my life-size bust and my
thinking<00:00:36.899> was<00:00:38.570> that<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.559> get<00:00:40.770> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
thinking was that I was going to get the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.190 
thinking was that I was going to get the
Premium<00:00:41.899> Format<00:00:42.899> figure<00:00:43.670> of<00:00:44.670> Boba<00:00:45.120> Fett<00:00:45.450> which

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
Premium Format figure of Boba Fett which

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.670 
Premium Format figure of Boba Fett which

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
is coming soon and I thought I had want

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.510 
is coming soon and I thought I had want
his<00:00:49.950> ship<00:00:50.280> also<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:51.649> I<00:00:52.649> was<00:00:53.039> doing<00:00:53.340> some

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
his ship also and I was doing some

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.779 
his ship also and I was doing some
research<00:00:53.670> today<00:00:54.329> on<00:00:54.690> code<00:00:55.350> three<00:00:55.800> because

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
research today on code three because

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.599 
research today on code three because
after<00:00:57.149> looking<00:00:57.300> at<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> TIE<00:00:57.899> fighter<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.710> was

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
after looking at the TIE fighter I was

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.900 
after looking at the TIE fighter I was
really<00:01:00.059> impressed<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> quality<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.910> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
really impressed with the quality of the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.679 
really impressed with the quality of the
ship<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.890> the<00:01:04.890> level<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.430> detail<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:06.450> went

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
ship and the level of detail that went

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.280 
ship and the level of detail that went
into<00:01:06.900> him<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.760> I<00:01:08.760> had<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.510> slave<00:01:09.869> one

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
into him and I had the slave one

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.570 
into him and I had the slave one
downstairs<00:01:11.189> sitting<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.119> box<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:13.580> I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
downstairs sitting in the box and I

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.760 
downstairs sitting in the box and I
wasn't<00:01:15.240> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.450> really<00:01:15.780> open<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.320> till<00:01:16.590> I

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
wasn't going to really open it till I

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.270 
wasn't going to really open it till I
got<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:17.130> Premium<00:01:17.610> Format<00:01:17.850> figure<00:01:18.890> but<00:01:19.890> after

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
got the Premium Format figure but after

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.450 
got the Premium Format figure but after
its<00:01:20.430> doing<00:01:20.759> some<00:01:21.030> research<00:01:21.710> today<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:23.509> saw<00:01:24.509> that

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
its doing some research today I saw that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.830 
its doing some research today I saw that
code<00:01:26.460> three<00:01:27.060> made<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:28.229> couple<00:01:28.920> different<00:01:29.840> types

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
code three made a couple different types

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.190 
code three made a couple different types
of<00:01:31.110> ships<00:01:31.439> and<00:01:32.659> one<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.780> them<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
signature series and that series came

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.590 
signature series and that series came
with<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.979> signature<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.990> actor<00:01:43.799> that

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
actually a signature series I know this

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.570 
actually a signature series I know this
is<00:04:38.180> going<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.390> be<00:04:38.450> backwards<00:04:38.960> because<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:40.370> is

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
is going to be backwards because it is

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:46.680 
is going to be backwards because it is
the<00:04:40.760> MacBook<00:04:42.070> but<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.400> can<00:04:43.610> see<00:04:44.060> the<00:04:44.590> plaque

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
the MacBook but you can see the plaque

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:58.320 
the MacBook but you can see the plaque
which<00:04:47.690> is<00:04:48.610> Jeremy<00:04:49.610> Bulloch<00:04:51.160> Boba<00:04:52.160> Fett<00:04:54.970> now

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:07.720 

these<00:04:59.330> move<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:03.020> cockpit<00:05:03.740> actually<00:05:04.490> tilts<00:05:06.730> if

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
these move the cockpit actually tilts if

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.650 
these move the cockpit actually tilts if
you<00:05:08.090> move<00:05:08.330> it<00:05:08.570> you<00:05:08.780> can<00:05:09.170> pick<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:10.450> vehicle<00:05:11.450> up

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:19.480 

first<00:05:14.660> landing<00:05:15.530> you<00:05:16.520> know<00:05:16.730> mode<00:05:17.240> I<00:05:18.400> thought<00:05:19.400> it

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:19.490 
first landing you know mode I thought it

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.320 
first landing you know mode I thought it
looks<00:05:19.670> pretty<00:05:20.030> cool<00:05:21.100> if<00:05:22.100> you<00:05:22.340> can<00:05:22.520> see<00:05:22.880> that

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
looks pretty cool if you can see that

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.210 
looks pretty cool if you can see that
cockpit<00:05:24.080> now<00:05:25.780> you<00:05:26.780> see<00:05:27.050> this<00:05:27.260> and<00:05:27.650> you<00:05:27.830> can<00:05:28.010> see

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
cockpit now you see this and you can see

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.370 
cockpit now you see this and you can see
it<00:05:28.400> it<00:05:28.610> swivels<00:05:31.960> depending<00:05:32.960> on<00:05:33.110> if<00:05:33.230> you're

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
it it swivels depending on if you're

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.360 
it it swivels depending on if you're
flying<00:05:33.740> or<00:05:34.190> landing<00:05:34.910> the<00:05:35.270> the<00:05:36.140> cockpit<00:05:36.980> itself

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
flying or landing the the cockpit itself

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.030 
flying or landing the the cockpit itself
actually<00:05:37.640> swivels<00:05:38.410> which<00:05:39.410> I<00:05:39.590> thought<00:05:39.860> was

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
actually swivels which I thought was

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.000 
actually swivels which I thought was
pretty<00:05:40.100> cool

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.580 

you<00:05:43.640> also<00:05:43.910> get<00:05:45.220> bring<00:05:46.220> back<00:05:46.430> a<00:05:46.460> wider<00:05:46.790> shot<00:05:47.590> you

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
you also get bring back a wider shot you

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:58.840 
you also get bring back a wider shot you

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
get a Han Solo in carbonite and it

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.750 
get a Han Solo in carbonite and it
actually<00:05:59.390> came<00:05:59.810> also<00:06:00.680> with<00:06:01.490> an<00:06:01.880> acrylic<00:06:02.810> case

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
actually came also with an acrylic case

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.810 
actually came also with an acrylic case
that<00:06:04.760> goes<00:06:05.030> over<00:06:05.660> the<00:06:05.870> top<00:06:05.900> of<00:06:06.380> it<00:06:06.560> and<00:06:07.550> now<00:06:07.790> I'm

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
that goes over the top of it and now I'm

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.780 
that goes over the top of it and now I'm
really<00:06:08.660> impressed<00:06:09.020> with<00:06:09.260> these<00:06:10.300> code<00:06:11.300> three

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
really impressed with these code three

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:17.530 
really impressed with these code three
ships<00:06:13.790> and<00:06:14.440> I'm<00:06:15.440> thinking<00:06:15.980> about<00:06:16.540> collecting

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:17.540 
ships and I'm thinking about collecting

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.170 
ships and I'm thinking about collecting
all<00:06:17.810> of<00:06:17.960> them<00:06:18.110> now<00:06:18.320> because<00:06:19.010> they're<00:06:19.640> really

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
all of them now because they're really

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.720 
all of them now because they're really
really<00:06:20.830> detailed<00:06:21.830> they're<00:06:23.590> actually<00:06:24.730> made

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:25.730 
really detailed they're actually made

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.870 
really detailed they're actually made
off<00:06:26.150> casts<00:06:26.960> and<00:06:27.110> models<00:06:27.590> of<00:06:27.830> the<00:06:27.950> actual<00:06:28.490> ships

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
off casts and models of the actual ships

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.810 
off casts and models of the actual ships
to<00:06:29.180> use<00:06:29.420> for<00:06:29.870> filming<00:06:30.380> of<00:06:31.300> Star<00:06:32.300> Wars<00:06:32.330> and
