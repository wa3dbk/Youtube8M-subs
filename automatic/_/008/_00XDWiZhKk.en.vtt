ground and driving the body forward now
let's<00:01:13.120> through<00:01:13.300> our<00:01:13.420> let<00:01:13.630> goes<00:01:13.870> with<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:14.320> little

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
let's through our let goes with a little

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.430 
let's through our let goes with a little
bit<00:01:14.890> of<00:01:14.920> resistance<00:01:15.810> follow<00:01:16.810> the<00:01:17.020> athlete

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
bit of resistance follow the athlete

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.110 
bit of resistance follow the athlete
forward<00:01:17.920> so<00:01:18.100> we<00:01:18.220> get<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.460> same<00:01:18.730> starting

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
forward so we get the same starting

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.260 
forward so we get the same starting
position<00:01:19.420> as<00:01:19.900> last<00:01:20.140> time<00:01:20.460> then<00:01:21.460> explode<00:01:22.000> into

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
position as last time then explode into

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.770 
position as last time then explode into
a<00:01:22.420> full<00:01:22.720> sprint<00:01:23.200> after<00:01:23.530> 3<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.340> 4<00:01:24.640> steps<00:01:24.970> let<00:01:25.660> him

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
a full sprint after 3 to 4 steps let him

slingshot and fire them out we want to

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.730 
slingshot and fire them out we want to
get<00:01:32.830> a<00:01:32.860> little<00:01:33.190> extra<00:01:33.460> muscle<00:01:33.940> recruitment

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740
