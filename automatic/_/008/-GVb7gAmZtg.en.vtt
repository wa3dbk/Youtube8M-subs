Chomper this is the third Boston tier
three<00:01:37.490> now<00:01:38.120> the<00:01:38.180> most<00:01:38.360> important<00:01:38.810> thing<00:01:38.840> to

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.050 
three now the most important thing to

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.900 
three now the most important thing to
remember<00:01:39.170> is<00:01:39.470> that<00:01:39.500> randomly<00:01:40.220> drew<00:01:40.670> guard

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
remember is that randomly drew guard

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.180 
remember is that randomly drew guard
will<00:01:41.030> throw<00:01:41.210> out<00:01:41.240> food<00:01:41.690> as<00:01:41.960> we'll<00:01:42.170> see<00:01:42.380> here<00:01:42.620> in

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
will throw out food as we'll see here in

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.650 
will throw out food as we'll see here in
a<00:01:43.280> second<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:43.670> choppers<00:01:44.000> gonna<00:01:44.090> go<00:01:44.270> eat<00:01:44.450> that

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
a second and choppers gonna go eat that

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.900 
a second and choppers gonna go eat that
so<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:44.960> need<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.500> go<00:01:45.620> and<00:01:45.950> eat<00:01:46.100> that<00:01:46.130> meat<00:01:46.640> hunk

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
so you need to go and eat that meat hunk

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.000 
so you need to go and eat that meat hunk
before<00:01:47.750> chopard<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.260> because<00:01:48.560> chopper<00:01:48.890> will

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
before chopard is because chopper will

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.680 
before chopard is because chopper will
become<00:01:49.340> so<00:01:49.610> much<00:01:49.729> stronger<00:01:50.000> if<00:01:50.270> he<00:01:50.360> eats<00:01:50.510> those

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
become so much stronger if he eats those

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.810 
become so much stronger if he eats those

first<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.640> mean<00:02:07.790> I<00:02:07.850> have<00:02:07.940> a<00:02:07.970> little<00:02:08.119> bit<00:02:08.240> of<00:02:08.270> AOE

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
first I mean I have a little bit of AOE

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.359 
first I mean I have a little bit of AOE
so<00:02:08.869> they're<00:02:08.990> both<00:02:09.110> going<00:02:09.320> down<00:02:09.410> now<00:02:10.190> when

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
so they're both going down now when

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.040 
so they're both going down now when
Chomper<00:02:10.729> evolves<00:02:11.270> after<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.600> kill<00:02:11.810> streak

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
Chomper evolves after you kill streak

are the one thing you have to watch out
for<00:02:13.550> is<00:02:13.820> his<00:02:13.940> leap<00:02:14.209> right<00:02:14.420> there<00:02:14.690> if<00:02:15.350> he<00:02:15.530> hits

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
for is his leap right there if he hits

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.530 
for is his leap right there if he hits
you<00:02:15.830> with<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.130> then<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.850> are<00:02:16.880> pretty<00:02:17.390> much

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
you with that then you are pretty much

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.720 
you with that then you are pretty much
dead<00:02:17.810> already<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:18.440> we're<00:02:18.770> on<00:02:18.800> to<00:02:19.040> Leo<00:02:19.250> G<00:02:19.370> the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.420 
stage the first thing to talk about is
this<00:02:26.959> cosmic<00:02:27.380> grip<00:02:27.530> these<00:02:27.770> will<00:02:27.950> appear<00:02:28.220> every

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
this cosmic grip these will appear every

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.040 
this cosmic grip these will appear every
once<00:02:28.580> in<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.760> while<00:02:28.940> trying<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.450> pull<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.810> and
