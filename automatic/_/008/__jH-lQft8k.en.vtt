00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.169
 fanatics there just flaunt handkerchiefs a very simple and affordable supplement 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.330
 for all but that can really make a difference in ohio I for 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:24.070
 example there come with an American and with a basic shirt of sight but 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.349
 thank you now spanish that bring I will get 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:28.919
 give a different touch 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.489
 for example here I have 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:34.340
 a handkerchief of plant motifs are specifically 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.910
 peacock feathers that the truth is that this country is from turÃ­cuaro any 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.270
 fan go crazy ong country 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.730
 both and very lethal green colors more steal - 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.880
 and for example 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.880
 placing mines in this simple way 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.390
 and waiting for the elderly 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.830
 good way to deny a different touch 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.040
 for example with him 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.020
 the sailors of Seattle are going to get effe 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.750
 the agenda that we have a handkerchief 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.670
 black white affirmed 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.860
 who visit and tawakkul also works better 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.130
 Sailors salary there we go 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.200
 and sure that traspasa comparsa Sanchez 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.150
 and is that for example 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.060
 we can not put it like that 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.270
 even 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.280
 with the asad 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.620
 to give a concert 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.430
 a little further 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.170
 so for example any Martian summer evening late 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.170
 this was just getting out of step and being very low 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.200
 I offered the appointment 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200
 it's the style 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760
 the tragedy of haiti 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.550
 we have this panel 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.480
 When we leave, we suggest you 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.199
 and a base 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.609
 but we think it is divine narco and look totally 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:04.489
 my tendency of the whole aspen is striking a month
