00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.730 

yeah<00:06:08.700> typically<00:06:09.630> how<00:06:09.900> long<00:06:10.110> does<00:06:10.290> the<00:06:10.530> dog

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
yeah typically how long does the dog

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.430 
yeah typically how long does the dog
dukey<00:06:11.250> to<00:06:11.550> lift<00:06:11.790> their<00:06:11.940> leg<00:06:12.120> up<00:06:12.270> like<00:06:12.420> that<00:06:12.690> as

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
dukey to lift their leg up like that as

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.010 
dukey to lift their leg up like that as
soon<00:06:13.530> as<00:06:13.830> she<00:06:13.890> stops<00:06:14.750> concentrating<00:06:15.750> on<00:06:15.870> it

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:16.020 
soon as she stops concentrating on it

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.090 
soon as she stops concentrating on it
and<00:06:16.110> gets<00:06:16.260> distracted<00:06:16.560> with<00:06:16.800> something<00:06:17.010> else

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
and gets distracted with something else

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.430 
and gets distracted with something else
she<00:06:17.250> won't<00:06:17.370> lift<00:06:17.580> her<00:06:17.700> leg<00:06:17.880> like<00:06:18.030> that<00:06:18.440> so

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
she won't lift her leg like that so

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.200 
she won't lift her leg like that so
that's<00:06:19.650> why<00:06:19.830> I'm<00:06:20.220> kind<00:06:20.520> of<00:06:20.610> working<00:06:20.940> with<00:06:21.060> this

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
that's why I'm kind of working with this

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:24.680 
that's why I'm kind of working with this
it<00:06:21.810> may<00:06:22.470> not<00:06:22.620> work
