 all 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.079
 by the fifth amendment of the language mm 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.929
 as a mold of shipments and modern humanism 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.109
 this because I do not agree with what he saw 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.109
 ee consistory after 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.940
 it's a good reason to believe that I see 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.949
 and be able to help many people 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.280
 I have the same doubt 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.530
 but it happened with friends that is not a disc partner 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.320
 percent from a point 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.160
 since this sale does not participate in trying to skate partition it 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.150
 it appears that the image is mounted 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.100
 then the only thing that we are 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.410
 I wrote it 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.030
 and how it adapts 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.479
 shortly before I have no objections we wanted 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:58.490
 this do something very fast 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.490
 we saw improvised 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.840
 mmmmm 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.260
 do not 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.660
 do not 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.660
 Naomi 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.970
 we have not finished no no no 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:38.470
 mondragón of general regime and 90 homeland activity we have not even when 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.079
 it seemed by 12 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.310
 no parents or cohabitants of the same good there were no inconveniences of any 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.009
 real property 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.310
 of the votes of the bonds of germany a lot of companies in summer but good 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.780
 is that I would like to explain that in a few months two weeks in the same way as 

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.850
 name well 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.010
 return me with return here appear in pakistan 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.850
 but san andrés providence in which only mm wine companies to try 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.310
 the sister world no hard drive and its sales also as my 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.540
 friend emaya nothing bothers me roundabout operative 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.659
 we want 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.279
 for those who use google world and they packed 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.559
 baba with 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.679
 what we are going to do is cumbersome system 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.089
 This space 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.179
 gibson brown 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:39.689
 not in dialogue with dyn in india germany the bayern 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:46.869
 for someone from some member of the world but when he started to become a 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.829
 phenomenon 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.409
 also the bar of a job with him also 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:52.859
 bardem 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.039
 For that 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:57.769
 once 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.769
 found the abject 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.099
 read 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.730
 no pd will not be because of not having the ball again because I know if 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.369
 all right 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.619
 we managed to understand well the 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:25.999
 of datexco are installed from January to the English nador zone where they do not 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:26.639
 they have 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:29.809
 but the former minister to the station 

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.809
 basically we are doing well while nissan 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.329
 by which we will be able to ap 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.719
 percent the modification of our patience good this case indeed 

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:44.399
 the virtual backpack was loaded 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:46.239
 so that 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.909
 explain this 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:50.909
 so small size and my hard drive 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.479
 these the patches that chávez 

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:58.179
 you are left 

00:03:58.179 --> 00:04:01.779
 ubuntu chávez the past logically 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:05.649
 that's why with a serious touch 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.579
 No cheating union your benzema containers 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:16.709
 in this event bilbao in less than environment 

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:22.300
 in a week in full flight in the new year 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.620
 nor in holy week 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.120
 because 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.120
 I played an act of pettiness 8 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.180
 Once this is done, what are we going to do? 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.110
 advance this follows 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.110
 Beijing after losing 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.990
 and is that we are going to move it d recommend 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.529
 which can 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.300
 this 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.249
 luévano that would be 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:56.110
 left to have done 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.029
 for is a way to avoid it 

00:04:59.029 --> 00:05:02.029
 so that the main record 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:07.039
 oo the piñera part 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:10.879
 since then 4 min had a hard time in a big deal 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.650
 before a problem because they resize in this way 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:21.020
 it is not a new problem when wanting to occupy space that is between two partitions 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:26.580
 that is to say and make the disc the previous main cupbearers 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.580
 the party the main partition the summits asked 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.900
 this is why offering to mention peking you are simply going to choose that the 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.009
 size that you need the one that will occupy free discrete participate and 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.610
 I the healthy body 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.610
 besides that they assume 400 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.869
 you can see here what we are doing is the status of gray spaces 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:56.360
 in free 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.229
 and good is simply those who are going to do the terminal stage I am here i in 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:04.849
 presence of the young 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.889
 min 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.330
 what we already have free this our space without assigning common here and which 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.909
 we suggest men who castiglioni 

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.220
 a value of 3 points minus three leagues so the score 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.740
 and good for simply to apply the changes 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.569
 and we are going to see click here in this polemic 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.569
 don Vicente apply all the improvement 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:33.099
 we are not going to do 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:38.419
 upa it seems this entente that we exist insurance of grown so much in his price 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:39.280
 pending 

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.280
 and they can not 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:49.439
 morán missile months 

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:52.550
 January to the family in the world 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.900
 while from mmmmm 

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.039
 the power of a trillion 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:03.020
 I bless the great ones of the real world 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.060
 the big since then two of emo very well 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:11.069
 for very fast as a movement yet 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.610
 very good really from the morning 10 in the morning 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:17.550
 they must bridge 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.430
 both come from losing money 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.360
 and now 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.129
 approximately lottery one hour deborah jacobs hours 

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:27.529
 lights 

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:30.539
 something so weird 

00:07:30.539 --> 00:07:32.830
 that's why you should not do it to us since 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.680
 the program 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.010
 ensures that everything is correct that there is no 

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:41.919
 October can be downloaded or lost that 

00:07:41.919 --> 00:07:44.970
 affect us p our is ubuntu operative 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.129
 star goalkeeper 

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:52.499
 Good Perez, here ends the video 

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:55.129

00:07:55.129 --> 00:07:56.800
 I do not know what they understood me 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.279
 xxx 

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:02.279
 they are keep sending me messages 

00:08:03.129 --> 00:08:07.409
 and good think about it was wearing the shirt that this video reaches other people 

00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:11.969
 and how do they understand that keep 

00:08:11.969 --> 00:08:12.549
