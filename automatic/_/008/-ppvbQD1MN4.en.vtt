hard<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.009> close<00:00:32.219> because<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> folds<00:00:33.989> they

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
hard to close because of the folds they

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.590 
hard to close because of the folds they
cannot<00:00:34.410> be<00:00:34.559> very<00:00:34.770> wide<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:36.210> you're<00:00:36.360> going<00:00:36.510> to

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
quarters before not going all the way

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
quarters before not going all the way
down<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.960> just<00:01:31.259> stop<00:01:31.950> before<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.430> side<00:01:32.850> on

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
down you just stop before the side on

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.100 
down you just stop before the side on
the<00:01:33.180> second<00:01:33.540> row<00:01:34.400> and<00:01:35.400> here<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.180> gonna<00:01:36.390> show

the second row and here I'm gonna show
you<00:01:38.360> how<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> score<00:01:39.869> lines<00:01:40.110> are<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.369> can

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
you how the score lines are so you can

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
you how the score lines are so you can
see<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.150> i<00:01:42.540> joined<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> opposite<00:01:43.409> side

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
see that i joined the opposite side

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.069 
see that i joined the opposite side
student<00:01:44.310> record<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.909> always<00:01:45.329> before<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.899> last

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079

square what are you going to do when are
we<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.880> cut<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.470> score<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.549> lines

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
we going to cut on this score the lines

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.679 
we going to cut on this score the lines
that<00:01:54.030> recorders<00:01:54.780> scored<00:01:55.740> line<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.509> on

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
that recorders scored line but just on

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.819 
that recorders scored line but just on
the<00:01:57.750> last<00:01:58.219> square<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.880> don't<00:02:00.180> cut<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.960> day

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
the last square you don't cut it the day

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.280 
the last square you don't cut it the day
squared<00:02:02.310> you<00:02:03.030> don't<00:02:03.299> cut<00:02:03.509> all<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> way<00:02:04.020> down

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
squared you don't cut all the way down

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.290 
squared you don't cut all the way down
I'm<00:02:04.500> just<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:05.159> illustrating<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:05.969> for<00:02:06.329> you

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
I'm just just illustrating that for you

I'm just just illustrating that for you
so<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:10.160> go<00:02:10.369> ahead<00:02:10.399> and<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.910> cut<00:02:11.210> just<00:02:11.780> on<00:02:11.990> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
so you go ahead and you cut just on the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.780 
so you go ahead and you cut just on the
last<00:02:12.410> square<00:02:13.280> of<00:02:13.880> the<00:02:14.120> twin<00:02:14.360> three<00:02:14.480> quarters

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.150 

mark<00:02:19.790> and<00:02:20.750> you<00:02:21.260> do<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.590> on<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.770> opposite

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
mark and you do that on the opposite

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.360 
mark and you do that on the opposite
side<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:24.260> what<00:02:24.530> you're<00:02:24.650> going<00:02:24.770> to<00:02:24.830> end<00:02:24.950> up<00:02:25.100> you

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
side so what you're going to end up you

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.250 
side so what you're going to end up you
can<00:02:25.520> end<00:02:25.670> up<00:02:25.880> with<00:02:26.920> both<00:02:30.520> cut<00:02:31.520> it<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:33.200> the

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
can end up with both cut it on the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.820 
can end up with both cut it on the
opposite<00:02:33.710> sides<00:02:35.290> now<00:02:36.290> what<00:02:36.500> you're<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.740> to

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
opposite sides now what you're going to

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.000 
opposite sides now what you're going to
do<00:02:37.070> also<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.850> cut<00:02:38.450> on<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.870> opposite<00:02:39.290> side<00:02:39.590> on

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
do also is cut on the opposite side on

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.040 
do also is cut on the opposite side on
the<00:02:40.280> score<00:02:40.580> lines<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.150> opposite<00:02:41.690> squares

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
the score lines of the opposite squares

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.330 
the score lines of the opposite squares
you're<00:02:45.050> going<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.260> have<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.500> last<00:02:45.740> quare<00:02:46.070> on

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
you're going to have the last quare on

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.760 
you're going to have the last quare on
the<00:02:46.520> top<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:47.120> see<00:02:47.300> there<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:51.290> one<00:02:51.500> on<00:02:51.650> the

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
the top you see there and the one on the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:03:00.580 
the top you see there and the one on the
bar<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:57.350> here<00:02:57.620> I'm<00:02:57.680> cutting<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:59.750> cut<00:03:00.050> on<00:03:00.350> the

bar so here I'm cutting you cut on the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.030 
bar so here I'm cutting you cut on the
side<00:03:00.860> because<00:03:01.430> that's<00:03:01.670> going<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.030> fold<00:03:03.040> inside

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
side because that's going to fold inside

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:12.340 
side because that's going to fold inside
the<00:03:04.280> book<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.200> cut<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:07.150> square<00:03:11.350> just

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
the book so you cut the square just

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.900 
the book so you cut the square just
squeezing<00:03:13.360> burnish<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.630> work<00:03:15.910> another

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
squeezing burnish it and work another

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.060 
squeezing burnish it and work another
opposite<00:03:17.570> want<00:03:17.810> the<00:03:17.900> same<00:03:18.170> thing<00:03:20.980> here<00:03:21.980> I'm

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
opposite want the same thing here I'm

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.229 
opposite want the same thing here I'm
folding<00:03:22.370> first<00:03:23.410> just<00:03:24.410> punishing<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.239> score

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
folding first just punishing the score

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:33.759 
folding first just punishing the score
lines<00:03:29.500> and<00:03:30.500> now<00:03:31.010> I'm<00:03:31.160> going<00:03:31.370> to<00:03:31.459> cut<00:03:32.769> the

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
lines and now I'm going to cut the

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:39.009 
lines and now I'm going to cut the
opposite<00:03:34.280> square<00:03:34.610> also<00:03:37.090> so<00:03:38.090> you<00:03:38.150> end<00:03:38.600> up<00:03:38.750> with

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
opposite square also so you end up with

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.870 
opposite square also so you end up with
two<00:03:39.410> deep<00:03:39.830> cuts<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.580> one<00:03:41.180> very<00:03:41.930> fine<00:03:42.350> cut

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
two deep cuts and one very fine cut

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.320 
two deep cuts and one very fine cut
that's<00:03:43.880> going<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.269> be<00:03:44.300> used<00:03:44.690> just<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:45.050> fold<00:03:45.410> up

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
that's going to be used just to fold up

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.420 
that's going to be used just to fold up
the<00:03:47.330> score<00:03:47.989> lines<00:03:48.290> on<00:03:48.560> the<00:03:48.680> middle<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:49.130> they

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
the score lines on the middle that they

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.449 
the score lines on the middle that they
are<00:03:49.600> bigger<00:03:50.600> ones<00:03:50.930> is<00:03:51.440> because<00:03:51.920> it's<00:03:52.190> going<00:03:52.370> to

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
are bigger ones is because it's going to

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.720 
are bigger ones is because it's going to
be<00:03:52.700> so<00:03:53.600> they<00:03:53.780> can<00:03:54.440> hold<00:03:54.739> the<00:03:54.980> book<00:03:55.190> when<00:03:55.700> it

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
be so they can hold the book when it

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.080 
be so they can hold the book when it
closed<00:03:56.090> because<00:03:58.720> so<00:03:59.720> it's<00:04:00.470> gonna<00:04:00.739> be<00:04:01.670> enough

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
closed because so it's gonna be enough

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.580 
closed because so it's gonna be enough
for<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.510> pages<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:02.930> you're<00:04:03.140> going<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.350> fold

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
for the pages that you're going to fold

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.960 
for the pages that you're going to fold
inside<00:04:04.010> the<00:04:04.130> book<00:04:04.280> otherwise<00:04:04.580> you<00:04:04.760> cannot

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
inside the book otherwise you cannot

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.870 
inside the book otherwise you cannot
close<00:04:05.269> the<00:04:05.510> book<00:04:05.890> so<00:04:06.890> we<00:04:07.100> leave<00:04:07.250> that<00:04:07.549> bigger

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:07.880 
close the book so we leave that bigger

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.750 
close the book so we leave that bigger
scored<00:04:08.500> so<00:04:09.500> I'm<00:04:09.650> showing<00:04:10.010> you<00:04:10.040> here<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.549> lines

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
scored so I'm showing you here the lines

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.380 
scored so I'm showing you here the lines
that<00:04:10.880> you<00:04:11.150> cut<00:04:11.390> opposite<00:04:12.380> and<00:04:13.060> that's<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.239> way

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
that you cut opposite and that's the way

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.670 
that you cut opposite and that's the way
you<00:04:14.450> fold<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.930> book

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
you fold the book

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.619 
you fold the book
first<00:04:19.829> partition<00:04:20.829> this<00:04:21.129> day<00:04:21.459> is<00:04:21.819> for<00:04:22.150> line<00:04:22.419> so

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:22.629 
first partition this day is for line so

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:25.439 
first partition this day is for line so
we<00:04:22.659> can<00:04:22.930> close<00:04:23.139> the<00:04:23.349> book<00:04:23.939> so<00:04:24.939> you<00:04:24.969> can<00:04:25.210> see

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:25.449 
we can close the book so you can see

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.020 
we can close the book so you can see
that<00:04:25.479> you<00:04:25.689> have<00:04:25.960> I<00:04:28.740> space<00:04:29.740> there<00:04:30.009> so<00:04:30.639> if<00:04:30.909> you

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
that you have I space there so if you

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.659 
that you have I space there so if you
want<00:04:31.210> to<00:04:31.270> put<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.449> lot<00:04:31.629> of<00:04:31.659> embellishments

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
want to put a lot of embellishments

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.429 
want to put a lot of embellishments
probably<00:04:33.669> going<00:04:33.939> to<00:04:34.000> have<00:04:34.090> to<00:04:34.150> do<00:04:34.449> this<00:04:34.479> bigger

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:35.439 
probably going to have to do this bigger

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:37.260 
probably going to have to do this bigger
but<00:04:36.099> then<00:04:36.129> you're<00:04:36.310> going<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.490> have<00:04:36.550> less<00:04:37.000> space

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
but then you're going to have less space

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.429 
but then you're going to have less space
to<00:04:37.449> put<00:04:37.810> pictures<00:04:39.930> so<00:04:40.930> now<00:04:41.080> we're<00:04:41.229> going<00:04:41.349> to

00:04:41.429 --> 00:04:41.439 
to put pictures so now we're going to

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:45.200 
to put pictures so now we're going to
fold<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.800> book<00:04:42.689> we're<00:04:43.689> going<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:43.930> fold<00:04:44.199> inside

fold the book we're going to fold inside

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.689 
fold the book we're going to fold inside
