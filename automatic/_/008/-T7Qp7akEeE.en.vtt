old 1850s and we noticed that the vein

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.250 
old 1850s and we noticed that the vein
keeps<00:00:32.529> going<00:00:32.890> at<00:00:33.039> a<00:00:33.100> 45<00:00:33.519> degree<00:00:33.550> angle<00:00:34.090> so<00:00:34.260> we

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
keeps going at a 45 degree angle so we

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.410 
keeps going at a 45 degree angle so we
decided<00:00:35.590> to<00:00:35.769> open<00:00:35.800> this<00:00:36.160> up<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:36.640> we<00:00:37.149> could<00:00:37.300> get

do you see it keeps on going back in
there<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.930> we'll<00:01:26.080> clear<00:01:26.320> that<00:01:26.470> all<00:01:26.620> out<00:01:26.880> get

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
there so we'll clear that all out get

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.730 
there so we'll clear that all out get
some<00:01:27.940> of<00:01:28.180> that<00:01:28.240> gold<00:01:30.930> huh<00:01:31.930> so<00:01:32.290> you<00:01:32.350> can<00:01:32.560> see

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
some of that gold huh so you can see

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.800 
some of that gold huh so you can see
those<00:01:33.580> beautiful<00:01:33.760> bays<00:01:34.210> alive<00:01:34.570> and<00:01:34.750> I

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
those beautiful bays alive and I

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.470 
those beautiful bays alive and I
traveling<00:01:35.260> at<00:01:35.350> a<00:01:35.380> 45<00:01:35.830> degree<00:01:35.860> angle<00:01:36.400> and<00:01:36.610> so

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:37.480 
traveling at a 45 degree angle and so

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.760 
traveling at a 45 degree angle and so
what<00:01:37.660> we're<00:01:37.840> gonna<00:01:38.230> do<00:01:38.470> is<00:01:38.590> we're<00:01:38.710> gonna

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.100 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna
continue<00:01:39.250> to<00:01:39.280> open<00:01:39.670> this<00:01:39.760> hole<00:01:40.000> up<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.930> that

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
continue to open this hole up and that

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.690 
continue to open this hole up and that
wouldn't<00:01:41.470> be<00:01:41.530> easier<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:41.980> get<00:01:42.070> buckets<00:01:42.460> in<00:01:42.550> and

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
wouldn't be easier to get buckets in and

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.640 
wouldn't be easier to get buckets in and
out<00:01:42.820> of<00:01:42.940> there<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:43.300> we<00:01:43.420> can<00:01:43.600> haul<00:01:43.990> more<00:01:44.350> in<00:01:44.500> and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
out of there so we can haul more in and

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.110 
out of there so we can haul more in and
out<00:01:44.740> then<00:01:44.950> will<00:01:45.100> completely<00:01:45.520> remove<00:01:45.790> that

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:46.120 
out then will completely remove that

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.070 
out then will completely remove that
bait<00:01:46.360> but<00:01:47.080> for<00:01:47.260> right<00:01:47.380> now<00:01:48.330> we<00:01:49.330> got<00:01:49.510> ah

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
bait but for right now we got ah

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.190 
bait but for right now we got ah
five<00:01:50.530> buckets<00:01:50.860> worth<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.840> know<00:01:52.900> there's

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
we designed our trommel so hopefully we

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.159 
we designed our trommel so hopefully we
got<00:04:50.270> some<00:04:50.330> goal<00:04:50.630> in<00:04:50.930> here's<00:04:51.139> here<00:04:51.560> we<00:04:51.650> go<00:04:56.169> okay

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:00.200 
working with gold that fine so we'll use

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.550 
working with gold that fine so we'll use
jet<00:06:00.530> dry<00:06:00.800> or<00:06:01.130> some

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
jet dry or some

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.440 
jet dry or some
detergent<00:06:02.250> into<00:06:02.430> water<00:06:02.639> and<00:06:03.180> with<00:06:03.419> the

detergent into water and with the

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.120 
detergent into water and with the
trommel<00:06:03.960> that<00:06:04.110> way<00:06:04.230> it<00:06:04.350> doesn't<00:06:04.620> float<00:06:04.889> right

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
trommel that way it doesn't float right

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.680 
trommel that way it doesn't float right
on<00:06:05.280> out<00:06:05.520> because<00:06:05.760> gold<00:06:05.970> will<00:06:06.150> literally<00:06:06.360> float

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
on out because gold will literally float

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.629 
on out because gold will literally float
on<00:06:06.870> top<00:06:06.900> of<00:06:07.169> that<00:06:07.260> water<00:06:07.500> you<00:06:08.070> don't<00:06:08.280> break<00:06:08.490> the

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
on top of that water you don't break the

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.700 
on top of that water you don't break the
surface<00:06:08.790> tension<00:06:09.120> so<00:06:09.419> I<00:06:09.810> hope<00:06:10.290> you<00:06:10.440> enjoyed
