today

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.650 
today
now<00:00:41.219> everyone<00:00:41.610> usually<00:00:42.059> goes<00:00:42.210> for<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.510> lock

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
now everyone usually goes for the lock

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.880 
now everyone usually goes for the lock
saw<00:00:42.899> which<00:00:43.260> is<00:00:43.290> fine<00:00:43.789> it<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> fast<00:00:45.510> plane<00:00:45.899> but

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
saw which is fine it is a fast plane but

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.889 
saw which is fine it is a fast plane but
a<00:00:46.920> lot<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.129> people<00:00:47.399> tend<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> crash<00:00:48.090> those

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
a lot of people tend to crash those

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.850 
a lot of people tend to crash those
planes<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.980> always<00:00:50.550> go<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.360> one

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
planes so I always go with this one

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.860 
planes so I always go with this one
so<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.100> stunt<00:00:53.340> plane<00:00:53.489> if<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.850> will

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
so the stunt plane if you will

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.389 
so the stunt plane if you will
purely<00:00:55.260> because<00:00:55.469> it's<00:00:55.980> more<00:00:56.219> maneuverable

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
purely because it's more maneuverable

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.080 
purely because it's more maneuverable
and<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.809> fast<00:00:58.289> ish<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.160> that's<00:00:59.640> why<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.879> always

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
and it's fast ish so that's why I always

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.930 
and it's fast ish so that's why I always
go<00:01:00.329> with<00:01:00.559> when<00:01:01.559> I'm<00:01:01.680> doing<00:01:01.949> sorbet<00:01:02.520> races

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
go with when I'm doing sorbet races

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.719 
go with when I'm doing sorbet races
really<00:01:03.739> because<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:05.010> swerve<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
really because you can swerve out of the

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.219 
really because you can swerve out of the
way<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.000> people<00:01:06.299> crashing<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.900> things<00:01:07.049> like

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
way of people crashing and things like

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.609 
way of people crashing and things like
that<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.619> it's<00:01:08.400> worth<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.960> loss<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.380> speed

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
that so it's worth the the loss in speed

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.580 
that so it's worth the the loss in speed
in<00:01:10.770> my<00:01:10.860> opinion<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.600> yeah<00:01:12.810> we've<00:01:13.229> got<00:01:13.320> someone

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
in my opinion so yeah we've got someone

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.609 
in my opinion so yeah we've got someone
over<00:01:13.799> there<00:01:13.950> choosing<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> lux<00:01:14.729> or<00:01:15.500> else<00:01:16.500> we

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
over there choosing the lux or else we

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:16.940 
over there choosing the lux or else we
got

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
got

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.450 
got
