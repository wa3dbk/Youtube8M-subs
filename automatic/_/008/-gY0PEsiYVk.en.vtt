the cuff we do a double reinforced cuff
as<00:01:15.450> well<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:16.259> that's<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.560> Kodiak<00:01:16.920> pant<00:01:17.189> from

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
as well so that's the Kodiak pant from

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.630 
as well so that's the Kodiak pant from
511<00:01:18.000> how<00:01:18.869> does<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> Kodiak<00:01:19.560> pant<00:01:19.920> compared<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
511 how does the Kodiak pant compared to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.490 
511 how does the Kodiak pant compared to
the<00:01:21.090> typical<00:01:21.540> tactical<00:01:22.140> pant

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the typical tactical pant

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.140 
the typical tactical pant
well<00:01:22.830> this<00:01:22.950> was<00:01:23.070> a<00:01:23.100> much<00:01:23.280> heavier<00:01:23.490> weight<00:01:23.850> pant

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
well this was a much heavier weight pant

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.609 
well this was a much heavier weight pant
so<00:01:24.390> this<00:01:24.509> would<00:01:24.630> be<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.720> great<00:01:24.960> carpenter<00:01:25.350> pant

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
so this would be a great carpenter pant

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.890 
so this would be a great carpenter pant
for<00:01:25.770> example<00:01:26.220> or<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.540> little<00:01:27.540> bit<00:01:27.630> heavier

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
for example or a little bit heavier

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.819 
for example or a little bit heavier
weight<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.350> you're<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> winter

pinion<00:01:42.960> if<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.079> want<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.350> go<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.759> fabric<00:01:44.759> did

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
pinion if I want to go with fabric did

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.120 
pinion if I want to go with fabric did
use<00:01:45.180> for<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.630> pan<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> 100%<00:01:46.740> cotton

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
use for this pan this is a 100% cotton

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.039 
use for this pan this is a 100% cotton
canvas<00:01:47.490> so<00:01:48.060> canvas<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.600> means<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.840> has<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
canvas so canvas just means it has the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.270 
canvas so canvas just means it has the
same<00:01:49.170> thread<00:01:49.470> count<00:01:49.680> going<00:01:49.799> vertically<00:01:50.189> as

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
same thread count going vertically as

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.800 
same thread count going vertically as
horizontally<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.360> gives<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> little

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
horizontally so it gives you a little

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.950 
horizontally so it gives you a little
extra<00:01:52.020> durability<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:54.540> what<00:01:54.689> does<00:01:54.810> this

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
extra durability and what does this

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.209 
extra durability and what does this
