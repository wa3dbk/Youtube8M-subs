00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
little too far and I might have really

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.199 
little too far and I might have really
okay<00:03:20.620> i<00:03:20.650> found<00:03:20.860> a<00:03:20.890> continued<00:03:21.220> might<00:03:21.970> have<00:03:22.180> a

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
okay i found a continued might have a

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.670 
okay i found a continued might have a
lot<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.900> go<00:03:23.019> back<00:03:23.320> backwards<00:03:24.160> on<00:03:25.560> but<00:03:26.560> we'll

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
lot to go back backwards on but we'll

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.770 
lot to go back backwards on but we'll
see<00:03:26.890> if<00:03:27.010> i<00:03:27.130> can<00:03:27.310> just<00:03:27.340> go<00:03:27.760> up<00:03:27.970> as<00:03:28.390> opposed<00:03:28.660> to

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
see if i can just go up as opposed to

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.449 
see if i can just go up as opposed to
having<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.049> actually<00:03:29.560> scroll<00:03:30.070> back<00:03:30.280> through

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
having to actually scroll back through

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.500 
having to actually scroll back through
this<00:03:30.549> whole<00:03:30.730> level<00:03:30.910> because<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.299> would<00:03:31.390> be

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
this whole level because that would be

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.020 
this whole level because that would be
really<00:03:31.690> annoying<00:03:32.079> one<00:03:32.890> hit<00:03:33.070> kills<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.730> i'm

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
really annoying one hit kills and i'm

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.640 
really annoying one hit kills and i'm
not<00:03:34.329> gonna<00:03:34.480> play<00:03:34.690> any<00:03:34.780> one<00:03:35.110> hit<00:03:35.260> kill<00:03:35.440> games

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
not gonna play any one hit kill games

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.640 
not gonna play any one hit kill games
anymore<00:03:36.209> ever<00:03:37.209> i<00:03:37.450> think<00:03:37.750> i<00:03:37.900> think<00:03:38.019> this<00:03:38.230> is<00:03:38.290> my

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
anymore ever i think i think this is my

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.350 
anymore ever i think i think this is my
my

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
my

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.830 
my
for<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:40.940> think<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.090> maybe<00:03:42.510> there<00:03:42.750> are

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
for that I think that maybe there are

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.820 
for that I think that maybe there are
people<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.140> are<00:03:43.550> more<00:03:45.260> superior<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.590> me<00:03:46.710> in

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
people that are more superior to me in

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.150 
people that are more superior to me in
that<00:03:46.950> way<00:03:47.010> that<00:03:47.820> will<00:03:48.000> suck<00:03:48.990> it<00:03:49.110> up<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.350> do

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
that way that will suck it up and do

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.110

think that I have done four levels today
and<00:07:47.780> I<00:07:47.840> think<00:07:48.020> that's<00:07:48.169> pretty<00:07:48.320> good<00:07:48.560> it<00:07:48.860> means

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:49.340 
and I think that's pretty good it means

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.300 
and I think that's pretty good it means
that<00:07:49.490> we<00:07:49.610> only<00:07:49.880> have<00:07:50.120> levels<00:07:50.800> 15

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:52.310 
that we only have levels 15

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:55.120 
that we only have levels 15
and<00:07:52.430> 16<00:07:53.270> left<00:07:53.510> to<00:07:53.660> do<00:07:53.840> which<00:07:54.650> means<00:07:54.890> one<00:07:55.100> more

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.130 
and 16 left to do which means one more

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.070 
and 16 left to do which means one more
boss<00:07:55.550> fight<00:07:55.850> and<00:07:56.120> then<00:07:56.240> I<00:07:56.300> have<00:07:56.570> no<00:07:56.870> clue

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.080
