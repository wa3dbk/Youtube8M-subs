00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.610
 beauty 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.770
 I'm André, I'm here with the third 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.960
 year play channel frame year show 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.690
 obscure games following the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.270
 You and this time we'll see what comes 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.660
 Legends fighting game developed by 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.480
 actress in 1995 and that was more than 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.580
 suggesting gone by icom mozer was in a 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.950
 research had on him that he does that walks 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.780
 telling suggestions that many websites live 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.940
 the staff comparing this game with 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.010
 street party and not only combat 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.590
 really when some games play from there 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.480
 I even thought it was a game of much 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.820
 as many others have for 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.980
 This but with the minute playing it I already 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.800
 I saw that it had nothing to do 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.300
 completely different gameplay is 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.759
 a game much faster than those who 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.680
 already had until that time that has several 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.990
 things that other producers just to 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.380
 use well after out that the game is 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.979
 completely this finding is of those who 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.930
 We talk killing the stab in the collection. 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.940
 of the characters so ricardinho that 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.679
 it looks like a drill a mine that looks like 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.600
 fall rappers to cure 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:31.090
 the other one that looks like spirit of aceu 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.009
 network that has a lot of average and also 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.119
 the game greatly values ​​the third 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.830
 age 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.440
 The most bizarre I've seen with my 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.869
 who wears an odd outfit and 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.140
 when you kid and show the worst face 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.140
 his 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.959
 worse the size of the piroga of the guri 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.539
 it must be what bengal from Japan is 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:54.220
 the stuff is crazy as hell and even 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.520
 something that I found very crazy and also 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.020
 were scenarios that have a lot of movement and 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.420
 it 's not just that business that people 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.080
 continue arms world those animations 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.940
 of 23 only kind is so much information scenery 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.429
 who even accustomed to working a little 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.709
 to help but later when it was neco 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.430
 beauty and really scenery it in the very 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.220
 Spotlight 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.959
 game and igor did not say which one 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.569
 It's the version he wanted me to 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.870
 I tried then I picked up the 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.209
 led 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.280
 the team had two other agencies 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.769
 the franchise that went before and the first 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.530
 came out for the mega drive and prosub 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.870
 claiming that some people in the 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.360
 funny girl I do not know runs stint 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.480
 Torch align himself with any other 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.739
 thing and is familiar even one of the versions 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.170
 this series 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:45.440
 the emily map was launched by neo geo and 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.200
 3 and made a splash of a success and is so 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.750
 Crazy about types and whether a trail 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.670
 already played and is sensational too 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.430
 was released yesterday at the end of life 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:58.280
 of rangel and has graphics honorability 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.530
 outstanding is well regarded for not 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.750
 be so well known or turn a game 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.730
 strange because the quality of it is 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.680
 excellent maybe it's because he uses 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.659
 much of the typical 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.590
 Japanese had so that this is not 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.900
 talking right? 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.030
 and there is a lot of American who does not 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.340
 enjoy it and it ends up that all 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.900
 identifies without knowing games like this 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.299
 because they do not have so much publicity 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.829
 like many other countries 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.590
 so much so that it seems that in the last games 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.530
 of this franchise were only in Japan itself 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.900
 and to make matters worse by what he heard eyes 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.810
 of games and going out in the United States only 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.209
 a mess difficult to understand why 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.790
 first came out with the power team and 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.690
 cícero as what emerges is the name 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.750
 The Japanese franchise had the map emily and 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.400
 another called group does not do then it is 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.680
 able to have already played a 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.010
 ghetto franchise game said that neither 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.440
 I knew you played alone there we go 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.000
 go back to the game and talk about the gameplay 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.829
 that I suffered openly to get the hang of it 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.989
 with him I've tried some 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.989
 characters and the ones I liked the most 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:05.000
 now they were laxi the sakura and a curious 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.180
 I do not even know their names in the beautiful game because 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.889
 the time and that is when we fight 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.359
 is learning to play we choose 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:13.690
 a character tries to lose the blocks 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.180
 some caresses and one of them in 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.389
 paralyzing traffic is the college 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.400
 josué and some characters that seem to 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.889
 other franchises or other 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.169
 drawing and other mention is that they 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.669
 was also a super system because the 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.150
 people fill in for an attack 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.680
 fatal and the highlight is that when the 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.830
 People fill this bar. 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:40.190
 the guy stock golzinho there a blow and 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.409
 someone touches you when it comes to 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:45.409
 people also choose two characters if they 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:47.539
 lose one during the Portuguese coming the other but 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:49.370
 when you get a audi life 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.950
 fills with the next horror then it is not 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.650
 exactly the same as tiny and 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:57.440
 having king of fighters and when I'm in 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.000
 bank still in the game I have I think and 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.039
 all the parties I played until 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.710
 now because that's what I was playing 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.599
 better but the healing of a character but 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:08.210
 short distance but has some 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.400
 his invitations are to do too and the wildcard 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.510
 has a strong with spells 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.370
 mainly from the south because I do not 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.389
 I know why but almost nobody 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.979
 business there 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.050
 and in this game the characters have a 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.300
 very large amount of savings that 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.760
 Some of the police resemble 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.039
 different fighter or 2 thing to the public 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.500
 mainly but has many tickets 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:31.130
 very original too and most of them 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.560
 are well on the same type attack an old 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.520
 that a website of damage and 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.529
 there goes 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.659
 This line I've spoken has two in it. 

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:41.090
 truth is the wisdom of the denture is the 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:42.710
 dog to defeat his arm 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.419
 it looks like he was the final boss of the games 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.190
 previous series 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.800
 and this is a normal character even 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.779
 selected everything but even if you pick it up 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.000
 to play against half the game 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:55.190
 front and every difficult trial 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.889
 defeat are for free and it seems that in 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:06:01.039
 The story of the game is leader by bangu de 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.479
 and the tournament is there to see who goes 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.729
 replace her 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.130
 and this average and has a legal trick with 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:09.650
 her attacks she jumps on top of the 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.920
 another and put his ball into play and he kind of 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.860
 doubt because I was going to 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:16.500
 She stays there for a while and 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.330
 dell animation animations also links to 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.610
 it seems that other characters are 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.090
 It also transforms into the game and bone of 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.950
 cure 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:25.320
 it transforms into a locally 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:27.360
 animal is almost useless and we can 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.990
 leave ritalin until you return to the 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:30.450
 normal 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.310
 These are cool and such but with the 

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:34.680
 pet is too small is more 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:36.060
 difficult also gives as legal or to 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.070
 enjoy the immense 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.990
 So that's it , this game I can 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:40.890
 recommend to everyone who likes to 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:42.720
 fight use 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.600
 so if you still do not know him 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.910
 run after it's worth it, it's alright 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:49.710
 already Fiant hilarious hope you 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.050

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.150
 do not know the channel between there on the page 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:55.980
 of the video that's pretty cool already 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.610
 you and also take advantage of 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:59.130
 register 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.870
 The case was written if you have a suggestion 

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:03.210
 obscure games to appear in this 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.790
 anderley can leave us 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:07.770
 comments too and clicking liked and 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.760
 left the favorites to give that force 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:13.760
 channel and months into the next video 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.760
 said
