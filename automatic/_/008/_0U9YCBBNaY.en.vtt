00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.280 
gene gene gene and separate those G's
and<00:00:41.300> then<00:00:41.510> go<00:00:41.690> a<00:00:41.719> quick<00:00:42.110> three<00:00:42.710> G's<00:00:43.040> in<00:00:43.219> a<00:00:43.309> row

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290 
and then go a quick three G's in a row

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.520 
and then go a quick three G's in a row
and<00:00:45.290> we<00:00:45.410> do<00:00:45.530> that<00:00:45.710> with<00:00:45.829> left<00:00:46.399> hand<00:00:46.460> -<00:00:46.730> unison<00:00:47.420> G

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.990

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
now what the left hand does is just G D

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.939 
now what the left hand does is just G D
G<00:00:53.719> C<00:00:54.079> E<00:00:54.890> flat<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:56.059> G<00:00:56.120> flat<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:57.140> it's<00:00:57.260> an<00:00:57.410> E<00:00:57.620> flat

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
G C E flat and G flat so it's an E flat

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.520 
G C E flat and G flat so it's an E flat
minor<00:00:58.309> sound<00:00:58.699> e<00:00:59.030> flat<00:00:59.600> minor<00:00:59.809> is<00:00:59.930> a<00:00:59.989> nice<00:01:00.170> chord

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.080 
all we're gonna play is those two notes
to<00:01:06.200> get<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:06.560> imply<00:01:07.340> that<00:01:07.369> E<00:01:07.610> flat<00:01:07.880> minor

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
to get that imply that E flat minor

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.770 
to get that imply that E flat minor
sound

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.330

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
so I do that twice and then I go right

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:28.840 
so I do that twice and then I go right
into<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.790> melody<00:01:25.090> flat<00:01:26.090> D<00:01:26.690> flat<00:01:26.720> G<00:01:27.020> B<00:01:27.740> flat<00:01:28.010> B

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850

flat<00:01:28.880> G<00:01:29.140> so<00:01:30.140> that's<00:01:30.320> your<00:01:30.470> E<00:01:30.530> flat<00:01:30.650> major<00:01:31.130> sound

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
flat G so that's your E flat major sound

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.620 
flat G so that's your E flat major sound
see<00:01:32.650> with<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:33.800> black<00:01:34.040> white<00:01:34.370> black<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.390> we<00:01:35.480> got
