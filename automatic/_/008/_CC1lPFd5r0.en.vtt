00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
center of the board this one pretty much

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.410 
center of the board this one pretty much
has<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.340> same<00:02:31.520> concept<00:02:31.970> as<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.150> one<00:02:32.300> before

has the same concept as the one before

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.850 
has the same concept as the one before
and<00:02:32.810> I<00:02:32.870> believe<00:02:32.930> it's<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.319> hardest<00:02:33.590> with<00:02:33.800> a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
and I believe it's the hardest with a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.559 
and I believe it's the hardest with a
master<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:34.490> your<00:02:34.580> front<00:02:34.850> foot<00:02:34.880> slides<00:02:35.240> off<00:02:35.420> the

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
master so your front foot slides off the

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:36.820 
master so your front foot slides off the
top<00:02:35.750> bolt<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.080> get<00:02:36.230> in<00:02:36.319> that<00:02:36.350> he'll<00:02:36.620> flip

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
top bolt to get in that he'll flip

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.320 
top bolt to get in that he'll flip
position<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.370> your<00:02:37.610> back<00:02:37.760> foot<00:02:37.940> kind<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.180> does

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
direction the board is heading then you

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.020 
direction the board is heading then you
can<00:02:54.500> predict<00:02:54.800> where<00:02:55.010> your<00:02:55.370> hand<00:02:55.610> needs<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.910> be

to catch it it's easier to catch the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.260 
to catch it it's easier to catch the
