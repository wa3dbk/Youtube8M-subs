00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.540
 well for now in chamonix ya rien 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.120
 the doses are quite normal the 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.470
 radio normal activity as well to 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.800
 the pointed of the south when one goes in bottom 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.660
 of valley 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.330
 there is no problem it's the strict 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.669
 truth is not at all reassured it's 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.380
 quite normal for now for 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:22.550
 the air moment did not fear it's true 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.300
 that we had east winds that was 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.070
 not favorable 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.169
 we'll see at the beginning of the week because 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.910
 sales will take west two years ago 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.390
 rounds of the atlantic and well there we get 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.429
 will see again and we'll see we'll see but hey 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.410
 dissolution is relatively important 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:37.820
 but still the signs of it 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.949
 which show that radioactivity in 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.149
 general in this massif of Mont Blanc is 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.550
 well in the Mont Blanc massif 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.079
 natural radioactivity and more 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.780
 important because the massif is 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.570
 made of granite and granite is a 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.670
 pebble which is radioactive so a 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.289
 natural way and so in the valley 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.929
 of Chamonix necessarily has a 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.249
 radioactivity which is superior it is 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.159
 three times above average 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:03.260
 national but you must not get angry 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.390
 for that it's really very very 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.479
 weak and then also the fact that one 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.369
 either in altitude 1 mm child put in 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.649
 emotion protected by the atmosphere layer 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.790
 and thus also the cosmic rays 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.399
 tells us that radioactivity 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.380
 so natural in the mountains is amel va 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:19.549
 to be even more you and the league of 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.619
 noon at the top of Mont Blanc 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.090
 you have you will receive a dose of 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.950
 radioactivity that will be more important 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.159
 than in the plain and so how did you 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.630
 actually measured this radioactivity is 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.000
 well it's very nice what I bought 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.979
 a little geiger counter after the 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.880
 disaster and the nuclear accident at 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.740
 Chernobyl 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.719
 we realized that we 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.399
 does have to type very via the mans 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.200
 was made anyway and I 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.130
 I'm told a few years later I 'm 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.229
 see there I 'm going to buy a little 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.460
 counter geiger and that will allow me to 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.619
 monitor 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.080
 not that I was hoping for another accident 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.270
 nuclear but to see what happens 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.130
 different places obviously and well 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.230
 this little counter that is very very 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.910
 simple allows everyone to be able to 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.220
 measure radioactivity 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.260
 in food or in 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.880
 things that will make Japan later I 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.830
 not believe but these are devices 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.660
 very simple after actually there is 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.180
 National Nuclear Safety Agency 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.490
 that allows is to have measures in 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.080
 keep having a good memory but that 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.240
 it's very important to know what's going on 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.550
 going on constantly but a particular 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.360
 can very well buy his little 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.430
 Geiger counter 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.840
 but I'm in a pack there are more 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.550
 of meters in stock 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.350
 it will be necessary to wait until May at 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.100
 month of June to find 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.100
 grape counters
