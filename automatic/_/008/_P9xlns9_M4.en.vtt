 of hints kama so you have a series in 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.099
 three episodes so I told myself that 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.360
 as currently on the channel of which 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.070
 of course I have a lot of videos in reserve 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.090
 but I can start doing 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.680
 videos and that I'm not exactly 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:26.060

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.820
 asus case mam have been asking a lot 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.320
 although I have already done a series that 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.450
 by the way not at all what the two 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.280
 third of the tricks are totally pp 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.140
 hints like that but I'm in no 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.280
 well we knew what he's going for I rather 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.380
 decided to show you but my three 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.460
 bigger in quotation marks up 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:50.440
 mach I use all the time to do 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:52.460
 comrades in the game because good 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.890
 of course I'm still kamas 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.690
 and ate a game given to the team but 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.270
 I'm going to show you that it's not 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.260
 necessarily related to the team there are a lot of 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.940
 tips that can be done in 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.350
 mono accounts of which in this first 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.000
 part which consists of breeding 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.460
 and so of teeth in the villages there are 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.050
 two things that happen to me 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:18.950
 Kamas to win so we will 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:23.600
 start by seeing a little bit of that 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:26.899
 give kama level so here we are here 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.170
 at the bank of the fact that so I won 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.729
 in early summer ewec I made myself 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.430
 like a small sum of kama I had 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.920
 put for a seem some 35 million 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.789
 thing like that on sale and I got 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:45.770
 made more than more than 20 million in two 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:47.090
 months of connections so I'm going to you I 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.800
 explain how I did after but 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.500
 I do this once occasionally you 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.360
 the looters months and is like that the 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.610
 case miles island 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.500
 so I will show you the mounts 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.740
 are still new and there still remains for 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.509
 a lot of camara 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.970
 I put a small price all the 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:07.069
 straps that you see there they are 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.330
 all fertile ready to breed 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:10.170
 so I'll explain a little bit 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.060
 tactics 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.459
 Here you see that they are not 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.750
 they are not even pure but the more I 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.510
 come for those who do not know what 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.690
 this is pure is a pure india dress 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.690
 its aftermath to all the parents of the 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.700
 same species as it is of the same race 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.599
 so I'm going to show you in a loaf 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.920
 if you want there I put you the link 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.180
 a small series I had done the same 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.130
 in three parts on the waves good I 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.989
 started a little bit but I explain 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.989
 two years who really has to know 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.690
 gentlemen mails are not here there's that 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.040
 the males and that the Malians part 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.360
 males for example it's a need 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.470
 sadr paint had a pure air 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.450
 that is to say that all parents is 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.459
 exactly the same race 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.810
 all the parents competitions so they 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.640
 have good brief so now finally 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.030
 I when I left when I 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.910
 start 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.530
 breeding none of my dragodinde was 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.950
 pure but still parents 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.660
 different 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.459
 and by dint of helping to make them 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.290
 reproduce and raise and then redo 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.220
 a couple is and where from the dragodindes 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.030
 become more and more pure 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.489
 that is, they have parents of 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.650
 the same race and so from time to time 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.110
 I liquid dragodinde who are far 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.519
 to be pure and that I had at the beginning I 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.390
 already done that three times this was the 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:27.360
 third time and I like myself I do not 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.310
 do not break your head I take all the 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.360
 dragodinde I have I loved it all for 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.190
 become fertile all the time from 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.680
 that they can and once they 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.150
 are fertile 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:40.140
 I check if there are times when he 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.540
 I need to remove for 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.920
 because there is too much 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.280
 easily and 205 years so that's the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.440
 first tip c2c to remove full who 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.610
 are fertile and go put in hdv 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.050
 by per package as I pay them and 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.400
 believe me it goes as you saw it 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.440
 in two months there are more than 20 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.780
 million who went to the bank one is 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.860
 how much I act was gone nizar 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.860
 exactly we have returns 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.009
 aulas for over 23 million which is 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.840
 part rank 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:23.800
 good is the first of two tips 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.610
 level breeding good there are 3 really 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.349
 real big stack 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.699
 all that is to please whole condÃ© 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.430
 in front of dragodindes fertile not too 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:31.569
 expensive and the more they are sure the more you 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.120
 can sell and dear me I want it 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:37.240
 sold up to 250 naughty and 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.080
 they leave the second trick is 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.539
 the basic trick 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.039
 when you when you do babies 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.699
 well do you dozens of 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:44.289
 tens and tens 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.090
 there are plenty of them that are useless 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.969
 since they are going they will not be 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.009
 necessarily good raf so for those 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:56.889
 who do not know you are going in 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:05:00.430
 top right of the zap 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.249

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.669
 useless whether it be wine or not you 

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:12.520
 will win the same number of the same 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:15.460
 number of two per way what is it to 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.999
 to say a horse equals a parchment so 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.139
 the wolf claims a lot of executives and the 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:21.310
 third fat knew I'm trying 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:23.800
 to try to exploit but I have trouble 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.740
 it is in front of your chameleon breeding 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.490
 chameleon wholesale when you make a 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.949
 baby chameleon 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.009
 for example an emerald plum chameleon 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.060
 level 1 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.159
 you can castrate her that she has not 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.710

 canes and balms 3 million look 

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:43.569
 beckham and so it's been expensive 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.879
 but once you have managed to 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:48.789
 implant your young camellia in your 

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:50.259

 about 800 thousand something like 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.089
 it totally varies from the servers 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.610
 oicha that I saw at 700 800 mhz there 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:11.439

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.919
 you can then coupled with 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:22.810
 plums and he did the first rounds 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:26.199
 down here you do a lot a lot 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:28.240
 of cana so that's about it's pretty much 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.490
 the Swiss mira that I dance enough 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:36.389
 the trick farming me I'm ten thousand 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.389
 cows and 100% begs breeding 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.080
 so I did with the other characters 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:42.280
 to win a few cases map that sacred 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.420

 many a lot the breeding successes and 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:50.590
 so that's it's worth the iut for a 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.710
 perfo and kamas so in addition to 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:56.110
 gaudin cameras breeding for sale 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.840
 shares path that's so that's it 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.980
 breeding is a little hard to get 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.060
 put but once we put it in 

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.170
 more success points we win 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.120
 really a lot when you're really 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.860
 thoroughly you connect a half 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.780
 hour half an hour a day enough 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.170

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:09.280
 hour by day 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.590
 I think it's far from 

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:14.860
 insurmountable and here you go 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.540
