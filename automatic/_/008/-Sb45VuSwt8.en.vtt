quite see it put the puzzle have reached
their<00:00:18.600> optimum<00:00:19.020> height<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.590> here<00:00:20.539> they're

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
their optimum height in here they're

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.269 
their optimum height in here they're
actually<00:00:21.660> touching<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.380> light<00:00:22.680> now<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.220> I'm

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279

get better results I should bring the pH
level<00:02:08.960> down<00:02:09.110> I<00:02:09.500> should<00:02:10.070> start<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.150> pithy

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
level down I should start the pithy

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.550 
level down I should start the pithy
amount<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:12.770> get<00:02:12.920> rid<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:14.560> millionaire

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
amount and get rid of that millionaire

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.800 
amount and get rid of that millionaire
stoning<00:02:15.980> so<00:02:16.370> it's<00:02:16.490> got<00:02:16.610> more<00:02:16.640> more<00:02:17.300> air<00:02:17.510> in

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
stoning so it's got more more air in

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.370 
stoning so it's got more more air in
there<00:02:18.760> their<00:02:19.760> temperatures<00:02:20.150> pretty<00:02:20.380> regular

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
there their temperatures pretty regular

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.480 
there their temperatures pretty regular
so<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.490> quite<00:02:23.000> warm<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.560> quite<00:02:24.560> humid<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.459> I

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
so and quite warm and quite humid so I

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.390 
so and quite warm and quite humid so I
think<00:02:26.030> it's<00:02:26.209> I<00:02:26.780> can<00:02:27.500> really<00:02:27.680> improve<00:02:28.040> on<00:02:28.220> that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
think it's I can really improve on that

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.290 
think it's I can really improve on that
side<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:28.670> things<00:02:29.080> maybe<00:02:30.160> start<00:02:31.160> smoking<00:02:31.700> bit

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
side of things maybe start smoking bit

side of things maybe start smoking bit
more<00:02:32.480> co2<00:02:32.959> would<00:02:33.080> help<00:02:33.380> them<00:02:33.560> out<00:02:34.360> make<00:02:35.360> them<00:02:35.480> a

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.570 
more co2 would help them out make them a
little<00:02:35.750> bit<00:02:35.840> more<00:02:35.990> green<00:02:36.200> especially<00:02:37.780> but

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
little bit more green especially but

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.040 
little bit more green especially but
hydroponics<00:02:40.580> really<00:02:40.970> isn't<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.239> hard<00:02:41.360> it's

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
hydroponics really isn't that hard it's

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.660 
hydroponics really isn't that hard it's
I<00:02:42.380> mean<00:02:42.739> the<00:02:43.160> most<00:02:43.340> one<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.610> most

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
I mean the most one of the most

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.380 
I mean the most one of the most
expensive<00:02:44.360> thing<00:02:44.510> here<00:02:44.690> is<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:45.019> electric

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
expensive thing here is the electric

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.080 
expensive thing here is the electric
that's<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.510> fourteen<00:02:47.930> what<00:02:48.170> light<00:02:48.820> 2news<00:02:49.820> much

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
that's a fourteen what light 2news much

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.570 
that's a fourteen what light 2news much
in<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.300> day<00:02:50.330> it's<00:02:51.320> a<00:02:51.410> seven<00:02:51.709> what<00:02:51.890> pump<00:02:52.160> that

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
in a day it's a seven what pump that

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.000 
in a day it's a seven what pump that
don't<00:02:52.790> really<00:02:53.030> use<00:02:53.150> much<00:02:53.480> most<00:02:54.170> probably<00:02:54.410> who

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
don't really use much most probably who

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.390 
don't really use much most probably who
had<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.420> most<00:02:56.420> probably<00:02:56.720> cost<00:02:57.019> about<00:02:57.190> ten<00:02:58.190> P<00:02:58.370> a

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
had a most probably cost about ten P a

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.949 
had a most probably cost about ten P a
day<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.670> run<00:02:59.380> so<00:03:01.000> three<00:03:02.000> pounds<00:03:02.420> over<00:03:02.690> a<00:03:02.750> month

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959

hydroponics<00:03:10.070> is<00:03:10.190> good<00:03:10.600> and<00:03:11.600> this<00:03:12.110> is<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.320> really

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
hydroponics is good and this is a really
