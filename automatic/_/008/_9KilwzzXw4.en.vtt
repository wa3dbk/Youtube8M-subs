00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 in the stomach there are around 100 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.960
 millions of neurons many more than 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.970
 that contains the spine and that 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.639
 is one of the reasons why he receives 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.559
 the nickname of second brain this network of 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.020
 cells allows to keep a narrow 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.150
 contact between the digestive system and the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.430
 brain through the vagus nerves 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.250
 reporting everything that goes through 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.869
 the first plus the arrival of food 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.939
 to the stomach causes them to be released 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.490
 bloodstream numerous hormones 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.009
 among them are the peptide 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.750
 glp-1 that decreases levels of 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.360
 blood glucose and promotes 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.969
 contraction of the stomach the koleos isto 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.129
 cfk quinine that suppresses the appetite 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.770
 when it detects fats or proteins in 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.440
 food the neighbor that reduces the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.260
 intake or ghrelin also known 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.360
 as hunger hormone the latter has 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 gained popularity in recent years 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 after discovering that his release not only 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.109
 increases appetite but also 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.180
 reduces energy expenditure and favors 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.640
 both the formation of new cumulus 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.680
 fat such as weight gain 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.780
 essence it is known that levels of 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.610
 ghrelin increase sharply 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.700
 of each meal and they fall immediately 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.470
 then to top it off in some individuals 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.240
 obese it has been detected that the 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.310
 hormone concentration does not vary 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.229
 when they eat and when they stop 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.140
 which would explain why in no 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.270
 moment they feel satiated another of the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.729
 committed by ghrelin as revealed 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.649
 recent research is to activate the 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.630
 hippocampus a brain region 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.810
 related learning and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.090
 memory another connection between the brain and 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.520
 the stomach that should be taken into account 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.470
 is that according to what was recently published 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.479
 science magazine we show a 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.060
 more aggressive behavior when 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.340
 we have an empty stomach one of the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.340
 reasons is that diet is the main 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.720
 source of tryptophan an amino acid 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.550
 necessary for the body to produce 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.619
 one of the neurotransmitters that 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.500
 control emotions at the brain level 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.630
 serotonin and therefore the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.700
 tryptophan and serotonin decrease 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.330
 when you do not eat increasing the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.330
 aggressiveness
