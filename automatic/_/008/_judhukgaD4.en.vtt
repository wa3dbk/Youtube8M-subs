00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
some grips in the inside so it doesn't

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.729 
some grips in the inside so it doesn't
scratch<00:00:53.340> your<00:00:53.699> iPad<00:00:54.390> when<00:00:54.930> you're<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.230> when

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.599 
mechanism that rotates 360 degrees on a
ratchet<00:01:01.079> joint<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.469> basically<00:01:01.770> love<00:01:02.399> this

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and it's very secure the base is really

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.020 
and it's very secure the base is really
robust<00:01:10.560> it's<00:01:10.799> made<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.430> pretty<00:01:11.850> good

that<00:01:16.409> great<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:17.009> doesn't<00:01:17.280> really<00:01:17.369> grip<00:01:17.729> onto

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
that great it doesn't really grip onto

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.170 
that great it doesn't really grip onto
my<00:01:18.210> wood<00:01:18.630> table<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.140> lot<00:01:19.320> I<00:01:19.530> didn't<00:01:20.180> experience
