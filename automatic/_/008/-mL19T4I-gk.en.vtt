00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.960
 we are always within ours 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.750
 campus and educational vineyards we see 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.240
 a breeding phase and in the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.939
 specific the formation of the stem for the 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.400
 espalier forms you see pruning 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.830
 last winter made the choice of 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.030
 departing shoots that gave these two 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:37.079
 their diameter is development 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:39.360
 enough to form the stem which 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.510
 of the two we will choose we must give 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.410
 continuity to the lymphatic circuit e 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.320
 respect vigor for continuity 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.780
 of the lymphatic circuit you see mine 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.059
 hand is making the journey starting 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.719
 from the rootstock passing through the point of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.320
 graft come I have already tried the branch 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.549
 which represents our future trunk 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.040
 or stem of life therefore the other will go 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.680
 eliminated even if it is the most upright 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.939
 more vertical the closer to the brace but 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:18.119
 no matter verticality counts the choice 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:23.670
 of the slice that is on the path of the 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:26.040
 lymph therefore I am going to eliminate this 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.329
 branch that is the most vertical I can 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.150
 make a cut having the crowns so 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.369
 that do not germinate trimming the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.439
 portion of dry left to the last 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.079
 winter to reduce the effect of the colon 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.780
 desiccation and I go to determine the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.600
 length depending on the height of the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.899
 quay that in this case is 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:54.229
 this therefore poto just at the level of 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:58.729
 shore wire I clean from the legendary and ho 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:03.780
 chosen my future stem will then go 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:06.060
 evidently tied up on the tutor and doing 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.429
 be careful not to ruin the gems 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.429
 during the tying phase
