00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello there are ideas for you again 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.290
 the editorial 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.859
 I wish you much fun 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.859
 look at 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:18.750
 I'll show you the ribbed pattern today 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:24.330
 alternately two stitches 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:27.779
 basic pattern and two stitches left the 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:32.189
 most mustafa must be paid by 42 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.719
 So I hit 18 and 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:45.450
 start with a mesh in the basic pattern 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:47.510
 and then two left two right two 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.510
 Left 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.890
 right 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.540
 peter link in masters as we always the 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:15.960
 thread before work and then after 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:18.050
 pull through the back and we end up with 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.860
 two stitches on the right 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:26.430
 this edge mesh at the beginning forms the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.890
 second mesh on the right side so 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.850
 this is how the pattern looks right and left 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.460
 rand evenly back we work 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.570
 initially used an additional air 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.200
 do and then together twice each 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.200
 make off 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:08.970
 So again with a right hand stitch 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:11.450
 start two left once, right and so on 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.450
 continue 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.200
 who the Tunisian would like that 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.150
 like to visit our facebook group 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.560
 crocheting or striving hot Tunisian 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:30.090
 There are many more 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.450
 patterns and suggestions of ours 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.450
 members 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:48.910
 and we end up with two guys again 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:52.780
 Right this life pattern is suitable 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:56.110
 good for starting a job with it 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.640
 the pattern does not roll or 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.640
 just as a conclusion 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.550
 and start again with a right 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:30.280
 and immediately drive so the row and 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:33.780
 her free always remains the same as me 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.780
 I wish you a lot of fun with it
