00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.720 

okay<00:00:01.350> we're<00:00:01.560> into<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.890> code<00:00:02.870> 0:01<00:00:04.009> menu<00:00:05.009> and

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
okay we're into the code 0:01 menu and

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.390 
okay we're into the code 0:01 menu and
we<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:06.600> SL<00:00:07.080> H<00:00:07.290> here<00:00:07.589> now<00:00:07.710> this<00:00:07.859> was<00:00:08.069> set<00:00:08.250> at

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
we have SL H here now this was set at

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.360 
we have SL H here now this was set at
400<00:00:09.139> from<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.260> factory<00:00:10.679> I've<00:00:10.889> just<00:00:11.070> reset<00:00:11.340> it

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
400 from the factory I've just reset it

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.950 
400 from the factory I've just reset it
to<00:00:11.460> zero

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
to zero

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.420 
to zero
this<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.380> set<00:00:13.679> level<00:00:14.009> high<00:00:14.480> for<00:00:15.949> the<00:00:16.949> unit

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
this is the set level high for the unit

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.529 
this is the set level high for the unit
and<00:00:18.230> basically<00:00:19.230> it<00:00:19.470> allow<00:00:19.680> us<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.920> do<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.279> to

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
and basically it allow us to do is to

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.400 
and basically it allow us to do is to
change<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.840> max<00:00:22.080> setpoint<00:00:23.779> from<00:00:24.779> safe<00:00:25.109> with

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
change the max setpoint from safe with

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.769 
change the max setpoint from safe with
400<00:00:25.890> over<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> factory<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:27.359> a<00:00:27.390> higher<00:00:27.660> number

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
400 over the factory to a higher number

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.490 
400 over the factory to a higher number
over<00:00:28.410> 400<00:00:28.800> 500<00:00:29.310> 400<00:00:29.760> on<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.439> factory<00:00:31.439> unit<00:00:32.149> it

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
over 400 500 400 on a factory unit it

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.380 
over 400 500 400 on a factory unit it
will<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:34.649> let<00:00:34.860> us<00:00:34.980> go<00:00:35.160> over<00:00:35.190> 400<00:00:36.590> C<00:00:38.390> so

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
will not let us go over 400 C so

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.389 
will not let us go over 400 C so
basically<00:00:39.719> we<00:00:40.230> got<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> do<00:00:40.590> is<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.010> got<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.219> back

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
basically we got to do is I got you back

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.229 
basically we got to do is I got you back
in<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.110> you<00:00:43.110> hold<00:00:43.410> down<00:00:43.649> set<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.520> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
in there so you hold down set and the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.369 
in there so you hold down set and the
left<00:00:45.510> arrow<00:00:50.600> okay<00:00:51.600> then<00:00:51.809> you're<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.050> first

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
left arrow okay then you're in the first

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.160 
left arrow okay then you're in the first
code<00:00:53.340> menu<00:00:54.110> you<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.260> through<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:57.170> then

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
code menu you go through this and then

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.720 
code menu you go through this and then
you<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.399> go<00:00:59.520> into<00:00:59.730> code<00:00:59.940> 0<00:01:00.329> 0<00:01:00.600> 0<00:01:00.840> 1<00:01:01.109> menu

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
you have a you go into code 0 0 0 1 menu

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.670 
you have a you go into code 0 0 0 1 menu
which<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> hidden<00:01:03.300> menu<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.530> this

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
which is a hidden menu and I have this

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.050 
which is a hidden menu and I have this
set<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.010> 1250<00:01:06.979> but<00:01:07.979> it's<00:01:08.130> adjustable<00:01:08.610> anywhere

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
set of 1250 but it's adjustable anywhere

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:19.130 
set of 1250 but it's adjustable anywhere
is<00:01:09.150> over<00:01:09.450> 400<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:14.450> 250

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.030 

three<00:01:20.140> four<00:01:20.500> five<00:01:20.530> six<00:01:21.250> seven<00:01:21.760> eight<00:01:21.940> hundred

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
three four five six seven eight hundred

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.180 
three four five six seven eight hundred
nine<00:01:24.040> hundred<00:01:24.630> thousand<00:01:25.860> twelve<00:01:26.860> fifty

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
nine hundred thousand twelve fifty

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.310 
nine hundred thousand twelve fifty
that's<00:01:27.310> what<00:01:27.520> that<00:01:27.670> probe<00:01:28.000> is<00:01:28.390> a<00:01:29.110> high

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
that's what that probe is a high

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.810 
that's what that probe is a high
temperature<00:01:29.560> probe<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.280> it's<00:01:30.400> rated<00:01:30.700> at

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
temperature probe and it's rated at

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.670 
temperature probe and it's rated at
twelve<00:01:31.180> hundred<00:01:31.360> and<00:01:31.540> fifty<00:01:31.870> I<00:01:31.900> believe<00:01:32.200> so<00:01:32.470> i

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
twelve hundred and fifty I believe so i

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.790 
twelve hundred and fifty I believe so i
set<00:01:33.580> it<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.700> 1250<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.360> max<00:01:34.660> out<00:01:34.870> but<00:01:35.590> i'm<00:01:35.680> going

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
set it to 1250 to max out but i'm going

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.030 
set it to 1250 to max out but i'm going
to<00:01:35.860> just<00:01:35.980> do<00:01:37.080> which<00:01:38.080> is<00:01:38.230> the<00:01:38.350> maximum<00:01:38.770> for<00:01:38.980> the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
to just do which is the maximum for the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.070 
to just do which is the maximum for the
probe<00:01:39.310> so<00:01:39.550> now<00:01:39.670> i<00:01:39.700> get<00:01:40.000> out<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.210> this<00:01:40.330> menu<00:01:40.600> or

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
probe so now i get out of this menu or

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:49.560 
probe so now i get out of this menu or
holding<00:01:41.610> set<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.820> left<00:01:43.030> arrow<00:01:48.390> there's<00:01:49.390> also

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
holding set and left arrow there's also

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.510 
holding set and left arrow there's also
a<00:01:49.720> s<00:01:49.990> ll<00:01:50.380> in<00:01:50.560> there<00:01:50.680> which<00:01:50.800> I<00:01:50.890> believe<00:01:51.130> is<00:01:51.310> set

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
a s ll in there which I believe is set

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.600 
a s ll in there which I believe is set
level<00:01:51.880> low<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:53.350> I<00:01:53.380> haven't<00:01:53.590> played<00:01:54.040> with<00:01:54.430> that

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
level low so I haven't played with that

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.980 
level low so I haven't played with that
yet<00:01:54.850> but<00:01:55.000> I'm<00:01:55.090> not<00:01:55.180> going<00:01:55.360> to<00:01:55.420> use<00:01:55.540> it<00:01:55.690> anyways

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
yet but I'm not going to use it anyways

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.430 
yet but I'm not going to use it anyways
so<00:01:56.100> what<00:01:57.100> step<00:01:57.340> we<00:01:57.910> have<00:01:58.060> our<00:01:58.210> temperature<00:01:59.200> set

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
so what step we have our temperature set

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:06.120 
so what step we have our temperature set
at<00:01:59.760> 232<00:02:00.760> we<00:02:01.690> can<00:02:01.840> raise<00:02:01.990> this<00:02:02.230> up<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:04.420> five<00:02:05.140> so

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
at 232 we can raise this up for five so

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.180 
at 232 we can raise this up for five so
we're<00:02:06.250> going<00:02:06.400> above<00:02:06.610> the<00:02:06.670> 400<00:02:07.180> by<00:02:07.300> default<00:02:08.190> so

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
we're going above the 400 by default so

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.680 
we're going above the 400 by default so
we'll<00:02:09.550> turn<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.850> down<00:02:10.000> a<00:02:10.060> little<00:02:10.270> bit<00:02:10.450> just<00:02:10.510> do

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
we'll turn it down a little bit just do

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.560 
we'll turn it down a little bit just do
a<00:02:10.720> quick<00:02:10.960> test<00:02:11.260> here<00:02:12.120> set<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.620> 332<00:02:15.450> for<00:02:16.450> our

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
a quick test here set it to 332 for our

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:35.260 
a quick test here set it to 332 for our
set<00:02:16.810> value<00:02:17.170> and<00:02:18.120> we<00:02:19.120> will<00:02:19.360> go<00:02:19.510> over<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.930> our

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.970 

they're<00:02:35.630> probing<00:02:36.080> air<00:02:36.410> as<00:02:36.590> you<00:02:36.680> can<00:02:36.800> see

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
they're probing air as you can see

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.360 
they're probing air as you can see
reclining

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
reclining

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.670 
reclining
we<00:02:39.700> reached<00:02:39.910> our<00:02:40.120> setpoint<00:02:40.660> way<00:02:41.319> over<00:02:41.650> our

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
we reached our setpoint way over our

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.309 
we reached our setpoint way over our
setpoint

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.869 

and<00:02:45.099> now<00:02:45.280> we're<00:02:45.519> cooling<00:02:46.209> back<00:02:46.480> down<00:02:47.819> now<00:02:48.819> you

00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 
and now we're cooling back down now you

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.830 
and now we're cooling back down now you
get<00:02:49.090> tired<00:02:49.299> of<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.629> annoying<00:02:49.900> alarm<00:02:51.689> you<00:02:52.689> have

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
get tired of the annoying alarm you have

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.000 
get tired of the annoying alarm you have
an<00:02:52.959> alarm<00:02:53.609> silenced<00:02:54.609> lever<00:02:54.849> here<00:02:55.090> we'll<00:02:55.239> just

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
an alarm silenced lever here we'll just
