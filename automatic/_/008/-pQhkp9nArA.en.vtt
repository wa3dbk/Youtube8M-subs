00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.430
 today in this tutorial we will explain 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.200
 how our Balinese bed is mounted na 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:18.330
 the tools necessary for the 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.850
 assembly are a hammer a screwdriver 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.160
 electric one meter and one allen key 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.170
 Number 8 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.050
 your home will come with the following 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.779
 packaging 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.410
 As you can see, it is easy to transport between 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.410
 two people 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.010
 We are going to group the pieces by type for 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.010
 make assembly easier 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.000
 first of all let's put together a 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.490
 square structure that will remain of the 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.620
 next way it is made up of two pieces 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.900
 to one c and one of the located the two 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.730
 pieces to parallel we go to the 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.070
 where the three are located 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.100
 holes in the inside face and the others 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.680
 three abroad we place in the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.990
 half a metal block and then 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.310
 we screw the screw in the ends 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.310
 we place the wooden blocks 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.680
 we carried out this process in the six 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.170
 holes of each wood will remain of the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.470
 Following way 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.470
 ah 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.610
 to make them easier assembly as 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.130
 first thing we will do is place the 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.229
 piece and leave it wedged between 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.229
 two pieces and without getting to screw 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.000
 then we went to the other side 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.149
 to join the two woods with the piece 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.640
 so that they fit we must place the 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.530
 circular piece as follows 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.829
 they have to look good in the background and with the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.570
 arrow as seen in the picture 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.729
 we fit the wood and press with the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.509
 help of an allen key until it is 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.509
 well subject 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.200
 now if we have it once 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.940
 place the four screws of the piece 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.940
 that we had left without screwing 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.560
 i 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.200
 the next step is to mount another 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:23.269
 square structure similar to the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.269
 previous but with the addition of the piece 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.520
 We placed three wooden blocks in the 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.080
 end of this piece and the other three 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.080
 directly in the structure 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.799
 we exert pressure to make it look good 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.049
 subject once we have it screwed 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.290
 the rest of the woods repeating the same 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:46.569
 process that the previous structure now 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.510
 we will stand up what we have armed and 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.819
 we will unite it with two pieces but before 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.129
 we must prepare them by placing the 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.280
 circular pieces as we have explained 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.170
 above and we fit them by squeezing 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.200
 with an Allen key until it is 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.200
 firm 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.780
 Y 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.790
 Y 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.450
 now we have to place four pieces 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:25.190
 but as you see in picture 2 in the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.190
 ends and 2 in the middle 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.730
 50 centimeters will be separated one from 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.160
 the other and leaving 2 centimeters with 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.410
 regarding the 4 pillars 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.900
 the woods that go in the column have 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.880
 four holes as you can see from 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.210
 moment are the only ones that we are going to 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.210
 screw 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.010
 we get an efe piece and the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.170
 holes that they see will serve us for 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.469
 screw the as shown in the 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.469
 image 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.090
 now yes screw the two pieces see 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.890
 that we are missing by verifying that they are 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.890
 50 centimeters one from another 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.540
 just missing the tables for 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.820
 finish the structure before 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.079
 we screw the three also 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.079
 with two centimeters of distance 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.889
 now yes screw a screw for 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.889
 corner in each table 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.630
 Y 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.110
 just need to put the mattress and the 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.110
 curtains 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.280
 this is the final result 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.290
 If you still have not done with our 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.910
 Balinese bed you can place the order
