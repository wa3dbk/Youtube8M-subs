00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.120
 good news we are not with the great 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.100
 anticipation of seeing this warrior come back 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.260
 to climb on the platform but we have to 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.320
 for another year to see how 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.200
 large can be put to have another promo 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.100
 mexican the idea is to arrive with 130 kilos 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.820
 dry 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:36.690
 now we go to 150 to lose 20 kilos 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.970
 but lean and dry well in 130 not 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.840
 Mexico has done no hope 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.580
 to be able to arrive not from the limits 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.830
 I think they are only in the head 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.780
 of one and there are people who have achieved it 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.760
 because one does not and you have to follow 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.450
 setting limits and trying to pass it yes 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.840
 and always always always leave very 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.840
 high and 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.620
 proudly represent mexico its 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:06.409
