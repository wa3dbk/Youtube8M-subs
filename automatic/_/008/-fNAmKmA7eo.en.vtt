going to go do a little mowing the

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.749 
going to go do a little mowing the
throttle<00:00:12.450> wouldn't<00:00:12.780> stay<00:00:13.370> too<00:00:14.370> high<00:00:14.580> enough

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
throttle wouldn't stay too high enough

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:22.880 
throttle wouldn't stay too high enough
rpm<00:00:16.400> so<00:00:17.400> what<00:00:18.180> happened<00:00:18.539> was<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.850> plate<00:00:21.890> did

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
rpm so what happened was this plate did

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.330 
rpm so what happened was this plate did
this<00:00:23.039> things<00:00:23.609> here<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.660> plate<00:00:24.990> moves<00:00:25.920> our

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340

this things here this plate moves our
excusing<00:00:27.029> holds<00:00:27.330> this<00:00:27.480> lever<00:00:28.410> this<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.800> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
excusing holds this lever this is the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.770 
excusing holds this lever this is the
throttle<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.960> it's<00:00:30.960> worn<00:00:31.289> out<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:32.780> ordered

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
throttle and it's worn out so ordered

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.270 
throttle and it's worn out so ordered
this<00:00:33.930> new<00:00:33.989> one<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:35.700> has<00:00:36.890> nice<00:00:37.890> sharp

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
this new one and this has nice sharp

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.299 
this new one and this has nice sharp
serrations<00:00:38.940> here<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.420> hold<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:40.309> throttle

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
serrations here to hold the throttle

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.049 
serrations here to hold the throttle
lever<00:00:41.610> where<00:00:42.120> you<00:00:42.239> set<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.629> well<00:00:44.059> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
lever where you set it well the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.740 
lever where you set it well the
best-laid<00:00:45.360> plans<00:00:45.539> of<00:00:45.989> mice<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.230> men<00:00:47.750> took

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
best-laid plans of mice and men took

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
best-laid plans of mice and men took
this<00:00:48.899> off<00:00:49.140> if<00:00:49.950> I<00:00:50.129> haven't<00:00:50.280> finished<00:00:50.550> doing<00:00:50.850> yet

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
this off if I haven't finished doing yet

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.740 
this off if I haven't finished doing yet
but<00:00:51.539> has<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.829> nice<00:00:53.520> hole<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> rush

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
but has this nice hole with the rush

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.299 
but has this nice hole with the rush
this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.829> flimsy<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.530> when<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.649> pushes<00:00:59.100> down

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
this is flimsy so when this pushes down

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.810 
this is flimsy so when this pushes down
against<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> plate<00:01:00.320> it<00:01:01.320> obviously<00:01:02.250> has<00:01:02.789> a

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
against the plate it obviously has a

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.609 
against the plate it obviously has a
problem<00:01:03.149> holding<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.840> so<00:01:04.110> what<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.470> going<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
problem holding it so what I'm going to

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.890 
problem holding it so what I'm going to
do<00:01:05.540> is<00:01:06.540> I'm<00:01:06.810> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.990> take<00:01:07.229> this<00:01:07.409> plate<00:01:07.710> off

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
do is I'm going to take this plate off

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.660 
do is I'm going to take this plate off
do<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> couple<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.470> modifications<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
do a couple little modifications to it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.230 
do a couple little modifications to it
to<00:01:12.210> cut<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.570> so<00:01:12.860> that<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.250> fit<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.549> down<00:01:15.000> into

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
to cut it so that I can fit it down into

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.960 
to cut it so that I can fit it down into
this<00:01:15.420> panel<00:01:16.640> make<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> new<00:01:18.409> piece<00:01:19.409> for<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.729> to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
this panel make a new piece for this to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.109 
this panel make a new piece for this to
bolt<00:01:21.210> into<00:01:21.979> so<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.220> throttle<00:01:23.670> will<00:01:23.850> stay

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
bolt into so the throttle will stay

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.969 
bolt into so the throttle will stay
where<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.110> set<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.630> fix<00:01:27.630> this<00:01:27.900> where<00:01:28.860> it's

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
where you set it and fix this where it's

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.460 
where you set it and fix this where it's
rotted<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.729> won't<00:01:29.790> be<00:01:29.970> perfect<00:01:30.350> but<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
rotted out it won't be perfect but it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.359 
rotted out it won't be perfect but it
should<00:01:31.680> work<00:01:31.710> okay<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:33.650> yeah<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:35.009> was<00:01:35.100> going

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
should work okay but yeah that was going

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.830 
should work okay but yeah that was going
to<00:01:35.430> be<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> little<00:01:35.759> job<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> thought<00:01:36.689> would

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
to be a little job that I thought would

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.980 
to be a little job that I thought would
take<00:01:36.900> probably<00:01:37.460> half<00:01:38.460> an<00:01:38.610> hour<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.240> but<00:01:39.509> of

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
take probably half an hour so but of

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.510 
take probably half an hour so but of
course<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.439> screws<00:01:40.770> were<00:01:41.070> grown<00:01:41.369> into<00:01:41.670> the

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
course the screws were grown into the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.230 
course the screws were grown into the
thrown<00:01:44.520> into<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.259> sheet<00:01:46.259> metal<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.240> I

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
thrown into the sheet metal here and I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.910 
thrown into the sheet metal here and I
drove<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.570> heads<00:01:48.780> off<00:01:49.049> and<00:01:49.079> then<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> got<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
drove the heads off and then I got the

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.789 
drove the heads off and then I got the
plate<00:01:50.159> out<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.520> way<00:01:50.750> all<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:52.049> right<00:01:52.320> so

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
plate out of the way all that right so

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.660 
plate out of the way all that right so
that's<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.880> for<00:01:54.030> now<00:01:54.530> just<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:56.189> know<00:01:56.280> nothing

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that's it for now just you know nothing

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.090 
that's it for now just you know nothing
is<00:01:56.790> bolt<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.299> not<00:01:58.079> usually<00:01:58.500> anyway<00:01:58.890> on

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
is bolt on not usually anyway on

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.819 
is bolt on not usually anyway on
something<00:01:59.520> let's<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.270> it's<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.899> 48<00:02:01.259> tractor

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
something let's see it's a 48 tractor

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.560 
something let's see it's a 48 tractor
you<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> math

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
you do the math

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.409 
you do the math
all<00:02:03.110> right
