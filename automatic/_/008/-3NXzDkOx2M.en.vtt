change<00:02:16.600> it<00:02:16.750> out<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:17.049> unscrew<00:02:17.799> that<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.340> you

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
change it out is unscrew that and you

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:28.199 
change it out is unscrew that and you
want<00:02:19.480> to<00:02:19.600> free<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.019> eye<00:02:20.049> from<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.650> plate

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.020 

as<00:02:28.480> you<00:02:28.930> can<00:02:29.110> see<00:02:29.319> first<00:02:30.189> thing<00:02:30.459> we<00:02:30.549> do<00:02:30.700> after

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
as you can see first thing we do after

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.630 
as you can see first thing we do after
we<00:02:31.060> shut<00:02:31.299> the<00:02:31.450> power<00:02:31.629> off<00:02:31.810> we've<00:02:32.409> already

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
we shut the power off we've already

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.339 
we shut the power off we've already
covered<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.909> eye<00:02:33.939> to<00:02:34.659> make<00:02:34.689> sure<00:02:35.019> that<00:02:35.170> it's

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
covered the eye to make sure that it's

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.170 
covered the eye to make sure that it's
often<00:02:35.739> we<00:02:35.829> want<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.159> do<00:02:36.250> another<00:02:36.489> check<00:02:36.790> on<00:02:36.849> it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
often we want to do another check on it

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.229 
often we want to do another check on it
so<00:02:37.840> we<00:02:37.989> disengaged<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.890> plate<00:02:39.159> from<00:02:40.030> the<00:02:40.120> eye

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
so we disengaged a plate from the eye

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.110 
so we disengaged a plate from the eye
and<00:02:40.659> now<00:02:41.260> we<00:02:41.319> check<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:41.980> really<00:02:42.819> make<00:02:42.970> sure

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
and now we check for really make sure

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.059 
and now we check for really make sure
that<00:02:43.269> the<00:02:43.390> power<00:02:43.569> is<00:02:43.900> off<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:47.530> is<00:02:47.709> a<00:02:47.739> power

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
that the power is off this is a power

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.640 
that the power is off this is a power
tester<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:48.849> I'm<00:02:48.970> using<00:02:49.209> and<00:02:49.659> normally<00:02:50.500> if

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
tester that I'm using and normally if

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.699 
tester that I'm using and normally if
there's<00:02:50.920> power<00:02:51.129> the<00:02:52.120> tip<00:02:52.359> of<00:02:52.510> this<00:02:52.629> here<00:02:53.079> will

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
there's power the tip of this here will

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.110 
there's power the tip of this here will
light<00:02:53.920> up<00:02:54.129> and<00:02:54.340> we'll<00:02:54.459> get<00:02:54.609> a<00:02:54.670> beeping<00:02:55.060> sound

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
light up and we'll get a beeping sound

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.780 
light up and we'll get a beeping sound
as<00:02:55.659> you<00:02:55.689> can<00:02:55.989> tell<00:02:56.260> there<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.010> no<00:02:57.280> power<00:02:57.549> at

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
as you can tell there is no power at

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.000 
as you can tell there is no power at
this<00:02:57.939> point<00:02:58.239> it's<00:02:58.780> always<00:02:59.140> confusing<00:02:59.829> when

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
this point it's always confusing when

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.319 
this point it's always confusing when
you're<00:03:00.099> disconnecting<00:03:00.760> wires<00:03:00.790> and

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
you're disconnecting wires and

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.979 
you're disconnecting wires and
reconnecting<00:03:02.019> my<00:03:02.620> advice<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.340> three<00:03:04.000> wires

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
reconnecting my advice is three wires

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:09.440 
reconnecting my advice is three wires
and<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.739> photo<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:07.150> black<00:03:07.359> is<00:03:07.629> the<00:03:07.659> power

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
and the photo I the black is the power

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.180 
and the photo I the black is the power
the<00:03:10.450> red<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.840> the<00:03:10.989> load<00:03:11.230> which<00:03:11.709> means<00:03:12.010> just

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
the red is the load which means just

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.429 
the red is the load which means just
goes<00:03:12.370> to<00:03:12.549> the<00:03:12.670> switch<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:13.329> the<00:03:14.079> white<00:03:14.260> is

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:14.439 
goes to the switch and the white is

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.830 
goes to the switch and the white is
always<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.769> neutral<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.549> strongly<00:03:16.510> recommend

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
always a neutral I strongly recommend

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.690 
always a neutral I strongly recommend
that<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.409> take<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:17.799> cap<00:03:18.760> off<00:03:20.400> for<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.489> black

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
that you take the cap off for the black

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.700 
that you take the cap off for the black
first<00:03:22.060> the<00:03:22.359> power

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.830 

and<00:03:26.800> the<00:03:27.430> best<00:03:27.610> way<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:27.850> do<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.240> so<00:03:28.270> it's<00:03:28.630> less

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
and the best way to do it so it's less

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.570 
and the best way to do it so it's less
confusing<00:03:29.020> once<00:03:29.740> you<00:03:29.860> have<00:03:30.070> all<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.370> wires

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
confusing once you have all the wires

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.800 
confusing once you have all the wires
off<00:03:30.940> is<00:03:31.240> once<00:03:31.900> you<00:03:32.050> disconnect<00:03:32.260> one<00:03:32.830> wire

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
off is once you disconnect one wire

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.700 
off is once you disconnect one wire
connect<00:03:34.810> it<00:03:35.970> to<00:03:36.970> where<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.240> needs<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.540> go

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
connect it to where it needs to go

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.230 
connect it to where it needs to go
instead<00:03:38.710> of<00:03:38.890> disconnecting<00:03:39.670> all<00:03:39.820> three<00:03:40.120> at

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
instead of disconnecting all three at

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.380 
instead of disconnecting all three at
one<00:03:40.420> time<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:44.370> then<00:03:45.370> put<00:03:45.580> the<00:03:45.700> cap<00:03:45.910> back<00:03:45.940> on

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
one time and then put the cap back on

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.130 
one time and then put the cap back on

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
the white which I'm going in and I'm

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.060 
the white which I'm going in and I'm
going<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:54.580> take<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.940> cap<00:03:55.150> off<00:03:55.360> now<00:03:55.690> off<00:03:56.410> the

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
changed if you put all the wiring back

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.150

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:10.249 
you need to push the wires in and then

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:18.249 
you need to push the wires in and then
