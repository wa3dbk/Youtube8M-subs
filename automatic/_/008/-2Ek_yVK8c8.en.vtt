00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
different reasons that the toughness

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.050 
different reasons that the toughness
clearly<00:03:41.209> is<00:03:41.420> something<00:03:42.350> to<00:03:42.440> be<00:03:42.590> admired<00:03:43.340> by

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060

clearly is something to be admired by
other<00:03:44.269> teams<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:45.139> it's<00:03:45.470> a<00:03:45.680> gritty<00:03:46.069> team

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
other teams and it's a gritty team

they're<00:03:46.489> playing<00:03:46.519> their<00:03:46.819> best<00:03:46.850> football<00:03:47.359> I

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
they're playing their best football I

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.120 
they're playing their best football I
think<00:03:47.720> they<00:03:47.870> have<00:03:47.900> a<00:03:48.109> really<00:03:48.620> good<00:03:48.739> chance<00:03:48.799> to

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
think they have a really good chance to

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.860 
think they have a really good chance to
go<00:03:49.220> out<00:03:49.250> in<00:03:49.430> Denver<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:49.730> win<00:03:49.970> this<00:03:50.090> game<00:03:50.329> the

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
go out in Denver and win this game the

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.319 
go out in Denver and win this game the
key<00:03:51.049> is<00:03:51.200> don't<00:03:51.680> turn<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.069> ball<00:03:52.100> over<00:03:52.329> fumbles

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
key is don't turn the ball over fumbles

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.819 
key is don't turn the ball over fumbles
in<00:03:53.450> their<00:03:53.569> first<00:03:53.720> three<00:03:54.049> possessions<00:03:54.200> in<00:03:54.650> week

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
in their first three possessions in week

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:57.400 
in their first three possessions in week
12<00:03:55.010> they<00:03:55.910> fell<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.480> an<00:03:56.599> early<00:03:56.810> deficit<00:03:57.260> because

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
12 they fell to an early deficit because

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:59.740 
12 they fell to an early deficit because
of<00:03:57.709> that<00:03:57.889> the<00:03:58.310> entire<00:03:58.639> game<00:03:58.970> you're<00:03:59.480> not<00:03:59.599> going

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
of that the entire game you're not going

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.809 
of that the entire game you're not going
to<00:03:59.810> see<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.230> game<00:04:00.410> like<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:00.680> this<00:04:01.010> weekend<00:04:01.459> but

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
to see a game like that this weekend but

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.339 
to see a game like that this weekend but
I<00:04:01.880> think<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.180> Patriots<00:04:02.480> are<00:04:02.720> more<00:04:02.870> efficient

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
I think the Patriots are more efficient

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:04.870 
I think the Patriots are more efficient
offensively<00:04:03.889> I<00:04:04.040> think<00:04:04.280> they're<00:04:04.430> equipped<00:04:04.730> to

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
offensively I think they're equipped to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.089 
offensively I think they're equipped to
go<00:04:05.000> out<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.299> handle<00:04:05.630> this<00:04:05.750> on<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.500> road<00:04:06.709> you

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
go out and handle this on the road you

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:08.470 
go out and handle this on the road you
just<00:04:07.310> got<00:04:07.459> to<00:04:07.489> be<00:04:07.670> smart<00:04:07.700> with<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.299> football

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
just got to be smart with the football

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.210 
just got to be smart with the football
if<00:04:08.989> they<00:04:09.139> don't<00:04:09.230> turn<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.560> ball<00:04:09.590> over<00:04:09.739> i<00:04:10.010> think

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
if they don't turn the ball over i think

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.890 
if they don't turn the ball over i think
they<00:04:10.310> win<00:04:10.489> the<00:04:10.579> game<00:04:10.760> well<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.450> there's<00:04:11.720> no

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
they win the game well and there's no

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.960 
they win the game well and there's no
they<00:04:12.230> have<00:04:12.380> no<00:04:12.560> shot<00:04:12.859> of<00:04:12.889> coming<00:04:13.310> back<00:04:13.459> 24

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
they have no shot of coming back 24

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.240 
they have no shot of coming back 24
nothing<00:04:14.359> this<00:04:14.510> time<00:04:14.750> I<00:04:15.049> mean<00:04:15.230> they<00:04:15.859> don't<00:04:16.010> have

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
nothing this time I mean they don't have

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.550 
nothing this time I mean they don't have
Rob<00:04:16.489> Gronkowski<00:04:17.209> they<00:04:17.359> don't<00:04:17.539> have<00:04:17.810> what<00:04:18.349> they

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
Rob Gronkowski they don't have what they

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.770 
Rob Gronkowski they don't have what they
had<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:19.160> come<00:04:19.400> back<00:04:19.430> the<00:04:20.120> last<00:04:20.359> time<00:04:20.630> they<00:04:20.750> came

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
had to come back the last time they came

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.649 
had to come back the last time they came
back<00:04:21.169> yeah<00:04:21.739> ball<00:04:22.580> security<00:04:22.760> is<00:04:23.210> huge

00:04:23.649 --> 00:04:23.659 
back yeah ball security is huge

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:26.330 
back yeah ball security is huge
especially<00:04:23.960> now<00:04:24.590> they<00:04:25.159> can't

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
especially now they can't

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.900 
especially now they can't
be<00:04:26.520> confident<00:04:27.030> up<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:28.590> know<00:04:28.880> Denver<00:04:29.880> is

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
be confident up and you know Denver is

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.629 
be confident up and you know Denver is
going<00:04:30.600> to<00:04:30.690> be<00:04:30.750> much<00:04:30.960> smarter<00:04:31.380> with<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.430> lead

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
going to be much smarter with the lead

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.640 
going to be much smarter with the lead
this<00:04:32.910> time<00:04:32.970> around<00:04:33.360> they're<00:04:34.260> not<00:04:34.380> going<00:04:34.590> to

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
this time around they're not going to

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.860 
this time around they're not going to
make<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:34.979> same<00:04:35.190> mistakes<00:04:35.610> that<00:04:35.729> they<00:04:35.970> made<00:04:36.000> in

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
make the same mistakes that they made in

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.469 
make the same mistakes that they made in
foxboro<00:04:37.530> seven<00:04:37.949> weeks<00:04:38.130> ago<00:04:38.310> they<00:04:39.180> did<00:04:39.330> almost

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
foxboro seven weeks ago they did almost

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.510 
foxboro seven weeks ago they did almost
cough<00:04:39.840> up<00:04:40.020> a<00:04:40.139> weird<00:04:40.380> lead<00:04:40.650> last<00:04:40.979> week<00:04:41.220> against

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
cough up a weird lead last week against

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.219 
cough up a weird lead last week against
the<00:04:41.580> charges<00:04:42.120> but<00:04:42.300> again<00:04:42.570> I<00:04:42.780> mean<00:04:42.930> it's<00:04:43.080> it's

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
the charges but again I mean it's it's

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.500 
the charges but again I mean it's it's
so<00:04:43.470> much<00:04:43.680> more<00:04:43.889> difficult<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:44.610> erase<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.180> big

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
so much more difficult to erase a big

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.879 
so much more difficult to erase a big
deficit<00:04:45.990> when<00:04:46.139> you're<00:04:46.320> on<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.470> road<00:04:46.680> they

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
deficit when you're on the road they

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.050 
deficit when you're on the road they
don't<00:04:47.070> have<00:04:47.190> the<00:04:47.310> Gillette<00:04:47.580> Stadium<00:04:47.760> crowd

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
don't have the Gillette Stadium crowd

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.700 
don't have the Gillette Stadium crowd
behind<00:04:48.449> him<00:04:48.600> and<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:48.900> is<00:04:49.080> fairly

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
behind him and that is fairly

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.040 
behind him and that is fairly
significant<00:04:50.430> in<00:04:50.520> terms<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.850> NFL<00:04:51.240> momentum<00:04:51.840> so

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
significant in terms of NFL momentum so

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.810 
significant in terms of NFL momentum so
we'll<00:04:52.530> see<00:04:52.680> how<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.830> Patriots<00:04:53.310> handle<00:04:53.669> those

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
we'll see how the Patriots handle those

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.430 
we'll see how the Patriots handle those
three<00:04:54.120> keys<00:04:54.360> and<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.720> follow<00:04:54.900> all<00:04:55.199> of<00:04:55.229> our
