but<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.170> be<00:03:33.290> kind<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.620> one<00:03:33.769> with<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.040> earth<00:03:34.219> and

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
but to be kind of one with the earth and

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.429 
but to be kind of one with the earth and
actually<00:03:34.939> get<00:03:35.659> in<00:03:35.810> there<00:03:35.900> and<00:03:36.049> do<00:03:36.139> that<00:03:36.170> which

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
actually get in there and do that which

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.959 
actually get in there and do that which
I<00:03:36.530> think<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:36.829> a<00:03:36.920> city<00:03:37.129> like<00:03:37.370> LA<00:03:37.639> a<00:03:37.670> lot<00:03:37.879> of

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:37.969 
I think in a city like LA a lot of

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:39.280 
I think in a city like LA a lot of
people<00:03:38.180> don't<00:03:38.420> get<00:03:38.540> that<00:03:38.599> because<00:03:38.989> you<00:03:39.170> don't

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
people don't get that because you don't

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.679 
people don't get that because you don't
have<00:03:39.409> a<00:03:39.530> backyard<00:03:40.030> it's<00:03:41.030> most<00:03:41.269> important<00:03:41.629> to

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689 
have a backyard it's most important to

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.030 
have a backyard it's most important to
know<00:03:41.810> that<00:03:42.019> if<00:03:42.139> you<00:03:42.260> want<00:03:42.439> to<00:03:42.500> do<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.739> can't

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
know that if you want to do it can't

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
know that if you want to do it can't
then<00:03:43.250> you<00:03:43.370> should<00:03:43.549> do<00:03:43.879> it<00:03:44.000> tomorrow<00:03:44.379> it's<00:03:45.379> easy

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
then you should do it tomorrow it's easy

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.309 
then you should do it tomorrow it's easy
the<00:03:47.060> way<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.510> start<00:03:47.689> a<00:03:47.750> guerrilla<00:03:47.930> garden

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:48.319 
the way to start a guerrilla garden

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.440 
the way to start a guerrilla garden
first<00:03:48.769> thing<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.220> you<00:03:49.430> want<00:03:49.609> to<00:03:49.639> do<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:50.000> little

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
first thing is you want to do a little

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.610 
first thing is you want to do a little
bit<00:03:50.629> of<00:03:50.659> research<00:03:50.959> about<00:03:51.169> what<00:03:51.349> type<00:03:51.590> of

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
bit of research about what type of

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.770 
bit of research about what type of
plants<00:03:52.040> work<00:03:52.370> well<00:03:52.549> for<00:03:52.760> your<00:03:52.879> area<00:03:53.180> what<00:03:53.599> we

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
plants work well for your area what we

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.789 
plants work well for your area what we
do<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:54.019> all<00:03:54.139> succulents<00:03:54.650> and

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
do is all succulents and

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.080 
do is all succulents and
drought-tolerant<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.489> it's<00:03:55.669> actually<00:03:55.790> really

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
drought-tolerant so it's actually really

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.520 
drought-tolerant so it's actually really
easy<00:03:56.120> to<00:03:56.419> maintain<00:03:56.569> there's<00:03:57.019> not<00:03:57.230> a<00:03:57.260> ton<00:03:57.500> of

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
easy to maintain there's not a ton of

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.259 
easy to maintain there's not a ton of
water<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:58.280> then<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.519> start<00:03:58.849> figuring<00:03:59.030> out

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
water and then you start figuring out

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.509 
water and then you start figuring out
where<00:03:59.629> can<00:03:59.810> I<00:03:59.959> find<00:04:00.349> a<00:04:00.590> spot<00:04:00.859> that's<00:04:01.129> going<00:04:01.370> to

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
where can I find a spot that's going to

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.789 
where can I find a spot that's going to
work<00:04:01.700> this<00:04:01.939> small<00:04:02.299> is<00:04:02.599> better<00:04:02.780> than<00:04:02.989> big<00:04:03.230> you

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
work this small is better than big you

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.039 
work this small is better than big you
want<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.040> kind<00:04:04.730> of<00:04:04.849> maintain<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.689> bigger<00:04:05.870> it

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
want to kind of maintain the bigger it

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.629 
want to kind of maintain the bigger it
gets<00:04:06.200> harder<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.620> take<00:04:06.829> care<00:04:07.040> of<00:04:07.069> places<00:04:07.549> that

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:07.639 
gets harder to take care of places that

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:09.099 
gets harder to take care of places that
are<00:04:07.700> near<00:04:07.939> where<00:04:08.299> you<00:04:08.389> live<00:04:08.599> where<00:04:08.989> you<00:04:09.019> work

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.229 
want to take care of the garden and not
just<00:04:12.650> plant<00:04:12.889> it<00:04:12.949> once<00:04:13.159> and<00:04:13.430> leave<00:04:13.849> it<00:04:14.000> because

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
just plant it once and leave it because

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.449 
just plant it once and leave it because
it<00:04:14.359> might<00:04:14.479> turn<00:04:14.659> into<00:04:14.840> what<00:04:15.290> you<00:04:15.409> had<00:04:15.590> just<00:04:16.280> do
