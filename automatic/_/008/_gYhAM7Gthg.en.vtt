I<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.800> on<00:02:12.980> an<00:02:13.130> even<00:02:13.430> higher<00:02:13.730> note<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.260> remember

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
I and on an even higher note I remember

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.740

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.490 
I had those xbox live memory cards out
already<00:02:18.110> so<00:02:18.410> why<00:02:18.709> not<00:02:18.890> put<00:02:19.070> them<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.340> good<00:02:19.459> use

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
already so why not put them to good use
