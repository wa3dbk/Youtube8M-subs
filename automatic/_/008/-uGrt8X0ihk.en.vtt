from<00:00:28.890> Waco<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.730> biggest<00:00:30.000> set<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.179> ever<00:00:30.359> had<00:00:30.660> is

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
from Waco the biggest set I ever had is

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.090 
from Waco the biggest set I ever had is
the<00:00:32.189> Tower<00:00:32.550> Bridge<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.510> most<00:00:33.719> pieces

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
the Tower Bridge that is the most pieces

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.880 
the Tower Bridge that is the most pieces
it's<00:00:35.100> over<00:00:35.540> 4,200<00:00:36.540> something<00:00:36.930> pieces<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.620> set

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
it's over 4,200 something pieces and set

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.729 
it's over 4,200 something pieces and set
102<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.670> four<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.149> have<00:00:39.420> three<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.780> those<00:00:39.899> and

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
102 one four I have three of those and

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.709 
102 one four I have three of those and
the<00:00:41.100> smallest<00:00:41.489> set<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.910> one<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.360> I'm<00:00:42.540> going

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
the smallest set is one like I'm going

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.660 
the smallest set is one like I'm going
to<00:00:42.750> review<00:00:43.020> today<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.320> think<00:00:43.710> about<00:00:43.920> 4<00:00:44.280> pieces

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to review today I think about 4 pieces

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.330 
to review today I think about 4 pieces
is<00:00:45.059> probably<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.750> smallest<00:00:46.110> I've<00:00:46.500> had<00:00:46.680> not

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
is probably the smallest I've had not

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
is probably the smallest I've had not
counting<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.879> something<00:00:48.660> that's<00:00:48.780> just<00:00:48.989> like

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
counting this something that's just like

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.139 
counting this something that's just like
a<00:00:49.230> mini<00:00:49.530> figure<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:51.210> we're<00:00:51.570> gonna<00:00:51.690> review<00:00:52.110> that

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
a mini figure so we're gonna review that

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.240 
a mini figure so we're gonna review that
alright<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.329> are<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.449> lot<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.780> sets<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.289> are

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
alright there are a lot of sets that are

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.130 
alright there are a lot of sets that are
not<00:00:56.430> really<00:00:56.579> sets<00:00:56.969> or<00:00:57.210> just<00:00:57.390> one<00:00:57.570> piece<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.230> a

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
not really sets or just one piece like a

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.470 
not really sets or just one piece like a
baseplate<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.070> buy<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> baseplate<00:01:02.550> that's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
baseplate if you buy a baseplate that's

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.950 
baseplate if you buy a baseplate that's
one<00:01:03.690> piece<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:05.070> technically<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
one piece so technically it's like the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.109 
one piece so technically it's like the
old<00:01:07.110> green<00:01:07.350> base<00:01:07.560> plate<00:01:07.830> was<00:01:08.070> set<00:01:08.340> six<00:01:08.640> two<00:01:08.850> six

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
old green base plate was set six two six

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.870 
old green base plate was set six two six
one<00:01:09.510> piece<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.979> know<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.549> really<00:01:11.760> gonna

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
one piece but I know I'm really gonna

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.090 
one piece but I know I'm really gonna
count<00:01:12.119> something<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.200> order<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.680> be

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
count something like that in order to be

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.499 
count something like that in order to be
a<00:01:14.130> set<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> think<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.729> got<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.939> have<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> minimum

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
a set I think you got to have a minimum

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.990 
a set I think you got to have a minimum
of<00:01:15.630> two<00:01:15.689> pieces<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.580> got<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> be<00:01:17.850> able<00:01:17.909> to

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
of two pieces and you got to be able to

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.679 
of two pieces and you got to be able to
build<00:01:18.210> something<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:20.220> think<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:21.030> might

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
build something and so I think for might

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.230 
build something and so I think for might
be<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:22.170> smallest<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:23.159> may<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.670> wrong<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.119> may

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
be the smallest I may be wrong there may

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.359 
be the smallest I may be wrong there may
be<00:01:24.270> something<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.080> three<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.740> know<00:01:26.280> I've

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
be something that is three I know I've

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.429 
be something that is three I know I've
had<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.549> lot<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.790> DUPLO<00:01:27.240> sets<00:01:27.270> like<00:01:27.930> this<00:01:28.200> one

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
had a lot of DUPLO sets like this one

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.010 
had a lot of DUPLO sets like this one
set<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.340> six<00:01:29.640> eight<00:01:29.790> five<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.479> Vette<00:01:30.689> that

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
set for six eight five the Vette that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.810 
set for six eight five the Vette that
were<00:01:31.170> only<00:01:31.439> four<00:01:32.369> pieces

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
were only four pieces

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.899 
were only four pieces
my<00:01:33.270> first<00:01:33.509> DUPLO<00:01:33.869> set<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.140> ever<00:01:34.470> got<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:35.670> was

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
my first DUPLO set I ever got which was

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.940 
my first DUPLO set I ever got which was
in<00:01:36.119> one<00:01:36.360> of<00:01:36.390> my<00:01:36.509> videos<00:01:36.810> with<00:01:37.259> all<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> sits<00:01:37.770> I

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
in one of my videos with all the sits I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.069 
in one of my videos with all the sits I
had<00:01:38.130> when<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.340> was<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.549> kid<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:39.450> had<00:01:39.600> four<00:01:39.840> pieces

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
had when I was a kid it had four pieces

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.850 
had when I was a kid it had four pieces
racer<00:01:40.890> set<00:01:41.189> 85<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> we're<00:01:43.380> going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.560> open<00:01:43.740> this

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
racer set 85 so we're going to open this

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.679 
racer set 85 so we're going to open this
box

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
box

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:53.310 
box
lost<00:01:45.689> my<00:01:45.869> cutters<00:01:46.200> again

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:03.399 

I<00:01:54.320> wonder<00:01:54.799> what's<00:01:54.979> in<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:55.250> box<00:01:59.320> a<00:02:01.540> 2x3<00:02:02.540> DUPLO

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
I wonder what's in this box a 2x3 DUPLO

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.010 
I wonder what's in this box a 2x3 DUPLO
brick<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:04.159> that's<00:02:04.310> pretty<00:02:04.520> cool<00:02:04.729> actually

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
brick so that's pretty cool actually

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.699 
brick so that's pretty cool actually
because<00:02:06.580> 2x3<00:02:07.580> DUPLO<00:02:07.939> keeps<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.660> be<00:02:08.780> rare<00:02:09.050> but

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
because 2x3 DUPLO keeps to be rare but

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.780 
because 2x3 DUPLO keeps to be rare but
now<00:02:09.860> it's<00:02:10.099> not<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:10.550> rare<00:02:10.580> so<00:02:12.519> you<00:02:13.519> get<00:02:13.670> the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
now it's not so rare so you get the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.830 
now it's not so rare so you get the
rabbit<00:02:14.239> which<00:02:14.390> is<00:02:14.800> wrapped<00:02:15.800> in<00:02:16.010> plastic

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
rabbit which is wrapped in plastic

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.130 
rabbit which is wrapped in plastic
suffocating

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
suffocating

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.290 
suffocating
this<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:19.010> supposed<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.310> be<00:02:19.459> the<00:02:19.580> table<00:02:20.000> that

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
this is supposed to be the table that

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.170 
this is supposed to be the table that
the<00:02:20.450> vets<00:02:20.630> working<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.950> there<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:22.610> go

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
the vets working in and there you go
