00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
just want to block we learned how to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.690 
just want to block we learned how to
block<00:02:45.270> now<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:45.900> want<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.470> hit<00:02:46.860> at<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.190> same<00:02:47.280> time

this<00:03:03.210> big<00:03:03.420> chance<00:03:03.690> is<00:03:03.810> coming<00:03:03.870> up<00:03:04.170> because<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
this big chance is coming up because the

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.500 
this big chance is coming up because the
attack<00:03:04.770> is<00:03:04.920> high<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.850> could<00:03:06.060> come<00:03:06.210> up<00:03:06.240> here

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
attack is high so I could come up here

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.110 
attack is high so I could come up here
because<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.870> still<00:03:07.050> up<00:03:07.200> if<00:03:07.440> it's<00:03:07.710> down<00:03:07.940> if<00:03:08.940> it's

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
because it still up if it's down if it's

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.550 
because it still up if it's down if it's
down<00:03:09.300> then<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.020> is<00:03:10.170> not<00:03:10.290> going<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.440> be

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
down then this is not going to be

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.530 
down then this is not going to be
effective<00:03:10.980> if<00:03:11.070> it's<00:03:11.160> down<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.730> need<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.240> be<00:03:12.360> here
