00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
to remove the Taylor's expression system

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.800 
to remove the Taylor's expression system
and<00:00:15.949> this<00:00:16.490> is<00:00:16.640> something<00:00:16.849> you<00:00:17.089> must<00:00:17.240> do<00:00:17.509> in

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
and this is something you must do in

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.050 
and this is something you must do in
order<00:00:18.080> to<00:00:18.140> install<00:00:18.500> a<00:00:18.560> new<00:00:18.830> pickup<00:00:19.220> on<00:00:19.429> your

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
order to install a new pickup on your

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.519 
order to install a new pickup on your
acoustic<00:00:20.269> guitar<00:00:20.660> so<00:00:20.839> let's<00:00:21.019> go<00:00:21.199> ahead<00:00:21.320> and

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:21.529 
acoustic guitar so let's go ahead and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.320 
acoustic guitar so let's go ahead and
jump<00:00:21.679> right<00:00:21.769> in<00:00:22.009> okay<00:00:22.279> so<00:00:22.460> the<00:00:22.699> first<00:00:22.849> step<00:00:23.150> is

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
jump right in okay so the first step is

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.790 
jump right in okay so the first step is
we're<00:00:23.869> going<00:00:24.019> to<00:00:24.080> have<00:00:24.199> to<00:00:24.349> remove<00:00:24.619> the

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
we're going to have to remove the

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.560 
we're going to have to remove the
strings<00:00:25.160> in<00:00:25.429> order<00:00:25.550> to<00:00:25.789> be<00:00:25.939> able<00:00:26.150> to<00:00:26.240> get<00:00:26.390> it<00:00:26.480> to

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
strings in order to be able to get it to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.230 
strings in order to be able to get it to
the<00:00:26.689> sound<00:00:26.929> hole<00:00:27.220> so<00:00:28.220> a<00:00:28.279> good<00:00:28.880> way<00:00:28.999> to<00:00:29.060> do<00:00:29.210> this

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
the sound hole so a good way to do this

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.359 
the sound hole so a good way to do this
is<00:00:29.539> to<00:00:29.689> loosen<00:00:30.050> them<00:00:30.169> and<00:00:30.409> actually<00:00:30.890> put<00:00:31.339> a

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
is to loosen them and actually put a

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.090 
is to loosen them and actually put a
cable<00:00:32.079> right<00:00:33.079> here<00:00:33.350> so<00:00:33.500> that<00:00:33.530> they<00:00:33.739> don't<00:00:33.860> fall

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
cable right here so that they don't fall

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.799 
cable right here so that they don't fall
all<00:00:34.520> over<00:00:34.579> the<00:00:35.000> place<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:35.329> then<00:00:35.449> you<00:00:35.570> want<00:00:35.780> to

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:35.809 
all over the place and then you want to

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:38.290 
all over the place and then you want to
make<00:00:35.930> sure<00:00:36.079> the<00:00:36.289> end<00:00:36.469> pins<00:00:36.829> are<00:00:37.039> out<00:00:37.070> too<00:00:37.670> as

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
make sure the end pins are out too as

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.910 
make sure the end pins are out too as
well<00:00:39.309> so<00:00:40.309> now<00:00:40.489> up<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.180> expression<00:00:41.719> system<00:00:42.140> has

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
well so now up the expression system has

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.799 
well so now up the expression system has
a<00:00:42.949> battery<00:00:43.520> in<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.879> back<00:00:44.199> right<00:00:46.719> here's<00:00:47.719> the

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
a battery in the back right here's the

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:53.650 
a battery in the back right here's the
battery<00:00:49.000> it's<00:00:50.000> a<00:00:50.059> 9-volt<00:00:50.480> battery<00:00:50.859> and<00:00:52.660> it

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
battery it's a 9-volt battery and it

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.529 
battery it's a 9-volt battery and it
actually<00:00:53.840> has<00:00:54.410> a<00:00:54.920> couple<00:00:55.519> of<00:00:55.789> body<00:00:56.059> sensors

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
actually has a couple of body sensors

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.529 
actually has a couple of body sensors
there's<00:00:57.199> one<00:00:57.379> right<00:00:57.620> around<00:00:57.769> here<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.539> it

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
there's one right around here and it

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.299 
there's one right around here and it
comes<00:00:59.719> this<00:01:00.170> way<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:00.679> then<00:01:00.829> there's<00:01:01.070> another

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
comes this way and then there's another

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.200 
comes this way and then there's another
one<00:01:01.519> here<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.320> then<00:01:03.320> it<00:01:03.710> goes<00:01:04.129> up<00:01:04.370> right<00:01:05.000> here

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
one here and then it goes up right here

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.630 
one here and then it goes up right here
into<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.720> preamp<00:01:06.440> where<00:01:07.190> you<00:01:07.280> have<00:01:07.490> your

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
into the preamp where you have your

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.340 
into the preamp where you have your
volume<00:01:08.120> and<00:01:08.300> tone<00:01:08.540> controls<00:01:10.900> let<00:01:11.900> me<00:01:11.990> see<00:01:12.170> if<00:01:12.260> I

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
volume and tone controls let me see if I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.130 
volume and tone controls let me see if I
show<00:01:12.770> that<00:01:12.980> to<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:13.250> here<00:01:13.700> we<00:01:13.790> go<00:01:13.940> so<00:01:14.660> here's

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
show that to you here we go so here's

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.070 
show that to you here we go so here's
your<00:01:15.670> volume<00:01:16.670> controls<00:01:17.120> and<00:01:17.360> tone<00:01:17.630> controls

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
your volume controls and tone controls

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.080 
your volume controls and tone controls
and<00:01:18.320> then<00:01:18.920> there's<00:01:19.100> another<00:01:19.250> body<00:01:19.640> sensor

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
and then there's another body sensor

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.140 
and then there's another body sensor
right<00:01:20.240> under<00:01:20.540> the<00:01:20.660> fret<00:01:20.870> board<00:01:20.900> and<00:01:22.150> they're

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
right under the fret board and they're

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.330 
right under the fret board and they're
all<00:01:23.300> connected<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:24.050> there's<00:01:24.920> actually<00:01:25.310> a

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
all connected and there's actually a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.070 
all connected and there's actually a
ground<00:01:25.670> right<00:01:26.030> under<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.420> saddle<00:01:26.660> that<00:01:26.930> is

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
ground right under the saddle that is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.080 
ground right under the saddle that is
connected<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.740> end<00:01:27.920> pin<00:01:28.160> and<00:01:28.370> a<00:01:28.880> dot

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
connected to the end pin and a dot

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.870 
connected to the end pin and a dot
prevents<00:01:29.660> any<00:01:30.280> electricity<00:01:31.280> shocks<00:01:31.730> from

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
prevents any electricity shocks from

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.640 
prevents any electricity shocks from
microphones<00:01:32.480> or<00:01:32.690> cables<00:01:33.050> or<00:01:33.200> such

microphones or cables or such

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.260 
microphones or cables or such
ok<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:34.160> first<00:01:34.430> we're<00:01:34.640> going<00:01:34.730> to<00:01:34.820> remove<00:01:35.090> the

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
ok so first we're going to remove the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.860 
ok so first we're going to remove the
nth<00:01:35.420> piece<00:01:37.030> we're<00:01:38.030> going<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:38.240> take<00:01:38.450> this<00:01:38.600> part

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
nth piece we're going to take this part

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.750 
nth piece we're going to take this part
off<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.320> you're<00:01:39.950> going<00:01:40.040> to<00:01:40.130> see<00:01:40.250> there<00:01:40.430> is<00:01:40.520> two

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:40.760 
off and you're going to see there is two

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.180 
off and you're going to see there is two
screws<00:01:41.060> behind<00:01:41.900> here<00:01:42.620> that<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:42.950> need<00:01:43.130> to

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
screws behind here that we need to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.190 
screws behind here that we need to
loosen<00:01:43.400> so<00:01:44.210> that<00:01:44.390> you<00:01:44.480> can<00:01:44.630> remove<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:45.080> whole

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
loosen so that you can remove the whole

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.760 
loosen so that you can remove the whole
bottom<00:01:45.650> unit<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:47.450> let's<00:01:47.690> go<00:01:48.260> ahead<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.620> take

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
bottom unit so let's go ahead and take

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.360 
bottom unit so let's go ahead and take
out<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.070> battery<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:51.860> see<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.160> two

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370 
out the battery and you see the two

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.620 
out the battery and you see the two
screws<00:01:52.790> you're<00:01:53.000> going<00:01:53.150> to<00:01:53.210> need<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.390> Phillips

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
screws you're going to need a Phillips

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.340 
screws you're going to need a Phillips
screw<00:01:54.020> driver<00:01:54.050> here<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.550> let's<00:01:55.730> go<00:01:55.880> ahead<00:01:55.970> and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
screw driver here so let's go ahead and

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:09.389 
screw driver here so let's go ahead and
do<00:01:57.350> those<00:01:57.560> real<00:01:57.890> quick

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.259 

now<00:02:10.620> this<00:02:11.620> might<00:02:12.220> be<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.430> little<00:02:12.640> hard<00:02:12.940> to<00:02:13.090> take

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
now this might be a little hard to take

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.509 
now this might be a little hard to take
off<00:02:13.450> the<00:02:13.659> first<00:02:13.930> time<00:02:14.200> but<00:02:14.769> you<00:02:14.920> just<00:02:15.220> actually

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
off the first time but you just actually

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.830 
off the first time but you just actually
pull<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.090> out<00:02:16.420> and<00:02:18.360> you're<00:02:19.360> going<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.599> have<00:02:19.810> a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
pull that out and you're going to have a

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.710 
pull that out and you're going to have a
couple<00:02:20.230> of<00:02:20.470> cables<00:02:21.099> that<00:02:21.340> are<00:02:21.459> attached<00:02:22.390> from

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
couple of cables that are attached from

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.410 
couple of cables that are attached from
the<00:02:22.959> end<00:02:23.110> pin<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:25.510> the<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.489> preamp<00:02:28.000> into

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
the end pin to the to the preamp into

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.110 
the end pin to the to the preamp into
the<00:02:28.540> body<00:02:28.750> sensors<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.950> you're<00:02:30.819> going<00:02:31.000> to<00:02:31.060> be

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
the body sensors so you're going to be

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.520 
the body sensors so you're going to be
able<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.390> see<00:02:31.599> those<00:02:31.780> right<00:02:32.019> there<00:02:32.049> that

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
able to see those right there that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.479 
able to see those right there that
little<00:02:32.709> black<00:02:32.980> one<00:02:34.920> then<00:02:35.920> when<00:02:36.069> we<00:02:36.190> need<00:02:36.340> on

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
little black one then when we need on

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.080 
little black one then when we need on
plug<00:02:36.790> and<00:02:37.379> then<00:02:38.430> so<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:39.459> when<00:02:39.760> you're<00:02:39.909> just

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
plug and then so that when you're just

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.940 
plug and then so that when you're just
going<00:02:40.269> to<00:02:40.329> pull<00:02:40.690> you're<00:02:41.560> going<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.739> push<00:02:41.920> the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
going to pull you're going to push the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.610 
going to pull you're going to push the
middle<00:02:42.370> part<00:02:42.579> in<00:02:42.790> and<00:02:43.200> then<00:02:44.200> it's<00:02:44.440> going<00:02:44.560> to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
middle part in and then it's going to

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.289 
middle part in and then it's going to
come<00:02:44.769> out<00:02:44.980> it's<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.400> little<00:02:45.670> difficult<00:02:45.879> while

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
come out it's a little difficult while

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.500 
come out it's a little difficult while
trying<00:02:46.629> to<00:02:46.720> point<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:47.049> camera<00:02:47.470> but<00:02:48.359> there<00:02:49.359> we

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
trying to point the camera but there we

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.690 
trying to point the camera but there we
go<00:02:50.250> all<00:02:51.250> right

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
go all right

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.670 
go all right
and<00:02:51.790> now<00:02:52.629> you're<00:02:52.840> going<00:02:52.989> to<00:02:53.049> see<00:02:53.260> this<00:02:53.470> other

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
and now you're going to see this other

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.949 
and now you're going to see this other
one<00:02:53.920> on<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.129> left<00:02:54.569> where<00:02:55.569> you're<00:02:55.720> going<00:02:55.900> to

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
one on the left where you're going to

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.610 
one on the left where you're going to
have<00:02:56.079> to<00:02:56.230> use<00:02:56.409> a<00:02:56.440> real<00:02:56.859> thin<00:02:57.269> small<00:02:58.620> flat-head

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
have to use a real thin small flat-head

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.440 
have to use a real thin small flat-head
screwdriver<00:03:00.510> and<00:03:02.129> then<00:03:03.129> will<00:03:04.000> come<00:03:04.030> right<00:03:04.420> off

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
screwdriver and then will come right off

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:10.220 
screwdriver and then will come right off
and<00:03:04.900> now<00:03:05.709> this<00:03:06.159> is<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:07.359> end<00:03:07.510> part<00:03:07.900> coming<00:03:08.170> off

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
and now this is the end part coming off

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.750 
and now this is the end part coming off
cool<00:03:11.230> so<00:03:11.680> now<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:11.859> can<00:03:12.099> actually<00:03:12.220> see<00:03:12.609> inside

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760 
cool so now you can actually see inside

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.229 
cool so now you can actually see inside
the<00:03:13.060> guitar<00:03:13.389> and<00:03:13.739> see<00:03:14.910> where<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.030> body

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
the guitar and see where the body

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.470 
the guitar and see where the body
sensors<00:03:16.720> are<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.139> where<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.829> preamp<00:03:18.190> is<00:03:18.480> now

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
sensors are and where the preamp is now

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.330 
sensors are and where the preamp is now
this<00:03:19.690> is<00:03:19.840> probably<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:20.440> hardest<00:03:20.859> part<00:03:20.919> of

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
this is probably the hardest part of

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.819 
this is probably the hardest part of
this<00:03:21.519> whole<00:03:21.790> thing<00:03:22.090> I've<00:03:22.840> done<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.380> before<00:03:23.470> so

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
this whole thing I've done it before so

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.830 
this whole thing I've done it before so
they're<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.040> little<00:03:24.250> loose<00:03:24.489> but<00:03:25.239> we're<00:03:25.720> going

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
they're a little loose but we're going

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.890 
they're a little loose but we're going
to<00:03:25.930> take<00:03:26.139> off<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.730> knobs<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.450> you're<00:03:28.750> going

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
to take off the knobs and you're going

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.690 
to take off the knobs and you're going
to<00:03:28.959> see<00:03:29.169> these<00:03:31.859> things<00:03:32.859> that<00:03:33.040> are<00:03:33.160> holding<00:03:33.430> the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
to see these things that are holding the

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.289 
to see these things that are holding the
preamp<00:03:34.180> against<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.109> guitar<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:36.299> we're

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
preamp against the guitar and we're

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.539 
preamp against the guitar and we're
actually<00:03:37.510> going<00:03:37.870> to<00:03:37.930> have<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.310> unscrew<00:03:39.310> those

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
actually going to have to unscrew those

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.360 
actually going to have to unscrew those
but<00:03:40.150> they're<00:03:40.329> in<00:03:40.569> very<00:03:40.959> tight<00:03:41.290> at<00:03:41.530> first<00:03:41.590> as

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
but they're in very tight at first as

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.250 
but they're in very tight at first as
you<00:03:42.910> can<00:03:43.060> see<00:03:43.239> mine<00:03:43.510> are<00:03:43.660> already<00:03:43.989> a<00:03:44.019> little

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
you can see mine are already a little

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.280 
you can see mine are already a little
bit<00:03:44.819> peeled<00:03:45.819> out<00:03:46.060> because<00:03:46.419> I've<00:03:46.599> taken<00:03:47.079> them

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
bit peeled out because I've taken them

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.559 
bit peeled out because I've taken them
off<00:03:47.470> before<00:03:47.829> so<00:03:48.730> we're<00:03:48.910> just<00:03:48.940> going<00:03:49.150> to<00:03:49.209> screw

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
off before so we're just going to screw

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.539 
off before so we're just going to screw
them<00:03:49.750> out<00:03:49.930> however<00:03:50.290> I've<00:03:50.949> already<00:03:51.340> previously

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
them out however I've already previously

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.339 
them out however I've already previously
loosened<00:03:51.970> them<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.510> they<00:03:52.750> might<00:03:52.930> be<00:03:53.109> really

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
loosened them and they might be really

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.349 
loosened them and they might be really
hard<00:03:53.620> at<00:03:53.799> the<00:03:53.889> beginning<00:03:54.310> if<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.970> haven't

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
hard at the beginning if you haven't

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.020 
hard at the beginning if you haven't
already<00:03:55.959> messed<00:03:56.440> with<00:03:56.530> them<00:03:56.739> so<00:03:57.370> just<00:03:57.609> unscrew

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
already messed with them so just unscrew

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.050 
already messed with them so just unscrew
them<00:03:58.750> it'll<00:03:59.260> take<00:03:59.410> some<00:03:59.590> time

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
them it'll take some time

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.860 
them it'll take some time
um<00:04:01.739> so<00:04:02.739> once<00:04:02.949> I<00:04:03.129> unscrew<00:04:03.549> the<00:04:03.699> third<00:04:03.910> one<00:04:04.150> the

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
um so once I unscrew the third one the

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.289 
um so once I unscrew the third one the
preamp<00:04:05.260> is<00:04:05.410> just<00:04:05.590> going<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.799> come<00:04:05.949> off<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:07.090> let

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
preamp is just going to come off so let

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:24.510 
preamp is just going to come off so let
me<00:04:07.359> show<00:04:07.569> you<00:04:07.599> what<00:04:07.870> that<00:04:08.019> looks<00:04:08.230> like

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.520 

all<00:04:25.090> right<00:04:27.569> so<00:04:28.569> this<00:04:28.720> is<00:04:28.780> what<00:04:29.110> these<00:04:29.289> look

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
all right so this is what these look

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.279 
all right so this is what these look
like

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:38.100 

okay<00:04:35.289> now<00:04:36.210> we're<00:04:37.210> looking<00:04:37.360> at<00:04:37.569> the<00:04:37.690> sound<00:04:37.900> hold

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
okay now we're looking at the sound hold

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.920 
okay now we're looking at the sound hold
the<00:04:38.199> preamp<00:04:38.560> just<00:04:38.770> comes<00:04:38.949> right<00:04:39.250> off<00:04:39.280> and

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
the preamp just comes right off and

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.879 
the preamp just comes right off and
you're<00:04:40.930> going<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.110> notice<00:04:41.289> that<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.740> has<00:04:41.770> a

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:41.889 
you're going to notice that it has a

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:43.879 
you're going to notice that it has a
bunch<00:04:42.250> of<00:04:42.370> cables<00:04:42.699> like<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.270> ones<00:04:43.449> that<00:04:43.659> we're

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
bunch of cables like the ones that we're

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.210 
bunch of cables like the ones that we're
attached<00:04:44.889> to<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.520> end<00:04:45.789> piece<00:04:46.770> where<00:04:47.770> you<00:04:47.919> plug

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
attached to the end piece where you plug

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.950 
attached to the end piece where you plug
in<00:04:48.280> the<00:04:48.460> jack<00:04:48.729> so<00:04:49.449> we're<00:04:49.629> just<00:04:49.659> going<00:04:49.900> to

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
in the jack so we're just going to

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.909 
in the jack so we're just going to
loosen<00:04:50.319> these<00:04:53.909> and<00:04:55.560> these<00:04:56.560> are<00:04:56.620> also

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
loosen these and these are also

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.649 
loosen these and these are also
connected<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.729> body<00:04:57.940> sensors<00:04:58.479> that<00:04:58.599> are

00:04:58.649 --> 00:04:58.659 
connected to the body sensors that are

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.290 
connected to the body sensors that are
glued<00:04:59.020> onto<00:04:59.199> the<00:04:59.440> guitar<00:05:00.090> so<00:05:01.090> we're<00:05:01.270> just

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
glued onto the guitar so we're just

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.159 
glued onto the guitar so we're just
going<00:05:01.569> to<00:05:01.599> press<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.020> bottom<00:05:02.409> and<00:05:03.900> they<00:05:04.900> come

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
going to press the bottom and they come

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:16.190 
going to press the bottom and they come
right<00:05:05.349> off

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:28.689 

here<00:05:16.920> we<00:05:17.040> go

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.770 

okay<00:05:29.699> so<00:05:29.759> now<00:05:30.000> you're<00:05:30.120> going<00:05:30.210> to<00:05:30.300> have<00:05:30.419> a<00:05:30.479> few

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
okay so now you're going to have a few

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.439 
okay so now you're going to have a few
cables<00:05:31.169> loose<00:05:31.919> inside<00:05:32.340> because<00:05:33.210> of<00:05:33.330> the

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:33.449 
cables loose inside because of the

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.890 
cables loose inside because of the
preamp<00:05:33.949> and<00:05:35.449> you're<00:05:36.449> going<00:05:36.599> to<00:05:36.659> have<00:05:36.750> to

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
preamp and you're going to have to

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.480 
preamp and you're going to have to
loosen<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.349> body<00:05:37.560> sensors<00:05:38.039> which<00:05:38.340> are

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
loosen the body sensors which are

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.070 
loosen the body sensors which are
actually<00:05:38.819> glued<00:05:39.060> onto<00:05:39.270> the<00:05:39.539> body<00:05:39.750> of<00:05:39.960> the

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
actually glued onto the body of the

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.779 
actually glued onto the body of the
guitar<00:05:40.440> from<00:05:40.650> the<00:05:40.710> inside<00:05:41.099> here's<00:05:41.340> one<00:05:41.610> that

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
guitar from the inside here's one that

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:44.029 
guitar from the inside here's one that
came<00:05:42.060> loose<00:05:42.270> and<00:05:42.449> that's<00:05:43.319> actually<00:05:43.560> attached

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
came loose and that's actually attached

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.460 
came loose and that's actually attached
to<00:05:44.220> this<00:05:44.430> body<00:05:44.819> sensor<00:05:45.270> which<00:05:45.870> is<00:05:46.050> under<00:05:46.319> the

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
to this body sensor which is under the

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.110 
to this body sensor which is under the
fretboard<00:05:46.860> but<00:05:47.250> you're<00:05:47.729> going<00:05:47.819> to<00:05:47.879> have<00:05:48.000> to

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
fretboard but you're going to have to

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.540 
fretboard but you're going to have to
either<00:05:48.210> cut<00:05:48.569> it<00:05:48.720> or<00:05:48.889> you<00:05:49.889> got<00:05:50.009> to<00:05:50.069> remove<00:05:50.400> the

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
either cut it or you got to remove the

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.189 
either cut it or you got to remove the
neck<00:05:50.759> in<00:05:51.000> order<00:05:51.180> to<00:05:51.360> remove<00:05:51.659> that<00:05:51.840> one<00:05:51.900> I

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
neck in order to remove that one I

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:54.710 
neck in order to remove that one I
actually<00:05:52.349> just<00:05:52.740> left<00:05:53.009> mine<00:05:53.280> on<00:05:53.720> afterwards

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720 
actually just left mine on afterwards

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.240 
actually just left mine on afterwards
and<00:05:54.960> this<00:05:55.289> is<00:05:55.500> what<00:05:55.680> it<00:05:55.770> looks<00:05:55.919> like<00:05:56.009> when<00:05:56.220> I

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250 
and this is what it looks like when I

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:58.999 
and this is what it looks like when I
remove<00:05:56.639> all<00:05:56.849> of<00:05:57.000> them<00:05:57.259> one<00:05:58.259> of<00:05:58.289> them<00:05:58.500> was<00:05:58.650> glued

00:05:58.999 --> 00:05:59.009 
remove all of them one of them was glued

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.490 
remove all of them one of them was glued
right<00:05:59.490> under<00:05:59.729> here<00:06:00.090> and<00:06:00.240> one<00:06:01.169> of<00:06:01.259> them<00:06:01.349> was

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
right under here and one of them was

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.760 
right under here and one of them was
glued<00:06:01.740> right<00:06:01.919> under<00:06:02.099> here<00:06:02.370> and<00:06:02.900> this<00:06:03.900> is<00:06:04.139> this

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
glued right under here and this is this

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.370 
glued right under here and this is this
is<00:06:04.979> basically<00:06:05.370> glued<00:06:06.000> on<00:06:06.180> there<00:06:06.449> you<00:06:07.050> can<00:06:07.199> use

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
is basically glued on there you can use

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.559 
is basically glued on there you can use
like<00:06:07.560> a<00:06:07.590> hot<00:06:07.860> knife<00:06:08.130> to<00:06:08.699> remove<00:06:08.789> the<00:06:09.000> glue<00:06:09.330> or

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
like a hot knife to remove the glue or

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:12.649 
like a hot knife to remove the glue or
you<00:06:10.560> can<00:06:10.740> just<00:06:10.949> shake<00:06:11.759> them<00:06:11.970> off<00:06:12.120> that's<00:06:12.509> what

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
you can just shake them off that's what

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:14.480 
you can just shake them off that's what
I<00:06:12.690> did<00:06:12.900> I<00:06:12.930> just<00:06:13.020> move<00:06:13.409> them<00:06:13.620> around<00:06:13.740> and<00:06:14.069> once

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 
I did I just move them around and once

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.909 
I did I just move them around and once
they're<00:06:14.639> loose<00:06:14.819> just<00:06:15.030> pull<00:06:15.270> them<00:06:15.419> out<00:06:15.509> so<00:06:15.919> this

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
they're loose just pull them out so this

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:18.950 
they're loose just pull them out so this
is<00:06:17.069> what<00:06:17.250> it<00:06:17.340> looks<00:06:17.520> like<00:06:17.610> here's<00:06:18.389> the<00:06:18.539> preamp

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
is what it looks like here's the preamp

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.600 
is what it looks like here's the preamp
and<00:06:19.110> here<00:06:19.409> are<00:06:19.469> the<00:06:19.560> cables<00:06:19.830> that<00:06:20.490> were

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
and here are the cables that were

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.149 
and here are the cables that were
attached<00:06:20.940> to<00:06:20.969> the<00:06:21.270> sensors<00:06:21.719> now<00:06:22.590> you're<00:06:23.039> going

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:23.159 
attached to the sensors now you're going

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:24.619 
attached to the sensors now you're going
to<00:06:23.219> have<00:06:23.310> some<00:06:23.520> loose<00:06:23.699> cables<00:06:24.120> inside<00:06:24.419> you're

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
to have some loose cables inside you're

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.029 
to have some loose cables inside you're
going<00:06:24.750> to<00:06:24.810> have<00:06:24.960> the<00:06:25.080> sensor<00:06:25.469> that's<00:06:25.680> attached

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
going to have the sensor that's attached

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.670 
going to have the sensor that's attached
under<00:06:26.610> the<00:06:26.849> fret<00:06:27.659> board<00:06:27.690> for<00:06:28.169> that<00:06:28.289> you<00:06:28.440> got<00:06:28.590> to

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
under the fret board for that you got to

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.070 
under the fret board for that you got to
remove<00:06:28.919> the<00:06:29.159> fretboard<00:06:29.520> or<00:06:29.969> you<00:06:30.539> can<00:06:30.719> just<00:06:30.870> cut

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
remove the fretboard or you can just cut

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.909 
remove the fretboard or you can just cut
it<00:06:31.229> I<00:06:31.580> just<00:06:32.580> glue<00:06:33.389> them<00:06:33.569> back<00:06:33.780> on<00:06:34.229> to<00:06:34.469> the<00:06:34.620> back

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
it I just glue them back on to the back

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.980 
it I just glue them back on to the back
of<00:06:35.069> the<00:06:35.130> guitar<00:06:35.280> and<00:06:35.639> the<00:06:36.360> other<00:06:36.509> cable<00:06:36.870> you're

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
of the guitar and the other cable you're

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.020 
of the guitar and the other cable you're
going<00:06:37.110> to<00:06:37.169> have<00:06:37.289> loose<00:06:37.530> is<00:06:37.770> the<00:06:37.979> cable<00:06:38.849> that's

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
going to have loose is the cable that's

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.610 
going to have loose is the cable that's
attached<00:06:39.330> to<00:06:39.539> the<00:06:39.659> bottom<00:06:39.840> of<00:06:40.080> the<00:06:40.169> saddle

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
attached to the bottom of the saddle

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.070 
attached to the bottom of the saddle
which<00:06:40.860> it<00:06:41.370> doesn't<00:06:41.729> really<00:06:42.509> get<00:06:42.750> in<00:06:42.870> the<00:06:42.960> way

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
which it doesn't really get in the way

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.230 
which it doesn't really get in the way
of<00:06:43.110> anything<00:06:43.590> I<00:06:43.710> put<00:06:44.250> it<00:06:44.340> in<00:06:44.400> a<00:06:44.490> new<00:06:44.639> pickup<00:06:45.060> and

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 
of anything I put it in a new pickup and

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.439 
of anything I put it in a new pickup and
it's<00:06:45.690> so<00:06:45.870> cool<00:06:46.139> it<00:06:46.289> doesn't<00:06:46.469> affect<00:06:47.120> so<00:06:48.120> I<00:06:48.150> hope

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449 
it's so cool it doesn't affect so I hope

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:50.930
