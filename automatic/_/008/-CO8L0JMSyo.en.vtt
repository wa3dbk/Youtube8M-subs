00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.520
 your two candidates 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.569
 rafa which is the most difficult group 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.569
 after the draw 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.120
 the most difficult group the one in germany the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.670
 group g germany portugal wins and usa and

 your two candidates there to advance 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.460
 german and portuguese jose ramon besides 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.869
 Portugal is the most difficult group but the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.789
 easier to index card 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.609
 for me the one from Uruguay with three cantons 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.609
 of the world uruguay with the most difficult 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.820
 uruguay italy uruguay 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:54.000
 for thinking was the group that played 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:57.030
 they are team beginners since 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.649
 five years equal but not to zero 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.390
 form the same players themselves 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.190
 players is a good football team 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.539
 fact set 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.539
 and the past 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.990
 Uruguay ran out of luck 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.840
 four years in the duel against japan in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.810
 the particular way to beat him to win 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 the group uruguay that the group of 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.350
 Argentina is to say that Argentina 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.350
 they gave away 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.119
 inside is the loosest 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.000
 - I'm complicated but for me the most 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:38.850
 difficult is now 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.770
 let's understand why difficult to do in that 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.229
 group is clear but of the other three 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.520
 it is not easy to decide for two spain 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.940
 have to leave as a favorite but 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.590
 between holland and chile 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.500
 chile because it is played in continent 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.950
 american is rafa yes but friendship 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.470
 when I think that Holland has a 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:01.960
 greater potential so that the pass that of 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.690
 germany germany portugal wins and usa 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.880
 been like favorites germany and portugal 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.970
 what the Uruguayan group I only see 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.280
 out Uruguayan by uruguay and at the coast 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.290
 rich because england has a team 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.010
 already done outside the islands but 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.880

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.480
 as we are going to say is that england 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.480
 Uruguay 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:56.220
