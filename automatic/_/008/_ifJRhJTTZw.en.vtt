00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.240
 do not 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.360
 prayer of a father 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.950
 give me oh sir a son that is what 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.369
 strong enough to know when 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.680
 is weak and courageous enough 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.060
 to face himself when 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.030
 feel good 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.000
 a son who is proud and inflexible 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.690
 in the honorable and humble defeat and 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.930
 magnanimous in victory 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.879
 a son who never bend his back 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.760
 when you must choose your chest a child who 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.300
 know how you are and know yourself 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.690
 same that is the cornerstone of 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.600
 all knowledge 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.159
 drive what I'm begging you not for the way 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.130
 comfortable and easy but by the rough road 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:10.759
 stung by difficulties and challenges 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:14.030
 there stops learning to hold firm 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.890
 in the storm and to feel compassion for 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.979
 those who fail 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:22.460
 to a child whose heart is not clear 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.979
 whose ideals are high that is mastered to 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.430
 himself and does not pretend to dominate the 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:32.090
 others a son who learns to laugh but 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:34.820
 that also knows how to cry a son that 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.540
 move towards the future but not 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.130
 never forget the past 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:44.770
 and after you've given him all this 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.230
 added I beg you enough 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.200
 sense of humor so that it can be 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:53.840
 always serious but do not take yourself 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:56.450
 too much to be 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.969
 Give him humility so he can remember 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.210
 always the simplicity of the true 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:06.200
 greatness the impartiality of the 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.210
 true wisdom the meekness of the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.050
 true strength 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:16.990
 then I, your father, would dare 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.990
 say I have not lived in vain
