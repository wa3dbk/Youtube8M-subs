00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.430
 Well, we practically have just 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.090
 come from turkey 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.080
 and once we have undone the suitcases 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.080
 this is all we have bought 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.820
 well let's go more or less saying what 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.640
 that has cost us so that for you 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.830
 make an idea if you plan to go to 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.830
 turkey or you are already there 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.829
 most of the things we have 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.690
 purchased in istanbul 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.390
 Y 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.620
 from what we have seen in istanbul 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.620
 You can get the best prices 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.600
 to see us the most purchases 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.700
 we have done them in the streets that are 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.790
 around the market we great bazaar of 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.670
 istanbul 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:17.600
 for example let's say prices 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.600
 the poles 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.070
 we have bought four and the 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.070
 four cost us 80 Turkish lira 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.130
 the more you buy more 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.509
 Cheap bolts can go 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.100
 then we follow the g6 the six go around 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.619
 30 leagues 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.859
 26 that we have taken is what we 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.859
 it has cost us 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.310
 and later 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.700
 the handkerchiefs 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.909
 the big handkerchiefs the good ones we go to 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.829
 tell 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.829
 these are around the 20 leagues 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.140
 and these others that are smaller and 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:08.380
 of worse quality more or less between 3 and 5 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.380
 pounds 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.990
 and the underpants that can not miss 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:20.760
 in the suitcase on a trip because these more 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:23.360
 or less is around 6 pounds each unit 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.980
 in the other six 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.350
 and it is the price that we have been able 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.569
 get 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.909
 and later 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.950
 the glasses the sunglasses sell them 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:37.819
 down the street there are a lot of stalls 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:42.189
 street vendors selling glasses 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.189
 and they are around 10 15 liras 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.710
 then 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.970
 sweatshirts 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:56.020
 this sweatshirt this cost us to haggle 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.290
 and in the end we got it for 50 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.290
 pounds 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.860
 and this sweat suit cost us more or 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.390
 minus 30 pounds 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.390
 then to the world sneakers 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.190
 in the shoes the truth that they are 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.500
 very successful 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.580
 and you see that we have an assortment here 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.730
 and the shoes are around between 35 and 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:28.650
 the 50 pounds already depends on 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.980
 from the buyer's seller 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.269
 and many things 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.269
 and these boots 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.970
 we get these boots for 45 lire 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.280
 the 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:53.400
 basically almost everything that I have 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:55.890
 taught we buy it in istanbul - 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.459
 you're here, we buy them in 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.950
 Italian and they were somewhat more expensive than 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:05.760
 being the same shoe 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.569
 put about 8 Turkish liras more and 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.569
 almost 3 safe 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.560
 then 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.470
 backpack 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.290
 It is also bought in Dalian 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.870
 40 liras 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:24.449
 and this little bag this one is from 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.889
 I like the habit of the big bazaar and this 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.889
 they were 20 20 pounds 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.669
 then we will continue 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.169
 with the cookbook cookbook 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.169
 we buy it the capadocia 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.889
 and they were 23 liras 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.870
 and the spices 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.930
 these three bags of spices that you are 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.660
 seeing more an apple tea bag 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.820
 maybe I already do 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.890
 they were 50 liras 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.890
 It's something new, but I think it's expensive 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.110
 and then we continue with the ceramic 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:10.150
 habanos in capadocia this dish 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:12.710
 made by hand and others with 150 more pounds 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.470
 or less about fifty euros 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:18.650
 and that is somewhat cheaper because you have 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:20.660
 this ashtray for ten miles 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.320
 and this one 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:27.430
 this koran this was a gift in the 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:27.430
 Mosque fit in peace 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:34.610
 then this rouge we bought it in 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.910
 Dalian and it cost us 20 liras 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.680
 more or less not six examples 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.680
 and then the gifts for 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.160
 for example this mug 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.030
 it's so it cost us expensive these were 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:55.350
 25 pounds but good that cool 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.430
 then the keyrings go out to three leagues and 

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.770
 the magnets also 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.969
 the tree of luck eyes 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.999
 Ottoman this were 15 liras 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:09.120
 and then we have the ring that is 

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:10.980
 bathed in silver 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.700
 that were 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:16.680
 10 10 liras and the earrings that also 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:20.100
 are bathed in silver this was 15 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:24.060
 leagues and this box is the one we took the 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.830
 we buy on the beach of study in the 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:29.880
 turtle recovery center 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:32.610
 caretta caretta and this cost 15 leagues 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.169
 us normally when we go to a 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:39.020
 country where you can buy cheap 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:41.169
 so we take an empty suitcase and the 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.480
 we fill there 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:46.580
 good countries to buy turkey 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.889
 China 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.509
 vietnam even if they sell once 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:52.840
 We were there it was not as good as 

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.840
 we believed 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:07:00.500
 thailand swimsuits paradise 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:02.810
 so you know if you plan to go to 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.470
 any of these destinations 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:08.300
 and take advantage and fill the closet that 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.510
 you're almost going to make an investment in that 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.510
 trip 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:18.070
 the change we have had at one euro more 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.070
 or less three Turkish liras
