00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
playing competitive hockey I think one

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.880 
playing competitive hockey I think one
worker<00:01:53.520> really<00:01:53.940> competitive<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:54.900> drives<00:01:55.590> us

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
worker really competitive it drives us

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.100 
worker really competitive it drives us
to<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.220> better<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.940> that's<00:01:57.270> why<00:01:57.510> we're<00:01:57.870> really

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
to do better and that's why we're really

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.560 
to do better and that's why we're really
intense<00:01:58.920> about<00:01:59.250> hockey<00:01:59.490> two<00:02:00.060> of<00:02:00.180> them<00:02:00.360> play

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
intense about hockey two of them play

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.510 
intense about hockey two of them play
goalie<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.380> so<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.800> know<00:02:01.920> there's<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:02.250> little

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
goalie and so I know there's a little

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.730 
goalie and so I know there's a little
sibling<00:02:03.000> rivalry<00:02:03.180> there<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.230> do<00:02:04.380> better<00:02:04.590> than

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740
