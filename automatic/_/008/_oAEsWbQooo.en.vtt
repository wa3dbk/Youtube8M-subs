Avengers whereby he was punching the the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.020 
Avengers whereby he was punching the the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
I guess the heavy bag that's what you

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.920 
I guess the heavy bag that's what you
want<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.240> call<00:01:06.360> them<00:01:06.450> not<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.630> sure<00:01:06.810> what

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
want to call them not really sure what

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.480 
want to call them not really sure what
the<00:01:07.020> correct<00:01:07.170> term<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:07.950> we're<00:01:08.400> going

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the correct term is here but we're going

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.090 
the correct term is here but we're going
to<00:01:08.549> time<00:01:08.850> these<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:10.229> intricacies<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:10.979> so

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
to time these little intricacies here so

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.200 
to time these little intricacies here so
the<00:01:11.189> first<00:01:11.369> thing<00:01:11.460> we're<00:01:11.549> going<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> time<00:01:11.909> is

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the first thing we're going to time is

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.390 
the first thing we're going to time is
from<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.960> position<00:01:13.439> whereby<00:01:13.619> he<00:01:13.890> has<00:01:14.040> his<00:01:14.189> fists

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
from a position whereby he has his fists

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.429 
from a position whereby he has his fists
cocked<00:01:14.670> back<00:01:14.880> how<00:01:15.570> long<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.900> takes<00:01:16.140> him<00:01:16.380> to

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
cocked back how long it takes him to

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.910 
cocked back how long it takes him to
make<00:01:17.070> contact<00:01:17.700> with<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.970> punching<00:01:18.450> bag<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:18.960> if

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
make contact with a punching bag so if

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.460 
make contact with a punching bag so if
you<00:01:20.040> guys<00:01:20.130> are<00:01:20.220> ready<00:01:20.460> let's<00:01:20.700> try<00:01:21.689> this<00:01:23.390> okay

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
you guys are ready let's try this okay

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.789 
you guys are ready let's try this okay
so<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.590> was<00:01:25.680> fast

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
so that was fast

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.490 
so that was fast
0.02<00:01:28.799> seconds<00:01:29.460> that's<00:01:29.790> absolutely<00:01:30.659> nuts<00:01:31.079> he

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
0.02 seconds that's absolutely nuts he

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.890 
0.02 seconds that's absolutely nuts he
punched<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.549> fraction<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.360> second<00:01:33.720> so

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
punched in a fraction of a second so

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.080 
punched in a fraction of a second so
going<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.770> our<00:01:34.920> Excel<00:01:35.159> spreadsheet<00:01:35.189> what<00:01:36.000> we

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
going to our Excel spreadsheet what we

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.840 
going to our Excel spreadsheet what we
can<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.360> here<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.750> we<00:01:36.780> can<00:01:37.079> punch<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.850> 0.02

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
can do here is we can punch in 0.02

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.149 
can do here is we can punch in 0.02
seconds<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:40.229> right<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.590> that<00:01:40.710> tells<00:01:40.920> us<00:01:41.100> is

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
seconds all right what that tells us is

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.819 
seconds all right what that tells us is
he<00:01:41.400> was<00:01:41.520> moving<00:01:41.759> at<00:01:42.170> 0.04<00:01:43.170> miles<00:01:43.380> per<00:01:43.619> hour

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
he was moving at 0.04 miles per hour

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.310 
he was moving at 0.04 miles per hour
what<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.549> did<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:44.850> we<00:01:44.970> took<00:01:45.149> this<00:01:45.329> 0.2<00:01:46.020> second

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
what we did is we took this 0.2 second

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.530 
what we did is we took this 0.2 second
calculation<00:01:46.920> or<00:01:47.070> 0.02<00:01:47.729> second<00:01:48.149> calculation

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
calculation or 0.02 second calculation

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.690 
calculation or 0.02 second calculation
and<00:01:48.960> we<00:01:49.259> punched<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.340> converted

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
and we punched it in and we converted

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.389 
and we punched it in and we converted
meters<00:01:51.149> per<00:01:51.360> second<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.110> miles<00:01:52.590> per<00:01:52.860> hour<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
meters per second to miles per hour and

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.580 
meters per second to miles per hour and
so<00:01:54.119> from<00:01:54.299> here<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.810> next<00:01:54.930> thing<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.170> we<00:01:55.350> do

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
so from here the next thing that we do

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.069 
so from here the next thing that we do
is<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.100> ask<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.490> question<00:01:56.909> when<00:01:57.540> he<00:01:57.630> punches

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
is we ask the question when he punches

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.649 
is we ask the question when he punches
the<00:01:58.259> bag<00:01:58.469> how<00:01:59.219> long<00:01:59.490> does<00:01:59.670> it<00:01:59.729> take<00:02:00.119> from<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the bag how long does it take from the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.380 
the bag how long does it take from the
bag<00:02:00.899> -<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.920> guess<00:02:02.399> leave<00:02:02.640> his<00:02:02.820> fist<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
bag - I guess leave his fist and

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.240 
bag - I guess leave his fist and
actually<00:02:03.899> get<00:02:04.079> knocked<00:02:04.290> off<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.530> chain<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
actually get knocked off the chain and

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.100 
actually get knocked off the chain and
then<00:02:05.460> land<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.210> ground<00:02:06.450> all<00:02:06.810> right<00:02:06.869> what

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
then land on the ground all right what

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.719 
then land on the ground all right what
that's<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.530> do<00:02:07.680> is<00:02:08.129> it's<00:02:08.369> going<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.580> give

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
that's going to do is it's going to give

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.369 
that's going to do is it's going to give
us<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.970> acceleration<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.959> bag<00:02:10.110> it's

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
us the acceleration of the bag it's

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.869 
us the acceleration of the bag it's
basically<00:02:10.619> going<00:02:10.830> to<00:02:10.890> tell<00:02:11.069> us<00:02:11.129> how<00:02:11.730> much

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
basically going to tell us how much

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.350 
basically going to tell us how much
force<00:02:12.330> he<00:02:12.569> put<00:02:12.810> onto<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
force he put onto the

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.930 
force he put onto the
itself<00:02:14.080> so<00:02:14.500> if<00:02:15.130> you<00:02:15.250> guys<00:02:15.370> are<00:02:15.520> ready<00:02:15.640> yeah

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
itself so if you guys are ready yeah

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.260 
itself so if you guys are ready yeah
let's<00:02:17.250> jump<00:02:18.250> into<00:02:18.460> this<00:02:21.120> okay<00:02:22.440> so<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.740> was

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
let's jump into this okay so that was

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.150 
let's jump into this okay so that was
ridiculously<00:02:25.270> fast<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:26.140> was<00:02:26.380> absolutely

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
ridiculously fast that was absolutely

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.380 
ridiculously fast that was absolutely
nuts<00:02:27.340> now<00:02:27.610> what<00:02:27.760> we're<00:02:27.880> going<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.030> do<00:02:28.180> here

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
nuts now what we're going to do here

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.040 
nuts now what we're going to do here
with<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.660> time<00:02:28.930> frame<00:02:29.820> 0.4<00:02:30.820> seconds<00:02:31.240> or<00:02:31.330> 0.04

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
with that time frame 0.4 seconds or 0.04

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.930 
with that time frame 0.4 seconds or 0.04
seconds<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.560> we're<00:02:32.740> going<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.070> put<00:02:33.610> this<00:02:33.730> in

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
seconds is we're going to put this in

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.150 
seconds is we're going to put this in
here<00:02:34.240> initially<00:02:34.840> as<00:02:35.020> feet<00:02:35.560> all<00:02:35.890> right<00:02:35.950> what

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
here initially as feet all right what

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.470 
here initially as feet all right what
we're<00:02:36.250> going<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.430> say<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:36.970> for<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.300> sake<00:02:37.450> of

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
we're going to say is for the sake of

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.870 
we're going to say is for the sake of
argument<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:38.440> distance<00:02:38.860> between<00:02:39.040> where<00:02:39.730> he

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
argument the distance between where he

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.670 
argument the distance between where he
was<00:02:40.030> standing<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:40.750> where<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.020> bag<00:02:41.170> landed

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
was standing and where the bag landed

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.310 
was standing and where the bag landed
we'll<00:02:42.100> say<00:02:42.310> it's<00:02:42.490> about<00:02:42.640> 11<00:02:43.360> feet<00:02:43.630> or<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.080> so

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
we'll say it's about 11 feet or so so

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.470 
we'll say it's about 11 feet or so so
we'll<00:02:44.440> go<00:02:44.560> ahead<00:02:44.680> and<00:02:44.860> we'll<00:02:45.010> punch<00:02:45.250> in<00:02:45.490> 11

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
we'll go ahead and we'll punch in 11

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.420 
we'll go ahead and we'll punch in 11
feet<00:02:46.690> here<00:02:46.990> now<00:02:47.910> we<00:02:48.910> know<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.240> 1<00:02:49.420> foot<00:02:49.690> equals

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
feet here now we know that 1 foot equals

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.860 
feet here now we know that 1 foot equals
0.3048<00:02:51.430> meters<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:52.239> so<00:02:52.480> this<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
0.3048 meters and so this is the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.720 
0.3048 meters and so this is the
calculation<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.410> we<00:02:53.590> get<00:02:53.770> now<00:02:54.310> putting<00:02:54.580> in

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
calculation that we get now putting in

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.390 
calculation that we get now putting in
the<00:02:54.850> time<00:02:54.880> will<00:02:55.600> say<00:02:55.810> zero<00:02:56.170> point<00:02:56.530> four<00:02:57.040> and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
the time will say zero point four and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.430 
the time will say zero point four and
think<00:02:57.640> seconds<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:58.090> was<00:02:58.209> all<00:02:58.870> right<00:02:59.110> what<00:02:59.290> this

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
think seconds it was all right what this

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.949 
think seconds it was all right what this
tells<00:02:59.680> us<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.250> when<00:03:01.000> he<00:03:01.150> punched<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:01.690> bag

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
tells us is that when he punched the bag

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.500 
tells us is that when he punched the bag
that<00:03:02.770> when<00:03:03.010> he<00:03:03.100> hit<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.370> bag<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:04.030> bag<00:03:04.060> came

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
that when he hit the bag the bag came

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.930 
that when he hit the bag the bag came
off<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.020> landed<00:03:05.470> at<00:03:05.620> eight<00:03:06.190> point<00:03:06.550> three

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
off and landed at eight point three

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.479 
off and landed at eight point three
eight<00:03:07.239> eight<00:03:07.750> point<00:03:08.230> three<00:03:08.380> eight<00:03:08.410> two<00:03:08.680> meters

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
eight eight point three eight two meters

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.010 
eight eight point three eight two meters
per<00:03:09.700> second<00:03:10.090> squared<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.570> know<00:03:10.630> it's<00:03:10.810> kind<00:03:10.989> of

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
per second squared I know it's kind of

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.840 
per second squared I know it's kind of
like<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.950> know<00:03:12.040> crazy<00:03:12.250> but<00:03:12.580> just<00:03:12.730> bear<00:03:12.820> with

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
like you know crazy but just bear with

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.250 
like you know crazy but just bear with
me<00:03:13.000> for<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.239> second<00:03:13.570> all<00:03:14.050> right

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
me for a second all right

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.020 
me for a second all right
so<00:03:14.590> what<00:03:14.739> we<00:03:14.830> do<00:03:14.950> here<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.430> because<00:03:15.730> this<00:03:15.850> is

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
so what we do here is because this is

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.460 
so what we do here is because this is
square<00:03:16.300> but<00:03:16.480> we<00:03:16.570> can't<00:03:16.750> really<00:03:16.989> represent<00:03:17.140> it

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
square but we can't really represent it

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
was fun we can do this more often like

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.360 
was fun we can do this more often like
what<00:04:37.870> would<00:04:37.990> happen<00:04:38.440> if<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.950> war<00:04:39.070> threw<00:04:39.250> his

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
what would happen if the war threw his

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.960 
what would happen if the war threw his
hammer<00:04:39.670> at<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.950> that<00:04:41.950> would<00:04:42.160> be<00:04:42.190> nuts<00:04:42.640> that

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
hammer at you that would be nuts that

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.180 
hammer at you that would be nuts that
would<00:04:43.090> be<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.620> ridiculously<00:04:44.620> difficult<00:04:44.770> one

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
would be a ridiculously difficult one

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.920 
would be a ridiculously difficult one
but<00:04:45.700> that'd<00:04:45.790> be<00:04:45.820> fun<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.210> do<00:04:46.330> that'd<00:04:46.780> be

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
but that'd be fun to do that'd be

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.060 
but that'd be fun to do that'd be
interesting<00:04:47.140> I<00:04:47.380> think<00:04:47.440> it'd<00:04:47.590> be<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.680> lot<00:04:47.800> easier

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
interesting I think it'd be a lot easier

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.290 
interesting I think it'd be a lot easier
than<00:04:48.160> this<00:04:48.310> one<00:04:48.520> but<00:04:48.820> it'd<00:04:48.940> still<00:04:48.970> be<00:04:49.150> pretty

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
than this one but it'd still be pretty

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.180 
than this one but it'd still be pretty
fun<00:04:49.570> so<00:04:49.870> anyway<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.620> hope<00:04:50.710> you<00:04:50.800> guys<00:04:50.860> enjoyed
