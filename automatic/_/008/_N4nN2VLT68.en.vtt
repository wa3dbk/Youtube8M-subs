have<00:02:47.010> probably<00:02:47.850> gone<00:02:48.240> but<00:02:48.960> I<00:02:48.990> do<00:02:49.140> you<00:02:49.440> think<00:02:49.770> as

have probably gone but I do you think as

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.390 
have probably gone but I do you think as
we<00:02:50.460> travel<00:02:51.150> more<00:02:51.300> as<00:02:51.870> we<00:02:52.080> fly<00:02:52.470> more<00:02:52.740> and<00:02:53.010> as

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
we travel more as we fly more and as

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.630 
we travel more as we fly more and as
long-term<00:02:54.210> more<00:02:54.690> congested<00:02:55.430> physically<00:02:56.430> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
long-term more congested physically the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.030 
long-term more congested physically the
only<00:02:57.060> way<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.270> do<00:02:57.570> it<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:58.050> with<00:02:58.440> planes<00:02:58.770> like

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
only way to do it is with planes like

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.250 
only way to do it is with planes like
creating<00:02:59.730> what<00:03:00.240> I'm<00:03:00.360> looking<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.750> see<00:03:00.990> really

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
creating what I'm looking to see really

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.460 
creating what I'm looking to see really
much<00:03:01.620> more<00:03:01.920> than<00:03:02.070> anything<00:03:02.460> else<00:03:02.700> is<00:03:03.440> sad<00:03:04.440> that

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
much more than anything else is sad that

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.820 
much more than anything else is sad that
I<00:03:04.890> am<00:03:05.040> perhaps<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:06.030> how<00:03:06.360> they<00:03:06.600> handle<00:03:07.140> all<00:03:07.500> that

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
I am perhaps is how they handle all that

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.480 
I am perhaps is how they handle all that
luggage<00:03:08.250> when<00:03:08.940> we<00:03:09.120> get<00:03:09.300> to
