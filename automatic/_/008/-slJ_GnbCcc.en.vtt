00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
watching a normal app watch you would

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.400 
watching a normal app watch you would
get<00:02:32.590> a<00:02:33.270> metallic<00:02:34.270> one<00:02:34.480> here<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.050> one<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.290> a

get a metallic one here this one is a

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.650 
get a metallic one here this one is a
plastic<00:02:35.890> one<00:02:36.070> because<00:02:36.400> it's<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.760> Apple<00:02:37.510> watch

plastic one because it's the Apple watch
sports<00:02:38.020> edition<00:02:38.580> anyway<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.610> think<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:40.030> looks

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
sports edition anyway I think it looks

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.140 
sports edition anyway I think it looks
very<00:02:40.989> good<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.560> as<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.100> can<00:02:42.250> see<00:02:42.550> from<00:02:42.850> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
very good and as you can see from the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.260 
very good and as you can see from the
size<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.800> it<00:02:45.220> looks<00:02:45.520> like<00:02:45.700> it's<00:02:45.940> going<00:02:46.150> to

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
size of this it looks like it's going to

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.720 
size of this it looks like it's going to
be<00:02:46.510> very<00:02:46.930> very<00:02:47.230> long<00:02:47.590> which<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.310> think<00:02:48.489> very

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
be very very long which is I think very

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.960 
be very very long which is I think very
handy<00:02:49.330> if<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.769> have<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.160> you<00:02:51.610> know<00:02:51.730> if<00:02:51.820> you

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
handy if you have to you know if you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.340 
handy if you have to you know if you
have<00:02:52.060> like<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.480> put<00:02:52.690> your<00:02:52.780> Apple<00:02:53.050> watch<00:02:53.080> in

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
have like to put your Apple watch in

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.960 
have like to put your Apple watch in
another<00:02:53.560> location<00:02:54.190> letting<00:02:54.580> you<00:02:54.640> buy<00:02:54.790> your

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
another location letting you buy your

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.290 
another location letting you buy your

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
bed or something like that so the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.600 
bed or something like that so the
nearest<00:02:58.600> plug<00:02:58.840> is<00:02:59.019> just<00:02:59.230> next<00:02:59.470> not<00:03:00.010> next<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.459> it

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
nearest plug is just next not next to it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.410 
nearest plug is just next not next to it
so<00:03:01.390> this<00:03:01.630> is<00:03:01.780> hidden<00:03:02.140> these<00:03:02.320> are<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:03.420> very
