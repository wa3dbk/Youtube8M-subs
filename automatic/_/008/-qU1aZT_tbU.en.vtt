oh<00:05:37.840> yes<00:05:38.840> and<00:05:39.170> if<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:39.860> wonder<00:05:40.250> how<00:05:40.400> I<00:05:40.430> modified

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
oh yes and if you wonder how I modified

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.180 
oh yes and if you wonder how I modified
a<00:05:41.120> bend<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:42.470> how<00:05:43.340> I<00:05:43.370> modified<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.240> ends

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
a bend and how I modified the ends

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.730 
a bend and how I modified the ends
I'll<00:05:46.190> use<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.640> hot-air<00:05:47.060> gun<00:05:47.630> I<00:05:47.740> tried

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
I'll use the hot-air gun I tried

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.100 
I'll use the hot-air gun I tried

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
water that wasn't hot enough so you will

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.380 
water that wasn't hot enough so you will
have<00:05:57.530> to<00:05:57.920> use<00:05:58.250> all<00:05:58.640> airgun<00:05:59.510> the<00:06:00.440> modify<00:06:01.390> the

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
get the openings like this

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.990 
get the openings like this
I<00:06:11.930> used<00:06:12.650> conical<00:06:13.610> piece<00:06:13.820> of<00:06:14.090> wood<00:06:14.300> I<00:06:14.480> machined

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 
I used conical piece of wood I machined

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.850

it<00:06:23.870> down<00:06:24.310> but<00:06:25.310> this<00:06:25.490> is<00:06:25.550> about<00:06:26.000> the<00:06:26.180> absolute

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
it down but this is about the absolute

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.690 
it down but this is about the absolute
limit<00:06:27.140> if<00:06:27.290> you<00:06:27.470> try<00:06:27.770> to<00:06:27.830> open<00:06:27.980> it<00:06:28.280> up<00:06:28.430> in<00:06:28.610> a
