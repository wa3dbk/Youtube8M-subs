00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.250
 hello gesture lars balance energy me 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.500
 wanted to give a little tip 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.510
 So what she currently has revital season 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.070
 are melons i have a watermelon 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.920
 that's pretty hard i thought 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.289
 so somewhere between seven and 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.679
 nine kilo unfortunately I have no biologists 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.660
 that can be good 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.939
 my tip to take apart 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.750
 to make a smoothie out of it is 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.220
 just cut in half through 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.560
 with a big knife we ​​have here 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.360
 such a huge knife and always 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.940
 already be careful now a very bad 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.710
 cut because it slipped and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.540
 then not everything in small pieces 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.660
 cut because it is a huge work 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:52.680
 It's better to let it happen 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.390
 anyway, and that covers out here that 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.780
 the pretty good and then I have here 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.520
 placed in the sink the mixa and here 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.500
 is now one half of the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.939
 Separate watermelon that fits here very much 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.770
 very good in this second container and 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:11.039
 Now nothing with x and you do not have to 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.270
 So mix long so 20 seconds 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:14.270
 because go 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.810
 it would also take almost ten seconds 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.080
 the mixer was enough and that was 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.440
 really delicious and I think so 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:46.940
 now here in such a one-seater 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:51.390
 Jam jar Yes I'll be right there 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.190
 and then you have a super good mac 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.860
 So that would be proper lunch 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.509
 I really drink two of the things 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.250
 you can straw the very thick 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.649
 take or really so directly out 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.509
 The glass of rain is delicious right now 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.910
 to this hot season 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.789
 that gives very good power 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.959
 for the kidneys and also for the kidneys 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.250
 Inflammation in the body in the watermelon 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.800
 The inflammation in the body brings you 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.910
 if you hold which have got down the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.739
 is very good if you are too 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.269
 somehow everything is clear 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.269
