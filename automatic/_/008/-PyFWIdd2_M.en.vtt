the
for<00:02:15.080> Morrison<00:02:15.530> then<00:02:16.010> in<00:02:16.130> the<00:02:16.190> a<00:02:16.220> first

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
for Morrison then in the a first

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.790

basically what they're trying to do i'm

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.090 
basically what they're trying to do i'm
guessing<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:20.930> go<00:02:21.080> into<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.350> more<00:02:21.560> defensive

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
guessing is go into a more defensive

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.760 
guessing is go into a more defensive
kind<00:02:22.340> of<00:02:22.430> try<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:22.820> keep<00:02:23.060> the<00:02:23.270> lead<00:02:23.300> but<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.380> the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
kind of try and keep the lead but in the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.370 
kind of try and keep the lead but in the
a<00:02:24.800> fifth-minute<00:02:25.220> Snodgrass<00:02:26.180> equals<00:02:27.170> it<00:02:27.260> out

him<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:42.709> that's<00:03:42.830> basically<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.250> word<00:03:43.489> used

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
him that that's basically the word used

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.400 
him that that's basically the word used
really<00:03:44.209> that's<00:03:44.390> probably<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.019> best<00:03:45.140> way<00:03:45.290> to

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
really that's probably the best way to

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.190 
really that's probably the best way to
kind<00:03:45.769> of<00:03:45.860> just<00:03:46.640> a<00:03:46.790> fire<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.360> Hulu<00:03:47.870> soon<00:03:48.080> has

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
kind of just a fire and Hulu soon has

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.320 
kind of just a fire and Hulu soon has
only<00:03:48.440> been<00:03:48.830> on<00:03:48.980> for<00:03:49.040> eight<00:03:49.370> minutes<00:03:49.730> in<00:03:50.060> fact

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
only been on for eight minutes in fact

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.410 
only been on for eight minutes in fact
so<00:03:50.630> it's<00:03:51.110> quite<00:03:51.950> a<00:03:52.010> bad<00:03:52.280> substitution<00:03:53.090> sindard

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
so it's quite a bad substitution sindard

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.870 
so it's quite a bad substitution sindard
emily<00:03:53.810> was<00:03:53.989> an<00:03:54.080> amazing<00:03:54.590> substitution<00:03:55.190> scored

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:55.880 
emily was an amazing substitution scored

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.420 
emily was an amazing substitution scored
on<00:03:56.000> his<00:03:56.120> debut<00:03:56.680> unbelievable<00:03:57.680> not<00:03:58.070> as<00:03:58.190> good<00:03:58.280> as

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
on his debut unbelievable not as good as

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.259 
on his debut unbelievable not as good as
Fletcher<00:03:58.760> those<00:03:58.910> scoring<00:03:59.180> two<00:03:59.480> but<00:04:00.140> he's<00:04:00.980> it's

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
Fletcher those scoring two but he's it's

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.850 
Fletcher those scoring two but he's it's
all<00:04:02.269> gone<00:04:02.450> off<00:04:02.630> with<00:04:02.840> eight<00:04:03.110> minutes<00:04:03.410> in<00:04:03.680> and

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
all gone off with eight minutes in and

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.650 
all gone off with eight minutes in and
he<00:04:04.250> has<00:04:04.280> just<00:04:04.550> got<00:04:04.730> sent<00:04:05.060> off<00:04:05.209> straight<00:04:05.630> away

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
he has just got sent off straight away

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.940 
he has just got sent off straight away
and<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:07.280> is<00:04:07.430> how<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:07.640> game<00:04:07.790> ends<00:04:08.360> and<00:04:08.950> really

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
and that is how the game ends and really

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.440 
and that is how the game ends and really
there<00:04:10.130> was<00:04:10.280> weather<00:04:10.549> and<00:04:10.820> points<00:04:11.090> from<00:04:11.209> both

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
there was weather and points from both

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.229 
there was weather and points from both
sides<00:04:11.810> they<00:04:12.049> both<00:04:12.290> really<00:04:12.920> needed<00:04:13.640> that<00:04:13.850> kind

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
sides they both really needed that kind

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.300 
sides they both really needed that kind
of<00:04:14.390> point<00:04:14.630> they<00:04:14.780> both<00:04:15.019> really<00:04:15.680> only<00:04:15.860> had<00:04:16.070> one

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
of point they both really only had one

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.949 
of point they both really only had one
point<00:04:16.609> so<00:04:16.820> they<00:04:16.910> needed<00:04:17.209> another<00:04:17.330> point<00:04:17.780> each

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
point so they needed another point each

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.110 
point so they needed another point each
at<00:04:18.229> least<00:04:18.260> so<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.220> think<00:04:19.669> they're<00:04:19.820> quite<00:04:19.970> happy

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
at least so I think they're quite happy

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.840 
at least so I think they're quite happy
with<00:04:20.299> that<00:04:20.540> result<00:04:21.130> Tottenham<00:04:22.130> maybe<00:04:22.310> wanting

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
with that result Tottenham maybe wanting

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.690 
with that result Tottenham maybe wanting
more<00:04:23.030> sinister<00:04:23.450> they<00:04:23.570> had<00:04:23.780> 62<00:04:24.350> possession<00:04:25.100> so

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
more sinister they had 62 possession so

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.860 
more sinister they had 62 possession so
it's<00:04:26.150> quite

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
it's quite

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.629 
it's quite
