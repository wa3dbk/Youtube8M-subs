00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
look across the bottom of the tank you

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.190 
look across the bottom of the tank you
can<00:00:39.070> see<00:00:39.250> those<00:00:39.400> little<00:00:39.490> brown<00:00:39.730> spots<00:00:40.210> grow<00:00:41.050> it

on top of the sand I believe they're

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.910 
on top of the sand I believe they're
diatoms<00:00:46.390> so<00:00:46.810> it's<00:00:46.930> not<00:00:47.050> that<00:00:47.230> big<00:00:47.320> a<00:00:47.380> deal<00:00:47.590> just

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
diatoms so it's not that big a deal just

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.690 
diatoms so it's not that big a deal just

by<00:02:08.040> live<00:02:09.040> aquaria<00:02:11.640> probably<00:02:12.640> can't<00:02:12.820> pick<00:02:12.970> it

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
by live aquaria probably can't pick it

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.030 
by live aquaria probably can't pick it
up<00:02:13.150> too<00:02:13.330> well<00:02:13.450> on<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.750> camry<00:02:14.560> hair<00:02:14.740> but<00:02:14.890> there

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
up too well on the camry hair but there

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.740 
up too well on the camry hair but there
is<00:02:15.160> a<00:02:15.660> lot<00:02:16.660> going<00:02:16.690> on<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.320> rock<00:02:19.530> my<00:02:20.530> power<00:02:20.710> data

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
is a lot going on a rock my power data

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.820 
is a lot going on a rock my power data
fell<00:02:22.750> out<00:02:22.900> there<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.140> gotta<00:02:23.350> put<00:02:23.530> that<00:02:23.560> back

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830

fell out there I gotta put that back
together

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.070 

but<00:02:31.060> it's<00:02:31.210> probably<00:02:31.480> somewhere<00:02:31.900> between<00:02:34.080> 35

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
but it's probably somewhere between 35

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.940 
but it's probably somewhere between 35
and<00:02:35.110> 40<00:02:35.680> pounds<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.130> live<00:02:36.280> rock<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:38.620> might<00:02:38.800> be<00:02:38.890> a

and 40 pounds of live rock it might be a

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.530 
and 40 pounds of live rock it might be a
little<00:02:39.100> much<00:02:39.220> for<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.730> 20<00:02:40.270> gallon<00:02:40.420> nano<00:02:42.540> now

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
little much for a 20 gallon nano now

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.580 
little much for a 20 gallon nano now
there<00:02:43.690> are<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.810> couple<00:02:43.960> pieces<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.470> I'll

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
there are a couple pieces that I'll

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.470 
there are a couple pieces that I'll
probably<00:02:44.860> get<00:02:45.250> rid<00:02:45.580> of<00:02:47.850> see<00:02:48.850> if<00:02:48.940> I<00:02:49.030> can<00:02:49.210> get<00:02:49.360> him

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
probably get rid of see if I can get him

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.730 
probably get rid of see if I can get him
to<00:02:49.570> the<00:02:49.660> local<00:02:49.990> fish<00:02:50.200> store<00:02:50.230> or<00:02:50.560> something

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
to the local fish store or something

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.830 
to the local fish store or something
like<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.370> just<00:02:52.330> think<00:02:52.480> I<00:02:52.510> have<00:02:52.660> too<00:02:52.810> much

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
like that I just think I have too much

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.300 
like that I just think I have too much
live<00:02:53.230> rock<00:02:53.500> in<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.770> tank<00:02:53.980> right<00:02:54.160> now<00:02:56.280> but<00:02:57.280> for

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
live rock in the tank right now but for

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.500 
live rock in the tank right now but for
now<00:02:57.580> I'm<00:02:57.760> trying<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.060> get<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.240> all<00:02:58.360> in<00:02:58.480> there

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
now I'm trying to get it all in there

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.030 
now I'm trying to get it all in there
and<00:02:58.750> get<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:58.930> all<00:02:59.020> cycled<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:02.290> then<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.680> will

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
and get it all cycled and then I will

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:19.250 
and get it all cycled and then I will
hopefully<00:03:03.550> do<00:03:04.000> a<00:03:04.590> better<00:03:05.590> aquascape<00:03:06.280> here

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.080 

hey<00:03:19.830> before<00:03:20.099> in<00:03:20.310> this<00:03:20.400> video<00:03:20.670> I<00:03:20.730> just<00:03:20.939> want<00:03:21.060> to

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
hey before in this video I just want to

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.449 
hey before in this video I just want to
take<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.239> quick<00:03:21.599> look<00:03:21.840> at<00:03:22.140> my<00:03:22.439> protein<00:03:23.069> skimmer

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
take a quick look at my protein skimmer

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.210 
take a quick look at my protein skimmer
and<00:03:24.079> you<00:03:25.079> can<00:03:25.200> see<00:03:25.379> there<00:03:25.530> it's<00:03:25.680> got<00:03:25.860> some<00:03:26.010> gunk

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
and you can see there it's got some gunk

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.539 
and you can see there it's got some gunk
going<00:03:26.579> on<00:03:26.700> there<00:03:27.680> but<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:28.890> real<00:03:29.129> quick<00:03:29.340> one

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
going on there but it's real quick one

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.710 
going on there but it's real quick one
dimensional<00:03:29.909> problem<00:03:30.000> i<00:03:30.329> had<00:03:30.480> with<00:03:30.569> it

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
dimensional problem i had with it

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.470 
dimensional problem i had with it
earlier<00:03:30.840> this<00:03:31.110> week<00:03:31.349> I<00:03:32.060> looked<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.209> up<00:03:33.269> online

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
earlier this week I looked it up online

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.569 
earlier this week I looked it up online
since<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.110> happens<00:03:34.379> often<00:03:34.560> but<00:03:35.040> basically<00:03:35.459> i

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
since it happens often but basically i

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.720 
since it happens often but basically i
had<00:03:35.730> my<00:03:35.909> protein<00:03:36.510> skimmer<00:03:37.430> bubble<00:03:38.430> started<00:03:38.670> to

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
had my protein skimmer bubble started to

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.699 
had my protein skimmer bubble started to
overflow<00:03:39.150> up<00:03:39.299> here<00:03:39.599> I<00:03:39.780> was<00:03:40.110> worried<00:03:40.379> that<00:03:40.560> the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
overflow up here I was worried that the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.780 
overflow up here I was worried that the
whole<00:03:40.860> collection<00:03:41.310> cup<00:03:41.489> could<00:03:41.640> actually

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
whole collection cup could actually

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.380 
whole collection cup could actually
overflow<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:43.370> apparently<00:03:44.370> it<00:03:45.090> had<00:03:45.239> does

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
overflow and apparently it had does

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.640 
overflow and apparently it had does
happen<00:03:45.629> often<00:03:47.299> so<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.659> was<00:03:49.200> trying<00:03:49.409> to<00:03:49.439> find

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
happen often so I was trying to find

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.440 
happen often so I was trying to find
some<00:03:49.799> quick<00:03:50.519> solutions<00:03:50.970> or<00:03:51.090> any<00:03:51.209> kind<00:03:51.329> of

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
some quick solutions or any kind of

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.789 
some quick solutions or any kind of
solution<00:03:51.810> at<00:03:51.900> all<00:03:51.989> for<00:03:52.290> it<00:03:52.319> really<00:03:52.500> and

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
solution at all for it really and

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.920 
solution at all for it really and
basically<00:03:53.480> obviously<00:03:54.480> if<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.599> have<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:54.900> a

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
basically obviously if you have it in a

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.809 
basically obviously if you have it in a
sump<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:56.069> would<00:03:56.220> be<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.340> problem<00:03:56.579> if<00:03:56.730> it

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
sump this would be a problem if it

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.009 
sump this would be a problem if it
overflowed<00:03:57.180> will<00:03:57.329> just<00:03:57.480> overflow<00:03:57.840> back

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
overflowed will just overflow back

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:01.369 
overflowed will just overflow back
through<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.260> Sun<00:03:59.540> but<00:04:00.540> since<00:04:00.780> this<00:04:00.930> is<00:04:01.079> a<00:04:01.109> hand

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
through the Sun but since this is a hand

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:02.830 
through the Sun but since this is a hand
on<00:04:01.409> the<00:04:01.530> back<00:04:01.769> I<00:04:02.010> don't<00:04:02.190> want<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.430> water<00:04:02.579> to

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
on the back I don't want the water to

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.240 
on the back I don't want the water to
get<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:03.959> my<00:04:04.109> carpet<00:04:04.409> and<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:04.829> bottom<00:04:05.159> the

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
get on my carpet and the bottom the

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.740 
get on my carpet and the bottom the
standard<00:04:05.639> all<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.790> wiring<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.269> anything<00:04:06.629> like

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
standard all the wiring is anything like

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.629 
standard all the wiring is anything like
that<00:04:07.940> so<00:04:09.379> what<00:04:10.379> I<00:04:10.409> looked<00:04:10.739> at<00:04:10.920> was<00:04:11.069> possibly

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
that so what I looked at was possibly

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.910 
that so what I looked at was possibly
drilling<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.150> hole<00:04:12.180> here<00:04:12.690> I'm<00:04:13.470> getting<00:04:13.590> some

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
drilling a hole here I'm getting some

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.129 
drilling a hole here I'm getting some
tubing<00:04:14.310> back<00:04:15.090> into<00:04:15.389> the<00:04:15.510> aquarium

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
tubing back into the aquarium

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:21.360 
tubing back into the aquarium
so<00:04:17.709> anything<00:04:17.949> that<00:04:18.069> overflows<00:04:18.639> I<00:04:20.249> can<00:04:21.249> just

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
so anything that overflows I can just

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.830 
so anything that overflows I can just
have<00:04:21.489> it<00:04:21.519> overflow<00:04:21.849> back<00:04:22.060> in<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.300> aquarium

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.200 

that's<00:04:25.840> just<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.139> quick<00:04:26.259> problem<00:04:26.680> i<00:04:26.770> had

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
that's just a quick problem i had

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.519 
that's just a quick problem i had
possible<00:04:28.210> solution<00:04:28.599> i'm<00:04:28.659> looking<00:04:28.930> at<00:04:31.529> all

00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:32.529 
possible solution i'm looking at all

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:33.989 
possible solution i'm looking at all
right<00:04:32.680> so<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:32.979> pretty<00:04:33.159> much<00:04:33.279> concludes<00:04:33.580> this

00:04:33.989 --> 00:04:33.999 
right so that pretty much concludes this

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:37.469 
right so that pretty much concludes this
video<00:04:34.180> i<00:04:34.979> just<00:04:35.979> wanted<00:04:36.249> to<00:04:36.370> show<00:04:36.939> the<00:04:37.029> diatoms

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
video i just wanted to show the diatoms

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.019 
video i just wanted to show the diatoms
i<00:04:37.539> had<00:04:37.689> in<00:04:37.779> the<00:04:37.840> tank<00:04:38.279> get<00:04:39.279> the<00:04:39.400> live<00:04:39.580> rock<00:04:39.849> in

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:40.029 
i had in the tank get the live rock in

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:42.480 
i had in the tank get the live rock in
the<00:04:40.090> tank<00:04:40.330> and<00:04:40.590> also<00:04:41.590> sure<00:04:41.949> the<00:04:42.039> problem<00:04:42.340> i<00:04:42.400> was

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
the tank and also sure the problem i was

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.589 
the tank and also sure the problem i was
having<00:04:42.550> with<00:04:42.789> the<00:04:42.879> protein<00:04:43.240> skimmer

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.330 

hopefully<00:04:46.599> in<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.870> next<00:04:47.229> video<00:04:47.620> i<00:04:47.680> can<00:04:48.039> get<00:04:48.310> a

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
hopefully in the next video i can get a

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.450 
hopefully in the next video i can get a
better<00:04:48.669> aquascape<00:04:49.240> going<00:04:49.889> get<00:04:50.889> the<00:04:51.009> live<00:04:51.189> rock

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
better aquascape going get the live rock

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.200 
better aquascape going get the live rock
cycled<00:04:52.090> more<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.569> also<00:04:53.849> talk<00:04:54.849> about<00:04:54.879> the

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210
