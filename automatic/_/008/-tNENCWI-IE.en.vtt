did<00:00:00.390> they<00:00:00.510> switch<00:00:00.680> yeah<00:00:07.670> it's<00:00:08.670> right<00:00:08.790> here

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
did they switch yeah it's right here

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.230 
did they switch yeah it's right here
it's<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.630> lady's<00:00:09.929> car<00:00:10.309> all<00:00:11.309> right<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.670> very

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
it's the lady's car all right it's very

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.140 
it's the lady's car all right it's very
similar<00:00:12.599> to<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:12.870> self<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.530> many<00:00:13.860> ways<00:00:14.150> we're

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
similar to a self in many ways we're

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.300

going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.330> tell<00:00:15.480> you<00:00:15.599> why<00:00:16.070> all<00:00:17.070> right<00:00:17.190> this

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
going to tell you why all right this

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.929 
going to tell you why all right this
right<00:00:17.520> here<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:18.660> engine<00:00:19.020> Licata<00:00:19.939> it's

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
right here the engine Licata it's

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.640 
right here the engine Licata it's
similar<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.390> lysosomes<00:00:22.020> because<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
similar to lysosomes because the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.500 
similar to lysosomes because the

outside<00:02:44.569> though<00:02:44.780> just<00:02:45.680> like<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.980> windshield

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
outside though just like the windshield

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.190 
outside though just like the windshield
wipers<00:02:46.730> are<00:02:46.909> used<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:50.299> get<00:02:50.450> unwanted<00:02:50.840> things

the cell membrane of a cell is used
mainly<00:03:23.349> for<00:03:23.620> protection<00:03:24.400> but<00:03:24.549> it<00:03:24.670> also<00:03:24.819> allows

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
mainly for protection but it also allows

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:28.319 
mainly for protection but it also allows
things<00:03:25.629> in<00:03:25.989> and<00:03:26.140> out<00:03:26.290> just<00:03:27.040> like<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.370> doors<00:03:28.000> on

things in and out just like the doors on
a<00:03:28.360> car<00:03:28.659> allow<00:03:29.290> things<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:29.950> out<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:30.400> need

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
a car allow things in and out I need

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.509 
a car allow things in and out I need
this<00:03:33.450> as<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:34.689> can<00:03:34.840> see<00:03:35.079> I<00:03:35.109> can<00:03:35.349> pull<00:03:35.769> Ryan<00:03:36.159> out

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
this as you can see I can pull Ryan out

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.780 
this as you can see I can pull Ryan out
of<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.730> car<00:03:36.970> I<00:03:37.329> couldn't<00:03:38.200> pull<00:03:38.470> this<00:03:39.129> seat<00:03:39.549> out

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
of the car I couldn't pull this seat out

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.420 
of the car I couldn't pull this seat out
of<00:03:39.819> the<00:03:40.000> car<00:03:40.209> because<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.170> how<00:03:41.319> big<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.189> seat

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
is it regulates what goes in and out

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.069 
is it regulates what goes in and out
just<00:03:45.129> like<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.310> gated<00:03:45.760> protein<00:03:46.180> channel<00:03:46.629> on<00:03:46.870> the
