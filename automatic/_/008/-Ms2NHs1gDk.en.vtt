00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.890
 here today at the sound factory 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.640
 we will demonstrate how it installs 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.640
 stringer on car roof 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.540
 measurements are first taken to know 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.579
 what is the ideal and right position that will 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.469
 stay spar each car has a 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.329
 position so that the stringer does not come out of the 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.670
 position already marked 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.670
 we fixed the stringer with the crepe tape 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:04.449
 with pencil we mark the points to be 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:07.960
 and we used the drill to make 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.530
 the holes note that the drill the people 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:15.990
 use a wedge just for the non-drill bit. 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.990
 pass the ceiling liner 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:27.000
 after that we put the bushes and 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.000
 we prepared the ceiling for an ambassador 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:40.390
 this tool stuck on her 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:45.220
 lock these bushings on the roof of the car 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:47.590
 these bushings it already comes with thread and there 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.400
 the ceiling is just to install the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:54.160
 and screwed at the time of the 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.750
 Witches' installation is very 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.020
 important you do not tighten too much for a 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.020
 to pass from point 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.770

 Fasteners Fasten Fasteners and Starts 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.110
 to tighten on one side and then on the other 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.510
 the ideal is whenever you intercalate 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.010
 first to tighten a left side 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.310
 or right on the other left side 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.070
 right and to close people puts the 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:45.590
