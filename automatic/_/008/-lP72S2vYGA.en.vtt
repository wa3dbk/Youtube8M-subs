is<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> look<00:01:26.400> at<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.640> little<00:01:26.850> bit<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.299> magnet<00:01:27.900> at

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
is a look at a little bit of a magnet at

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.600 
is a look at a little bit of a magnet at
the<00:01:28.200> end<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.470> stick<00:01:28.710> here<00:01:28.979> which<00:01:29.159> helps<00:01:29.430> me

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the end of a stick here which helps me

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.210 
the end of a stick here which helps me
to<00:01:30.329> take<00:01:30.540> my<00:01:30.780> lids<00:01:31.079> off<00:01:31.409> here<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.740> place<00:01:31.979> them

to take my lids off here and place them

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.100 
to take my lids off here and place them
directly<00:01:32.369> on<00:01:32.759> top<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.119> my<00:01:33.240> jars<00:01:33.509> after<00:01:33.960> they're

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
directly on top of my jars after they're

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.370 
directly on top of my jars after they're
filled<00:01:35.479> all<00:01:36.479> right<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.720> your<00:01:36.840> recipe<00:01:37.140> like

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
filled all right if your recipe like

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.289 
filled all right if your recipe like
this<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.770> does<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.189> raspberry<00:01:38.640> jam<00:01:38.820> uses

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
this one does is raspberry jam uses

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.569 
this one does is raspberry jam uses
liquid<00:01:39.630> pectin<00:01:40.229> we're<00:01:40.650> going<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.829> add<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
liquid pectin we're going to add that to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.810 
liquid pectin we're going to add that to
the<00:01:41.729> boiling<00:01:42.060> sugar<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.310> raspberries<00:01:44.310> I'm

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
the boiling sugar and raspberries I'm

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.950 
the boiling sugar and raspberries I'm
going<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> make<00:01:45.090> sure<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.390> get<00:01:45.509> all<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.930> that

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
going to make sure we get all of that

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.080 
going to make sure we get all of that
out<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.409> here<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:47.130> squeeze<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> all<00:01:47.670> out<00:01:47.909> and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
out of here so squeeze it all out and

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.999 
out of here so squeeze it all out and
then<00:01:48.439> what<00:01:49.439> you're<00:01:49.530> going<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.710> do<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.920> you're

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
then what you're going to do is you're

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.069 
then what you're going to do is you're
going<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.220> have<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.520> boil<00:01:50.880> hard<00:01:51.479> for<00:01:51.899> about

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
going to have that boil hard for about

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.440 
going to have that boil hard for about
one<00:01:52.409> minute<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:53.220> activates<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> pectin<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
one minute that activates the pectin and

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.209 
one minute that activates the pectin and
ensures<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.930> it's<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> jail<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:56.009> nice

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
ensures that it's going to jail up nice

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.150 
ensures that it's going to jail up nice
and<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.549> end

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
and the end

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.910 
and the end
so<00:01:59.160> now<00:01:59.310> my<00:01:59.610> jam<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.330> boiled<00:02:01.230> for<00:02:01.440> that<00:02:01.620> full

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
so now my jam is boiled for that full

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.160 
so now my jam is boiled for that full
minute<00:02:02.280> afterwards<00:02:02.610> I'm<00:02:03.540> going<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.810> take<00:02:03.990> this

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
minute afterwards I'm going to take this

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.500 
minute afterwards I'm going to take this
off<00:02:04.440> and<00:02:04.740> pour<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.400> into<00:02:05.580> a<00:02:05.730> container<00:02:06.090> that

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
off and pour it into a container that

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.440 
off and pour it into a container that
can<00:02:06.630> easily<00:02:06.840> fill<00:02:07.470> my<00:02:07.650> jars<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:09.119> know<00:02:09.240> at<00:02:09.330> this

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
can easily fill my jars you know at this

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.750 
can easily fill my jars you know at this
point<00:02:09.570> if<00:02:09.930> you<00:02:10.050> wanted<00:02:10.350> a<00:02:10.500> more<00:02:10.920> refined<00:02:11.160> jam

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
point if you wanted a more refined jam

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.460 
point if you wanted a more refined jam
over<00:02:12.030> there<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.390> would<00:02:12.540> skim<00:02:12.960> off<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.140> foam

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
over there you would skim off the foam

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.790 
over there you would skim off the foam
off<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.830> top<00:02:14.040> but<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:14.850> remember<00:02:15.180> grandma<00:02:15.800> she

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
off the top but I remember grandma she

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.140 
off the top but I remember grandma she
used<00:02:16.920> to<00:02:17.010> pour<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.280> right<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.520> there<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.850> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
used to pour it right in there and the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.640 
used to pour it right in there and the
kids<00:02:18.390> we<00:02:18.570> all<00:02:18.690> fought<00:02:18.960> over<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.290> little<00:02:19.560> bit

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
kids we all fought over the little bit

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.470 
kids we all fought over the little bit
of<00:02:19.740> foam<00:02:19.920> and<00:02:19.950> each<00:02:20.190> one<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.610> jam<00:02:20.880> jars<00:02:21.180> so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
of foam and each one of the jam jars so

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.200 
of foam and each one of the jam jars so
I<00:02:21.690> like<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.260> leave<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.710> there<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:24.060> now

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
I like to leave that on there so now

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.580 
I like to leave that on there so now
what<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.450> do<00:02:24.570> is<00:02:24.750> your<00:02:25.170> going<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.380> take<00:02:25.440> your

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
what you do is your going to take your

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.190 
what you do is your going to take your
jars<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.370> couple<00:02:26.880> at<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.180> time<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.780> we're<00:02:28.080> going

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
jars a couple at a time and we're going

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.260 
jars a couple at a time and we're going
to<00:02:28.230> fill<00:02:28.470> those<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:29.430> one<00:02:29.730> tool<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.240> can

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
to fill those so one tool that you can

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.670 
to fill those so one tool that you can
use<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.720> had<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> little<00:02:31.050> funnel<00:02:31.290> here<00:02:31.530> which

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
use you had a little funnel here which

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.610 
use you had a little funnel here which
fits<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.190> inside<00:02:32.550> or<00:02:33.180> a<00:02:33.240> nice<00:02:33.960> container

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
fits on the inside or a nice container

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.370 
fits on the inside or a nice container
like<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:34.890> which<00:02:35.340> gets<00:02:35.630> all<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.930> my<00:02:37.050> jam

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
like this which gets all of my jam

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.610 
like this which gets all of my jam
filled<00:02:38.070> all<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.370> way<00:02:38.580> up<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.810> quarter<00:02:40.230> inch

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
filled all the way up to a quarter inch

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.670 
filled all the way up to a quarter inch
of<00:02:41.130> headspace<00:02:41.910> that<00:02:42.780> means<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.230> quarter<00:02:43.530> inch

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
of headspace that means a quarter inch

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.170 
of headspace that means a quarter inch
up<00:02:43.950> from<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.460> top<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.700> that's<00:02:45.000> very

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
up from the top and that's very

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.900 
up from the top and that's very
important<00:02:45.810> what<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.740> does<00:02:46.980> is<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.370> builds

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
important what that does is that builds

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.250 
important what that does is that builds
the<00:02:48.060> correct<00:02:48.330> amount<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.690> pressure<00:02:48.870> in<00:02:49.110> there

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
the correct amount of pressure in there

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.500 
the correct amount of pressure in there
so<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.130> put<00:02:50.340> our<00:02:50.370> lids<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.850> there<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.060> we<00:02:51.210> boil

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
so we put our lids in there and we boil

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.710 
so we put our lids in there and we boil
it<00:02:51.720> off<00:02:51.870> it's<00:02:52.710> going<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:52.950> make<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.190> nice<00:02:53.520> seal<00:02:53.910> so

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
it off it's going to make a nice seal so

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.530 
it off it's going to make a nice seal so
now<00:02:54.870> let<00:02:55.860> me<00:02:55.890> take<00:02:56.160> our<00:02:56.370> raspberry<00:02:57.180> jam<00:02:57.360> which

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
now let me take our raspberry jam which

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.410 
now let me take our raspberry jam which
is<00:02:57.690> inside<00:02:58.070> we<00:02:59.070> can<00:02:59.220> take<00:02:59.520> if<00:02:59.760> we<00:02:59.940> got<00:03:00.150> a<00:03:00.180> little

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
is inside we can take if we got a little

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.880 
is inside we can take if we got a little
bit<00:03:00.570> on<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> edge<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:01.140> can<00:03:01.290> go<00:03:01.440> by<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.739> wipe

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
bit on the edge we can go by and wipe

crank<00:03:12.239> them<00:03:12.390> down<00:03:12.630> you're<00:03:12.870> going<00:03:12.989> to<00:03:13.050> have

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
crank them down you're going to have

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.040 
crank them down you're going to have
issues<00:03:13.470> later<00:03:13.800> by<00:03:14.459> pulling<00:03:14.790> them<00:03:14.940> off<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.420> each

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
issues later by pulling them off so each

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.910 
issues later by pulling them off so each
one<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.410> these<00:03:16.670> go<00:03:17.670> inside<00:03:18.000> your<00:03:18.270> canner

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
one of these go inside your canner

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
once we get them all out is this little

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.910 
once we get them all out is this little
indentation<00:04:09.629> on<00:04:09.720> the<00:04:09.780> top<00:04:10.079> of<00:04:10.230> this<00:04:10.319> and<00:04:10.680> you

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
indentation on the top of this and you

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.920 
indentation on the top of this and you
want<00:04:11.129> this<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.610> fall<00:04:11.849> down<00:04:11.879> and<00:04:12.360> depress<00:04:12.750> and

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
want this to fall down and depress and

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.420 
want this to fall down and depress and
you<00:04:13.019> can<00:04:13.140> even<00:04:13.230> hear<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.530> little<00:04:13.739> noise<00:04:13.860> go<00:04:14.280> off

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
you can even hear a little noise go off

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.670 
you can even hear a little noise go off
that<00:04:14.760> means<00:04:15.690> that<00:04:16.049> that<00:04:16.199> pressure<00:04:16.500> is

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
that means that that pressure is

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.590 
that means that that pressure is
dropping<00:04:17.489> in<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:17.850> center<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.419> that's

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
dropping in the center and that's

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.689 
dropping in the center and that's
ceiling<00:04:19.139> that<00:04:19.289> top<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:19.829> can<00:04:20.100> on<00:04:20.340> there

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
ceiling that top of that can on there

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.909 
ceiling that top of that can on there
then<00:04:21.449> after<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:21.959> what<00:04:22.199> I<00:04:22.229> want<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.560> to<00:04:22.680> do<00:04:22.800> is

then after that what I want you to do is

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.520 
then after that what I want you to do is
take<00:04:23.220> these<00:04:23.490> screw<00:04:24.419> tops<00:04:24.690> off<00:04:24.930> you're<00:04:25.410> going

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
take these screw tops off you're going

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.740 
take these screw tops off you're going
to<00:04:25.590> store<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:25.949> without<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.370> screw<00:04:26.610> tops<00:04:26.880> there

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
to store it without the screw tops there

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.600 
to store it without the screw tops there
goes<00:04:27.870> another<00:04:27.990> one<00:04:28.310> it's<00:04:29.310> going<00:04:29.460> to<00:04:29.520> happen

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
goes another one it's going to happen
