00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:35.130
 I think I tested had a rafael 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:38.520
 fast there is no chance it can be 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:42.000
 discarded in the case of the mh flight tragedy 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.770
 17 may have been an accident 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.079
 to have been a human error may have been 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.870
 a technical failure is unlikely 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.140
 most likely it was in fact 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.770
 an anti-aircraft missile fired 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.719
 possibly by someone who considered 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.190
 that that plane was a plane 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.890
 recognition of an intelligence plane 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.409
 a data collection aircraft 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.960
 spy plane is a failure 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.619
 rough and we can not forget that 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.580
 in that region that is not at first 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.189
 with the 11 districts is a commercial axis 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.570
 very important there is the heavy traffic 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.390
 commercial air traffic is not and that 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.670
 so I'll enforce your route 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.950
 usually but we can not let 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.560
 and we must not forget that it is 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.119
 is a sensitive region where 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.640
 perhaps seven to nine separatist groups 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.070
 nationalist rebels and more 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.229
 recently from autonomous groups 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.450
 led by warlords who 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.159
 considered independent in relation to 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.430
 all others 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.070
 many of them the majority is formed by ex 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.009
 military personnel who know for example 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.770
 know a weapon know the logistics 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.719
 or wherever they are stored 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.969
 what is the way they are stored 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.409
 which are the most vulnerable and 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.890
 which may therefore simply have 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.840
 this type of material has reached 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.550
 The plane is not so difficult so it does not 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.550
 it's a military plane is not a plane capable 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.930
 for example from issuing signals that 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.180
 to confuse the warheads that the 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.290
 radar of the warheads that will carry the missile 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.080
 until your target 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.570
 not the plane was doing a commercial flight 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.570
 drove people to one another on a route 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.800
 of tourism that is amsterdam kuala lumpur and 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.290
 these people were simply 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.440
 waiting for the moment to land on one of the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:40.510
 most wanted destinations in the world 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.100
 have found their individual and 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.670
 This destiny was tragic. 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:48.400
 we are sure of only one thing 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.130
 expertise is able to identify the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.650
 causes the origins and all 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.650
 consequences of a possible attack 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.140
 military and also a fall 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.040
 possibly suffered from a 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.620
 failure 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.630
 the blackboard boxes that certainly 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.910
 will be located differently than 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.780
 happened to the other alaska plane 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.690
 airlines 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.860
 they resist any kind of 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.330
 aggression 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.760
 they were prepared in 1 in 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.980
 certain cases and perhaps this is 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.709
 they have been prepared to withstand 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.630
 even nuclear explosions not an impact 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.350
 direct but the effects of an explosion 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.260
 nuclear 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.360
 the data are not lost and even though 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.850
 difficult to rescue when 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.700
 they were found and more after the 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.550
 evaluation of the remains of the aircraft will be 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.770
 possible to establish a way that does not 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.730
 leave any doubts whether it was a 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.430
 outrage 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.680
 if it was a mistake or if it was a fall 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.880
 actually caused by a failure 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.880
 technique a human fault
