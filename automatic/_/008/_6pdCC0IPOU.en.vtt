more over here the reason i set up an
infinite<00:00:41.969> water<00:00:42.149> source<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:44.239> be<00:00:45.239> able

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
infinite water source here is to be able

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.510 
infinite water source here is to be able
to<00:00:45.690> make<00:00:45.719> new<00:00:47.180> farm<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.390> grounds<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:48.870> I

then I love the corner and just wait for
two<00:01:31.619> becomes<00:01:32.009> stable<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.549> that's<00:01:33.299> about<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
two becomes stable one that's about it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.030 
two becomes stable one that's about it
as<00:01:34.530> much<00:01:34.619> water's<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.310> want<00:01:39.439> another<00:01:40.439> place<00:01:40.860> I

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
as much water's you want another place I

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.069 
as much water's you want another place I
put<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> knife<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.000> water<00:01:42.240> source<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:43.020> I

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
put a knife in a water source that I

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.139 
put a knife in a water source that I
think<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.340> bad<00:01:44.579> idea<00:01:44.610> is<00:01:46.850> close<00:01:47.850> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
think is a not a bad idea is close to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.060 
think is a not a bad idea is close to
where<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.450> go<00:01:48.600> mining<00:01:49.729> so<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:52.070> you'll

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
where you go mining so that you'll

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.179 
where you go mining so that you'll
always<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.640> able<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.880> extinguish<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:55.530> fire<00:01:55.799> if

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
always be able to extinguish the fire if

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.899 
always be able to extinguish the fire if
you're<00:01:56.460> ever<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.390> cotton<00:01:58.320> lava

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
you're ever a cotton lava

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.969 
you're ever a cotton lava

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
happens pretty often for me anyway I'm a

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.449 
happens pretty often for me anyway I'm a
good<00:02:06.569> reason<00:02:07.569> to<00:02:07.689> have<00:02:07.860> buckets<00:02:08.860> waters<00:02:09.280> if

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459

you<00:02:09.640> want<00:02:09.849> to<00:02:09.970> in<00:02:10.060> line<00:02:10.739> sitting<00:02:11.739> because

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
you want to in line sitting because

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.940 
you want to in line sitting because
