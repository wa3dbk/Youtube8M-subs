00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
there's my first breath of air seatbelts

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.870 
there's my first breath of air seatbelts
and<00:01:18.770> parachute<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.950> was<00:01:20.130> either<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.400> taking

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and parachute I was either just taking

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.789 
and parachute I was either just taking
them<00:01:20.970> off<00:01:21.090> just<00:01:21.390> taking<00:01:22.320> them<00:01:22.439> off<00:01:22.560> right

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
them off just taking them off right

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.969 
them off just taking them off right
there<00:01:23.040> that's<00:01:23.250> why<00:01:23.460> I'm<00:01:23.580> not<00:01:23.729> out<00:01:23.909> already<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
there that's why I'm not out already and

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.070 
there that's why I'm not out already and
then<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> saw<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.340> flames<00:01:26.700> coming<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.720> I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
then I saw the flames coming up and I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.230 
then I saw the flames coming up and I
decided<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.220> wasn't<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> wait<00:01:30.030> for

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
decided that I wasn't going to wait for

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.810 
decided that I wasn't going to wait for
this<00:01:30.329> thing<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.600> stop<00:01:30.930> or<00:01:31.380> anything<00:01:31.590> if<00:01:31.890> I<00:01:32.100> was

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
this thing to stop or anything if I was

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.819 
this thing to stop or anything if I was
clearly<00:01:33.390> playing<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.810> was<00:01:33.960> getting<00:01:34.229> out<00:01:34.320> now

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
clearly playing I was getting out now

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.570 
clearly playing I was getting out now
and<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.310> exactly<00:01:35.670> what<00:01:35.970> I'm<00:01:36.090> doing

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
and that's exactly what I'm doing

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.370 
and that's exactly what I'm doing
climbing<00:01:36.880> out<00:01:36.970> of<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.120> top<00:01:37.360> fifth<00:01:37.630> get<00:01:38.110> away

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
climbing out of the top fifth get away

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.920 
climbing out of the top fifth get away
from<00:01:38.560> the<00:01:38.680> sucker<00:01:38.920> now<00:01:39.420> slow<00:01:40.420> enough<00:01:40.660> for<00:01:40.840> me

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
from the sucker now slow enough for me

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.450 
from the sucker now slow enough for me
to<00:01:41.020> jump<00:01:41.260> went<00:01:41.500> off<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:41.740> front<00:01:42.010> because<00:01:42.220> I<00:01:42.280> can

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
to jump went off the front because I can

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.010 
to jump went off the front because I can
control<00:01:42.850> my<00:01:43.830> my<00:01:44.830> fall<00:01:45.100> better<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:45.790> I<00:01:45.880> knew<00:01:46.060> it

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
control my my fall better and I knew it

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.540 
control my my fall better and I knew it
was<00:01:47.140> about<00:01:47.260> stopping<00:01:47.890> you<00:01:47.980> notice<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:48.430> only
