00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.350
 little bit difficult what are we just before 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.120

 the olympiakos 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.850
 and so that can be a little bit of noise around us setting up 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.400
 badly barred by the eponymous team m 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.510

 be careful what they eat yes I hope 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.650
 the farce in France 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.810
 this case 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 down 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.730
 but the scene 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.470

 this theatrical technique drc nearly 30% 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.579
 according to how in attack 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:04.609
