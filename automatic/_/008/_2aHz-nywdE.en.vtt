00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.890
 motorola hit the bike gently 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.080
 able to make it one of the devices 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.599
 favorite of Brazilians 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.150
 now she tries to repeat the feat with the 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.029
 bike and a simpler version of your 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.879
 brother and wants to be the first 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.620
 smartphone of many people 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.699
 the bike looks and follows the same pattern 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.800
 motorcycle g 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.320
 the main difference is the two bars 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.690
 to hide the microphone and 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.820
 speakers have the objective of 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.960
 protect the device from spillage 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.090
 Water 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.309
 the rear plastic housing can be 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.469
 changed by another one of different colors 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.489
 already the textured rubberized format 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.829
 curved shape of the device facilitates a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.600
 the motorcycle and has a very robust appearance 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.010
 important quality for any 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.520
 smartphone 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.979
 the screen is 4.3 inches and uses the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.020
 gorilla glass 3 technology that makes 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.860
 very resistant device to risk 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.259
 accidents 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.690
 a lower resolution than the bike but g 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.800
 sufficient to ensure images with good 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.259
 definition 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.280
 however the image is not free of 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.200
 problems 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.270
 the panel does not display a 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.280
 very high brightness which impairs a 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.590
 the screen in very bright surroundings. 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.660
 and colors tend to say fan a 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.520
 little at the time of the scroll effect 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.479
 fortunately does not hinder the use of 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.759
 appliance 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.530
 the screen glass also seems to be more 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.569
 thinner than other models 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.440
 just press the screen a little to 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:47.380
 see the dispersion of the motorcycle 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.239
 has 4 GB of storage 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.890
 although the company does not carry the 

00:01:49.239 --> 00:01:53.020
 interface with extra features or 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.090
 space-saving applications 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.270
 for installing applications 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.190
 the SD card slot helps because it can 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.080
 be used for recording photos and 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:04.289
 but not for installation of 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.289
 Software 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.720
 the android kitkat installed in the engine is 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.810
 pure and unmodified 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.820
 this brings positives and negatives of the 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.810
 good side is the speed at which the system 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.850
 wheel 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.370
 everything is very light and switch between 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.740
 programs almost always fast 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.780
 On the other hand, there are 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.000
 present in other 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.920
 interfaces but unfortunately can 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.760
 be made through the installation of 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:35.070
 lausitz among the few applications 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.810
 motorola is the motorola alert one 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.910
 system that can send messages to 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.440
 your contacts if you find yourself 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.720
 in danger 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.640
 there is also a practical tool for 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.870
 Immigration that helps you pass the 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.700
 data from your old device to the new 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.010
 the bike's hardware and is relatively 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.880
 modest but he can handle the 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.220
 message 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.470
 most current games and apps 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.350
 can run without much trouble 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.270
 games like injustice or racing 3 can 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.550
 lightly choking for some 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:09.060
 moments but overall the experience 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:11.400
 satisfactory simpler programs such as 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.590
 facebook or even zap run without any 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.250
 difficulty and switching between them is 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.350
 fast 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.220
 even though the phone has only 1 gb of 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.920
 memory 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.890
 of course there is much to the same 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.830
 time can make the system heavier 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.570
 but still bike and do well to 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.209
 battery also has a good 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.739
 performance during the tests we use 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:34.590
 the device normally for the tasks 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.470
 most common over several days 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.769
 it is normal to arrive at night to have more than 30% 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.810
 of energy left over 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:44.820
 the bike and has support for two chips 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:47.790
 Yes, but what attracts attention is the 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.769
 feature called smart every time 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.140
 Are you going to make a call to the appliance? 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.350
 automatically identifies the most 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.090
 suitable for connection 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.400
 the digital TV receiver including the 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.989
 device is very interesting and the only 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.570
 which leaves a little to be desired and 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:05.010
 antenna and needs to be connected to the 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.799
 for headphones 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.420
 Nevertheless, the signal reception is very 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.549
 good 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.370
 the radio uses the headphones as 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.500
 antenna the application is very intuitive and 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.269
 does an automatic search by radios 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:23.280
 saving everything in memory 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.900
 to facilitate tuning later a 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.909
 act and has no front camera and 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.610
 rear of its most basic resources 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:30.300
 with 5 megapixels resolution and without 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.490
 flash 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.479
 she can break a branch but nothing 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.460
 Besides that 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.440
 focus is fixed and the photos come out 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.270
 graduation in environments with 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.979
 less light 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.199
 low-definition video recording 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.330
 and the system does not have a good 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.330
 image stabilizer but it works 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:55.800
 repeat the success of motogp a task 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.169
 difficult but the bike and affords 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.720
 at least get near the hardware 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.180
 modest but the system and take what yields 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.860
 a fast and efficient device even in 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.590
 low cost cell phone 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.630
 the model with tv is an excellent request 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.849
 for those who spend a lot of time in the 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.430
 street or queuing and the intelligent system 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.789
 selection of telephone lines is a 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.440
 both for facilitating life and for 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.659
 of course the model has some points 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.919
 negative as the camera if you like 

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.599
 lots of photos 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.780
 it might be best to look for a model one 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.940
 little better overall motorola 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.460
 managed to create a very good smartphone 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:34.050
 and at a very affordable price 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.610
 I think you should find strong 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.740
 market competitors 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.810
 one of them is motogp itself 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.139
 presents better results for a 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.419
 a small price difference in this way 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:46.259
 the tv were not important differential 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.880
 for you 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.580
 maybe it's better to save a little 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:53.190
 more and stay with an actor g 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.330
 complete analysis of the world and 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.330
 until the next video
