 make out and maybe there but lurking 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.260
 something else that shows up 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.899
 at least now in this current one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.809
 filming but first briefly to the content 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.059
 What 's Katy 's about?

 played by josh duhamel in him 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.420
 Of course she falls in love very fast 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.280
 this is like a rosamunde pilcher 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.280
 filming you look in the eyes 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.560
 and the audience knows right there 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.170
 something else happens in the course of the action 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.570
 she works there in this little job 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.810
 coastal resort as a waitress makes friends 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.549

 Children is a single parent and his 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.240
 woman died 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.659
 and then there is a mysterious one 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.310
 Katy always speaks well to Katy 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.829
 this relationship and we do not know 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.079
 where this mysterious woman comes from and am 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.680
 At the end of the film we learn where to go 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.079
 Woman will not go anymore 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.750
 interesting in the film and at all 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.310
 niklas parks filming is that the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.460
 Figures always from their past 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.320
 be caught up and shows sparks 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.820
 actually how to get away from the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.460
 can liberate the past yes how to 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.649
 she is getting rid of in the niklas 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.939
 filming the lucky one there had the 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:05.520
 former husband had to die with it 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.259
 start a new relationship at all 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.399
 can and must be here too 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.109
 a past 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.400
 this repels a new happiness 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.439
 can arise 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.480
 in all these postcards pictures the 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:20.019
 as always with a hold class 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.209
 Frosting covers so he is as 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.030
 Swedish director is really 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.920
 he succeeded the American 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.340
 dream par excellence on the glue bank too 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.109
 bring 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.900
 with all this frosting expresses itself there 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.370
 but in a scene something completely different 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.730
 through and over it is worth it too 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.730
 speak 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.440
 the exciting thing about nicholas sparks 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.390
 filming is that she is always very 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.890
 symbolically charged there is 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.410
 a letter that there is any 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.739
 sign anything is there always the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.440
 goes beyond the actual scene 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.950
 and so it is in the following scenes 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.510
 katie becomes full after she gets 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.019
 found a job as a waitress 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.069
 a wooden house in the forest the ground the 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.920
 hardwood floors that should urgently 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.560
 be renovated and she goes about it and 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.540
 then breaks immediately a hole 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.739
 arises and that is somehow 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.349
 sign that something 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.000
 could possibly threaten disaster 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.220
 but then the following happens 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.870
 of course befriends you with alex 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.940
 come closer and he visits her 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.560
 then sometime in her wooden house 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.230
 you realize immediately that they have a certain 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.630
 Fear of men par excellence 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.849
 and they are getting closer and closer and 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.849
 just before they want to kiss because 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.170
 Alex enters just this hole falls there 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.400
 He went in there in this little hole and 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.680
 of course I thought the same 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.600
 is a symbol of the what 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.850
 it can not be that other thing 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.500
 what will follow so the following 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.750
 penetration is already here 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.609
 symbolically anticipated then I have 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.459
 but maybe this is just one 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.900
 obscene fantasy but then some 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.090
 minutes later in the movie happens 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.799
 The following are on again 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.500
 the wooden house they still sit together 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:07.019
 in the car and then suddenly katie says 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.590
 By the way, Alex, I was able to punch that hole 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:12.209
 mend and alexa interesting and 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.739
 then she says yes you are it to you 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.139
 maybe take a look 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.359
 he says yes and then they go 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.299
 pure and of course they sleep 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.400
 with each other what happened here 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.979
 We may not be such a scene 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.340
 from a commercial porn film 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:31.410
 this banal dialogue then the sex act 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.450
 leads to is simply an error 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:36.590
 subvert or mean this scene 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.590
 maybe much more 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.390
 safe haven is a real one 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.520
 scrape a dental look 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.710
 how could it be so 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.660
 come to such pornographic dialogue 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.980
 we should get another kitsch 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.960
 view the phenomenon 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.150
 heino nothing against heino that he 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.040
 currently the German pop and rock music 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.750
 then brings back where it belongs 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.490
 namely to the greedy blessed Stammtisch 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.290
 That's just too good to keep 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.840
 but let us look at his most famous 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.910
 song to the song of the gentian blue blue 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.730
 the gentian blooms and we hear that 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.860
 heino with the swiss made in the 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.850
 first hut has sat in together 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.950
 the second one will 

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.930
 there we ate together in the 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.390
 third hut I kissed her 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:22.910
 nobody knows what happened then 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.980
 but then we learn exactly what 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:27.320
 then happen, that is, begin 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.280
 treacherous stroke and heino 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.280
 sent 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.790
 then we know what happened and 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.220
 At the same time, we are at the heart of 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.460
 kitsch reached because the problematic 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.250
 Kitsch is not that he gives us one 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.180
 harmless cure world pretended 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:50.510
 The problem with the kitsch is actually 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.050
 that he can be so beautiful yes that he 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.640
 Obscene is fundamental and it should 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.320
 not to be surprised that 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.240
 just the kitsch artist par 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.760
 excellence chefcoach one 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.550
 porn actress married and this in 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.840
 scene put art market like audience and 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.590
 also the art criticism were immediate 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.510
 excited 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.880
 that shows how much kisses and 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:14.060
 alike pornography is ours 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.310
 Society is kitsch and pornography 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.140
 These are brothers and sisters they go 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.420
 an unholy alliance 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:23.110
 they belong together like bad luck and 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:26.600
 sulfur and that will be in this scene 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:28.160
 the outright provided in the film 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.990
 seems to have come 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.150
 in hallasse clearly leave this 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.620
 scene with the hole that makes us 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.510
 really see because otherwise it is with 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.190
 let hallströms film but rather so and 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:41.470
 filmed at nicholas sparks anyway 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:41.470
 you look but you do not see
