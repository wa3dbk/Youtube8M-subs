stud<00:04:29.220> and<00:04:29.490> then<00:04:30.060> a<00:04:30.360> stud<00:04:30.750> with<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:30.990> smooth<00:04:31.740> top

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
stud and then a stud with a smooth top

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.750 
stud and then a stud with a smooth top
and<00:04:32.670> you<00:04:33.600> stick<00:04:34.020> it<00:04:34.050> into<00:04:34.490> little<00:04:37.310> gap<00:04:38.310> that

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
and you stick it into little gap that

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.360 
and you stick it into little gap that
the<00:04:39.060> two<00:04:39.450> inclined<00:04:40.200> piece<00:04:40.560> is<00:04:40.800> made<00:04:43.250> so<00:04:44.250> it

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
the two inclined piece is made so it

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.310 
the two inclined piece is made so it
looks<00:04:44.580> like<00:04:44.750> this<00:04:45.750> oh<00:04:47.510> I'm<00:04:48.510> so<00:04:48.780> sorry<00:04:48.810> I<00:04:49.140> did

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
looks like this oh I'm so sorry I did

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:58.700 
looks like this oh I'm so sorry I did
this<00:04:49.350> wrong

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.600 

it<00:04:59.710> should<00:05:00.069> be<00:05:00.310> like<00:05:00.610> on<00:05:01.509> the<00:05:02.139> bottom<00:05:02.590> here<00:05:03.370> the

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
it should be like on the bottom here the

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.540 
it should be like on the bottom here the
that's<00:05:04.509> where<00:05:04.690> the<00:05:04.780> actual<00:05:04.930> like<00:05:05.410> square<00:05:06.220> part

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
that's where the actual like square part

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.180 
that's where the actual like square part
is<00:05:06.789> then<00:05:07.630> you<00:05:07.750> get<00:05:07.930> one<00:05:08.199> of<00:05:08.319> these<00:05:08.560> flat<00:05:09.160> tiles

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
is then you get one of these flat tiles

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.070 
is then you get one of these flat tiles
put<00:05:12.190> it<00:05:12.280> diagonally<00:05:13.000> like<00:05:13.150> that<00:05:13.419> and<00:05:13.750> then<00:05:13.960> you

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
put it diagonally like that and then you

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:23.029 
put it diagonally like that and then you
gotta<00:05:14.289> have<00:05:14.410> one<00:05:14.560> of<00:05:14.620> these<00:05:14.860> like<00:05:21.599> excuse<00:05:22.599> me

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
right there then you just attach it to

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.600 
right there then you just attach it to
the<00:05:29.940> front<00:05:30.940> like<00:05:31.539> that<00:05:32.169> and<00:05:33.070> now<00:05:33.160> for<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.400> back

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
the front like that and now for the back

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.520 
the front like that and now for the back
part<00:05:33.910> this<00:05:34.090> was<00:05:34.300> what<00:05:34.479> I<00:05:34.509> found<00:05:34.780> most<00:05:35.080> tricky

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
part this was what I found most tricky

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.810 
part this was what I found most tricky
cuz<00:05:36.250> in<00:05:36.520> um<00:05:37.259> skulblaka<00:05:38.259> six<00:05:38.680> six<00:05:38.919> six<00:05:39.099> fours

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
cuz in um skulblaka six six six fours

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.510 
cuz in um skulblaka six six six fours
video<00:05:40.330> it<00:05:40.840> was<00:05:41.020> kind<00:05:41.470> of<00:05:41.560> confusing<00:05:42.039> looking

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
video it was kind of confusing looking

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.790 
video it was kind of confusing looking
so<00:05:42.669> I'm<00:05:42.759> just<00:05:42.940> making<00:05:43.300> hit<00:05:43.509> his<00:05:44.199> version<00:05:44.500> of

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
so I'm just making hit his version of

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.810 
so I'm just making hit his version of
the<00:05:44.889> Mongoose<00:05:45.310> just<00:05:45.669> easier<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.210> tell<00:05:46.570> so<00:05:47.820> the

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
the Mongoose just easier to tell so the

00:05:48.820 --> 00:06:01.800 
the Mongoose just easier to tell so the
back<00:05:49.800> you<00:05:50.800> get<00:05:57.449> one<00:05:58.449> of<00:05:58.570> these<00:06:00.479> get<00:06:01.479> one<00:06:01.659> of

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
back you get one of these get one of

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:09.390 
back you get one of these get one of
those<00:06:02.639> then<00:06:03.639> you<00:06:03.880> get<00:06:04.180> the<00:06:07.710> this<00:06:08.710> piece<00:06:08.979> from

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
those then you get the this piece from

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.249 
those then you get the this piece from
this<00:06:09.909> piece<00:06:10.180> from<00:06:10.360> earlier<00:06:10.750> and<00:06:10.990> put<00:06:11.110> it<00:06:11.229> right

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:11.259 
this piece from earlier and put it right

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.260 
this piece from earlier and put it right
there<00:06:11.580> then<00:06:12.580> you<00:06:12.699> grab<00:06:12.969> a<00:06:13.300> flat<00:06:14.050> like<00:06:15.270> tile

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
there then you grab a flat like tile

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.430 
there then you grab a flat like tile
piece<00:06:17.039> and<00:06:18.039> a<00:06:18.159> tap<00:06:18.430> for<00:06:19.120> I<00:06:19.300> can<00:06:19.750> fit<00:06:19.930> four<00:06:20.169> studs

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:20.440 
piece and a tap for I can fit four studs

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.219 
piece and a tap for I can fit four studs
on<00:06:20.650> it<00:06:20.680> and<00:06:21.250> you<00:06:21.400> put<00:06:21.430> a<00:06:21.909> glowing<00:06:22.719> red<00:06:22.930> stud

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
on it and you put a glowing red stud

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:25.499 
on it and you put a glowing red stud
here<00:06:23.620> at<00:06:23.770> a<00:06:23.830> glowing<00:06:24.130> red<00:06:24.310> stud<00:06:24.580> their<00:06:24.820> head

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:25.509 
here at a glowing red stud their head

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:34.110 
here at a glowing red stud their head
you<00:06:25.659> attach<00:06:26.050> it<00:06:26.080> right<00:06:28.740> there<00:06:31.590> and<00:06:32.940> then<00:06:33.940> you

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
you attach it right there and then you

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.439 
you attach it right there and then you
just<00:06:34.270> arch<00:06:34.509> it<00:06:34.690> down<00:06:34.900> a<00:06:34.930> little<00:06:35.289> bit<00:06:35.560> and<00:06:36.449> you

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449 
just arch it down a little bit and you

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:40.830 
just arch it down a little bit and you
then<00:06:38.139> get<00:06:38.860> one<00:06:39.099> of<00:06:39.280> these<00:06:39.849> and<00:06:40.360> attach<00:06:40.630> two

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
then get one of these and attach two

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:50.719 
then get one of these and attach two
tiles<00:06:41.139> right<00:06:41.500> there<00:06:43.770> and<00:06:48.300> attach<00:06:49.300> it<00:06:49.330> like<00:06:49.570> so

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:50.729 
tiles right there and attach it like so

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:55.680 
tiles right there and attach it like so
so<00:06:51.729> it<00:06:51.789> looks<00:06:51.820> like<00:06:52.060> this<00:06:53.699> and<00:06:54.699> then<00:06:55.360> you<00:06:55.479> just

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
so it looks like this and then you just

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:01.159 
so it looks like this and then you just
stick<00:06:56.530> it<00:06:56.710> on<00:06:56.949> to<00:06:57.599> the<00:06:58.599> back<00:06:58.810> of<00:06:59.050> the<00:06:59.500> mongoose

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:01.169 
stick it on to the back of the mongoose

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:04.500 
stick it on to the back of the mongoose
so<00:07:02.169> I<00:07:02.710> think<00:07:02.949> this<00:07:03.250> is<00:07:03.339> a<00:07:03.400> fairly<00:07:03.699> good<00:07:04.000> this<00:07:04.389> is

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 
so I think this is a fairly good this is

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.920 
so I think this is a fairly good this is
actually<00:07:04.810> a<00:07:04.870> very<00:07:05.110> good<00:07:05.320> Mongoose<00:07:05.919> I<00:07:06.690> prefer

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
actually a very good Mongoose I prefer

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.960 
actually a very good Mongoose I prefer
this<00:07:08.139> Mongoose<00:07:08.590> over<00:07:08.949> the<00:07:09.070> other<00:07:10.050> 20<00:07:11.050> I<00:07:11.080> found
