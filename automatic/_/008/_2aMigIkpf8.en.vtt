low<00:00:49.620> profile<00:00:50.010> no<00:00:50.190> dangerous<00:00:50.789> also<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.780> these

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
low profile no dangerous also with these

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.720 
low profile no dangerous also with these
with<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.379> carbon<00:00:52.620> fiber<00:00:52.860> four<00:00:53.070> days<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.370> 400

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
with the carbon fiber four days in 400

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.060 
with the carbon fiber four days in 400
PS<00:00:53.879> eyes<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.960> standard<00:00:55.530> they<00:00:55.620> come<00:00:55.829> at<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
PS eyes and a standard they come at the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.369 
PS eyes and a standard they come at the
high<00:00:56.250> output<00:00:56.489> pressure<00:00:56.910> which<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.270> 650<00:00:58.109> nope

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
high output pressure which is 650 nope

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.119 
high output pressure which is 650 nope
50<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.719> policies<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.620> can<00:01:01.770> fit<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
50 and policies and then we can fit the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.560 
50 and policies and then we can fit the
other<00:01:02.250> kits<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.730> these<00:01:02.879> as<00:01:03.000> well<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:03.420> got

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
other kits to these as well so we got

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.329 
other kits to these as well so we got
high<00:01:03.719> pressure<00:01:03.989> medium<00:01:04.799> pressure<00:01:05.070> low

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
high pressure medium pressure low

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.100 
high pressure medium pressure low
pressure<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.760> extra<00:01:06.360> low<00:01:06.450> pressure<00:01:06.689> so

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
pressure and extra low pressure so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.929 
pressure and extra low pressure so
obviously<00:01:07.439> they<00:01:07.590> go<00:01:07.710> down<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.790> you've<00:01:08.909> got

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
obviously they go down so you've got

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.010 
obviously they go down so you've got
your<00:01:09.030> 856<00:01:09.979> 5415<00:01:10.979> 258<00:01:11.640> put<00:01:11.850> pressures<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.420> so

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
your 856 5415 258 put pressures and so

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.230 
your 856 5415 258 put pressures and so
you<00:01:13.080> know<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.470> get<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.920> option<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.640> have

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you know you get that option to have

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.880 
you know you get that option to have
fitted<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.869> suit<00:01:16.049> your<00:01:16.170> marker<00:01:16.500> basically

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
fitted to suit your marker basically

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.050 
fitted to suit your marker basically
when<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.070> fit<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.460> free<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.939> charge

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
when you fit it free of charge

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.780 
when you fit it free of charge
absolutely<00:01:18.659> yeah<00:01:19.560> good<00:01:19.830> luck<00:01:19.860> yeah<00:01:20.460> we<00:01:20.670> are
