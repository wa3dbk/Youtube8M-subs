125<00:01:50.650> grams<00:01:51.070> a<00:01:51.720> hundred<00:01:52.720> grams<00:01:52.960> of<00:01:53.230> light<00:01:53.410> brown

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
125 grams a hundred grams of light brown

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.050 
125 grams a hundred grams of light brown
sugar<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.960> we<00:01:55.990> have<00:01:56.260> butter<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:57.070> sugar<00:01:57.880> and

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
sugar so we have butter and sugar and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.090 
sugar so we have butter and sugar and
then<00:01:58.150> you<00:01:58.210> put<00:01:58.330> that<00:01:58.570> in<00:01:58.720> there<00:01:59.110> stir<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.070> I

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
then you put that in there stir it I

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.680 
then you put that in there stir it I
guess<00:02:00.340> so<00:02:00.910> this<00:02:01.060> is<00:02:01.240> what<00:02:01.390> it<00:02:01.480> should<00:02:01.630> look

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
guess so this is what it should look

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.440 
guess so this is what it should look
like<00:02:02.310> when<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.520> butter<00:02:03.730> and<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.030> sugars<00:02:04.360> all

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
like when the butter and the sugars all

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.990 
like when the butter and the sugars all
creamed<00:02:04.690> together<00:02:04.870> so<00:02:05.620> set<00:02:06.250> for<00:02:06.460> a<00:02:06.490> boil<00:02:06.700> one

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
creamed together so set for a boil one

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.770 
creamed together so set for a boil one
egg<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:08.140> lightly<00:02:08.770> beat<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:10.270> egg<00:02:10.540> up<00:02:10.750> I<00:02:12.780> don't
