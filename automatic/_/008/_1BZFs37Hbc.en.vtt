00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.539 

no<00:01:47.990> ground<00:01:48.409> fighting<00:01:48.679> they<00:01:48.950> don't<00:01:49.100> want<00:01:49.340> to<00:01:49.429> go

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549

to<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.789> ground<00:01:50.030> they're<00:01:50.209> probably<00:01:50.659> rightly

00:01:50.949 --> 00:01:50.959 
to the ground they're probably rightly

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:54.039 
to the ground they're probably rightly
so<00:01:51.520> often<00:01:52.520> rather<00:01:52.789> than<00:01:52.970> use<00:01:53.149> that<00:01:53.360> foot<00:01:53.659> has

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
so often rather than use that foot has

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.620 
so often rather than use that foot has
they've<00:01:54.200> been<00:01:54.380> using<00:01:54.560> hands<00:01:55.179> during<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.360> sand

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
they've been using hands during the sand

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.999 
they've been using hands during the sand
in<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.810> game<00:01:57.049> but<00:01:57.229> when<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.470> other<00:01:57.590> guy<00:01:57.799> goes

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
in the game but when the other guy goes

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.350 
in the game but when the other guy goes
to<00:01:58.069> the<00:01:58.220> ground<00:01:58.549> they<00:01:58.700> carry<00:01:58.909> on<00:01:59.119> with<00:01:59.270> their

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
to the ground they carry on with their

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.789 
to the ground they carry on with their
hands<00:01:59.690> so<00:01:59.840> they're<00:01:59.990> just<00:02:00.110> sort<00:02:00.440> of<00:02:00.530> stuck<00:02:00.770> in

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
hands so they're just sort of stuck in

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:02.710 
hands so they're just sort of stuck in
that<00:02:01.069> cycle<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.060> what<00:02:02.209> they'll<00:02:02.360> do<00:02:02.509> is

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
that cycle so what they'll do is

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.699 
that cycle so what they'll do is
sometimes<00:02:02.959> bend<00:02:03.379> forward<00:02:03.879> punch<00:02:04.879> like<00:02:05.119> this

00:02:05.699 --> 00:02:05.709 
sometimes bend forward punch like this

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:11.290 
sometimes bend forward punch like this

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.459 
either
bending<00:03:41.879> over<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.420> punching<00:03:42.900> me<00:03:42.989> like<00:03:43.170> we<00:03:43.349> did

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:43.469 
bending over and punching me like we did

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.429 
bending over and punching me like we did
before<00:03:43.590> or<00:03:44.280> 40<00:03:44.549> stars<00:03:44.790> came<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.180> me<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.389> it<00:03:46.260> was

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:46.439 
before or 40 stars came to me so it was

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:49.670 
before or 40 stars came to me so it was
like<00:03:47.000> just<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.209> split<00:03:48.540> second<00:03:48.900> time<00:03:49.200> we<00:03:49.379> looking

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
like just a split second time we looking

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.360 
like just a split second time we looking
at<00:03:49.769> here<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.519> we<00:03:50.670> need

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.750 

probability<00:03:54.370> of<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.900> so<00:03:55.900> instead<00:03:56.170> of

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
probability of that so instead of

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.020 
probability of that so instead of
solving<00:03:57.760> through<00:03:58.290> we're<00:03:59.290> gonna<00:03:59.470> sweep<00:04:00.160> in

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
solving through we're gonna sweep in

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.660 
solving through we're gonna sweep in
like<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:01.690> is<00:04:02.200> essentially<00:04:02.770> a<00:04:02.800> type<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.340> kicker

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
like this is essentially a type a kicker

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.230 
like this is essentially a type a kicker

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
with power this hand is going to have to

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.830 
with power this hand is going to have to
cut<00:04:14.950> off<00:04:15.130> so<00:04:15.610> that<00:04:15.760> I<00:04:15.790> can<00:04:16.000> get<00:04:16.150> my<00:04:16.360> body<00:04:16.570> weight

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
cut off so that I can get my body weight
