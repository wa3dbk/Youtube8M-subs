time which will save energy and make it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.190 
time which will save energy and make it
a<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:05.490> bit<00:02:05.670> quieter<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.240> also<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> really

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
bottom here you can see that it does say

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.690

which is actually false it always says

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.160 
which is actually false it always says

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
storage space a little bit annoying but

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.330 
storage space a little bit annoying but
I<00:02:47.440> don't<00:02:47.620> really<00:02:47.740> know<00:02:47.950> what<00:02:48.100> can<00:02:48.220> be<00:02:48.250> done

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
I don't really know what can be done

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.670 
I don't really know what can be done
about<00:02:48.490> that<00:02:48.730> like<00:02:49.480> I<00:02:49.630> said<00:02:49.840> earlier<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.410> main

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
about that like I said earlier the main

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.410 
about that like I said earlier the main
feature<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.130> the<00:02:51.430> Drobo<00:02:51.670> is<00:02:51.970> that<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.270> can

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
feature of the Drobo is that it can

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.450 
feature of the Drobo is that it can
withstand<00:02:52.660> Drive<00:02:53.230> failures<00:02:53.680> without<00:02:53.890> losing

hard<00:03:07.210> drive<00:03:07.420> fails<00:03:07.690> that's<00:03:07.960> it<00:03:08.200> you've<00:03:08.350> lost

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
hard drive fails that's it you've lost

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.170 
hard drive fails that's it you've lost
it<00:03:08.770> all<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.100> that's<00:03:09.190> where<00:03:09.460> the<00:03:09.550> Drobo<00:03:09.790> comes

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
it all so that's where the Drobo comes

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.000 
it all so that's where the Drobo comes
in<00:03:10.360> as<00:03:10.510> you<00:03:10.750> can<00:03:10.870> see<00:03:11.050> I<00:03:11.080> just<00:03:11.230> ripped<00:03:11.710> one<00:03:11.920> of

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
in as you can see I just ripped one of

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.470 
in as you can see I just ripped one of
the<00:03:12.070> drives<00:03:12.340> out<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.610> simulate<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.180> drive

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
the drives out to simulate a drive

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.780 
the drives out to simulate a drive
failure<00:03:13.930> now<00:03:14.470> even<00:03:14.740> though<00:03:14.980> that<00:03:15.160> drive<00:03:15.490> did

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
failure now even though that drive did

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.030 
failure now even though that drive did
have<00:03:15.970> some<00:03:16.210> data<00:03:16.450> on<00:03:16.720> it<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.530> completely

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
have some data on it it is completely

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.160 
have some data on it it is completely
fine<00:03:18.460> all<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.850> other<00:03:19.150> drives<00:03:19.480> are<00:03:19.720> rebuilding

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
fine all the other drives are rebuilding

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.900 
fine all the other drives are rebuilding
they<00:03:20.530> are<00:03:20.620> flashing<00:03:21.130> green<00:03:21.310> and<00:03:21.520> yellow<00:03:21.790> and

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
they are flashing green and yellow and

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.180 
they are flashing green and yellow and
you<00:03:22.330> can<00:03:22.510> look<00:03:22.660> at<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.960> inside<00:03:23.470> panel<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:24.010> see

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
you can look at the inside panel to see

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.560 
you can look at the inside panel to see
what<00:03:24.340> all<00:03:24.460> the<00:03:24.490> lights<00:03:24.820> mean<00:03:25.090> if<00:03:25.300> you<00:03:25.450> are

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
what all the lights mean if you are

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.080 
what all the lights mean if you are
unsure<00:03:25.810> but<00:03:26.800> basically<00:03:27.250> it'll<00:03:27.790> start

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
unsure but basically it'll start

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.450 
unsure but basically it'll start
rebuilding<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.780> entire<00:03:29.200> system<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:29.980> it<00:03:30.310> will

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
rebuilding the entire system and it will

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.790 
rebuilding the entire system and it will
be<00:03:30.610> able<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:31.060> hold<00:03:31.360> all<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:31.810> files<00:03:32.080> on<00:03:32.410> just

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
be able to hold all the files on just

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.190 
be able to hold all the files on just
those<00:03:33.010> remaining<00:03:33.550> hard<00:03:33.910> drives<00:03:34.210> now<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:35.080> is

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
those remaining hard drives now it is

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.900 
those remaining hard drives now it is
not<00:03:35.410> asking<00:03:35.950> me<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.130> put<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> new<00:03:36.700> one<00:03:36.850> in

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
not asking me to put a new one in

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.000 
not asking me to put a new one in
because<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.480> have<00:03:37.810> enough<00:03:38.020> storage<00:03:38.290> space<00:03:38.530> to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
because I have enough storage space to

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.100 
because I have enough storage space to
just<00:03:39.190> keep<00:03:39.400> it<00:03:39.550> on<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.790> remaining<00:03:40.090> 4<00:03:40.510> however

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
just keep it on the remaining 4 however

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.410 
just keep it on the remaining 4 however
if<00:03:41.530> you<00:03:41.650> have<00:03:41.800> less<00:03:42.070> hard<00:03:42.370> drives<00:03:42.640> or<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:42.940> really

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
if you have less hard drives or a really

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.440 
if you have less hard drives or a really
full<00:03:43.870> inventory<00:03:44.650> of<00:03:44.860> files<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.550> will<00:03:45.880> ask<00:03:46.090> you

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
full inventory of files it will ask you

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.570 
full inventory of files it will ask you
using<00:03:46.990> that<00:03:47.020> light<00:03:47.410> that<00:03:47.710> is<00:03:47.860> now<00:03:48.130> in<00:03:48.400> that

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
using that light that is now in that

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.430 
using that light that is now in that
empty<00:03:48.760> slot<00:03:49.240> it<00:03:49.510> will<00:03:49.810> ask<00:03:49.990> you<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.200> put

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
empty slot it will ask you to put

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.080 
empty slot it will ask you to put
another<00:03:50.770> Drive<00:03:51.100> in<00:03:51.280> there<00:03:51.460> if<00:03:51.670> you've<00:03:51.910> ever

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
another Drive in there if you've ever

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.970 
another Drive in there if you've ever
experienced<00:03:52.810> the<00:03:52.900> drive<00:03:53.110> failure<00:03:53.440> before<00:03:53.620> and

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
experienced the drive failure before and

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.800 
experienced the drive failure before and
lost<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.400> lot<00:03:54.550> of<00:03:54.670> information<00:03:55.240> you<00:03:55.480> know<00:03:55.630> that

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
lost a lot of information you know that

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.470 
lost a lot of information you know that
it<00:03:55.960> really<00:03:56.290> sucks<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:57.340> 5d<00:03:57.820> makes<00:03:58.090> it<00:03:58.270> really

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
it really sucks the 5d makes it really

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.570 
it really sucks the 5d makes it really
easy<00:03:58.630> to<00:03:59.020> handle<00:03:59.350> files<00:03:59.650> you<00:04:00.010> never<00:04:00.220> have<00:04:00.430> to

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
easy to handle files you never have to

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.250 
easy to handle files you never have to
worry<00:04:00.790> about<00:04:00.940> losing<00:04:01.330> anything<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:02.140> it

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
worry about losing anything and it

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.350 
worry about losing anything and it
really<00:04:02.560> makes<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.220> lot<00:04:03.250> safer<00:04:03.790> to<00:04:04.090> store

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360

Drobo<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.490> definitely<00:05:06.120> worth<00:05:06.240> buying<00:05:06.569> is

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
Drobo is definitely worth buying is

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.870 
Drobo is definitely worth buying is
because<00:05:07.380> you<00:05:07.560> can<00:05:07.740> upgrade<00:05:07.979> it<00:05:08.250> at<00:05:08.520> any<00:05:08.759> time

because you can upgrade it at any time

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.969 
because you can upgrade it at any time
let's<00:05:09.750> say<00:05:09.960> when<00:05:10.110> you<00:05:10.199> first<00:05:10.440> buy<00:05:10.620> it<00:05:10.680> you

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
let's say when you first buy it you

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:13.610 
let's say when you first buy it you
throw<00:05:11.250> two<00:05:11.340> 500<00:05:12.330> gig<00:05:12.449> hard<00:05:12.479> drives<00:05:12.960> in<00:05:13.199> when

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:13.620 
throw two 500 gig hard drives in when

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.350 
throw two 500 gig hard drives in when
you<00:05:13.740> run<00:05:13.889> out<00:05:13.919> of<00:05:14.069> storage<00:05:14.430> space<00:05:14.759> on<00:05:14.940> that<00:05:15.000> you

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
you run out of storage space on that you

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.420 
you run out of storage space on that you
can<00:05:15.539> keep<00:05:15.780> adding<00:05:16.080> drives<00:05:16.740> into<00:05:17.159> the<00:05:17.250> bays

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
can keep adding drives into the bays

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.550 
can keep adding drives into the bays
until<00:05:17.909> you're<00:05:18.060> completely<00:05:18.240> full<00:05:18.840> and<00:05:19.110> once

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
until you're completely full and once

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.379 
until you're completely full and once
you<00:05:19.680> run<00:05:19.860> out<00:05:19.889> of<00:05:20.039> storage<00:05:20.340> space<00:05:20.639> there<00:05:20.909> you

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
you run out of storage space there you

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:22.969 
you run out of storage space there you
can<00:05:21.539> take<00:05:21.780> out<00:05:21.960> some<00:05:21.990> of<00:05:22.259> your<00:05:22.500> lower<00:05:22.710> capacity

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
can take out some of your lower capacity

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.610 
can take out some of your lower capacity
drives<00:05:23.669> and<00:05:23.969> throw<00:05:24.240> in<00:05:24.419> even<00:05:24.780> bigger<00:05:25.020> drives

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.860 
drives and throw in even bigger drives
into<00:05:26.069> those<00:05:26.190> spaces<00:05:26.520> so<00:05:27.240> let's<00:05:27.449> say<00:05:27.599> you<00:05:27.659> have

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
into those spaces so let's say you have

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.719 
into those spaces so let's say you have

00:05:29.719 --> 00:05:29.729 
a 500 gig hard drive in there you can

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:31.459 
a 500 gig hard drive in there you can
take<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:30.060> out<00:05:30.120> put<00:05:30.539> in<00:05:30.659> a<00:05:30.780> three<00:05:31.020> terabyte

take that out put in a three terabyte
hard<00:05:31.620> drive<00:05:31.889> and<00:05:32.069> you're<00:05:32.520> good<00:05:32.699> to<00:05:32.819> go
