 Hi, I'm Dr. Christopher today, hello 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.980
 I am a specialist in aesthetic medicine and 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.980
 work at the brussels clinic 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:20.360
 let's talk about facial fillers 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.340
 the facial fillers mainly 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.169
 we have to know that there are two types 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.509
 temporary fillings and fillings 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.330
 permanent and temporary fillings 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.180
 only most commonly used are 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.620
 fillings that are absorbed and good 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.620
 permanent fillers do not mean 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.870
 that they are a product even if 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.120
 dangerous but yes that a complication 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.070
 of a permanent filling because it is usually 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.470
 usually brings more headache to 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.030
 patient and the doctor therefore the 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.390
 number of temporary fillings that 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.690
 applied in the consultations is commonly 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.650
 much more the area of ​​application 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.960
 mainly of the fillings is the 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:00.190
 middle area of the lower area of ​​the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.110
 face in the upper area we should 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.699
 mainly apply botox the 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.390
 main indication is the application of 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:12.640
 botox as to the middle area 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:15.530
 of the cheekbones are the organs is a 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.030
 area where obviously the result is 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.040
 very good 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.369
 and in very few sessions we can see 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.729
 a very good result the application more 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.290
 common that currently exists is the 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.880
 application of hyaluronic acid as 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.060
 we talked is a resorbable filler 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.310
 and where else we apply it is for the 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.070
 lip augmentation because this product 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.049
 applies in sessions dives is 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.640
 variable depending on the result that 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.079
 we want to obtain according to the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.020
 patient according to the needs 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.299
 of the patient for her application what 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.850
 we do is put for a few minutes 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.829
 an anesthetic cream called mla is 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.869
 a cream that diminishes a little the 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.819
 Infiltration pain is not a 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.560
 very painful treatment for nothing is a 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.750
 pretty painless treatment but 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.399
 we always try to get the patient to 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.310
 an important comfort when it comes to 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.590
 apply these fillings we deposit a 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.069
 little product as you see then what 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.069
 we can mold 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:21.510
 very plastic filler that allows us 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.510
 the furrow disappears 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.599
 as a main side effect we can 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.120
 talk about that some case the patient 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.829
 during the first hours or 24 hours 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.390
 taking a professed inflammatory book 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.900
 which refers without any problem 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.329
 with the application of ice or some shot 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.530
 of an anti-inflammatory once applied 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.629
 the product at the time the patient 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.670
 your work life can be incorporated into your 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.620
 me social to his family life without any 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.579
 kind of complication and you do not need 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.270
 no application no cream 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:59.820
 anti-inflammatory at all 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:03.470
 it is a very demanded treatment very 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.470
