00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.009
 And as soon as he lives, he's gone. 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.870
 occurring a vacancy is that they speak 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.170

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:12.170
 It's his seat, so it gets open then. 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.860

 living the most important people and 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.820
 also the poor side is not that profile 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.310
 says that the side where he had been living 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.420
 poor people where you have a clinic 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.460
 also of chemical dependents and some 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.940
 members of the board want to close 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.180
 this clinic and want is that fields do not 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.850

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.670
 brother would defend that fields is to continue 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.950
 being part of the telegraph 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.400
 most of the characters they live in 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:59.780
 rich side and lose only one family source 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.330
 live on the poor side is to give a book that 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.090
 has many intrigues so sometimes the 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.520
 intrigues occur as members of the 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.820
 his own family as a city 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.010
 little is too many gossip all around 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.970
 world knows everybody's life 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:21.530
 world is a friend of everyone is so 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:24.230
 so she managed and knew how to ride is a 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.980
 book with several characters but 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:31.160
 so every major character with 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.470
 that the other is to see as she approaches the 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.459
 life of each and she kind of does not take 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.390
 broken 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:41.330
 you that you end up identifying yourself or 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.700
 it 's not with some characters 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.220
 he does not have a character like that 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:49.070
 main 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.410
 it is made up of several characters in this 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.820
 video has several characters in the 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.220
 families of each with their own 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.070
 characteristic of each of its 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.110
 problems each their conflicts and the 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.780
 interesting in this book so for 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:06.170
 that he has many characters that I 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.700
 I think it's honestly a bit uncomfortable 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.850
 as much as he has many 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.250
 jack hollen characters so she 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.450
 writes in a very good way that by 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.489
 more that the book has many 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.910
 characters is a very 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.979
 cool is she despite being a dense book 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.560
 because it is a dense book is due to the 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:27.199
 content it is a so - half story 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.900
 It's complicated, it's a story that speaks 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:32.840
 a lot about politics, I do not like it 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.150
 a lot of politics though she 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.310
 writes in such a good way 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.199
 so enveloping that the book 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.270
 It turns out to be very interesting. 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:43.310
 at the beginning of the book you think so goes up 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.819
 a little but 7 but only have a little bit 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.560
 more patience and keep reading the 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:50.509
 The book that you end up getting involved with is 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.599
 because of the way she writes herself 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:55.250
 it also discusses the characteristics 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:59.270
 of them that you end up identifying 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.759
 with some stories you end up 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.460
 clinging to some characters 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:06.770
 I've heard enough is criticism, it 's in 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.620
 relation to this book some positive 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:12.020
 but many negatives in some people 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.370
 are complaining that he has excess of 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.400
 curse words 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.590
 but it's not like that, there's no excess 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.840
 I will not say that you do not have 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:24.500
 words have words yes but it is not 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.599
 nothing excessive and nothing that demeans the 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.030
 book some people complaining that he 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:32.509
 it's a pretentious book it really is 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.310
 A pretentious book is a book that 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:36.860
 addresses issues so many people do not 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.020
 like what you're talking about 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.990
 business of being involved but so 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:45.020
 it is nothing more than the reality that - 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.030
 Our day to day lives have houses here that can 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.669
 to be on your side with your 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.750
 neighbor with his brother with his father and his 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.960
 mom 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.430
 so it 's nothing out of the ordinary, not me 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.229
 I'll tell you what this book here 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.569
 has a dramatic end 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.180
 for me it was very dramatic for some 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:04.849
 people can a fabric a final 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.819
 dramatic I found super dramatic end 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:10.219
 so you realize you got clean 

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:13.669
 not have pity the characters not only for 

00:06:10.219 --> 00:06:16.580
 Cei talks about fame coming out and it 's if you 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:20.020
 take a character so have detachment 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.169
 dumb because in the end it's half a dozen 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.909
 complicated 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.409
 She will make the choice of the book is 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:27.150
 because that what i said is already a 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:29.130
 But little spoiler, but it's 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.950
 the opportunity for those who have 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.950
 patience for those who do not know in writing 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.380
 It's really worth it in this book. 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:41.010
 Thank you for reading this book. 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.870
 I really liked reading it, it 's sudden death. 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:45.450
 so if you have the opportunity like 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.940
 much of the author nedbank the lens is worth 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.230
 very much worth you give attention to to 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.880
 This book is good 

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.830

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:58.610
 read this book and that you can come back 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.610
 more times until the next video 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:07.010
 oh look there
