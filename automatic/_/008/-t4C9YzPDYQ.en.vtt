00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
see in piano players that I think

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.470 
see in piano players that I think
prevents<00:00:30.080> people<00:00:30.380> from<00:00:31.029> really<00:00:32.029> achieving

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
prevents people from really achieving

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.020 
prevents people from really achieving
their<00:00:32.630> maximum<00:00:33.230> capability<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.640> enjoyment

their maximum capability and enjoyment

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.120 
their maximum capability and enjoyment
and<00:00:35.660> that<00:00:35.840> is<00:00:36.079> that<00:00:36.410> people<00:00:36.740> feel<00:00:36.890> they<00:00:37.010> have
