drill<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:01.699> our<00:01:01.850> first<00:01:02.059> step<00:01:02.390> is<00:01:02.600> to<00:01:02.960> find<00:01:03.109> the

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
drill so our first step is to find the

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.529 
drill so our first step is to find the
center<00:01:03.620> point<00:01:03.649> of<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.729> footboard<00:01:05.119> so<00:01:05.420> I'm

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
center point of the footboard so I'm

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.690 
center point of the footboard so I'm
going<00:01:05.660> to<00:01:05.720> take<00:01:05.840> my<00:01:05.960> tape<00:01:06.110> measure<00:01:06.700> I've

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
going to take my tape measure I've

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:17.810 
going to take my tape measure I've

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.460 

so<00:01:18.820> now<00:01:19.299> that<00:01:19.360> we<00:01:19.540> have<00:01:19.690> our<00:01:19.810> sides<00:01:20.080> we're

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
so now that we have our sides we're

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.930 
so now that we have our sides we're
going<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:20.650> measure<00:01:20.860> to<00:01:21.280> find<00:01:21.400> out<00:01:21.580> where<00:01:21.760> we're

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
going to measure to find out where we're

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.670 
going to measure to find out where we're
going<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.150> drill<00:01:22.299> into<00:01:22.510> the<00:01:22.690> headboard<00:01:22.869> so<00:01:23.320> I

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
drilled three holes and now that we have

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.830 
drilled three holes and now that we have
them<00:01:27.340> drill<00:01:27.610> we're<00:01:27.880> going<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:28.060> screw<00:01:28.540> in<00:01:28.690> our

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.260 
them drill we're going to screw in our
screws<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:33.220> we're<00:01:33.430> going<00:01:33.520> to<00:01:33.640> measure<00:01:33.820> how

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
screws so we're going to measure how

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.359 
screws so we're going to measure how
wide<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.840> bench<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.259> so<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.770> we<00:01:35.950> can<00:01:36.130> start

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
wide the bench is so that we can start

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:44.219 
wide the bench is so that we can start
measuring<00:01:36.670> the<00:01:36.909> boards<00:01:37.240> for<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.570> seat<00:01:43.229> now
