your own high-power digital telescope
then<00:00:17.000> you<00:00:17.270> can<00:00:17.480> talk<00:00:18.530> too<00:00:18.740> so<00:00:19.270> anyway

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.500 
we're looking at inbound here image
appears<00:00:24.560> to<00:00:24.710> be<00:00:24.830> slightly<00:00:25.250> distorted<00:00:25.789> I'm<00:00:26.360> not

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
appears to be slightly distorted I'm not

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.210 
appears to be slightly distorted I'm not
sure<00:00:26.780> why<00:00:26.960> I<00:00:26.990> could<00:00:27.230> be<00:00:27.350> because<00:00:27.530> it<00:00:27.770> is<00:00:27.890> still

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
sure why I could be because it is still

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.939 
sure why I could be because it is still
quite<00:00:28.640> some<00:00:28.880> distance<00:00:29.030> from<00:00:29.360> us<00:00:29.510> but<00:00:30.440> we<00:00:30.830> are

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
quite some distance from us but we are

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.540 
quite some distance from us but we are
tracking<00:00:31.250> inbound<00:00:31.820> and<00:00:34.870> yeah<00:00:35.870> it's<00:00:36.739> it's

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
tracking inbound and yeah it's it's

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.180 
tracking inbound and yeah it's it's
headed<00:00:37.940> straight<00:00:37.970> for<00:00:38.210> the<00:00:38.450> Sun<00:00:39.100> kind<00:00:40.100> of

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
headed straight for the Sun kind of

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.270 
headed straight for the Sun kind of
interesting<00:00:40.720> but<00:00:41.720> um<00:00:41.960> I<00:00:42.230> guess<00:00:42.950> that's<00:00:43.130> what

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
interesting but um I guess that's what

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.229 
interesting but um I guess that's what
comments<00:00:43.640> do<00:00:45.460> don't<00:00:46.460> know<00:00:46.579> what<00:00:46.670> else<00:00:46.790> to<00:00:46.910> say

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
comments do don't know what else to say

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.350 
comments do don't know what else to say
about<00:00:47.360> this<00:00:47.660> other<00:00:47.960> then<00:00:52.059> it's<00:00:53.059> going<00:00:53.180> to<00:00:53.270> be

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
about this other then it's going to be

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.810 
about this other then it's going to be
beautiful<00:00:53.510> when<00:00:53.840> it<00:00:53.960> gets<00:00:54.140> here<00:00:54.290> I<00:00:54.820> don't

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
beautiful when it gets here I don't

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.280 
beautiful when it gets here I don't
believe<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:56.420> it's<00:00:56.540> going<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.719> be<00:00:56.899> doom<00:00:57.110> and

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
believe it it's going to be doom and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.560 
believe it it's going to be doom and
gloom<00:00:57.350> I<00:00:57.829> think<00:00:58.160> it's<00:00:58.280> going<00:00:58.399> to<00:00:58.489> be<00:00:58.700> a

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
gloom I think it's going to be a

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.840 
gloom I think it's going to be a
celebration<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.620> lights<00:01:01.010> in<00:01:01.340> the<00:01:01.640> nighttime

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850

sky<00:01:02.239> and<00:01:03.339> hopefully<00:01:04.339> there<00:01:04.519> won't<00:01:04.640> be<00:01:04.850> too

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
sky and hopefully there won't be too

really enjoy this comment this year and

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.999 
really enjoy this comment this year and
that<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.569> ends<00:01:50.840> up<00:01:50.959> being<00:01:51.289> a<00:01:51.409> really<00:01:51.439> beautiful

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
that it ends up being a really beautiful

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.649 
that it ends up being a really beautiful
thing<00:01:52.399> I<00:01:52.549> doubt<00:01:52.729> if<00:01:52.819> it's<00:01:52.969> going<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.179> be<00:01:53.270> 15

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
thing I doubt if it's going to be 15

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.690 
thing I doubt if it's going to be 15
times<00:01:53.899> brighter<00:01:54.109> than<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.380> Sun<00:01:54.649> doesn't<00:01:55.429> look

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
times brighter than the Sun doesn't look

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.919 
times brighter than the Sun doesn't look
like<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.029> losing<00:01:56.719> 51<00:01:57.429> tons<00:01:58.429> of<00:01:58.759> material<00:01:59.689> every

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
like it losing 51 tons of material every

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:02.949 
like it losing 51 tons of material every
minute<00:02:00.399> as<00:02:01.399> it<00:02:01.639> comes<00:02:01.849> in<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.329> it's<00:02:02.630> supposed

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
minute as it comes in and it's supposed

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.779 
minute as it comes in and it's supposed
to<00:02:03.139> lose<00:02:03.319> ten<00:02:03.560> percent<00:02:03.950> of<00:02:04.039> its<00:02:04.130> mass<00:02:04.399> as<00:02:04.669> it

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
to lose ten percent of its mass as it

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.269 
to lose ten percent of its mass as it
goes<00:02:04.939> around<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.299> Sun<00:02:05.359> so<00:02:05.929> I<00:02:06.169> guess<00:02:07.099> we'll

00:02:07.269 --> 00:02:07.279 
goes around the Sun so I guess we'll

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:09.050 
goes around the Sun so I guess we'll
just<00:02:07.310> have<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.669> wait<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:07.969> see

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
just have to wait and see

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.400 
just have to wait and see
but<00:02:10.020> for<00:02:10.500> now<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:11.099> is<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.819> Rob<00:02:12.750> Spencer<00:02:13.230> from

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
but for now this is a Rob Spencer from

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.040 
but for now this is a Rob Spencer from
the<00:02:13.560> Spencer<00:02:13.980> space<00:02:14.220> program<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.930> am
