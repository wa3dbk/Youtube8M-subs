speed and so we went to work on it got

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.139 
speed and so we went to work on it got
our<00:00:40.620> engineers<00:00:41.040> focused<00:00:41.489> on<00:00:41.640> what<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:41.969> could

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
our engineers focused on what we could

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.510

do with it and we wanted to see how fast
we<00:00:44.670> can<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.090> thing<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.510> go<00:00:45.809> without<00:00:46.020> doing

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
we can get the thing to go without doing

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
engines like this and we basically took

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.529 
engines like this and we basically took
this<00:00:59.250> car<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.670> drag<00:00:59.879> strip<00:00:59.910> them<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> see

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
this car to the drag strip them to see

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.880 
this car to the drag strip them to see
just<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.989> would<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.640> after<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> while

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
just what it would do and after a while

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.590 
just what it would do and after a while
a<00:01:04.129> couple<00:01:04.580> of<00:01:04.670> runs<00:01:04.909> have<00:01:05.120> to<00:01:05.239> learn<00:01:05.330> how<00:01:05.390> to

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
a couple of runs have to learn how to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.350 
a couple of runs have to learn how to
launch<00:01:05.870> it<00:01:06.050> with<00:01:06.140> all<00:01:06.290> that<00:01:06.440> horsepower<00:01:07.360> we

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
launch it with all that horsepower we

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.899 
launch it with all that horsepower we
ended<00:01:08.600> up<00:01:08.659> doing<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:09.020> ten<00:01:09.229> point<00:01:09.440> oh<00:01:09.590> three

that they do on these vehicles there's

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.640 
that they do on these vehicles there's
always<00:01:52.070> something<00:01:52.550> left<00:01:52.580> on<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.060> table

think no problem well well yes and
that's<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.920> beauty<00:02:55.190> of<00:02:55.220> it<00:02:55.310> correct<00:02:55.670> but

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
that's the beauty of it correct but

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.130 
that's the beauty of it correct but
there<00:02:56.090> are<00:02:56.209> other<00:02:56.390> things<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.780> we<00:02:56.959> do

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
there are other things that we do

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.080 
there are other things that we do
obviously<00:02:57.890> we<00:02:58.010> upgraded<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.640> inner<00:02:58.850> core

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
obviously we upgraded the inner core

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.820 
obviously we upgraded the inner core
system<00:02:59.510> on<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.720> car<00:02:59.930> we<00:03:00.530> haven't<00:03:00.709> done

anything on this vehicle with the inner

anything on this vehicle with the inner

stupid

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
stupid

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.290 
stupid
and<00:03:05.560> that's<00:03:05.740> why<00:03:05.860> we've<00:03:06.040> seen<00:03:06.250> only<00:03:06.400> 16<00:03:06.910> pounds

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
and that's why we've seen only 16 pounds

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.820 
and that's why we've seen only 16 pounds
of<00:03:07.420> boost<00:03:07.540> after<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.110> interquartile<00:03:08.590> because

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
of boost after the interquartile because

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.320 
of boost after the interquartile because
at<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.400> level<00:03:09.700> right<00:03:09.880> now<00:03:10.060> there<00:03:10.300> are

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
at the level right now there are

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.440 
at the level right now there are
restrictions<00:03:11.730> interesting<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:13.000> what<00:03:13.150> we<00:03:13.270> did

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
restrictions interesting but what we did

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.300 
restrictions interesting but what we did
was<00:03:13.600> increase<00:03:13.960> the<00:03:14.140> storage<00:03:14.380> capacity<00:03:15.160> of<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
was increase the storage capacity of the

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.520 
was increase the storage capacity of the
cooling<00:03:15.670> system<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.600> increased<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.320> heat

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
cooling system and increased the heat

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.920 
cooling system and increased the heat
exchanger<00:03:17.740> upfront<00:03:18.640> we<00:03:19.390> actually<00:03:19.510> doubled

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
exchanger upfront we actually doubled

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.600 
exchanger upfront we actually doubled
the<00:03:20.020> size<00:03:20.200> of<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.560> okay<00:03:21.040> but<00:03:21.250> what<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.550> does

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
the size of that okay but what that does

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.810 
the size of that okay but what that does
give<00:03:21.940> us<00:03:22.090> is<00:03:22.240> consistency<00:03:22.870> between<00:03:23.110> rhymes<00:03:23.820> we

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
give us is consistency between rhymes we

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.980 
give us is consistency between rhymes we
got<00:03:24.970> three<00:03:25.180> runs<00:03:25.390> within<00:03:26.460> 25<00:03:27.460> minutes<00:03:27.990> I'm

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
one on that and i would think your

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.550 
one on that and i would think your
transaxle<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.550> tires<00:03:36.790> had<00:03:37.209> you<00:03:37.840> know<00:03:37.990> more<00:03:38.470> of

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
transaxle and tires had you know more of

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.130 
transaxle and tires had you know more of
a<00:03:38.650> variable<00:03:38.920> on<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:40.540> give<00:03:40.690> a<00:03:40.720> repeatable

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
a variable on that to give a repeatable

a variable on that to give a repeatable
launch<00:03:41.440> down<00:03:41.770> in<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.010> car<00:03:42.220> that's<00:03:42.459> yeah<00:03:42.940> it's

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
launch down in the car that's yeah it's

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.699 
launch down in the car that's yeah it's
essentially<00:03:43.630> quite<00:03:43.930> difficult<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.410> launch

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
essentially quite difficult to launch

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.160 
essentially quite difficult to launch
the<00:03:44.920> car<00:03:45.180> we've<00:03:46.180> been<00:03:46.300> running<00:03:46.510> me<00:03:46.720> obviously

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
the car we've been running me obviously

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.030 
the car we've been running me obviously
the<00:03:47.260> drag<00:03:47.500> slicks<00:03:47.739> on<00:03:49.830> we're<00:03:50.830> currently

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
the drag slicks on we're currently

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.400 
the drag slicks on we're currently
getting<00:03:51.370> about<00:03:51.610> a<00:03:51.640> 16<00:03:51.880> 60-foot<00:03:52.840> time<00:03:53.050> which<00:03:53.260> is

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
getting about a 16 60-foot time which is

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.990 
getting about a 16 60-foot time which is
essentially<00:03:53.920> pretty<00:03:54.160> slow<00:03:54.489> yeah<00:03:54.820> you'd<00:03:54.970> think

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
essentially pretty slow yeah you'd think

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.880 
essentially pretty slow yeah you'd think
of<00:03:55.239> you<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.360> little<00:03:55.420> bit<00:03:55.630> quicker<00:03:56.050> now<00:03:56.320> the<00:03:56.650> wig

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.199 
link and the system so far has been a
stuffed<00:03:58.720> plush<00:03:58.900> okay<00:03:59.860> but<00:04:00.520> it's<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.180> very

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
stuffed plush okay but it's a very

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.570 
stuffed plush okay but it's a very
robust<00:04:01.870> clutch<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.260> mean<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:03.100> actually<00:04:03.250> see

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
robust clutch I mean you actually see

robust clutch I mean you actually see
the<00:04:03.700> car<00:04:03.880> launch<00:04:04.180> you<00:04:04.360> see<00:04:04.510> black<00:04:04.840> smoke<00:04:05.020> come

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
the car launch you see black smoke come

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.260 
the car launch you see black smoke come
out<00:04:05.500> from<00:04:05.680> behind<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:06.070> that's<00:04:06.190> much<00:04:06.610> but<00:04:07.150> it's

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
out from behind and that's much but it's

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.660 
out from behind and that's much but it's
there<00:04:07.510> in<00:04:07.690> second<00:04:08.110> then<00:04:08.200> it's<00:04:08.320> there<00:04:08.530> so<00:04:09.310> give

stock clutch is handling that absolutely

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.170

amazing<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.950> medium<00:04:19.190> itself<00:04:19.280> absolutely

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
amazing the medium itself absolutely

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.150 
amazing the medium itself absolutely
it's<00:04:20.750> a<00:04:20.810> very<00:04:21.050> robust<00:04:21.410> approach<00:04:21.530> it's<00:04:21.950> got<00:04:22.130> a

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
it's a very robust approach it's got a

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.130 
it's a very robust approach it's got a
loop<00:04:22.340> material<00:04:22.820> it's<00:04:22.940> a<00:04:23.030> sax<00:04:23.300> design<00:04:23.720> and

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
loop material it's a sax design and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.260 
loop material it's a sax design and
we're<00:04:25.040> actually<00:04:25.190> working<00:04:25.460> with<00:04:26.090> in

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
we're actually working with in

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.000 
we're actually working with in
conjunction<00:04:26.840> with<00:04:26.960> sacks<00:04:27.290> on<00:04:27.500> getting<00:04:27.740> twenty

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
conjunction with sacks on getting twenty

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.350 
conjunction with sacks on getting twenty
percent<00:04:28.280> or<00:04:28.490> plant<00:04:28.730> allowed<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.090> the<00:04:29.180> coach

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
percent or plant allowed to the coach

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.050 
percent or plant allowed to the coach
and<00:04:29.570> we<00:04:29.660> think<00:04:29.810> that'll<00:04:30.140> be<00:04:30.230> perfect<00:04:31.060> target

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
and we think that'll be perfect target

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.130 
and we think that'll be perfect target
is<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.270> ninth<00:04:32.480> we<00:04:33.410> ran<00:04:33.620> a<00:04:33.650> 1003<00:04:34.540> 141<00:04:35.540> I<00:04:35.780> think

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
is the ninth we ran a 1003 141 I think

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.570 
is the ninth we ran a 1003 141 I think
the<00:04:36.230> clutch<00:04:36.470> improvement<00:04:37.220> will<00:04:37.310> judge<00:04:37.460> from

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
the clutch improvement will judge from

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.100 
the clutch improvement will judge from
the<00:04:37.670> mines<00:04:37.880> well<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.450> clutch<00:04:38.630> improvement

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
the mines well the clutch improvement

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.750 
the mines well the clutch improvement
will<00:04:39.200> get<00:04:39.320> as<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.530> nines<00:04:39.740> we<00:04:40.190> noticed<00:04:40.580> a

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
will get as the nines we noticed a

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.580 
will get as the nines we noticed a
tendency<00:04:41.240> for<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.450> car<00:04:41.660> to<00:04:41.840> roll<00:04:42.050> into<00:04:42.320> deep

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
tendency for the car to roll into deep

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.420 
tendency for the car to roll into deep
stage<00:04:43.120> which<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.150> obviously<00:04:44.690> her<00:04:44.870> dowry<00:04:45.170> clean

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
stage which is obviously her dowry clean

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.490 
stage which is obviously her dowry clean
so<00:04:46.730> we<00:04:46.880> did<00:04:47.090> some<00:04:47.120> modifications<00:04:47.990> to<00:04:48.140> that<00:04:48.170> and

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
so we did some modifications to that and

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.350 
so we did some modifications to that and
after<00:04:49.130> the<00:04:49.370> show<00:04:49.400> we're<00:04:49.730> hoping<00:04:50.000> to<00:04:50.060> get<00:04:50.210> back

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
after the show we're hoping to get back

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.050 
after the show we're hoping to get back
to<00:04:50.450> the<00:04:50.540> track<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.840> see<00:04:50.990> what<00:04:51.110> we<00:04:51.200> got<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.880> is

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
to the track to see what we got this is

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.820 
to the track to see what we got this is
