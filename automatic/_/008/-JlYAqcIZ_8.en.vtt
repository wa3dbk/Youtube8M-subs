00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.130
 yesterday my name is joÃ£o carlos and I'm going 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.930
 try to pass on to you the Basque of how 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.930
 is to condition the radiator 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.529
 each workshop has its own way of working 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:30.490
 it's just a chat from the 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:32.050
 principle that whoever will choose is a 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.540
 comedy where no reconditioning 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.280
 Accept the professional is workshop 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.220
 if he thinks it 's trade he has 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.850
 condition of being conditioned option is 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.159
 his 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:45.400
 otherwise, if there is no condition 

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:49.920
 it will just point out a new world 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:55.350
 the client in case of not doing a passat 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.350
 or I had on the side 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.409
 obviously 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.409
 [Music] 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:16.489
 Where are we going to take off our clothes? 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.489
 [Music] 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:31.780
 I can take away both qualified I see 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:35.500
 that the tite is crazy with pliers 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.829
 more sophisticated the function is without me 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:42.759
 be careful with the clamp is a total 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:47.459
 The absurdity they wanted was only the case of the 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.459
 look there, oh 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.870
 [Music] 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:07.340
 always careful with this headboard 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.650
 head in case here 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.030
 the dolphin a little more than the 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.940
 others 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.940
 already the china itself conditioned the friends 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.670
 and more sophisticated plug -in for 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:29.600
 function is the same you regulates 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:35.480
 with hand pressure and is a white 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:37.700
 position completely you stained the 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:47.360
 next year you do not mess with head 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:55.390
 clean tinker on the w3 radiator placard as 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:55.390
 a deadline given the same thing 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.560
 [Music] 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.540
 O 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:20.060
 [Music] 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:29.209
 the radiator has to have stepped conrado 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:38.909
 you can just change the box 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:41.310
 go player at ease so you come 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.019
 hit the new corner 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.650
 how much more seven were even for 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:53.359
 take it easy, you're going to be us 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.359
 mount the hive or swap the other side 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.939
 [Music] 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:07.300
 there is more nor are you conditioned to 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:11.150
 people will find the head oppression 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:15.500
 world is this if you do not ask and nothing 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.510
 there is no street there that I used to 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.950
 I bet that underneath it is easier 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:25.930
 But you wait on the high seas of August. 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.930
 because they can not save the reflector 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.600
 ease to 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.350
 [Music] 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:57.010
 on the scene five months is now will be given 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:05:00.279
 can already be a mechanic 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.279
 [Music] 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:09.100
 If it's bullshit twice you have to 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:13.840
 give a preheating in the bedside but 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:23.700
 I felt the people are all hot. 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:23.700
 avoid the clamp remember china 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:32.270
 [Music] 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.270

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.800
