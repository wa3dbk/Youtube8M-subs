00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
we've actually been able to put some

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.120 
we've actually been able to put some
systems<00:04:39.990> into<00:04:40.170> place<00:04:40.380> in<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.650> kitchen<00:04:41.010> that

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:41.130 
systems into place in the kitchen that

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:42.800 
systems into place in the kitchen that
we<00:04:41.250> couldn't<00:04:41.550> do<00:04:41.700> at<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:41.940> old<00:04:42.090> place<00:04:42.270> because

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
we couldn't do at the old place because

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.680 
we couldn't do at the old place because
of<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.020> kitchen<00:04:43.770> was<00:04:43.890> tiny<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:44.550> where<00:04:45.360> now<00:04:45.630> we

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
of the kitchen was tiny and where now we

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.300 
of the kitchen was tiny and where now we
can<00:04:46.050> prep<00:04:46.380> three<00:04:46.620> or<00:04:46.770> four<00:04:46.920> days<00:04:47.070> in<00:04:47.190> advance

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
can prep three or four days in advance

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.030 
can prep three or four days in advance
the<00:04:48.300> old<00:04:48.450> place<00:04:48.690> we<00:04:48.900> had<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.050> prep<00:04:49.320> per<00:04:49.800> day

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
the old place we had to prep per day

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.280 
the old place we had to prep per day
because<00:04:50.640> we<00:04:50.760> had<00:04:50.940> minimal<00:04:51.540> refrigeration

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
because we had minimal refrigeration

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.490 
because we had minimal refrigeration
virtually<00:04:53.190> no<00:04:53.340> dry<00:04:53.640> storage<00:04:53.940> and<00:04:54.480> the<00:04:55.200> our

ability to to put these systems into

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.230 
ability to to put these systems into
place<00:04:57.810> has<00:04:58.110> given<00:04:58.560> us<00:04:58.710> even<00:04:59.070> more<00:04:59.340> free<00:04:59.940> time

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240

consistency<00:05:03.080> we<00:05:04.080> can<00:05:04.260> use<00:05:04.410> a<00:05:04.440> lot<00:05:04.650> of

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
consistency we can use a lot of

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.320 
consistency we can use a lot of
