 form is spoken near then excuse me but 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.200

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.500

 we take it to the treadmill 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:06.570
 thanks ok ok but then today 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.820
 There are several questions in part I will 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.160
 much of the graphics aside 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.320
 of human nature maybe we should be one 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.150
 lame score reads a subjective thing 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.280
 okay with her 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.190
 with her a lot then we are to nothing we go 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.709
 first of all with how it came about 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.370
 here where you came by bus 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.090
 how do you see everything as a lot of doubts a 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.260
 party she has doubts 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:38.070
 ok ok where from roma of course typical 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.739
 madonnina accent a little clean state 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.350
 rino romano roots I said that 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:49.340
 come rome but you take a bus 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:52.230
 from torino that is right and go ahead luca 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.239
 but listen, and we would have seen that 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.970
 she is a person i think she is 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.390
 a great guinea pig for our game of 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.100
 we have an innovative game from a 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.470
 cap take the envelopes go the envelopes 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.690
 we want to subject it to a beautiful one 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.000
 I play a test that's okay 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.920
 some envelopes here we have six envelopes 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.570
 also there were three but the times that 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.930
 change here we have to update there were 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.750
 the dott 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.720
 now it's a bit like the euro the lira yes 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.880
 so it suddenly increases that luca happens 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.299
 let's see one of the six envelopes 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.670
 you have to choose look 16 or there is no 7 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.090
 he doesn't understand anything that ugly pur 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.799
 ignoring the hard ok the 4 ok the iv has 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.690
 said affection gave the 4 right 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.230
 Michael told the painting very well 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.379
 please dress 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.080
 let's see what I give you 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.220
 question we hear tell us crazy that you 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.519
 led to becoming a celebrity 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.750
 I 'd change it I'd tell you about it 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.629
 seems a woman to work because second 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.590
 you didn't do an operation that 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:58.299
 tell me one day it happened it happened 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.670
 let's say clean cut that neither can 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.310
 I realized one day it was on the beak up 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.870
 what make me go ahead to load 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.709
 so more success the other day 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.780
 I was wrong I was wrong I understood 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.400
 that I had to be serious here anyway 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.750
 doubts of this bull not with these 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:21.070
 blonde hair because I'm sorry but you go 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:23.050
 forward they are not fair and therefore that is 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.729
 happened if you had woken up from riders to 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.940
 this is what i heard that 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:30.490
 I had to be so good everyone his 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.389
 goal so it's nice very beautiful 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.250
 very beautiful 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.800
 now to do another continue in 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.389
 much to ask another question another 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.889
 the other question asks if there ever is 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:42.160
 another envelope you choose an envelope 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:44.950
 they look to bust a perfect 3 told by 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.710
 5 the one you heard was selector 5 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.539
 but told by zurich he said he deduced 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.039
 data revolver I see so trained I have 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.979
 trained because as I do not understand what 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:56.020
 six time trial videos myself 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.639
 I think we have the art 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.520
 we have chosen the wrong envelope 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:05.050
 ok so who are you and what are you doing 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:10.210
 viviane and I run ok multiply 5 by eight 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:13.539
 and subtracts 3 is fast but there is a 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.210
 earthquakes are between 3 30 on ok is more or 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:20.650
 less than your obvious age ok you are 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:22.030
 happy because because I run but for every one 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.490
 but panache that now I will be much 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:27.700
 worried how much love you had in 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:31.389
 your life one just don't want to say 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.820
 that apple is very much faithful 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.660
 I see then it is better to live with regrets 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:40.599
 or remorse for remorse why 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.470
 because in others they cry but me 

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:43.470
 they seem answered 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:50.099
 if you were a flower things I see 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.499
 difficult that flower would be a violet 

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:55.419
 because for those who violate 

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:58.449
 I would say that it is very comprehensive no ok 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:01.029
 what is the part of your pseudo body 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.699
 body that you like best and which least i 

00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:05.020
 I like this hair in the other 

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:08.050
 version do not hear us 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.490
 it happened to some of the voice changes of 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.139
 however to say that even now that the 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:18.669
 great club we make it go away and the 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:20.439
 I would throw out just enough but it is not 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.180
 of course, to cut it off 

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:24.909
 again both paolo continues to run 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.900
 how many stops and pray go away 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:29.889
 robben but I don't know who is sending us keys 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.240
 sending this in my opinion has arrived 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.189
 for dense paper but we can't 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.900
 continue to reserve the given tender 

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:36.250
 that mandate the other one was not there goes 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:38.650
 while at the beginning he knows it is a 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.560
 marpione guys please help us a 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:45.639
 come come here find the carrier that 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.789
 they went up I know how to call it that one 

00:06:45.639 --> 00:06:47.789
 there
