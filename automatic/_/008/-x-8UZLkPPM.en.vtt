00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 what to do when such a point came drum 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:23.539
 at such a point is zero 0 and you feel that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:27.080
 pause such a vacuum and there is no these 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.300
 there is no direction 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.989
 something like you don't know the orientation 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.829
 what is not here so here so here all 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:43.590
 hung 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:47.640
 still not feeling like 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.010
 as if you want something 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:58.250
 start acting i don't know you 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:01.620
 I want to, I don't know what it means 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.239
 I understand it was a very good desire for you 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.939
 what is worth that everything was clear now 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.790
 it is not clear very well but that's for sure 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.670
 higher level than ever 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.830
 it becomes incomprehensible I am very happy but 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.960
 I already experienced just I just studied 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:23.100
 very serious spiritual there school and this 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.659
 very clearly explained that there before 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.850
 always move to a new level 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.850
 there is a total eclipse that is you 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.680
 it seems that those are nothing but nothing 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.759
 it is clear nothing is 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.220
 drop this is always remember 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.900
 before under it before rising always 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.710
 fall meaning you have you worse 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.020
 look can start you worse start 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.490
 The initial starts something to turn out in 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.310
 Nepal stop understanding what 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.680
 understood before it before before 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.170
 the next step before the ascents 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:11.650
 turn it off to rome or cheap it so 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:13.690
 it will be easier for me here and the knowledge of this 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.360
 already you will be twice a little bit 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.240
 ease that all is well nothing bad 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:23.459
 this is not it only if you are you 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:29.800
 you really for the promotion for the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:31.989
 spiritual growth which we say panic 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.000
 no our panic itself occurs when 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.400
 I used to have a panic when suddenly I 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.170
 something was able to work out and suddenly ceases 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.209
 I turned out to be a panic and now I know 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.590
 it has already happened many times 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.730
 before the new rise always fall here 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.470
 so there is no panic 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:56.760
 this is the first here and the second is what 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:59.590
 you have no desire now 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.459
 large of some and therefore you are not 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:07.540
 you know what to do it just this how 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.450
 once the symptoms of falling but that's just 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.810
 tired now tired soul tired doing 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:15.820
 do you have such a figurative saying night well 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.100
 at night we have no desire and all back 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.049
 have a rest 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.260
 an hour you have such a fall period fall 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:26.260
 it's when you're at night you're awake 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.620
 that is, there is no lived there is no there is no 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.420
 strong desires purposeful here I 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:38.350
 I am sure that here is help in the last lesson 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:40.989
 talked about goals every day I write 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.200
 now I continue to write by the way every 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.670
 day 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.200
 I like it very much and I am sure that you 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.150
 would probably now not even be able to 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.980
 write yes I understand because no no 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.620
 big of some desires and this 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.900
 called night it's just called 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:04.489
 the soul is tired is resting now nothing 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:08.590
 there is nothing bad in it then it will rest 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.690
 the soul is just seagulls to drink relax for a walk 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:17.540
 that is, do not rush and then suddenly begin 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:20.690
 dawn of the soul again dawn again I 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.300
 which will then begin to feel 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.930
 wishes want it want then start or 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.450
 write down or how you start 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:35.479
 act life will appear again 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:39.190
 there will be a passion again like this 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:39.190
 it works on top of worrying
