brain I think that you didn't like the
fact<00:02:47.320> that<00:02:47.440> they<00:02:47.620> didn't<00:02:47.830> have<00:02:47.950> enough

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.810 
bullshit nickel and diming so releasing
them<00:02:53.320> might<00:02:53.590> be<00:02:53.770> a<00:02:53.800> much<00:02:54.160> better<00:02:54.340> thing<00:02:54.670> cuz
