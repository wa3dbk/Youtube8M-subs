how to take the body off how to
lubricate<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.759> where<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.360> leave<00:01:21.479> okay<00:01:21.810> -<00:01:21.840> house

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
lubricate it where to leave okay - house

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
off after the motor there's still

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.469 
off after the motor there's still
nothing<00:01:24.450> on<00:01:27.110> running<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.409> or<00:01:29.479> anything

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
and back don't seem to do but well we're

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.859 
and back don't seem to do but well we're
in<00:01:37.350> it's<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.650> an<00:01:37.770> earring<00:01:39.950> then<00:01:40.950> I've<00:01:41.070> got<00:01:41.250> two

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
in it's in an earring then I've got two

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.289 
in it's in an earring then I've got two
are<00:01:42.869> these<00:01:43.020> curious<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.799> cases<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
are these curious little cases for the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.090 
are these curious little cases for the
DCC<00:01:45.930> tips<00:01:46.170> which<00:01:46.970> quite<00:01:47.970> oddly<00:01:48.829> say<00:01:49.829> that

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
DCC tips which quite oddly say that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.350 
DCC tips which quite oddly say that
you'd<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.520> put<00:01:50.700> them<00:01:50.820> over<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.090> chips

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
you'd have to put them over the chips

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.060 
you'd have to put them over the chips
yet<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.810> instructions<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> chip<00:01:52.770> say

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
yet the instructions for the chip say

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.039 
yet the instructions for the chip say
you<00:01:53.130> don't<00:01:53.880> need<00:01:54.540> them

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
you don't need them

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.139 
you don't need them
so<00:01:55.939> that's<00:01:56.939> about<00:01:57.200> four<00:01:58.200> there<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:59.130> go<00:01:59.340> there's

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
so that's about four there we go there's

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.630 
so that's about four there we go there's
the<00:02:00.450> loco<00:02:00.840> itself

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
the loco itself

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.029 
the loco itself
I<00:02:02.670> should<00:02:03.570> say<00:02:03.780> ACEF<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.330> we<00:02:06.510> just<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.110> have

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
I should say ACEF so if we just I have

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.110 
I should say ACEF so if we just I have
to<00:02:08.069> somehow<00:02:08.369> carefully<00:02:09.170> poke<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.830> out<00:02:11.120> by

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
to somehow carefully poke it out by

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.330 
to somehow carefully poke it out by
pushing<00:02:12.330> your<00:02:12.630> fingers<00:02:13.200> through<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.740> holes

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
pushing your fingers through the holes

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.840 
pushing your fingers through the holes
at<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.790> back<00:02:16.100> gently<00:02:17.100> gently<00:02:17.700> gently<00:02:19.610> outs<00:02:20.610> it

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
at the back gently gently gently outs it

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.940 
at the back gently gently gently outs it
corners<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:23.459> then<00:02:23.640> take<00:02:24.120> off<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.390> paper<00:02:24.950> like

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
corners and then take off the paper like

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.480 
corners and then take off the paper like
it<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:26.220> far

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
it so far

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.410 
it so far
that's<00:02:26.940> up<00:02:27.060> in<00:02:27.150> a<00:02:27.209> gift<00:02:27.450> shop<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.760> there<00:02:30.150> she

that's up in a gift shop and there she

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.320 
that's up in a gift shop and there she
is<00:02:30.510> oh<00:02:31.489> that's<00:02:32.489> really<00:02:32.850> heavy

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
we've got the obviously tongue OH

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.900 
we've got the obviously tongue OH
huh<00:03:33.570> okay<00:03:34.290> that<00:03:34.860> wasn't<00:03:35.040> fun<00:03:35.340> very<00:03:35.579> securely

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
huh okay that wasn't fun very securely

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.539 
huh okay that wasn't fun very securely
them<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:37.110> it<00:03:37.650> couldn't<00:03:37.980> have<00:03:38.040> run<00:03:38.220> without<00:03:38.400> it

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
them but it couldn't have run without it

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.310 
them but it couldn't have run without it
with<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.239> well<00:03:39.390> we<00:03:39.690> couldn't<00:03:39.930> have<00:03:39.989> run<00:03:40.140> with

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
with it well we couldn't have run with

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.160 
with it well we couldn't have run with
it<00:03:40.470> on<00:03:40.590> anyway<00:03:41.510> we<00:03:42.510> couldn't<00:03:42.720> have<00:03:42.840> run<00:03:43.049> it

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
it on anyway we couldn't have run it

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.920 
it on anyway we couldn't have run it
without<00:03:43.350> doing<00:03:43.890> that<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.430> I<00:03:44.700> suppose<00:03:45.690> it's

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
without doing that so I suppose it's

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.330 
without doing that so I suppose it's
helped<00:03:46.170> us<00:03:46.260> really<00:03:48.560> that's<00:03:49.560> just<00:03:49.769> probably<00:03:49.980> to

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
helped us really that's just probably to

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.060 
helped us really that's just probably to
keep<00:03:50.459> it<00:03:50.610> secure<00:03:50.790> while<00:03:51.299> it's<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.440> transit<00:03:52.470> I

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
keep it secure while it's in transit I

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.030 
keep it secure while it's in transit I
imagine<00:03:53.489> but<00:03:54.450> we'll<00:03:55.170> better<00:03:55.410> check<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.920> other

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
imagine but we'll better check the other

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.900 
imagine but we'll better check the other
one<00:03:56.220> as<00:03:56.340> well<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:57.230> let's<00:03:58.230> just<00:03:58.410> put<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.910> one

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
one as well so let's just put that one

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.890 
one as well so let's just put that one
there

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
there

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.530 
there
just<00:04:02.049> tissue<00:04:02.950> papers<00:04:03.489> on<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.790> side<00:04:04.000> alone

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
just tissue papers on the side alone

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.330 
just tissue papers on the side alone
that<00:04:04.780> we're<00:04:04.870> gonna<00:04:04.989> have<00:04:05.140> to<00:04:05.200> have<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.129> time

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
that we're gonna have to have the time

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.559 
that we're gonna have to have the time
together

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
go oh not like a much lighter much less

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.860 
go oh not like a much lighter much less
weight<00:04:16.269> in<00:04:16.479> this<00:04:16.630> one<00:04:18.419> but<00:04:19.419> you<00:04:19.449> can<00:04:19.570> see<00:04:19.840> right

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
weight in this one but you can see right

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.219 
weight in this one but you can see right
through<00:04:20.139> the<00:04:21.180> the<00:04:22.180> dogs<00:04:22.449> there<00:04:22.690> on<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:22.990> side

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
through the the dogs there on the side

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.700 
through the the dogs there on the side
and<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.970> can't<00:04:25.810> on<00:04:26.110> that<00:04:26.229> huh

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710

and you can't on that huh
not<00:04:27.010> really<00:04:28.350> I'd<00:04:29.350> say<00:04:29.620> this<00:04:29.800> is<00:04:29.860> less<00:04:30.190> than

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
not really I'd say this is less than

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.980 
not really I'd say this is less than
half<00:04:30.760> the<00:04:30.790> weight<00:04:31.270> of<00:04:31.479> the<00:04:31.570> other<00:04:31.600> one<00:04:33.990> but

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
half the weight of the other one but

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.890 
half the weight of the other one but
it's<00:04:35.199> just<00:04:35.289> as<00:04:35.919> detailed<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:36.669> the<00:04:37.150> doors<00:04:37.419> open

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
other but with no motor but it has got

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.490 
other but with no motor but it has got
space<00:04:46.090> for<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.330> chip<00:04:46.570> because<00:04:46.900> I<00:04:46.990> believe<00:04:47.289> the

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
space for a chip because I believe the

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.029 
space for a chip because I believe the
lights<00:04:47.770> light<00:04:48.280> up<00:04:48.310> and<00:04:49.139> you're<00:04:50.139> gonna<00:04:50.260> DCCC<00:04:50.919> it

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
lights light up and you're gonna DCCC it

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.740 
lights light up and you're gonna DCCC it
you'll<00:04:51.250> need<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.490> put<00:04:51.669> chip<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:52.030> both<00:04:52.300> units

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
you'll need to put chip and both units

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.000 
you'll need to put chip and both units
but<00:04:53.680> very<00:04:54.340> impressed<00:04:54.810> quality<00:04:55.830> comes<00:04:56.830> to
