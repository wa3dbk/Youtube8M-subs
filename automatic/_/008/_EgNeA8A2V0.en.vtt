00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.839
 hello welcome to my channel once again 

00:00:02.979 --> 00:00:06.759
 my name is ever before by all 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:10.420
 those new subscribers and those who 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:13.000
 continue with me and good today I bring you a 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:16.060
 video and fixed in the title are my 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.420
 three breakfasts please and are the ones that I do 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:23.320
 when I'm in a hurry and the truth is that 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.320
 very easy very simple milestones and about 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:31.170
 everything is health so the three options 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.480
 they have seen a lot the only thing 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.060
 If I order them, they have a lot 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.100
 Beware of the portions of your 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.360
 there are some foods that although 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.700
 we believe that they are healthy 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.330
 because they are fruit salads are 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.270
 good green salads are going to be very 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.879
 good option for us but we 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.900
 we realize that they are small details 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.030
 and quantities in our food that 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.220
 they trigger the amount of 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.350
 calories so I leave you with the video 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.830
 I hope it serves them 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.100
 to make them and see you in the next 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.100
 video 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.180
 we started with our first option that 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 it's fruit with yogurt and we need a 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.620
 fruit cup half cup zero yogurt 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.080
 percent sugar 0% fat one third of 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.690
 cup of granola and remember that I did 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.890
 a very healthy I leave the link in the 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.890
 information box 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.640
 and my second option is an egg over 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.310
 bread and we need only a slice of 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.150
 bread that we're going to put to toast in the 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.010
 toaster in the comal and we need a 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.229
 egg for that let's put a 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.990
 teaspoon of oil as it is well 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.390
 hot we add our egg and 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.200
 we cover so that you can sew a 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.200
 a little bit better 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:11.370
 once we have our toast 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:14.440
 we put on our already cooked egg 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.620
 we add a bonche quoted from the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.940
 vegetables that we like in this case I 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.290
 I put lettuces 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.170
 Y 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.850
 to give it a special flavor 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.470
 we add sauce 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:36.750
 in this case it 's salty tatemada and ready 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.750
 our second breakfast option 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:55.189
 my third and last option is a smoothie 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:03:00.109
 of fruit with milk of almonds this 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:03.079
 It also has coconut is delicious and 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:06.500
 we started with a cup of fruit of his 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:12.139
 preference I chose melon and strawberries 2 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:16.219
 Spoons of yogurt 10 almonds 2 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:17.659
 spoonfuls of oatmeal and we add our 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:20.910
 cup of milk 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:23.150
 we liquefy it very well 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:29.340
 if you want to put ice on it too 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:32.340
 and we just get an 8 ounce glass like that 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:35.900
 I hope you liked and 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.900
