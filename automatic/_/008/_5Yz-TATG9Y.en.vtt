00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
and I give it a minute yeah there we go

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.890 
and I give it a minute yeah there we go
it<00:03:08.220> will<00:03:08.400> focus<00:03:08.819> but<00:03:09.150> there's<00:03:09.299> no<00:03:09.390> way<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.599> tap

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
it will focus but there's no way to tap

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
on the screen to autofocus if I touch

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.670 
on the screen to autofocus if I touch
instead<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.599> when<00:03:12.810> take<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.049> picture<00:03:13.470> which<00:03:13.650> is
