00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
if you don't know how to deal with you

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.130 
if you don't know how to deal with you
here<00:01:43.079> on<00:01:43.170> out

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.600 

the<00:01:50.140> way<00:01:50.260> I<00:01:50.290> learned<00:01:50.530> this<00:01:50.740> was<00:01:50.950> first<00:01:51.340> of<00:01:51.520> all

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
the way I learned this was first of all

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.520 
the way I learned this was first of all
like<00:01:51.820> starting<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.240> do<00:01:52.390> from<00:01:52.600> board<00:01:52.900> to<00:01:53.080> 70s

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
like starting to do from board to 70s

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.649 
like starting to do from board to 70s
out<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.920> then<00:01:54.190> I<00:01:54.520> started<00:01:55.000> to<00:01:55.090> do<00:01:55.180> back<00:01:55.390> tails

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
out and then I started to do back tails

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.289 
out and then I started to do back tails
and<00:01:55.930> I<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:57.340> that<00:01:57.460> helps<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.759> lot<00:01:57.909> once<00:01:58.210> you

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
and I think that helps a lot once you

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.969 
and I think that helps a lot once you
get<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.479> front<00:01:58.690> board<00:01:58.900> down<00:01:59.080> and<00:01:59.440> you're

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979
