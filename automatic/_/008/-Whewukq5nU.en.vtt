00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.849
 ae 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:30.280
 It's the city that I've done now. 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.430
 I think until it happens, the tap has to look 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.850
 the mirrors look what the crisis is 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.130
 outside is going to have to park alda is 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.960
 cool if I play well in field of vision 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.970
 cool feel good 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.150
 the car has to be like clothes by 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:50.199
 Judge that the same is look I gave many 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.750
 efforts for drivers and pilots who 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.180
 today give direction instruction and void 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.040
 Because I got here, it turned out 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.129
 placed obstacles in front of me other 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.260
 time left and then you're nervous not 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.019
 You know this car was fantastic. 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.780
 reverse schedule in europe behind 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.540
 or have a low turned sheet 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.810
 already with the first real loss 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:21.130
 It hurt very easy to do this is for 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:23.650
 do once again against the rate is such 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:28.750
 look to bring and lead to life for that 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:31.570
 and without a low date and leaves in front is the 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.719
 light model helps a lot to say look at that 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:37.149
 aa rear of it runs much easier 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.340
 exchange also spectacular here for 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:42.130
 put the rear axle first jib and 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.070
 then go away and get rid of any 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:48.640
 danger situation is not enough to do everything 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.460
 This you need to train and train. 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.020
 much much much much 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.960
 have to have an evasive steering course 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.640
 that will help you to do these 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.130
 maneuvers 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.180
 the model car is very good 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.180
 on May 5
