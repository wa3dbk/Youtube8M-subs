00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello everyone this channel slept today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.109
 I will try to tell what can be done 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.360
 so that your guests do not slow down 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.440
 In fact, there are ways on the Internet 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.960
 Mass but such a way as I did not find 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.080
 so I decided to tell you about him 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.830
 this way i called update first 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.539
 drivers namely geforce drivers 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.619
 To update the driver you need to first 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.990
 go to their website here is the website on the website 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.350
 can go on the wall 3w jeff 1 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.500
 dot com I'll give it to you in the description what 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:42.540
 we need to do further go to the section 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:48.480
 drivers for convenience I'll bring on 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:51.000
 Russian language so there is such a section 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.910
 Oven congratulated choose the driver 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.140
 which suits you according to me 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.170
 let's say fit in such parameters 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.439
 so it 's okay 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.730
 32-bit only Russian is necessary 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:08.820
 so russian 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:13.590
 so everybody start the search now we are a little bit 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.750
 look so i wanted to tell you beta 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.010
 driver I would not recommend to download 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.570
 the past is not after this beta driver 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.700
 computer nose started on its own 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.220
 cut it out unpleasant trust me 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.430
 when you mount the video and he 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:34.790
 it cuts you down 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.740
 this version you are 1.82 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:44.000
 In general, I recommend downloading it to you. 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:48.480
 download it, select click gave 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.880
 the driver is downloaded so wait for 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:54.180
 The driver is downloaded but I will cancel it already 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.960
 downloaded so here I created a special 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.960
 driver folder 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.390
 Also on this site there is a program on 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.179
 here if you move to the home page 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.230
 here about him says a little bit 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.510
 here is this program 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:18.100
 I’m giving you a little bit now too 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.130
 tell so here are two things that downloaded 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:27.150
 This program and the driver itself 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.150
 look at the program so 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:37.739
 on and bestway 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.739
 Yes, debt is allowed in fact 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.170
 he is 0 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.950
 never 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.960
 So 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.960
 here are four sections 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:07.530
 my system is that faith 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.720
 Here are the games that 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.349
 supported by this type of driver 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.019
 i.e. they can be updated and want them 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:21.000
 drivers 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:23.750
 here is shown on the striver and 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.790
 written a little about his features 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.980
 also here you can update it 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.599
 my system here is a little bit 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.880
 tells about your bye 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:39.870
 And the parameters are right, well, in general, and 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.370
 all as a stop trust i think everyone 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.970
 deal with it but I still tell 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.970
 it is not enough who do not start running temper 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.810
 so run this file of course yes 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.709
 So 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:10.519
 it will be preparing now for bye 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:14.810
 let's get out the driver 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:17.890
 prepares to stop a lot 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.890
 it does not take time 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.230
 I'll tell you in advance before the end of the drawer 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.630
 I will not install because he 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.980
 I have already been installed but I don’t 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:32.060
 I need 2 installation so I just 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.060
 tell you what's what 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.640
 So 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.060
 already almost 80 percent 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.550
 let's read faster 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.480
 So 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.320
 he 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:01.770
 everything 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.599
 here 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.319
 now we will go must leave in 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.319
 window let yes 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.060
 so kind of protects from be 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.060
 why are you huge 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.970
 here 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.310
 here she writes a graphics driver 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:29.020
 nvidia version 330 1.82 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:32.410
 This is the penultimate version of the driver. 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.410
 I consider the beta version 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.410
 So 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:42.939
 happiness should 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:45.099
 a window will appear like this checking the system 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:50.379
 now it will check compatibility 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:52.330
 your system with the driver so we are waiting for all 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.330
 continue 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.330
 express 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:05.240
 and then it will be installed here 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:10.270
 click no and everything is set to 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.270
 your so far so i will cancel the stub 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.820
 after this process your computer and 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.680
 your i should work faster 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.000
 I hope I helped you put the likes 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.000
