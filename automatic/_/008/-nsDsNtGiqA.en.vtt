00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
dead space is much more a world that

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.980 
dead space is much more a world that
needs<00:01:09.670> some<00:01:09.970> sort<00:01:10.149> of<00:01:10.180> unwrapping<00:01:10.630> and

exploring<00:01:11.710> and<00:01:11.920> we<00:01:12.310> try<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.550> use<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:13.090> lighting

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
exploring and we try to use the lighting

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.570 
exploring and we try to use the lighting
to<00:01:14.020> be<00:01:14.080> another<00:01:14.350> character<00:01:14.770> in<00:01:15.009> the<00:01:15.310> world

know we are we're pretty much our

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.810 
know we are we're pretty much our
environments<00:01:35.500> where<00:01:35.650> the<00:01:35.890> ship<00:01:36.159> is<00:01:36.190> the<00:01:36.610> issue

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
environments where the ship is the issue

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.570 
environments where the ship is the issue
my<00:01:37.060> ship<00:01:37.420> and<00:01:37.890> we<00:01:38.890> didn't<00:01:39.130> have<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.280> lot<00:01:39.400> of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
my ship and we didn't have a lot of

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:46.230 
my ship and we didn't have a lot of
variety

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.560 

and<00:01:47.240> now<00:01:47.480> we're<00:01:48.020> on<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:48.290> huge<00:01:48.470> city<00:01:48.980> so<00:01:49.570> you

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
and now we're on this huge city so you

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:51.220 
and now we're on this huge city so you
know<00:01:50.690> there's<00:01:50.870> all<00:01:50.960> sorts<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.170> different

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
know there's all sorts of different

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.500 
know there's all sorts of different
lighting<00:01:51.530> situations<00:01:51.800> from<00:01:52.640> let's<00:01:53.270> say<00:01:53.480> a

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
lighting situations from let's say a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.870 
lighting situations from let's say a
Vegas<00:01:54.200> like<00:01:54.410> shopping<00:01:54.920> mall<00:01:55.130> with<00:01:55.400> with

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
Vegas like shopping mall with with

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.450 
Vegas like shopping mall with with
bright<00:01:56.630> lights<00:01:56.930> and<00:01:57.230> animation<00:01:57.950> going<00:01:58.160> all

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
bright lights and animation going all

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.719 
bright lights and animation going all
the<00:01:58.610> time<00:01:58.840> that<00:01:59.840> then<00:02:00.170> that<00:02:00.530> light<00:02:01.250> starts<00:02:01.670> to

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
the time that then that light starts to

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.660 
the time that then that light starts to
fail<00:02:02.260> it's<00:02:03.260> kind<00:02:03.560> of<00:02:03.620> different<00:02:03.800> than<00:02:04.130> than

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
fail it's kind of different than than

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.700 
fail it's kind of different than than
what<00:02:04.820> we're<00:02:04.970> used<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.360> seeing<00:02:05.930> in<00:02:06.260> a

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
what we're used to seeing in a

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.320 
what we're used to seeing in a
traditional<00:02:07.190> dead<00:02:07.340> space<00:02:07.610> because<00:02:08.149> it's

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
traditional dead space because it's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.630 
traditional dead space because it's
brighter<00:02:08.630> and<00:02:08.990> a<00:02:09.710> lot<00:02:09.890> of<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.070> spaces<00:02:10.310> that<00:02:10.459> we

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
brighter and a lot of the spaces that we

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.580 
brighter and a lot of the spaces that we
have<00:02:10.820> are<00:02:11.000> really<00:02:11.240> dark<00:02:11.480> depending<00:02:12.230> on<00:02:12.230> the

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
have are really dark depending on the

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.470 
have are really dark depending on the
space<00:02:12.980> there<00:02:13.490> could<00:02:13.670> be<00:02:13.700> anything<00:02:13.940> from<00:02:14.090> like

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
space there could be anything from like

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.440 
space there could be anything from like
ten<00:02:14.810> lights<00:02:15.050> to<00:02:15.380> hundreds<00:02:15.709> of<00:02:15.830> lights<00:02:16.070> and<00:02:16.450> in

ten lights to hundreds of lights and in

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.120 
ten lights to hundreds of lights and in
this<00:02:17.959> space<00:02:18.170> in<00:02:18.410> particular<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.980> have

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
this space in particular we have

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.340 
this space in particular we have
hundreds<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.610> lights<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.690> challenge<00:02:21.080> here<00:02:21.290> is

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
hundreds of lights the challenge here is

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.860 
hundreds of lights the challenge here is
having<00:02:22.340> all<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.550> lights<00:02:22.760> but<00:02:23.060> also<00:02:23.239> keeping

the the light outside the window that

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.840 
the the light outside the window that
have<00:02:45.500> changed<00:02:45.680> everything<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.670> main

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
have changed everything the main

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.300 
have changed everything the main
character<00:02:50.209> has<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:51.019> spotlight<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.950> whole<00:02:52.070> time

character has a spotlight the whole time
and<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.820> really<00:02:52.940> can<00:02:53.239> dictate<00:02:53.480> how<00:02:53.959> the

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
and that really can dictate how the

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.979 
and that really can dictate how the
player<00:02:55.760> sees<00:02:56.120> things<00:02:56.420> and<00:02:56.690> what<00:02:56.870> their

experience is like and it's really
critical<00:03:00.620> because<00:03:01.010> we<00:03:01.280> will<00:03:01.459> light<00:03:01.610> a<00:03:01.640> space

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
critical because we will light a space

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.060 
critical because we will light a space
that<00:03:02.330> without<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.410> in<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.650> without<00:03:03.799> the

of the Dutch masters around that time

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.410 
of the Dutch masters around that time
when<00:03:34.349> they<00:03:34.440> started<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.800> really<00:03:35.040> get<00:03:35.489> lighting

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
when they started to really get lighting

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.030 
when they started to really get lighting
in<00:03:36.540> a<00:03:36.599> tangible<00:03:36.930> way<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.560> those<00:03:37.680> cannons<00:03:37.950> were
