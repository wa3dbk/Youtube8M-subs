ridiculous<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.950> much<00:01:23.159> better<00:01:23.369> and

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
ridiculous this is so much better and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.780 
ridiculous this is so much better and
it's<00:01:25.320> only<00:01:25.500> about<00:01:25.590> cheap<00:01:25.920> amarak<00:01:26.280> spent<00:01:26.520> about

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
it's only about cheap amarak spent about

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.330 
it's only about cheap amarak spent about
Pat<00:01:27.060> yeah<00:01:27.540> about<00:01:27.659> how<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:27.990> more<00:01:28.140> expensive<00:01:28.680> but

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
Pat yeah about how a more expensive but

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.090 
Pat yeah about how a more expensive but
this<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:30.060> pound<00:01:30.390> cheaper<00:01:31.020> than<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.860> one

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
this is a pound cheaper than this one

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.160 
this is a pound cheaper than this one
but<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.180> works<00:01:33.360> as<00:01:33.630> well<00:01:33.659> as<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.110> one

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
but I think it works as well as this one

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.230 
but I think it works as well as this one
but<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.890> think<00:01:35.070> this<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.280> works<00:01:35.369> awfully<00:01:35.850> they

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
but I think this one works awfully they

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.160 
but I think this one works awfully they
both<00:01:36.420> work<00:01:36.890> awfully<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.939> follow<00:01:39.060> I<00:01:39.420> hope

both work awfully do you follow I hope

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.670

so

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.880 
so
it's<00:01:41.189> it's<00:01:41.310> alright<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> conditioner<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
it's it's alright as a conditioner as a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.120 
it's it's alright as a conditioner as a
toner<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.640> was<00:01:44.729> alright<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.710> think<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.860> took<00:01:46.979> out

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
toner it was alright I think it took out

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.889 
toner it was alright I think it took out
some<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.579> yellow<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.939> my<00:01:47.970> hair<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.450> had<00:01:48.780> to

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
some of the yellow in my hair I had to

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.389 
some of the yellow in my hair I had to
leave<00:01:49.020> on<00:01:49.170> flat<00:01:49.409> half-hour<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:50.070> see<00:01:50.250> any

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.039 
leave on flat half-hour to see any
difference<00:01:50.579> but<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.689> didn't<00:01:51.869> flick

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049

two<00:01:52.170> hours<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.130> think<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> had<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.060> wait

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
two hours but I think that I had to wait

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.969 
two hours but I think that I had to wait
like<00:01:54.540> quite<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> long<00:01:54.990> time<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.470> any<00:01:55.649> actual

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
like quite a long time to see any actual

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.620 
like quite a long time to see any actual
difference<00:01:56.549> between<00:01:56.729> them<00:01:57.740> so<00:01:58.740> umm<00:01:59.119> yeah<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.329> I

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
and I don't use the twice the 1/3 daily

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.840 
and I don't use the twice the 1/3 daily
one<00:02:12.840> of<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
one of the

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:19.870 
one of the
but<00:02:14.510> what<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.050> do<00:02:15.380> use<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:18.140> this<00:02:18.380> one<00:02:18.820> twice<00:02:19.820> a

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
but what I do use is this one twice a

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.270 
but what I do use is this one twice a
week<00:02:20.150> brightening<00:02:20.780> shampoo<00:02:21.260> it's<00:02:22.160> not

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
week brightening shampoo it's not

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.480 
week brightening shampoo it's not
conditioner<00:02:22.760> shampoo<00:02:23.480> but<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.680> think<00:02:25.310> it's

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
conditioner shampoo but I think it's

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.400 
conditioner shampoo but I think it's
great<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:26.480> does<00:02:26.630> say<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.960> can<00:02:27.110> use<00:02:27.260> this

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
great it does say that you can use this

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.260 
great it does say that you can use this
after<00:02:27.590> this<00:02:27.890> but<00:02:28.610> that's<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.940> point<00:02:29.090> because

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
after this but that's the point because

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.110 
after this but that's the point because
this<00:02:29.480> just<00:02:29.750> seems<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.140> be<00:02:30.260> stupid<00:02:31.060> it<00:02:32.060> doesn't

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
this just seems to be stupid it doesn't

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.860 
this just seems to be stupid it doesn't
seem<00:02:32.690> worth<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:34.490> money<00:02:34.820> really<00:02:35.030> I've<00:02:35.480> ever

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
seem worth the money really I've ever

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.760 
seem worth the money really I've ever
used<00:02:36.080> normal<00:02:36.320> could<00:02:36.470> be<00:02:36.650> normal<00:02:38.770> conditioner

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:39.770 
used normal could be normal conditioner

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:41.140 
used normal could be normal conditioner
and<00:02:39.890> use<00:02:40.010> this<00:02:40.160> because<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.550> wash<00:02:40.760> my<00:02:40.940> hair<00:02:41.060> with

and use this because I wash my hair with

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.420 
and use this because I wash my hair with
this<00:02:41.360> and<00:02:41.840> then<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.530> wish<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.770> was<00:02:42.860> shampoo<00:02:43.250> to

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430
