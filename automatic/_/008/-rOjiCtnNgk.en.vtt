when you hit the ball out of the year a
couple<00:00:30.929> very<00:00:31.320> important<00:00:31.800> skills<00:00:32.189> needed<00:00:33.059> in

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
couple very important skills needed in

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.930 
couple very important skills needed in
order<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.719> hit<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> volley<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.760> you

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
order to hit the volley one is that you

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.350 
order to hit the volley one is that you
must<00:00:36.500> eliminate<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.890> backswing<00:00:38.399> is<00:00:38.550> very

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
must eliminate your backswing is very

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.420 
must eliminate your backswing is very
difficult<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:40.140> time<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.890> hit<00:00:41.100> when<00:00:41.309> you're

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
difficult to time the hit when you're

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.860 
difficult to time the hit when you're
striking<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.940> ball<00:00:42.059> directly<00:00:42.510> out<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
striking the ball directly out of the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.010 
striking the ball directly out of the
year<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> bigger<00:00:43.920> backswing<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.670> going<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
year so a bigger backswing is going to

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.260 
year so a bigger backswing is going to
make<00:00:46.530> it<00:00:46.649> more<00:00:46.770> difficult<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.250> time<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:48.059> also

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
make it more difficult to time it also

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.529 
make it more difficult to time it also
takes<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:49.289> lot<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.500> force<00:00:49.829> when<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> ball

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
takes a lot of force when the ball

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.639 
takes a lot of force when the ball
strikes<00:00:51.539> your<00:00:51.690> racket<00:00:51.989> directly<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
strikes your racket directly out of the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.279 
strikes your racket directly out of the
air<00:00:52.800> for<00:00:53.219> those<00:00:53.370> two<00:00:53.550> reasons<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.329> need<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:55.079> set

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
air for those two reasons we need to set

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.229 
air for those two reasons we need to set
the<00:00:55.440> racket<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> tip<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.760> racket<00:00:56.910> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the racket so the tip of the racket is

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.060 
the racket so the tip of the racket is
pointing<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.809> sky<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.620> does<00:00:58.859> two

pointing up to the sky that does two

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.400 
pointing up to the sky that does two
things<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.660> discourages<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.719> backswing

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
things that discourages a backswing

things that discourages a backswing
number<00:01:02.070> one<00:01:02.250> number<00:01:02.460> two<00:01:02.629> it<00:01:03.629> sets<00:01:04.110> your

wrist in a much stronger position so

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.050 
wrist in a much stronger position so
rack<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:09.960> involves<00:01:10.770> tip<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.460> that

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
rack it up involves tip up and that

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.630 
rack it up involves tip up and that
involves<00:01:13.130> discouraging<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.220> backswing

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
involves discouraging the backswing

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.130
