over<00:05:46.370> there<00:05:46.550> I'm<00:05:47.090> going<00:05:47.240> to<00:05:47.330> put<00:05:47.509> the<00:05:47.599> hops

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
over there I'm going to put the hops

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.649 
over there I'm going to put the hops
directly<00:05:48.620> from<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.919> couch<00:05:49.130> in<00:05:49.610> severe<00:05:50.120> and

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659 
directly from the couch in severe and

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:51.999 
directly from the couch in severe and
then<00:05:50.780> we're<00:05:50.900> going<00:05:50.990> to<00:05:51.080> pour<00:05:51.259> those<00:05:51.409> hops<00:05:51.710> back

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 
then we're going to pour those hops back

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.189 
then we're going to pour those hops back
into<00:05:52.340> here<00:05:52.599> that's<00:05:53.599> not<00:05:53.750> going<00:05:53.840> to<00:05:53.930> have<00:05:54.050> any

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
into here that's not going to have any

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.749 
into here that's not going to have any
adverse<00:05:54.530> effect<00:05:54.860> on<00:05:55.009> those<00:05:55.190> hops<00:05:55.490> because

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:55.759 
adverse effect on those hops because

00:05:55.759 --> 00:05:57.279 
adverse effect on those hops because
next<00:05:55.970> time<00:05:56.120> use<00:05:56.389> i'm<00:05:56.539> just<00:05:56.720> going<00:05:56.900> to<00:05:56.930> war<00:05:57.139> with

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289 
next time use i'm just going to war with

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:02.170 
next time use i'm just going to war with
crap<00:05:57.500> out<00:05:57.710> of<00:05:57.740> them<00:05:57.919> so

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.020 

put<00:06:03.020> these<00:06:03.199> right<00:06:03.259> here<00:06:04.009> I'm<00:06:04.610> going<00:06:04.759> to<00:06:04.850> worry

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.469 
put these right here I'm going to worry
about<00:06:05.150> hops<00:06:05.600> action<00:06:06.169> on<00:06:06.320> that<00:06:07.210> listening<00:06:08.210> to

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 
about hops action on that listening to

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:12.159 
about hops action on that listening to

jason McDowell brewing network he says

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.870 
jason McDowell brewing network he says
that<00:06:12.560> this<00:06:13.340> is<00:06:13.520> when<00:06:13.699> he's<00:06:13.850> gonna<00:06:14.120> start

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.879 

I've<00:06:17.600> been<00:06:17.810> taking<00:06:18.170> hydrometer<00:06:18.770> reading

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
I've been taking hydrometer reading

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:23.470 
I've been taking hydrometer reading
but<00:06:20.069> this<00:06:20.249> time<00:06:20.509> I'm<00:06:21.509> not<00:06:21.569> going<00:06:21.719> to

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:23.480 
but this time I'm not going to

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.780 
but this time I'm not going to
mess<00:06:23.720> with<00:06:23.930> for<00:06:24.290> several<00:06:24.500> days<00:06:24.890> so<00:06:25.550> all<00:06:25.700> the

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
mess with for several days so all the

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.400 
mess with for several days so all the
hops<00:06:26.000> are<00:06:26.210> kind<00:06:26.390> of<00:06:26.450> stuck<00:06:26.720> right<00:06:26.960> here<00:06:26.990> that

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
hops are kind of stuck right here that

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.230 
hops are kind of stuck right here that
stars<00:06:27.770> hand<00:06:28.070> it's<00:06:28.550> the<00:06:28.670> first<00:06:28.820> time<00:06:29.030> I've

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
stars hand it's the first time I've

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.840 
stars hand it's the first time I've
dry-hopped<00:06:29.690> and<00:06:30.410> one<00:06:30.560> of<00:06:30.680> these<00:06:30.800> things<00:06:31.070> so

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
dry-hopped and one of these things so

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.720 
dry-hopped and one of these things so
that's<00:06:32.720> no<00:06:32.930> problem<00:06:33.260> this<00:06:33.770> starts<00:06:34.520> and

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730 
that's no problem this starts and

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.880 
that's no problem this starts and
solutions<00:06:35.240> gonna<00:06:35.450> fall<00:06:36.080> down<00:06:36.110> back<00:06:36.530> into<00:06:36.830> the

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:36.890 
solutions gonna fall down back into the

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:38.860 
solutions gonna fall down back into the
work<00:06:37.100> and<00:06:37.670> I've<00:06:38.000> provide<00:06:38.360> a<00:06:38.390> little<00:06:38.630> bit<00:06:38.720> of

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
work and I've provide a little bit of

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.410 
work and I've provide a little bit of
each<00:06:39.560> nutrient<00:06:40.190> for<00:06:40.610> the<00:06:40.760> remaining<00:06:41.120> ease

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
each nutrient for the remaining ease

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.720 
each nutrient for the remaining ease
that<00:06:41.690> are<00:06:41.780> in<00:06:41.960> suspension<00:06:42.590> inside<00:06:43.250> them<00:06:43.460> here

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
that are in suspension inside them here

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.970
