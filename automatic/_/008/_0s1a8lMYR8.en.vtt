00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:08.760
 dance all guys here you have minute rules 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.900
 in this new commentary yes this is 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:17.789
 a comment is not a live 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.939
 nothing today i have some arguments from da 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:26.840
 bring you to explain something in short 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.130
 who knows the date of the entries 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.660
 background but we are registered at 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.739
 gameplay so I do a little effort 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:39.270
 remove I see then lower the volume is 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:42.930
 however this 2 with the new play and that is 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:46.620
 it's not really gameplay and of between 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.530
 quotation marks a wide sheet of film 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.149
 in her, in short, that recording that 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.730
 so he came to the cock on the wall 2 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.570
 the only one I needed to do this 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.699
 comment I used this but it is not if 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.180
 it is not the result of the Madonna della 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.489
 gameplay pity indeed rightly so 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.330
 what I had to bring it into this 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.340
 video 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 however there is a 46 24 but stuff like that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.880
 but there is everything says kg here while meanwhile from 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.439
 we still talk about the beautiful hacker 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.610
 a moment of the subject is then me 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.640
 I wanted to talk a little about the fact that 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:35.210
 there youtuber we say famous if so 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.370
 we want to call them that always tend to 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.450
 control of the two commented 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:46.760
 they always tend to do it with famous people 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.710
 how now no the second is 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:54.090
 very wrong because I tell him if I had 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.950
 a channel with 30 40 thousand subscribers that me 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.479
 I think I would do like a series where 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.530
 at least once a week between 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.720
 commentaries with a file someone who 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.300
 maybe I ca n't exceed 3 400 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.080
 subscribers 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:12.330
 that is, they really talk so much about the fact 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.209
 who want to help these things here but 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.340
 I will not this just can not do 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.040
 I see right 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:22.380
 then okay everyone to free to do that 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.190
 which he wants however resumed 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.840
 I would definitely do it for them 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:34.140
 more point then there is also the fact that 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:36.170
 sometimes like to do commenting with 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.180
 these people in famous quotation marks 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:46.020
 organized of the contest on purpose we are but 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.450
 what the fuck do not understand their knowing that 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:54.600
 the police bother where indeed 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:58.470
 however there is help someone because if 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.870
 This would not you feel that I 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.470
 damage when I look at a commentary 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:08.250
 maybe the winner of a contest that 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:11.280
 that makes the video with those who do 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.260
 the organized in short enough juric e 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.530
 I practically all this the 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:23.760
 I notice the great almost facial annoyance 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:26.550
 because I know it is difficult to explain 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.320
 this speech because it is not much 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.560
 simple because in any case they are not 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.600
 as a youtube with 30 40 thousand 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.209
 subscribers so I can't even tell you 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:43.160
 because maybe these things don't do it here 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:47.310
 I know very well that time anyway 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.130
 everyone has the time they can find for 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.150
 make these videos but I don't think so 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.600
 that the ten minutes a week a white 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.150
 huber 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.000
 if you want famous just the all 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.900
 time to make videos with fans e 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.900
 this is really mine 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:09.330
 I almost wanted myself anyway 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.930
 I think we say with this they fall 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.610
 emerging youtuber that surely a 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.760
 but no 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.799
 I do not say that it should have but 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.060
 however it would be clicks that you would not give 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.570
 annoyance because you need love from 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.570
 but somebody there is this one 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.570
 I do n't know how the fuck is said 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.580
 that the more you see that they are willing 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.580
 to lend a hand also the fact that l 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.570
 video sponsorship and what 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.610
 so it is up to them to make the last 30 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.950
 seconds of a video sponsor between 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.200
 four channels and videos what the fuck me 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:51.990
 it costs that what many people would give 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.180
 at least no you know what it is like with 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.610
 what fills the last last minutes of 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.470
 all your videos, that is, the boys 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.320
 really if it should come to have 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.840
 even one thousand two thousand subscribers will be the 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.900
 first to do this thing to help 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:10.440
 all really all even though he is 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.570
 on the cock you're asshole 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.650
 anyway if i was at the time i 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:19.680
 clothes I had I my the 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.860
 my anxious little audience whether or fatigue 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.560
 to receive me like and comments and so I know 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.960
 how we feel committed to showing 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.720
 maybe I don't get it right 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.120
 the right attention to the right space 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.039
 so really if I should arrive 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.860
 from these goals 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:41.120
 that would be the first thing 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.800
 think about helping others 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.349
 nothing then the topic of today was a 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.360
 this is the fact that these youtube 

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:53.400
 we say famous that I don't think so 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:55.020
 they devote a lot is something they are 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.240
 according to me if they would not be required to 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.259
 do however in their shoes there 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.780
 we are the ones we say, like me 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:05.159
 we know how it feels anyway 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.330
 save even them how it feels to 

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:13.219
 then be emerging youtubers 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.219
 all those guys anyway 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:20.160
 I respect very much the decisions of the 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.530
 great Italians 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.990
 but I repeat, everyone is free to do 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.720
 what he wants 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:32.770
 everyone is free to make people commit with 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.740
 but who wants a little more than tourism there 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.380
 would be in this community here is this 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.980
 it is a small criticism that I would like 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:45.100
 do so that in any case it is me of the other 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:49.990
 channel and canal and the one with thousands of 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:51.520
 subscribers here yes once was me 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:54.479
 required to customize the channel but 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.940
 I did n't do it not because I did n't want to 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:07:01.000
 absolutely but because we say how 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:04.750
 are kept by a chaste party to make you by 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.180
 play so I forgot but how 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.669
 so I immediately said yes here is the 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.370
 person who asked me so so 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:13.360
 I think it should be helping 

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:18.310
 that your own situation is going 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:20.860
 no point guys if this video there 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.960
 both enjoyed not gameplay not them 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:26.140
 look at that for a look at that 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.870
 that you close the commentaries if this 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:31.050
 that puts you liked this online 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:34.810
 comment if you are not registered do it 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:37.120
 please and we hope nothing these 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:39.150
 youtuber will give us a hand and hello to everyone 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.150
 boys
