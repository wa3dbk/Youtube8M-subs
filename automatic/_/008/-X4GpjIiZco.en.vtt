here's I'm gonna show you a view here of
my<00:00:12.389> other<00:00:12.809> project<00:00:13.320> I've<00:00:13.469> been<00:00:13.500> doing

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150

it's a 1980 dodge with the slant six and
they<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.390> two<00:00:27.510> spring<00:00:27.780> load<00:00:27.930> these<00:00:28.080> things

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
they have two spring load these things

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.119 
they have two spring load these things
video<00:00:28.880> there<00:00:29.880> we<00:00:29.940> go

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:32.129 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:34.310 

I'm<00:00:32.850> still<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.570> process<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:34.079> getting<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
I'm still in the process of getting a

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.300 
I'm still in the process of getting a
tune<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.010> got<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.280> timing<00:00:37.160> pretty<00:00:38.160> much

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
tune I just got the timing pretty much

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.390 
tune I just got the timing pretty much
figured<00:00:38.640> out<00:00:38.760> but<00:00:39.600> now<00:00:39.750> I'm<00:00:39.900> just<00:00:40.250> tuning<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
figured out but now I'm just tuning the

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:47.300 
figured out but now I'm just tuning the
carburetor<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:42.950> 390<00:00:44.960> four-barrel<00:00:46.310> vacuum

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310 
carburetor a 390 four-barrel vacuum

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.139 
carburetor a 390 four-barrel vacuum
secondary<00:00:47.820> Holley<00:00:49.489> so<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.790> I<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:50.970> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
secondary Holley so and I have the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.130 
secondary Holley so and I have the
Clifford<00:00:51.570> intake<00:00:51.930> headers<00:00:52.380> and<00:00:54.110> yeah

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
Clifford intake headers and yeah

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.190 
Clifford intake headers and yeah
Clippers<00:00:55.530> headers<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.370> intakes<00:00:56.930> so<00:00:57.930> pretty

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
Clippers headers and intakes so pretty

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.450 
Clippers headers and intakes so pretty
much<00:00:58.320> everything<00:00:58.620> else<00:00:58.860> is<00:00:59.010> stock<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.430> think

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
much everything else is stock I think

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.270 
much everything else is stock I think
that's<00:00:59.760> even<00:00:59.880> the<00:01:00.030> original<00:01:00.450> starter<00:01:01.130> when<00:01:02.130> I

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that's even the original starter when I

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.130 
that's even the original starter when I
bought<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.700> truck<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.450> I<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.840> got<00:01:03.989> finished

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
bought the truck so I just got finished

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.350 
bought the truck so I just got finished
converting<00:01:04.469> it<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.399> power<00:01:05.610> steering<00:01:06.180> there

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
converting it that power steering there

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.750 
converting it that power steering there
was<00:01:06.479> nothing<00:01:06.810> there<00:01:07.049> before<00:01:07.610> except<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
was nothing there before except the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.310 
was nothing there before except the
brackets<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.280> air<00:01:11.280> pump<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.840> but<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
brackets to the air pump so but then I

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.260 
brackets to the air pump so but then I
went<00:01:14.070> out<00:01:14.190> to<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.370> picking<00:01:14.729> pool<00:01:14.940> got<00:01:15.120> some

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
went out to the picking pool got some

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
went out to the picking pool got some
new<00:01:15.360> brackets<00:01:15.870> and<00:01:16.110> added<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.040> power

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
new brackets and added the power

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.160 
new brackets and added the power
steering<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.030> does<00:01:18.690> a<00:01:18.720> pretty<00:01:18.870> good<00:01:19.020> job

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
steering and it does a pretty good job

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.450 
steering and it does a pretty good job
lining<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:22.670> here's<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.760> view<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:25.460> power

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
lining up here's a view of the power

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.630 
lining up here's a view of the power
steering<00:01:26.760> block<00:01:27.409> tell<00:01:28.409> how<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.680> swap<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.369> out

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
steering block tell how to swap that out

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.600 
steering block tell how to swap that out
and<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.299> ended<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.049> stripping<00:01:31.470> out<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.680> pit<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
and I ended up stripping out the pit the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.480 
and I ended up stripping out the pit the
drop<00:01:32.850> arm<00:01:33.119> boat<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:34.220> don't<00:01:35.220> know<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.400> can

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
drop arm boat I don't know if you can

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.730 
drop arm boat I don't know if you can
see<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.820> very<00:01:35.939> well<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:37.320> not<00:01:37.409> actually

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
see that very well but it's not actually

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.410

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
all the way on there so I wouldn't be

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.870 
all the way on there so I wouldn't be
surprised<00:01:39.689> fell<00:01:40.110> off<00:01:40.320> on<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.560> road<00:01:40.880> then
