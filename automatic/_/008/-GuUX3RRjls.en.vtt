00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:10.139
 the calculation of the flirt and the deadlock now I 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:13.049
 knitting pattern of this topic I want 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.730
 tell me how I calculated my top 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.970
 and how to calculate you I push off 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.930
 the fact that I have this at all 90 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:33.120
 centimeters 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:37.680
 rather not the width of the volume so I have to 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:43.050
 was going to the wind that he died pretty 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.879
 long and so here I am 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:51.300
 focused on hips 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:54.420
 if you have a drawing that you can choose 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.640
 expand you can navigate need 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.600
 district 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.890
 that is, after all start knitting yoke 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.949
 this part 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:09.750
 fangs volume you will have this half 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.880
 back half to the front if you take before 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.720
 and back 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.720
 that we allow your chest volume and if 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.970
 can expand to this size 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:26.670
 for not so important they can be equal a 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:33.090
 if we have some here over all and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:36.630
 how do i equal and green it will be 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.659
 that is, up to the hips you can orient 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.340
 on death beat if you knit the king 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.070
 somehow you can target death to day 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.640
 I hope here / or 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.829
 than i said so a little bit flooded and 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.640
 here here we still have to prune for 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:02:00.149
 the sleeves here are also determined by one 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.030
 how much will you take here 5 cm from here 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.729
 each side here from the back on 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:13.200
 my sleeve and from the front must 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:18.510
 and just get 5 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:23.370
 510 from the other side 10 but I took you 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:27.780
 yourself 2 here here is your half so 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.739
 the sides of the back that is and therefore i have 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:39.209
 total size was hip size grandpa 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:45.470
 centimeter and I took 10 centimeters on 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:50.849
 drink ip-address and that is 9110 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:54.209
 180 and as a result so it will be the green 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:57.650
 This half of ours is completely taken from 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.200
 I got 40 centimeters 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.470
 flirt it does not fit in a circle 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.440
 and I fit first, I start from the back 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:16.530
 that is, it is very close to be 40 centimeters 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:21.299
 and wrote up then I did not take 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:25.109
 hostile bones and stitch on 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:29.670
 man before right away but you are all 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:33.420
 will see the resident when the yoke was 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:38.160
 connected I added loops on here 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:41.840
 man tie a part with him I hope 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.840
