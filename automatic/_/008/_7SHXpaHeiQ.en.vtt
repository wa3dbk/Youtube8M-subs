00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:08.120
 and how is today he spends all day being 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.670
 a lamp to give to light up for 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.380
 the videos and well I decided to do it 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.230
 like in tutorial plan so that you 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.090
 can see how I did it and suddenly 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.860
 someone works well is the 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.690
 finished lamp I need to change the 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.350
 suiche from above but basically remains 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.230
 well materials two tubes one of a 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:33.290
 inch and one half inch pvc a 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:35.590
 heap of co2 from jim palmer I lived four 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.630
 reductions three quarters to a half inch 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:44.750
 two reductions from one inch to three 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:50.120
 rooms 6 kos of half an inch 2 kos of 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:53.570
 one inch 5 t of half an inch two 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:59.010
 one-inch rings eight tubes of 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:03.579
 half and two of 342 socrates 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.759
 any glue for pvc tube a hacksaw 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:11.320
 or a jigsaw or something to cut 

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:14.140
 the pvc tubes we need to cut 6 tubes 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.009
 40 centimeters of media tube 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:21.270
 inch and cut two of 19 centimeters 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:21.270
 from the same tube 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.280
 now we need two tubes of one 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.259
 inch 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.909
 I'm going to use the 90 centimeters for 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.119
 that my lamp has more or less one 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.189
 height of one meter eighty 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.610
 you can cut it to the height that 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.920
 it suits them well now let's put together 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.170
 the base of the lamp for this we are going to 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.140
 take the 40- centimeter tubes and 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.530
 let's put a half-inch elbow 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:56.009
 in the extremes we are going to do it in 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.479
 rectangle shape between the end of 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.310
 those tubes we're going to place 23 so that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.250
 they are going to do the part that is going to go up 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.700
 towards the base of the lamp we are going to 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.480
 place two tubes more than 40 centimeters 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.610
 and at the end 2 more kos to form 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.340
 the rectangle that is going to be the base of the 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.750
 can 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.819
 then they have the list base in between 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.260
 everything can see the parts with the glue 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.260
 pvc so that it is firm 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.120
 now let's use the two tubes of 19 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:33.819
 centimeters that we cut and we're going to 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.260
 put the tn in the middle now this 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:40.269
 tube that we put together we are going to put it in 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.269
 the base and we would have to base ready 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.519
 Well first of all I recommend them 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.540
 be careful when you use the earth 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:53.700
 or something like that because I cut myself 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.040
 let's take the productions of a 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.560
 inch three quarters and three quarters a 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.010
 half an inch together with the bits of 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.580
 tube that we cut to make a base 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.580
 for the tube 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.700
 now let's take the junctions should 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.400
 half an inch to three quarters to make 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:41.440
 the base of the lamp and we will use the 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:43.780
 the one-inch elbows on the joint 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.110
 of three quarters to make the base where 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.970
 going to go the socket is when they have all 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.849
 Ready pieces can use glue 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.040
 to fix the parts 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.329
 we need to make two pieces of this one 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:02.920
 for each sócates that we are going to place 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:05.470
 well I made the base by joining two three 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.800
 a parallel division towards the two 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.599
 parts of the lamp that are these and the 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.690
 another to remove the cables from 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:17.079
 feeding what would be the 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:20.109
 sócates then these two parts are going to 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.730
 go connected to each other and the part 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.730
 up are going to go the two touches 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.680
 good and having everything armed you see something 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.169
 more or less they can use the unions 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.180
 of an inch to extend or shorten 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.180
 the tube and change the size of the sheet 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.370
 good now to do the wiring 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:44.370
 electrical we are going to connect some cables 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.979
 to the sócates and we will continue this 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.050
 illustration to connect the switch 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.599
 of the lamp 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.280
 is a cable that is going to be the neutral what 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:55.020
 let's connect directly in the 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.060
 neutral line that will go towards the 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.560
 outlet and the other cable that goes to 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.470
 being the positive is going to go towards 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.720
 switch 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.700
 the other cable next to it coming out of the 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.540
 switch will go to the positive line 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.540
 going towards the outlet 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.240
 and 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:37.569
 below the description I leave the 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:40.169
 materials that separate a lamp 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:43.809
 and good for you to see them tell you 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:45.129
 if it suits them to do it or not so good 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:47.649
 I hope this tutorial is working 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:49.639
 if they have any comments on how 

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:51.590
 improve them 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.259
 or any question below in the 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:59.139
 comments I will try to answer you 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:59.139
 when can and well, see you
