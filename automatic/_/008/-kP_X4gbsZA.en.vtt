the keyboard any time to go over to your
keyboard<00:02:22.250> it<00:02:22.700> slows<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.030> down<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.329> little<00:02:23.540> bit

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
keyboard it slows it down a little bit

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.240 
keyboard it slows it down a little bit
but<00:02:23.989> now<00:02:24.170> since<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.650> keyboard<00:02:25.070> or<00:02:25.220> the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
but now since the keyboard or the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.550 
but now since the keyboard or the
spotlight<00:02:25.730> doesn't<00:02:26.120> pop<00:02:26.239> up<00:02:27.310> it's<00:02:28.310> smooth<00:02:29.560> you

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
spotlight doesn't pop up it's smooth you

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.680 
spotlight doesn't pop up it's smooth you
can<00:02:30.709> also<00:02:30.860> do<00:02:31.100> your<00:02:31.310> I<00:02:31.340> composition<00:02:32.239> so<00:02:32.510> where

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
can also do your I composition so where

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.150 
can also do your I composition so where
you<00:02:32.840> can<00:02:32.989> have<00:02:33.200> multiple<00:02:34.190> icons<00:02:34.880> um<00:02:35.390> in

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
you can have multiple icons um in

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.530 
you can have multiple icons um in
different<00:02:37.160> positions<00:02:37.250> so<00:02:38.030> if<00:02:38.150> you<00:02:38.239> drag<00:02:38.510> it

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540
