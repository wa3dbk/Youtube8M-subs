00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
today I am working on another tutorial

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.200 
today I am working on another tutorial
video<00:00:05.779> I'm<00:00:06.779> still<00:00:07.140> doing<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.680> o-ring<00:00:08.639> mod<00:00:08.849> on

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
video I'm still doing the o-ring mod on

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.470 
video I'm still doing the o-ring mod on
my<00:00:09.599> second<00:00:10.050> Das<00:00:10.170> Keyboard<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:11.240> when<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:12.269> did

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
my second Das Keyboard and when I did

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.759 
my second Das Keyboard and when I did
the<00:00:12.570> first<00:00:12.599> one<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:13.019> didn't<00:00:13.349> know<00:00:13.469> if<00:00:13.590> I<00:00:13.679> was

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
the first one I didn't know if I was

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.220 
the first one I didn't know if I was
going<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.099> pull<00:00:14.490> off<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.179> stabilized<00:00:15.690> keys<00:00:16.049> or

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
going to pull off the stabilized keys or

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.740 
going to pull off the stabilized keys or
not<00:00:16.410> because<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.160> be<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.750> dangerous

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
not because it can be a dangerous

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.150 
not because it can be a dangerous
process<00:00:19.230> if<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.710> don't<00:00:19.740> know<00:00:19.949> what<00:00:20.039> you're

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
process if you don't know what you're

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.700 
process if you don't know what you're
doing<00:00:20.430> but<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.789> took<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.300> chance<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:21.990> found

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
doing but I took the chance and I found

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.269 
doing but I took the chance and I found
it<00:00:22.890> really<00:00:23.130> wasn't<00:00:23.369> too<00:00:23.670> difficult<00:00:24.000> and<00:00:25.279> I'm

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
it really wasn't too difficult and I'm

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.410 
it really wasn't too difficult and I'm
going<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.550> go<00:00:26.670> ahead<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.939> show<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.119> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
going to go ahead and show you the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.689 
going to go ahead and show you the
method<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.960> I<00:00:28.019> use<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:29.010> remove<00:00:29.460> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
method that I use to remove the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.150 
method that I use to remove the
stabilized<00:00:30.179> keys<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.859> ever<00:00:31.949> have

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
stabilized keys so that if you ever have

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.680 
stabilized keys so that if you ever have
to<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.520> yourself<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.059> should<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> good

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
to do it yourself you should have a good

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.069 
to do it yourself you should have a good
method<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.140> do<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:34.640> so<00:00:35.640> I'm<00:00:36.000> trying<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.899> stay

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
method to do it so I'm trying to stay

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.080 
method to do it so I'm trying to stay
out<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> camera<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> best<00:00:38.129> as<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.550> but

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
out of the camera the best as I can but

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.850 
out of the camera the best as I can but
we'll<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.930> looks<00:00:40.020> when<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.350> put<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.800> all

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
we'll see how it looks when I put it all

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.830 
we'll see how it looks when I put it all
together<00:00:41.040> first<00:00:41.969> things<00:00:42.239> first<00:00:42.329> I'm<00:00:42.660> going<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
together first things first I'm going to

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.560 
together first things first I'm going to
do<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.969> spacebar<00:00:44.969> because<00:00:45.300> it'll<00:00:45.480> be<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
do the spacebar because it'll be the

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.510 
do the spacebar because it'll be the
easiest<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.200> it's<00:00:46.469> also<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.980> easiest<00:00:47.309> to

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
easiest to see it's also the easiest to

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.830 
easiest to see it's also the easiest to
do<00:00:47.640> so<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> might<00:00:48.090> want<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.300> practice<00:00:48.690> with

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
do so you might want to practice with

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.049 
do so you might want to practice with
that<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.280> I'm<00:00:50.280> going<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:50.579> ahead<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:50.940> pull

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
that one I'm going to go ahead and pull

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.029 
that one I'm going to go ahead and pull
off<00:00:51.180> all<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.510> keys<00:00:51.750> around<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> make

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
off all the keys around it just to make

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.950 
off all the keys around it just to make
this<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.309> little<00:00:53.399> bit<00:00:53.610> easier<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> let's<00:00:57.390> see<00:00:57.629> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
this a little bit easier so let's see I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.139 
this a little bit easier so let's see I
got<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.590> cheap<00:00:59.070> generic<00:00:59.250> key<00:00:59.699> puller<00:00:59.940> I'll

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
got the cheap generic key puller I'll

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.479 
got the cheap generic key puller I'll
use<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.539> pull<00:01:00.719> these<00:01:00.899> these<00:01:01.770> alt<00:01:02.010> keys<00:01:02.280> off

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
use to pull these these alt keys off

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:15.649 
use to pull these these alt keys off
with<00:01:13.040> for<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.220> spacebar<00:01:15.090> though<00:01:15.360> I'm

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
with for the spacebar though I'm

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.320 
with for the spacebar though I'm
actually<00:01:15.810> going<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.200> use<00:01:16.290> my<00:01:16.640> self<00:01:17.640> fashioned

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
actually going to use my self fashioned

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.050 
actually going to use my self fashioned
folders<00:01:19.020> because<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:20.430> get<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.640> both<00:01:20.790> sides

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
folders because I can get to both sides

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.530 
folders because I can get to both sides
of<00:01:21.270> it

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
of it

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.460 
of it
so<00:01:22.350> here's<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.680> trick<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:24.119> key<00:01:24.390> is<00:01:24.600> only<00:01:25.229> on

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
so here's the trick the key is only on

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.460 
so here's the trick the key is only on
one<00:01:25.650> switch<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.280> center<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:28.049> both

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
one switch in the center and on both

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.490 
one switch in the center and on both
sides<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.040> stabilizers<00:01:29.640> are<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:31.350> want

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
sides the stabilizers are there you want

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.010 
sides the stabilizers are there you want
to<00:01:31.560> pull<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.630> constant<00:01:33.630> but

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
to pull up with a constant but

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.429 
to pull up with a constant but
controlled<00:01:34.409> force<00:01:34.759> just<00:01:35.759> enough<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.540> pull<00:01:36.810> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
controlled force just enough to pull the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.420 
controlled force just enough to pull the
key<00:01:37.650> off<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.369> switch<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:39.150> not<00:01:39.329> put

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
key off of the switch but not put

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.980 
key off of the switch but not put
tension<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.640> pressure<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.390> stabilizers

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
tension and pressure on the stabilizers

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.260 
tension and pressure on the stabilizers
causing<00:01:43.350> some<00:01:43.500> kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.740> damage<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.310> I'm<00:01:45.060> going

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
causing some kind of damage so I'm going

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:57.550 
causing some kind of damage so I'm going
to<00:01:45.329> do<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.110> now<00:01:56.149> that<00:01:57.149> was

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
to do that now that was

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.749 
to do that now that was
really<00:01:57.799> didn't<00:01:57.950> take<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.130> whole<00:01:58.340> lot<00:01:58.369> of<00:01:58.549> force

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
really didn't take a whole lot of force

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.289 
really didn't take a whole lot of force
there<00:01:58.970> now<00:01:59.840> the<00:01:59.899> key<00:02:00.200> is<00:02:00.229> loose<00:02:01.060> what<00:02:02.060> we<00:02:02.119> want

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
there now the key is loose what we want

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.399 
there now the key is loose what we want
to<00:02:02.360> do<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.630> just<00:02:02.780> kind<00:02:02.930> of<00:02:02.990> work<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.380> little

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
to do is just kind of work it a little

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.490 
to do is just kind of work it a little
bit<00:02:04.000> so<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:05.210> can<00:02:05.360> kind<00:02:06.259> of<00:02:06.320> push<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.740> back<00:02:08.500> you

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
bit so you can kind of push it back you

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.960 
bit so you can kind of push it back you
push<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:09.920> back<00:02:09.950> like<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:10.520> you're<00:02:10.819> going

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
push it back like this and you're going

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.740 
push it back like this and you're going
to<00:02:11.060> expose<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:12.080> underside<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.800> key<00:02:13.750> and

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
to expose the underside of the key and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:15.729 
to expose the underside of the key and
what<00:02:14.870> you're<00:02:14.989> going<00:02:15.080> to<00:02:15.170> have<00:02:15.319> here<00:02:15.530> is<00:02:15.560> a

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
what you're going to have here is a

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.990 
what you're going to have here is a
metal<00:02:16.099> bar<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:17.269> is<00:02:17.540> slid<00:02:17.900> into<00:02:18.640> two<00:02:19.640> plastic

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
metal bar that is slid into two plastic

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.559 
metal bar that is slid into two plastic
tabs<00:02:20.480> on<00:02:20.750> each<00:02:20.900> end<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.440> key<00:02:22.239> so<00:02:23.239> instead

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
tabs on each end of the key so instead

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:24.940 
tabs on each end of the key so instead
use<00:02:23.720> needle<00:02:23.989> nose<00:02:24.019> pliers<00:02:24.380> but<00:02:24.680> for<00:02:24.830> me<00:02:24.920> I

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
use needle nose pliers but for me I

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.970 
use needle nose pliers but for me I
found<00:02:25.220> that<00:02:25.430> a<00:02:25.489> flat<00:02:26.440> screwdriver<00:02:27.440> worked

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
found that a flat screwdriver worked

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.699 
found that a flat screwdriver worked
much<00:02:28.489> easier<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.930> one<00:02:30.080> here<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.380> actually

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
much easier this one here is actually

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.220 
much easier this one here is actually
just<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:31.010> right<00:02:31.160> size<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.370> fit<00:02:31.850> in<00:02:32.090> there<00:02:33.019> and

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
just the right size to fit in there and

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.750 
just the right size to fit in there and
bend<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:33.890> metal<00:02:33.920> out<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.430> way

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
bend the metal out of the way

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.340 
bend the metal out of the way
now<00:02:35.540> what<00:02:35.660> I'm<00:02:35.750> going<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.900> be<00:02:35.989> doing<00:02:36.110> is<00:02:36.260> I'm

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
now what I'm going to be doing is I'm

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.680 
now what I'm going to be doing is I'm
going<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.530> be<00:02:36.590> pushing<00:02:36.920> on<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.970> key<00:02:38.209> one<00:02:38.510> way

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
going to be pushing on the key one way

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.350 
going to be pushing on the key one way
and<00:02:39.100> prying<00:02:40.100> on<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.519> metal<00:02:40.760> bar<00:02:40.910> or<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.209> other

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
and prying on the metal bar or the other

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.860

way<00:02:41.540> just<00:02:41.750> to<00:02:42.260> get<00:02:42.410> enough<00:02:42.769> clearance<00:02:43.130> to

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
way just to get enough clearance to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.330 
way just to get enough clearance to
remove<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.680> metal<00:02:45.799> bar<00:02:46.010> out<00:02:46.190> of<00:02:46.220> the

push down on the center of the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.160 
push down on the center of the
stabilizing<00:04:26.410> bar<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:27.520> pick<00:04:27.760> it<00:04:27.910> up<00:04:28.120> while<00:04:29.050> you

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
stabilizing bar to pick it up while you

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.670 
stabilizing bar to pick it up while you
can't<00:04:29.410> reach<00:04:29.560> it<00:04:29.680> with<00:04:29.800> your<00:04:29.920> fingers<00:04:31.680> and

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
can't reach it with your fingers and

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.530 
can't reach it with your fingers and
again<00:04:33.640> I'm<00:04:33.730> going<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:33.880> have<00:04:34.000> to<00:04:34.120> kind<00:04:34.270> of<00:04:34.390> get

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
again I'm going to have to kind of get

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.220 
again I'm going to have to kind of get
in<00:04:34.600> front<00:04:34.780> of<00:04:34.840> the<00:04:34.900> camera<00:04:35.170> to<00:04:35.260> do<00:04:35.410> this<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:38.200> I

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
in front of the camera to do this and I

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:56.870 
in front of the camera to do this and I
got<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.410> little<00:04:38.500> bit<00:04:38.680> the<00:04:38.740> grease<00:04:38.950> on<00:04:39.100> my<00:04:39.160> hand<00:04:39.460> -

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.130 

all<00:04:57.880> right<00:04:58.060> that<00:04:58.330> was<00:04:58.480> a<00:04:58.510> little<00:04:58.720> harder

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
all right that was a little harder

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.200 
all right that was a little harder
because<00:04:59.169> the<00:04:59.500> angle<00:04:59.770> I'm<00:04:59.830> working<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.340> but

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
because the angle I'm working it but

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.110 
because the angle I'm working it but
once<00:05:01.390> you<00:05:01.890> get<00:05:02.890> it<00:05:03.040> on<00:05:03.160> there<00:05:03.370> you<00:05:03.760> have<00:05:03.970> the

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
once you get it on there you have the
