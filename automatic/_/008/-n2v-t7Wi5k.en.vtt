00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hey people's how we go again and 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.359
 Welcome to a small one 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.639
 berg fidel 1 beta tricking guide with the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.740
 your performance and your moment in the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.210
 you can improve the game 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.009
 battlefield hardliner is launched 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.420
 version 2 is just start and a lot outside 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.820
 then determined on January and performance 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.039
 problems what the performance in itself 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.570
 frames the frames per second or else 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.740
 that mouse movement is concerned and I have 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.810
 here are a few tips on starting with those 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.500
 quickly improve your performance 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.199
 First of all we should do this in here 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.579
 the bfh kleinpeter two folders go the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.920
 path below in the video description 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.750
 linked where the whole is located there 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.170
 Once made via right click and 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.059
 new a new text document on this 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.469
 text document gives you in below 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.070
 the video description code located 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.510
 on 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.829
 this one looks like this 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.600
 Commands have different 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.980
 impact on your game 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.050
 that already existed at battlefield 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.579
 4 times there has me and many 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.079
 other neat housing around 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.760
 to blow the performance accordingly 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.430
 the highest value may be important 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.369
 explain games home point maxwell fps 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.470
 Blank and then the numbers 145 sets 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.869
 fixed how many frames per second you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.820
 maximum in the game have or 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.590
 what number you lure them if you 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.090
 So you have a 60 heart monitor you can 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.770
 here should enter 60 , however 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.229
 always a few frames be over it 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.380
 I have a heart monitor because of that 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.420
 I'm here to 145 heart to this 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.119
 a frame over it to be powder 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.400
 lake shore fps gives you in game 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.530
 standard in the upper right corner 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.240
 the frames per second to what actually 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.560
 as practical is around here an overview 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.790
 to have them turn off 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.110
 then you just go back in 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.030
 this config pure and makes instead of the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.729
 once the zero or just delete that 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.799
 completely out when he goes there from to 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.299
 file save under must of course 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.420
 make sure that you continue in the 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.420
 folder bfh beta 2 since and here are yes 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.860
 now a small written user point 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.840
 cfg so that we create one 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.790
 config file the second one must be on it 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.710
 Pay attention that you are not down at the type 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.020
 text file are available but all 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.880
 files then save the whole and 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.399
 if you do that then you see that 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.709
 here our user point cfg no 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.770
 text document is more but a cfg 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.360
 file 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.980
 other important changes we 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.970
 should exist in the ingame 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.770
 options 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.900
 just what the graphics area but 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.950
 Also in the gameplay options are here 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.490
 already doing things we change 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.170
 should 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.000
 The first thing we do is start with the network 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.810
 rescue factors already known 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.790
 battlefield 4 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.700
 we should set it to zero around the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.430
 latency to improve it accordingly 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.740
 further would have to worth the network update 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.750
 Setting down here by car on 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.700
 to optimize the whole thing even further 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.290
 arrived in the graphics options should 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.030
 right here on the right side 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.450
 Pay attention to the following attitude 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.010
 do 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.480
 if you wonder why he does it all 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.160
 You can not change this here 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.140
 on the left side in the lower field 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.180
 under graphics quality the whole up 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.040
 individually to this then too 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.880
 here explicitly each value individually 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.220
 to be able to adjust 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.080
 at the guitar quality or more 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.400
 Quality should pay attention to that 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.410
 Ultra remains for the presentation of 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.320
 not strongly influence objects 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.450
 but you should be especially delayed 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.670
 antialiasing post and rising and the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.990
 environment view completely turn down 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.730
 to just the appropriate 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.290
 to have performance boost right there 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.090
 Above all, these things de-icing 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.070
 stories neat performance 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.790
 move out of feeling accordingly 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.530
 improve 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.240
 Of course you should do the vertical one 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.040
 sync as sync 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.959
 turn off the whole 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.410
 to counteract and further 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.250
 override the rome in the bus 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.750
 turn it on, of course, here it is 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.310
 always gives a bit questionable 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.540
 say one the others say 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.920
 but I turned it on 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.420
 Just give it a try and we can 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.310
 also times ne long time with the 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.260
 value has also played on times 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.380
 Turn it off and check if it's you 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.910
 maybe a bit better 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.880
 that was already my tips and tricks 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.520
 to the performance suite for battlefield 3 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.740
 beta with you your fps a bit 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.090
 blow and make your call better 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.350
 if you want more 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.970
 then write down the comments 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.740
 whether you liked it and whether such 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.910
 also helped and let room 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.920
 unless you know her like that 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.320
 working in that sense was the goal in the 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.320
 eye is
