00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.740
 hello friends welcome to another tuto 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.290
 Tuesday 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:18.360
 I am leonardo pÃ©rez grandson and today we are going 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.360
 to draw a satellite 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.510
 with a compass we start drawing a 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.580
 half circle that will be the earth 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.150
 then we take some measurements and 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:34.050
 we started slapping the satellite its 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.860
 solar panels and the body itself 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.030
 We give a little bit of shape and detail to you 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.750
 I put a radar cited how rich 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.990
 then with a light blue piece 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.690
 we started to light the earth 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:52.460
 we leave some blank spaces or 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.980
 almost white that will be the clouds 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.079
 I think the sole was too light 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.290
 let's go over it with a little matter 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.900
 darker I do not think I was thrilled 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.720
 it came out a bit from 4 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.110
 we finished illuminating the surface of the 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.440
 planet and then with a cloth or a 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.020
 suede preferably we blur it 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.329
 this changes its appearance 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.380
 and with a moldable eraser or a 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:25.180
 normal eraser we make the clouds 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.780
 well and now with a black marker 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.270
 we draw the outer space 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.460
 first he used a fine tip for 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.040
 make the edges and so not to spend 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.229
 too much and then I change a tip 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.390
 thick to finish faster because no 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.280
 I want to go back old man doing this 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.280
 with a very thin tip 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:48.970
 with a sharp black pencil 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.820
 we detail in the solar panels and 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:55.070
 then we give the shadows and the shines 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.830
 to the satellite itself 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:01.680
 I want it to look like shiny metal 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.020
 with a hawthorn we blur 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.660
 the inspiration to make this drawing me 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.060
 came up reading a very good book that 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.780
 called bond that means something like that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.080
 as bold in this book written by 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.810
 Diamandis and Steven Kotler Peter speak 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.670
 of the new technologies that 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.190
 will revolutionize the world and how 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.010
 apply them to cause an impact 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.720
 positive in society 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:31.110
 Peter is a true futurist has 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.120
 created 15 high- tech companies and 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.220
 one of the most recent that is still in 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:41.190
 development will be dedicated to mining satellites 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.160
 asteroids that is to dig them for 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.350
 take out valuable metals and send them 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.060
 come back on earth so we will not have 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.069
 to do away with the resources of this 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.349
 planet and still be Galician 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.829
 By the way, the company is called Planet 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.749
 diffuser its planetary resources by itself 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.249
 you want to check and join this 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.079
 movement 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:03.730
 use a rule to interest some 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.770
 lines that I had left something 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.140
 undulating egypt 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.320
 and with a gray marker we give tone to 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.630
 the panels returning to the subject results 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.960
 that there are thousands of asteroids in orbit 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.120
 around the sun rich in metals and 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.790
 we can take advantage of them 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.030
 with the white pencil we sharpened the edge of 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.280
 the earth and we create the stars with a 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.709
 white cake we shine on the 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:34.049
 satellite then we do in the glow 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.049
 of the earth and ready 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.960
 if you liked it please give it a like 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.900
 Share it with your friends and subscribe to 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:52.080
 fun art you know where you can
