remapping<00:00:38.100> now<00:00:38.370> very<00:00:38.670> nice<00:00:39.420> feature<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.899> was

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
remapping now very nice feature I was

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.470 
remapping now very nice feature I was
playing<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:41.520> game<00:00:41.760> play<00:00:41.969> here<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.210> was

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
playing on the this game play here I was

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.500 
playing on the this game play here I was
playing<00:00:42.840> with<00:00:43.050> just<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.379> basic<00:00:43.590> setup<00:00:44.340> as<00:00:44.550> I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
playing with just the basic setup as I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.060 
playing with just the basic setup as I
play<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.899> more<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.350> understand<00:00:46.770> what

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
play it more and I understand what

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.049 
play it more and I understand what
buttons<00:00:47.370> do<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:47.940> would<00:00:48.239> move<00:00:48.989> them<00:00:49.140> around

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
buttons do what I would move them around

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.220 
buttons do what I would move them around
so<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> idea<00:00:51.210> here<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.020> sort<00:00:52.170> of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
so the idea here it's like it's sort of

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.229 
so the idea here it's like it's sort of
a<00:00:52.289> Tetris<00:00:52.710> II<00:00:52.829> kind<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.160> game<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:54.090> a

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
a Tetris II kind of game and a

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.180 
a Tetris II kind of game and a
combination<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.289> super<00:00:55.920> smash

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
combination of that and super smash

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.779 
combination of that and super smash
brothers<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.760> would<00:00:56.879> say<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.899> street<00:00:58.320> fighter

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
brothers I would say or street fighter

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.160 
brothers I would say or street fighter
but<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.910> put<00:01:00.120> certain<00:01:00.510> color<00:01:00.780> blocks

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
but you put certain color blocks

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.680 
but you put certain color blocks
together<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:02.460> when<00:01:02.579> you<00:01:02.670> build<00:01:02.850> squares<00:01:03.270> with

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
together and when you build squares with

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.800 
together and when you build squares with
them<00:01:03.930> they<00:01:04.170> become<00:01:04.549> weapons<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.600> bigger

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
them they become weapons and the bigger

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.800 
them they become weapons and the bigger
the<00:01:06.990> square<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.439> more<00:01:07.590> powerful<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> weapon

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
the square the more powerful the weapon

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.359 
the square the more powerful the weapon
this<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.990> definitely<00:01:10.170> not<00:01:10.439> my<00:01:10.500> best<00:01:10.799> game<00:01:11.159> by

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
quicker so I was just staying out of the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.610 
quicker so I was just staying out of the
game<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.299> most<00:02:22.540> time<00:02:22.750> possible<00:02:23.230> for<00:02:23.470> some

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
game the most time possible for some

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.509 
game the most time possible for some
reason<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:25.720> this<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.080> uneasy<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.370> it's

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
reason but this is uneasy so it's

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.620 
reason but this is uneasy so it's
nothing<00:02:27.640> too<00:02:27.940> spectacular<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:31.180> he<00:02:31.330> an<00:02:31.420> idea

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
nothing too spectacular but he an idea

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.880 
nothing too spectacular but he an idea
of<00:02:31.660> how<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.810> game<00:02:32.019> is<00:02:32.140> played<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.560> just<00:02:32.709> start

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
of how the game is played you just start

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.220 
of how the game is played you just start
building<00:02:33.269> blocks<00:02:34.269> and<00:02:34.599> you<00:02:34.720> can<00:02:34.870> go<00:02:34.959> Laser

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
building blocks and you can go Laser

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.559 
building blocks and you can go Laser
zand<00:02:35.709> rockets<00:02:36.160> and<00:02:36.400> then<00:02:36.880> I<00:02:37.030> think<00:02:37.209> one<00:02:37.540> of

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
zand rockets and then I think one of

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.940 
zand rockets and then I think one of
those<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.930> shield<00:02:40.620> again<00:02:41.620> I'm<00:02:41.769> just
