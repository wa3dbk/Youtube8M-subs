00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.580
 the 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:08.429
 the summer 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:09.840
 year a new session 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.150
 the central this is what I hear with it now I'm sitting here one 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.109
 concert hall 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:18.419
 people who already indicate now that the animals are sitting in the background 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:20.989
 very difficult part 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.319
 appropriate year 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:25.849
 I am kind of sentimental 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.909
 also at my age now a very sentimental one 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.510
 relationship with p 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.290
 it has meant so much in my life and for my music and for my 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.450
 education 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.890
 and the knowledge of my music the way I understood and learned music 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.250
 to have 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.780
 the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.220
 haha 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.220
 Hey 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.510
 this is the first time i see something like that 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.640
 another composers as subject have gotten picked select 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.920
 and 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.350
 the advantage for a piece of music so that made me think that it is me 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.280
 so had to try out a lot of things and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.520
 trying the friends 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.700
 hope so 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.340
 can fit in 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.300
 one in that jan that makes me feel very comfortable with group at home 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.300
 the organ 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.590
 and so we see how that is possible 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.480
 integrate 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.800
 the rest of the zeebrugge fish mine in Ostend that happened 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.870
 the 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.870
 cor pot pulled 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.130
 watch out then I play with a process of pasting 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.260
 at the same time playing the trade becomes mainly big leaps 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.830
 I want with other teams 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.560
 the big difference 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.560
 because she was too old 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.169
 yes yes that is true for example that of the piece 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.309
 governing is of course that an organ is always seen as a matter of course 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:39.339
 as something state street a sound 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.639
 And that is often still people often do not like and so it is whole 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.729
 expressive that can persist to soft different colors and your friend 

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:49.329
 has used the organ in such a way that it is and is not a static one, but correct 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.039
 very flexible and that has constantly grown and the shrinkage is amazing 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.929
 different 

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:57.249
 actually one the tastiest buyer actually has the finish 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.549
 but are happy
