 wards in the world suffers malnutrition that is seriously hampering 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.400
 can achieve the millennium goal of extreme poverty and the 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.570
 hunger in the world of all this we speak in this next report 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.849
 as well 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.849
 you feel August 2010 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.480
 a wave of heat as it has not been known for many years covers the country 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.739
 the theory of chaos states that the flutter of the butterfly in japan can cause 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:36.250
 furacán in another point of the world our globalized world a heat wave and 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.680
 fires in russia 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.499
 causes chaos in the form the food problem 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:44.429
 in the rest of the world it is already known as the wheat crisis 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.060
 Russia has passed in recent years to produce 4% between a global 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.930
 supply almost a third of the wheat that is consumed on the planet this year its 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.210
 crop will be lower rock September 2 the Russian government bans the 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.290
 exports and announces that it will continue like this until 2011 successes since after the 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.920
 announcement the prices of wheat rose dramatically other effects we 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.940
 they did wait 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.560
 as a collateral effect, the rest of the grains, mainly corn and soybeans, increased 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.890
 also of prices 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.060
 and as a direct effect the cost of animal feed went up 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.640
 the meat is also expensive 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.130
 in some countries the drastic rise in food prices 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.710
 causes disturbances 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.900
 in memory another recent crisis this time that of rice that caused the 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.369
 prices tripled on twitter arch riots and falls of governments 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.700
 but it is really the weather that causes a child to die every six seconds 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.159
 for maintenance because there are about one billion 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.270
 hungry 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.940
 but there are those who suddenly seem to me that Andalusia 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.530
 I guess appreciated the ones in brutal mind that goes 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.440
 simply 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.090
 that creates a psychosis that nothing of food that will take revenge 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.440
 yagüe-varea I made chelsea fans people think that no food for what 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.830
 to be 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.090
 We went to the urban gardens of the Tamarguillo Park in Seville 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.020
 where several associations have formed the food sovereignty group and 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.839
 gender 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:14.839
 they have helped us sell what is behind this crisis 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.980
 faa accitana toralín 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.079
 are not 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.079
 they are not the root causes of the wheat crisis 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.040
 the one that yield the witness shortens the farm exports of eight but already in 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.859
 June or July of that year the increase of what had been brutal efe that 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.409
 what happens in russia 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.519
 a lot come off from a foreign company and a lot of emaná te 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.609
 Russian have bought vacationers on that land in Russia 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.619
 and they have made carcesa importer of cheap wheat for the rest of the world 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.509
 then connected with this fire this drought 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.569
 a bit the price of wheat and it is predicted that it will sublimate 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.079
 chest the minister has made that apple will be less bad in it within three 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.629
 months after a pitch 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.179
 There have been many initiatives 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.699
 it's young people who are 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.010
 until it came to go through it napoles to haggle field cooperate 

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:05.809
 extraditions I did know how to do local traditional agriculture 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.809
 the araque was with field was sentenced today to 13 is emerging and I 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:14.549
 I think the positive one that surprised producers and ecological iredale 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.919
 ecological consumers that you treat to the good way in fact they trust to be able 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.249
 make a 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.469
 of food not business yes not a right 

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:26.409
 the way to be 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.019
 a right of the person 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:31.090
 I have to thank something social rush the merchandise 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.590
 in its price it is decided to achieve the international market in chicago where tahrir of 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.629
 russia then how do you operate this market 

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.769
 that one approach with the so-called future tuna contract or purchase well from a 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.459
 merchandise that already has your purchase an acacia road is going to produce between two 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.169
 years 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:52.659
 then what happens what the contract buys and how much more than this 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.879
 week was hired more 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.879
 peace - of the tram 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:01.739
 it's not just because food has become a financial product 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.029
 there are more reasons 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:06.359
 for example, the incidence of oil that increases the costs of 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:10.040
 production and transport also the large increase in demand for 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.709
 agricultural products in developed countries 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:13.819
 that every time 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.119
 grow less 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:19.400
 of what is produced in the world more than half is for fuels and for 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.400
 I think of cattle in ten western countries 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.589
 It also flows that the world food trade is in the hands of some 

00:04:27.589 --> 00:04:29.840
 few corporations 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.689
 but let's do a little history 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.659
 a turning point of recent history occurred in the 60s with 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:37.529
 the so-called green revolution 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.019
 the incorporation of modern agricultural procedures allowed earlier 

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:42.529
 crops per year 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.629
 but the critical voce highlights that not only did it not end the hunger of the world 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:50.009
 if not long term and made the viability of the model difficult this year 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.430
 less developed 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.120
 we are going through 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.140
 every time there is more fertilizer 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.629
 lacks Havana blanket 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.639
 more will rise the peasants had less room 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:02.460
 this week then at the end or a very large peasant displacement 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.550
 towards the poverty belts 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:08.680
 and peasant girls end up working at least coffee growing 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.599
 of tobacco banana 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:14.219
 even at the price of laughter they returned from tears 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:15.830
 i can one 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.080
 in order that aena here 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.080
 i can not commit that product yet 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.320
 in the next decade the peasants are 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.199
 more and more of this 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.240
 and the lands 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.479
 more eroded 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.000
 and problems of structural adjustment arise that try to mitigate the effects 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:35.360
 and is that each patient 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.749
 the system has to face its own land 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:41.839
 the eighty and ninety the international economic world bank 

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:45.909
 decides to give the countries of the south a loan to bring us to the peseta 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:47.159
 in aspen 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:48.300
 the area that has 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.400

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.770
 african pérez a free what keeps you in agreement 

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:57.599

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.370
 of not charging to me I was educated to local market and diffem enters by eight agents 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.779
 the people there are no longer worth producing 

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:18.239
 the first of the millennium goals is to end extreme poverty and the 

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:20.180
 hungry for 2015 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.259
 but it is not clear that it can be achieved 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:25.389
 not even with the recent rule of establishing transaction fees 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.319
 financial 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:31.330
 from the food sovereignty group propose as a solution to strengthen the 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.599
 local production to place it 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.250
 encourage local markets 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.250

 Yeremi so few affect the ability 

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:01.409
 It is true that FAO announced that the number of people 

00:07:01.409 --> 00:07:03.409
 they suffer malnutrition in the world 

00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:06.979
