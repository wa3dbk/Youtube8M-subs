00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.599
 jo people welcome your race to weather 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.650
 a new complete here on my channel 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.000
 races gaming 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.710
 continued to want today on the 18th century 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.660
 fly in report you see the game 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.640
 has been busy for three minutes and me 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.320
 joinen so really was very late because 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.359
 was a playing game i play with the k7 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.830
 but of course the built-in more economical 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.869
 with excel and macs and again the crap 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:31.039
 pet testament and last night 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.860
 the call of duty ghosts playing 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:36.080
 I saw a lot of people without two 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.250
 fs played me so I saw a lot 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.839
 people who just stuff with her 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.309
 and until I saw many people who 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:41.960
 stuff only with the saris there or 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.670
 only externally the next but the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.329
 point is in call or duty ghosts it costs 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.730
 you 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.140
 points of course secondary to 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.690
 sits on a leetle hans and tom effect 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.489
 So I set up anyway to counsel 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.109
 you say no your song because really couldn't 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:56.210
 I will give you three extra points to sets 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.640
 for your turkish because every perkins again 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.469
 points but you always have without that 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.149
 it even something comes the chance to two 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.009
 years tess put my soapy water on 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.590
 ensure then we are the a12 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.539
 castor oil bed you play with a sniper 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.759
 you always just played 2 tess knew 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:12.170
 have it on it because it wo n't cost you anything 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.090
 and it helps you to 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.080
 for example just a better score it 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.180
 already made the set 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.890
 designer and I are ex on your weapon or 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.500
 for and run until I set about most 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.900
 grip and a science we or whatever true 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.600
 there is always two and sms on you 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.240
 just the maximum points and the maximum 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.049
 the best class attachments just look like 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.729
 can fetch 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.079
 but abyss gamepro bach and rinse 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.610
 just wake up for a moment 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.780
 tjonge you want quickly to you about 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.149
 because if maybe nice to 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.399
 to tell in between is the 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.170
 rating of coal video like yesterday 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.820
 I do n't feel like it 4 but in call 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.860
 of duty ghost searching the internet 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.750
 of course just on google to watch 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.479
 what the reviews were from kalleveen die 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.520
 chose it because of course it is not really the 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:53.689
 best call of duty has ever been made to 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.759
 just be able to go a whole day 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.680
 and I didn't even look up 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.060
 true by a lot of people and quite well 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.920
 bad just because I finished the 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.140
 heard from certain people and I went 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.430
 look up okay there are so many 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.049
 people who think it is okay so so much 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.490
 people who find the game bad and 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.500
 only went as focusing on the people 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.110
 that form the bad game like ijn 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.820
 like really just people who put games out 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.980
 tests and then a dry figure 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.449
 like games games like all those 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.760
 different types of people who the they 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:21.120
 game retting with a certain number and with 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.909
 express a certain opinion 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.290
 and so I came to the conclusion 100 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.459
 percent of the people who have it bad 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.090
 found 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.299
 78% of the people just had that 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.769
 the game given a bad rating by 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.750
 the community 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.489
 and by that I mean a lot of people 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.970
 found calorie that chose not really tasty 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.950
 play by the players themselves and thereby 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.900
 they had therefore given insufficient and 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.540
 on the one hand, that is really the biggest 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.190
 Bullshit reason for a game and over 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.049
 doors only give because there 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.359
 annoying players like this one 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:56.819
 person perfect example 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.970
 and therefore everyone who's bad 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.890
 had completed 78% of people thought it 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.120
 bad game because they are just the players 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.859
 not show or under 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.190
 and I get it because call of duty ghost 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:10.290
 is the game with the most number of people 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.290
 the highest percentage of campers ever 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.030
 quietly playing people of course 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.849
 which by doing that you do not really Inc 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.459
 can run out loud and of course 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.440
 all those well-known companies all those well-known 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.650
 People who rate games have one 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.930
 Great influence on people who play the game 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.359
 so buy all those rating balances again 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.209
 so low grades are really just calm 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.639
 study a bit poorly and me 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.139
 think it's a good reason to say yes 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.639
 the game isn't that nice to players 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:40.349
 not really silent again 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.419
 bullshit but nobody they have after 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.709
 have not looked at perth system 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:44.819
 did not look at the folder is not 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.560
 have not looked at the basics 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:49.590
 looked at game itself but only 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.930
 to players and therefore 78 percent and 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.329
 therefore you now also see that very much 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.739
 people the game day and as a player that 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.790
 not yet that rating they have seen and 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.349
 those people who do have the religions 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.359
 seen here maybe a game yet 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.859
 Heals so bought what I actually want 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.750
 agree with this 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.910
 do not always listen to other people 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.560
 but start from your own opinion like me 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.849
 say van plays the k7 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.709
 you also have here with the cheese 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:12.209
 play when i say you must give me this burg 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.340
 you don't have to play deeper at all 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.049
 play it is all your own impression 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.669
 and so when you watch a program 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.090
 like gamekings or if you go to just 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.940
 an English rating site will not go there 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.289
 always out of that rating what their 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.300
 so have put down on a game 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.210
 for example, battlefield 4 has someone 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.890
 really just ready as a final grade one 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.430
 because this is just another fun game 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.750
 Then you shouldn't go with that 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.910
 go because you have to go for it yourself 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.250
 is off if your game likes you 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.140
 game burr go play then buy or test 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.880
 for example at a company 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.050
 where I can just play for a while and 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.240
 if you think it's a fun game 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.400
 buy it if you think I trust 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.900
 those figures not quite of it 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.400
 For example, call or duty ghosts for sale 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.310
 the game and test it for yourself 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.960
 just because your own opinion counts 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.730
 of course, just the highest I can 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.200
 say i find a pussy game i can 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.450
 say i like very very much game 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.550
 then you can also go a bit further 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.250
 but still everything revolves around your own 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.960
 opinion so always keep it in mind 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.550
 that if you colin sweet stuff just that 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.140
 it's all about your self you have to 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.120
 keep it nice for yourself and 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.190
 you must always challenge yourself to 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.840
 You were going to state how fun the game is 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.280
 how can you continue to play and the 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.870
 knife this play 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.340
 it is sometimes a bit annoying if 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.080
 for example, these people turn you 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.360
 as here is the perfect kill cam again 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.190
 but on the other hand they go naturally 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.780
 again after a while thinks well too 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.040
 I've been in the same place for three minutes 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.630
 must also once they go wandering 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.950
 and then they will walk on their own 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.050
 they automatically go behind a few times 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.920
 kill each other because of you so there you can too 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.330
 just another nice score 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.670
 drop and 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.870
 for example pornstars dot com i like 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.580
 that one of the best players ever 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.410
 re also all trials event icon 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.180
 shoots like crazy he really can just 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.190
 every enemy who is also right you just right 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.260
 they shoot right through them 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.050
 also says all videos is real 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.670
 perfect game and views are 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.020
 different and everyone this the bad 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.300
 think it is actually a bad game 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.710
 game by the players themselves I own 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.870
 personally I also find call of duty 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.210
 Ghosts are simply the best game ever 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:06.370
 said each other in terms of weapons coiffeur 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.680
 system often created class etcetera 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.900
 etcetera but sometimes it becomes waves vest 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.030
 by the particular players who just get it 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:15.760
 are playing a game so that is mine 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.100
 opinion about the game call of duty and what 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.560
 I want to touch is not listening already 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:22.180
 other people to film but did 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.530
 a little note that if real 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.150
 very many people say that the bad 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:28.150
 pulse that it is therefore just a bad one 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.980
 but be sure to always 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.420
 stay with yourself and make sure 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.880
 you always remain yourself 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.290
 except people watch ice cream so 30 to 5g 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.730
 not to like the video and to the 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.880
 again next time 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.880
 bye bye
