be teaching you how to create 2d

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.420 
be teaching you how to create 2d
animations<00:00:15.690> for<00:00:15.900> yourself<00:00:16.320> if<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.310> been

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
animations for yourself if you have been

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.099 
animations for yourself if you have been
watching<00:00:17.550> my<00:00:17.850> recent<00:00:18.300> videos<00:00:18.660> you'll<00:00:18.990> have

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
watching my recent videos you'll have

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.349 
watching my recent videos you'll have
seen<00:00:19.350> that<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.920> have<00:00:20.010> been<00:00:20.310> creating<00:00:20.760> all<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:20.939> 2d

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
seen that I have been creating all of 2d

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.589 
seen that I have been creating all of 2d
films<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.619> due<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.800> my<00:00:23.599> and

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
films and this is due to my and

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.880 
films and this is due to my and
University<00:00:25.320> course<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.060> so<00:00:27.060> I<00:00:27.089> thought<00:00:27.740> if<00:00:28.740> I

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
University course and so I thought if I

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.050 
University course and so I thought if I
this<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.159> what<00:00:29.279> I'm<00:00:29.369> doing<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.669> moment<00:00:29.970> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
this is what I'm doing the moment I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.489 
this is what I'm doing the moment I
should<00:00:30.480> probably<00:00:30.689> try<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.169> teach<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.439> guys

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:31.499 
should probably try and teach you guys

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:33.979 
should probably try and teach you guys
how<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.829> do<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> same<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.759> in<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.720> first

how to get started what equipment you're

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.840 
how to get started what equipment you're
going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> need<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.160> what<00:00:38.280> software<00:00:38.520> you're

to make 2d films so here we go okay so
one<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> first<00:00:51.179> things<00:00:51.390> you're<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.629> to

need to create a 2d film is a graphics
tablet<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:55.100> the<00:00:56.100> one<00:00:56.250> I'm<00:00:56.370> using<00:00:56.609> is<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.030> Wacom

tablet and the one I'm using is a Wacom
pen<00:00:57.839> and<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.500> cost<00:00:58.710> me<00:00:58.859> around<00:00:59.039> 50<00:00:59.339> pounds

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
pen and this cost me around 50 pounds

pen and this cost me around 50 pounds
and<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.899> would<00:01:01.379> highly<00:01:01.710> recommend<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.280> guys

getting<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.940> Wacom<00:01:03.359> also<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:04.050> if<00:01:04.199> you're<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.769> a

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
getting a Wacom also but if you're on a

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.340 
getting a Wacom also but if you're on a
budget<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:06.030> are<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> lot<00:01:06.660> of<00:01:06.690> cheaper

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
budget there are a lot of cheaper

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.899 
budget there are a lot of cheaper
alternatives<00:01:08.270> but<00:01:09.890> obviously<00:01:10.890> there<00:01:11.759> won't

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
alternatives but obviously there won't

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.539 
alternatives but obviously there won't
be<00:01:11.970> as<00:01:12.090> good<00:01:12.680> but<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.740> will<00:01:13.890> post<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.159> few<00:01:14.280> links

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
be as good but I will post a few links

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.679 
be as good but I will post a few links
in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.790> description<00:01:15.299> below

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.899 

the<00:01:18.649> reason<00:01:18.920> we<00:01:18.979> need<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:19.159> graphics<00:01:19.520> tablet<00:01:19.579> is

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
the reason we need a graphics tablet is

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.880 
the reason we need a graphics tablet is
basically<00:01:20.329> so<00:01:20.659> we<00:01:20.780> can<00:01:20.930> draw<00:01:21.170> straight<00:01:21.619> into

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
basically so we can draw straight into

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.520 
basically so we can draw straight into
the<00:01:21.950> computer<00:01:22.430> using<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.299> pen<00:01:23.539> and<00:01:23.840> straight

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
the computer using a pen and straight

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.649 
the computer using a pen and straight
into<00:01:24.649> the<00:01:24.770> software<00:01:25.159> we're<00:01:25.310> using<00:01:25.670> this<00:01:26.360> makes

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
into the software we're using this makes

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.630 
into the software we're using this makes
it<00:01:26.780> easier<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:27.200> we<00:01:27.350> don't<00:01:27.530> have<00:01:27.619> to<00:01:27.829> draw<00:01:28.579> it

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
it easier so we don't have to draw it

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.789 
it easier so we don't have to draw it
the<00:01:28.909> traditional<00:01:29.060> way<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.450> animating<00:01:29.840> is<00:01:30.170> to

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
the traditional way of animating is to

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.230 
the traditional way of animating is to
draw<00:01:31.009> onto<00:01:31.220> paper<00:01:31.429> and<00:01:31.729> scan<00:01:31.909> it<00:01:31.970> into<00:01:32.179> the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
draw onto paper and scan it into the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.880 
draw onto paper and scan it into the
computer<00:01:32.299> or<00:01:32.899> take<00:01:33.140> pictures<00:01:33.500> of<00:01:33.619> it<00:01:33.740> but

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
computer or take pictures of it but

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.649 
computer or take pictures of it but
that's<00:01:34.399> quite<00:01:34.610> a<00:01:34.640> tedious<00:01:34.970> task<00:01:35.060> because<00:01:35.539> you

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
that's quite a tedious task because you

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.690 
that's quite a tedious task because you
can't<00:01:35.869> like<00:01:36.619> preview<00:01:37.100> what<00:01:37.250> you've<00:01:37.369> drawn

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
can't like preview what you've drawn

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.090 
can't like preview what you've drawn
whereas<00:01:38.600> in<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.049> software<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.590> computer<00:01:39.979> you

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
whereas in the software and computer you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.760 
whereas in the software and computer you
can<00:01:40.310> draw<00:01:40.640> something<00:01:40.880> and<00:01:41.240> like<00:01:42.170> straightaway

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
can draw something and like straightaway

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.160 
can draw something and like straightaway
you<00:01:42.829> can<00:01:43.100> look<00:01:43.939> through<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.240> footage<00:01:44.630> and<00:01:44.810> see

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
you can look through the footage and see

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.069 
you can look through the footage and see
if<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.679> works<00:01:45.829> or<00:01:46.039> not<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.420> graphics<00:01:48.049> tablet

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
if it works or not so a graphics tablet

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.280 
if it works or not so a graphics tablet
is<00:01:48.409> key<00:01:48.590> really<00:01:48.979> to<00:01:49.189> creating<00:01:49.670> 2d<00:01:49.849> films

I'm just going to leave that because I
think<00:03:25.700> a<00:03:26.209> 2d<00:03:26.660> animation<00:03:27.110> there's<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.290> lot<00:03:27.500> to<00:03:27.620> go

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
think a 2d animation there's a lot to go

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.790 
think a 2d animation there's a lot to go
through<00:03:28.070> so<00:03:28.640> at<00:03:28.820> the<00:03:28.880> moment<00:03:29.030> if<00:03:29.989> you've<00:03:30.290> got

the software and if you've got the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.490 
the software and if you've got the
hardware<00:03:32.300> then<00:03:32.810> just<00:03:33.050> have<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.170> play<00:03:33.380> around

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
hardware then just have a play around
