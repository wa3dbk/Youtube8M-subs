into the phone a little bit yeah and
that<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:11.510> think<00:01:12.510> another<00:01:12.659> reason<00:01:12.869> why<00:01:13.140> I<00:01:13.170> wanted

that I think another reason why I wanted
to<00:01:13.619> kind<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.890> shave<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.400> down<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.729> little<00:01:14.939> bit

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
to kind of shave this down a little bit

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.149 
to kind of shave this down a little bit
so<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.840> dirt<00:01:16.020> wouldn't<00:01:16.380> slide<00:01:16.710> off<00:01:16.890> too

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
so that the dirt wouldn't slide off too

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.520 
so that the dirt wouldn't slide off too
much<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.990> but<00:01:19.310> kind<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.369> get<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.520> idea<00:01:21.530> what's

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
worked in mind so let me make an

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:33.470 
worked in mind so let me make an
adjustment<00:02:26.070> here<00:02:26.940> all<00:02:27.450> right<00:02:32.060> I'm<00:02:33.060> basically

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
adjustment here all right I'm basically

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.980 
adjustment here all right I'm basically
going<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:33.780> be<00:02:33.960> doing<00:02:34.740> the<00:02:34.980> same<00:02:35.040> thing

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
going to be doing the same thing

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.310 
going to be doing the same thing
elsewhere<00:02:37.100> on<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:39.180> interchange<00:02:39.450> scene<00:02:40.050> it's

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
elsewhere on this interchange scene it's

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.530 
elsewhere on this interchange scene it's
going<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.500> get<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> layer<00:02:40.950> of<00:02:40.980> dirt<00:02:41.250> down<00:02:41.540> paint

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
going to get a layer of dirt down paint

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.760 
going to get a layer of dirt down paint
it<00:02:42.690> with<00:02:44.840> painting<00:02:45.840> McMahon<00:02:46.140> but<00:02:46.320> probably

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
it with painting McMahon but probably

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:47.840 
it with painting McMahon but probably
not<00:02:46.860> between<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.220> tracks<00:02:47.490> they'll<00:02:47.790> be

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
not between the tracks they'll be

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.180 
not between the tracks they'll be
ballast<00:02:48.300> filled<00:02:48.750> in<00:02:48.900> here<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.530> probably<00:02:49.980> one

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
ballast filled in here so probably one

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.670 
ballast filled in here so probably one
of<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.340> next<00:02:50.520> things<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.850> do<00:02:50.910> but<00:02:51.900> you<00:02:52.560> know

spot right down here because that's a

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.710 
spot right down here because that's a

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
this is water putty that's what's kind

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.460 
this is water putty that's what's kind
of<00:04:54.610> cool<00:04:54.669> about<00:04:55.150> it<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:57.310> this<00:04:57.400> is<00:04:57.550> all<00:04:57.700> kind<00:04:58.030> of

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
of cool about it so this is all kind of

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.640 
of cool about it so this is all kind of
looking<00:04:59.470> a<00:04:59.620> little<00:04:59.800> worn<00:05:00.040> out<00:05:00.220> so<00:05:01.560> actually<00:05:02.560> it

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
looking a little worn out so actually it

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.140 
looking a little worn out so actually it
already<00:05:02.860> looks<00:05:02.890> kind<00:05:03.190> of<00:05:03.220> like<00:05:03.280> a<00:05:03.400> pothole<00:05:03.940> a

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
already looks kind of like a pothole a

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.670 
already looks kind of like a pothole a
patch<00:05:04.180> there<00:05:04.720> actually<00:05:05.230> it's<00:05:05.320> more<00:05:05.440> like<00:05:05.500> an

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
patch there actually it's more like an

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.340 
patch there actually it's more like an
oil<00:05:05.919> stain<00:05:06.310> so<00:05:06.700> that's<00:05:07.630> cool<00:05:07.900> that<00:05:08.200> will<00:05:08.320> work

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
oil stain so that's cool that will work

I use to make the road with don't think
I'd<00:05:55.350> mix<00:05:56.350> this<00:05:56.530> up<00:05:56.710> to<00:05:57.010> oh<00:05:58.500> I<00:05:59.500> think<00:05:59.740> it<00:05:59.890> was<00:06:00.010> up

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
I'd mix this up to oh I think it was up

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.790 
I'd mix this up to oh I think it was up
at<00:06:02.890> the<00:06:03.070> consistency<00:06:03.580> of<00:06:03.729> toothpaste<00:06:04.770> well<00:06:05.770> I

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:05.800 
at the consistency of toothpaste well I

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.190 
at the consistency of toothpaste well I
want<00:06:06.010> to<00:06:06.070> make<00:06:06.160> this<00:06:06.280> a<00:06:06.340> little<00:06:06.550> bit<00:06:06.729> thicker

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:07.200 
want to make this a little bit thicker

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
want to make this a little bit thicker
one<00:06:08.200> thing<00:06:08.380> you<00:06:08.440> got<00:06:08.560> to<00:06:08.590> keep<00:06:08.770> in<00:06:08.890> mind<00:06:09.100> with

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
one thing you got to keep in mind with

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.040 
one thing you got to keep in mind with
water<00:06:09.520> putty<00:06:09.880> I<00:06:10.000> mean<00:06:10.240> the<00:06:10.450> acrylic<00:06:10.810> paint

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
water putty I mean the acrylic paint

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:18.010 
water putty I mean the acrylic paint
will<00:06:11.169> slow<00:06:11.440> the<00:06:11.650> drying<00:06:11.950> time<00:06:12.040> down<00:06:12.580> some<00:06:13.650> but

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.610 

the<00:06:18.740> thicker<00:06:19.009> the<00:06:19.789> mix<00:06:20.030> is<00:06:20.360> the<00:06:21.229> more<00:06:21.379> water

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
the thicker the mix is the more water

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.219 
the thicker the mix is the more water
putting<00:06:22.009> it<00:06:22.129> that's<00:06:22.370> in<00:06:22.580> here<00:06:23.110> faster<00:06:24.110> it's

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:24.229 
putting it that's in here faster it's

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:27.129 
putting it that's in here faster it's
going<00:06:24.259> to<00:06:24.410> dry<00:06:25.389> so<00:06:26.389> you<00:06:26.449> gotta<00:06:26.840> kind<00:06:26.900> of<00:06:27.080> keep

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:27.139 
going to dry so you gotta kind of keep

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:30.129 
going to dry so you gotta kind of keep
in<00:06:27.349> mind<00:06:27.620> that<00:06:27.860> when<00:06:28.190> you<00:06:28.659> make<00:06:29.659> a<00:06:29.690> fairly

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:30.139 
in mind that when you make a fairly

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.529 
in mind that when you make a fairly
thick<00:06:30.560> batch<00:06:30.889> of<00:06:31.129> water<00:06:31.280> putty<00:06:31.729> or<00:06:31.849> time<00:06:32.300> to

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
thick batch of water putty or time to

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.839 
thick batch of water putty or time to
work<00:06:32.750> with<00:06:32.780> they're<00:06:33.139> going<00:06:33.379> to<00:06:33.440> be<00:06:33.620> a<00:06:33.949> little

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:34.849 
work with they're going to be a little

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:39.520 
work with they're going to be a little
bit<00:06:35.030> more<00:06:35.289> limited<00:06:37.300> ok<00:06:38.300> now<00:06:38.539> it's<00:06:38.780> as<00:06:38.870> boys<00:06:39.199> as

bit more limited ok now it's as boys as

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:46.240 
bit more limited ok now it's as boys as
yeah<00:06:40.270> really<00:06:41.270> kind<00:06:41.720> of<00:06:41.810> doughy<00:06:42.849> putty-like<00:06:45.250> so

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
yeah really kind of doughy putty-like so

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:47.770 
yeah really kind of doughy putty-like so
I'm<00:06:46.430> probably<00:06:46.610> kind<00:06:46.909> of<00:06:47.000> limited<00:06:47.479> on<00:06:47.569> how<00:06:47.599> much

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:47.780 
I'm probably kind of limited on how much

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.480 
I'm probably kind of limited on how much
time<00:06:48.199> I<00:06:48.560> have<00:06:49.340> to<00:06:49.639> work<00:06:49.879> with<00:06:50.360> this<00:06:51.430> kind<00:06:52.430> of

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
time I have to work with this kind of

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.330 
time I have to work with this kind of
see<00:06:52.669> the<00:06:52.759> consistency<00:06:54.310> nice<00:06:55.310> thick<00:06:56.210> like<00:06:56.810> that

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
see the consistency nice thick like that

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:01.419 
see the consistency nice thick like that
if<00:06:58.340> you<00:06:58.460> can't<00:06:58.699> see<00:06:58.849> that<00:06:59.000> too<00:06:59.210> well
