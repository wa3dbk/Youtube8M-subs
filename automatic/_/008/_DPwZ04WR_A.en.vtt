00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.340
 salute friends my name is metatron reading 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.190
 tell you how to use the charger 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.650
 turnigy devices and qsl 6s any 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.800
 the other whether I would max 6 or all 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.630
 what is it like to charge lead 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.119
 car batteries 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.880
 at least some of her teeth and with nicks from 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.580
 your scooters and anything for 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.460
 we need it first of all we connect 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.149
 terminals to the battery but it is logical 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.219
 but at this stage everything is clear and 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.399
 we just have a battery 7 amp 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.600
 hours it's so here for a minute this one 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.980
 here we go to the program go to 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.739
 plumbum lead program and go into it 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.280
 Further that we see here so a charge current 1 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 ampere 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.829
 no it's too much lead charge 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.109
 batteries need a current 01 seat them 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:02.489
 not capacity that is roughly speaking 10 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.450
 percent therefore we reduce for 7 amps 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.030
 the current will be 0 7 amps but I recommend 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.150
 I need to charge less current 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.890
 after all 01 c can be still nothing less 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.080
 there will not be anything terrible here if you 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.780
 put it will be bad for anyone 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.900
 battery whether it is car or 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.759
 from your song to it doesn't matter what 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.930
 he is lead acid it will be bad 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.299
 if you put more 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.759
 and if less put epoch will not 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.939
 friends will not give badly put 0 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.720
 6 further choose the voltage it depends on 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.159
 the number of jars say 12 volts is 6 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.200
 can look at your 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.290
 battery how many caps do you have 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.200
 exactly six is ​​what 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.860
 we need to choose 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.780
 charge, you can choose of course discharge 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.490
 if you need to choose the current in the same way 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.070
 we need it but we are not interested 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.320
 men charge 06 amperes 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.070
 all connected plus plus u minus to 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.780
 minus press enter enter see enter 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.780
 or start and hold the key 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.080
 battery check all 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.260
 charge went see means here we have 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.650
 current voltage here we have current 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.480
 current here time is ampere and but 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.410
 the battery is almost charged 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.840
 Therefore, as the charge ends, the current 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.000
 will be small here we put our 06 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.200
 Amp if the battery was at least 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.840
 half discharged he would now 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.290
 Charged 0 6 amps and so only 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.850
 gradually decreases towards the end of the charge and and 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.460
 and and here it all went charging voltage 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.130
 you see already 14 4 almost general 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.720
 soon-soon before charge such here 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.810
 impulses he him as you see by 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.020
 the voltage is added to the rest of the charge and here 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:57.440
 they are milliampere and which are filled 0 0 0 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.480
 0 0 3 nutri miliamper and in general like this 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.050
 Here you can easily and simply charge any 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:07.370
 12 volt lead battery 24 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.959
 volt 24 volt by the way not at all 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.360
 chargers can be charged 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.570
 for example, on this limit only 20 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.310
 volt so keep that in mind 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.830
 check before buying but here 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.770
 the program of all is equally simple not every 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.660
 not everyone can there were 4 or more 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:26.270
 charge itself common here may 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:30.350
 up to 20 but 12-volt as already seen 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:32.540
 once again with how you can be charged 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.400
 I hope you have been helpful and understandable 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.680
 interesting this instruction is suitable for 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.820
 any such charger 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.100
 so use on health 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.560
 never charge batteries 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:45.560
 put big currents better as grit 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.720
 less yes better with you was metatron och 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.180
 after spending the rest of your life to good use 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.930
 buddy for now if you like and like 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.930
