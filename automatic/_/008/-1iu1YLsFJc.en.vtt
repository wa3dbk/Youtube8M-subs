00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
spackle it on the pan and you see how

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.949 
spackle it on the pan and you see how
it's<00:03:57.769> kind<00:03:58.010> of<00:03:58.100> heating<00:03:58.790> up<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.209> boiling<00:03:59.930> a

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
it's kind of heating up and boiling a

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.330 
it's kind of heating up and boiling a
little<00:04:00.140> bit<00:04:00.260> that's<00:04:00.680> when<00:04:00.920> we<00:04:01.010> know<00:04:01.160> we're

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
little bit that's when we know we're

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.960 
little bit that's when we know we're
ready<00:04:01.550> let's<00:04:02.120> get<00:04:02.269> our<00:04:02.360> pancake<00:04:02.840> mixture<00:04:03.970> pour

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
ready let's get our pancake mixture pour

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.430 
ready let's get our pancake mixture pour
a<00:04:05.030> little<00:04:05.269> disc<00:04:05.750> on<00:04:06.560> there<00:04:08.440> perfect

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
a little disc on there perfect

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.600 
a little disc on there perfect
consistency<00:04:10.780> and<00:04:12.100> then<00:04:13.100> we're<00:04:13.250> gonna<00:04:13.340> let

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
consistency and then we're gonna let

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.180 
consistency and then we're gonna let
that<00:04:13.930> heat<00:04:15.640> on<00:04:16.640> both<00:04:16.850> sides<00:04:17.769> just<00:04:18.769> like<00:04:18.919> mama

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
that heat on both sides just like mama

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.740 
that heat on both sides just like mama
would<00:04:19.430> do<00:04:19.549> it<00:04:19.669> this<00:04:19.729> is<00:04:19.910> over<00:04:20.030> medium<00:04:20.479> heat<00:04:20.600> so

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
would do it this is over medium heat so

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.870 
would do it this is over medium heat so
that<00:04:20.870> was<00:04:20.989> baking<00:04:21.380> for<00:04:21.650> maybe<00:04:22.160> four<00:04:22.550> minutes

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
that was baking for maybe four minutes

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.580 
that was baking for maybe four minutes
or<00:04:22.940> so<00:04:23.150> now<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.660> key<00:04:23.930> is<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.169> be<00:04:24.200> able<00:04:24.289> to<00:04:24.380> flip

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
or so now the key is to be able to flip

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.960 
or so now the key is to be able to flip
the<00:04:24.710> pancake<00:04:24.890> without<00:04:25.370> making<00:04:25.700> it<00:04:25.760> look<00:04:25.820> like

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
the pancake without making it look like

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.480 
the pancake without making it look like
a<00:04:26.150> junkie<00:04:26.690> messy<00:04:27.289> pancake<00:04:27.800> let's<00:04:28.220> see<00:04:28.340> how<00:04:28.430> we

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490
