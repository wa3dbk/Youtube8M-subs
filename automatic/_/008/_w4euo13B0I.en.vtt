00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.229 
because sometimes it'll take part of the
wall<00:03:13.060> off<00:03:13.269> okay<00:03:14.079> so<00:03:14.140> there's<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.590> roof<00:03:15.239> the

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
wall off okay so there's the roof the

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.119 
wall off okay so there's the roof the
secret<00:03:16.630> button<00:03:16.980> which<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.100> this

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:29.199 

secret<00:03:22.129> button<00:03:22.340> is<00:03:22.640> only<00:03:24.910> this<00:03:25.910> piece<00:03:26.349> and<00:03:28.209> one

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
secret button is only this piece and one

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.690 
secret button is only this piece and one
of<00:03:29.300> these<00:03:29.390> one<00:03:29.629> by<00:03:29.660> twos<00:03:31.239> just<00:03:32.239> stacked<00:03:32.629> on<00:03:32.810> top

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
of these one by twos just stacked on top

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.500 
of these one by twos just stacked on top
so<00:03:34.700> that's<00:03:34.879> the<00:03:34.940> secret<00:03:35.120> button<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:37.510> the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
so that's the secret button and the

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.360 
so that's the secret button and the
mechanism<00:03:39.280> is<00:03:40.280> this<00:03:40.700> secret<00:03:41.060> button<00:03:42.250> got<00:03:43.250> to

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
mechanism is this secret button got to

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.839 
mechanism is this secret button got to
close<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.640> door<00:03:44.049> okay<00:03:45.049> so<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:46.670> see<00:03:46.819> that

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
close the door okay so you see that

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.470 
close the door okay so you see that
thing<00:03:47.180> inside<00:03:47.330> that<00:03:47.810> I'm<00:03:47.900> moving<00:03:49.239> looks<00:03:50.239> that

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
thing inside that I'm moving looks that

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.130 
thing inside that I'm moving looks that
goes<00:03:51.290> under<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:52.360> that's<00:03:53.360> why<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.720> door<00:03:54.079> is

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
goes under that that's why the door is

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.809 
goes under that that's why the door is
locked<00:03:55.269> and<00:03:56.269> this<00:03:57.049> is<00:03:58.010> blocking<00:03:58.610> you<00:03:58.790> from

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
locked and this is blocking you from

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.069 
locked and this is blocking you from
pulling<00:03:59.239> this<00:03:59.510> up<00:04:01.299> then<00:04:02.299> the<00:04:02.420> wall<00:04:02.630> goes<00:04:02.900> on<00:04:03.049> I

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
pulling this up then the wall goes on I

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.979 
pulling this up then the wall goes on I
guess<00:04:03.380> to<00:04:03.620> keep<00:04:04.010> it<00:04:04.160> inside<00:04:04.360> yep<00:04:05.360> you're<00:04:05.959> right

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
guess to keep it inside yep you're right

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.509 
guess to keep it inside yep you're right
Zane<00:04:07.209> so<00:04:08.209> how<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:08.840> works<00:04:09.049> this<00:04:09.620> button<00:04:09.950> sits

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
Zane so how it works this button sits

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.410 
Zane so how it works this button sits
right<00:04:10.790> there<00:04:11.319> as<00:04:12.319> you<00:04:12.650> can<00:04:12.769> see<00:04:13.150> they're<00:04:14.150> both

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
right there as you can see they're both

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.819 
right there as you can see they're both
diagonal<00:04:15.170> against<00:04:15.680> each<00:04:15.769> other<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.930> when<00:04:18.709> you

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
diagonal against each other so when you

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.860 
diagonal against each other so when you
press<00:04:19.070> the<00:04:19.280> button<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:20.180> press<00:04:20.449> it<00:04:20.479> on<00:04:20.660> this

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
press the button you press it on this

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.940 
press the button you press it on this
side<00:04:21.010> because<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:22.490> piece<00:04:22.850> is<00:04:23.090> covering<00:04:23.600> it

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:26.950 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.320 

so<00:04:27.670> when<00:04:28.420> you<00:04:28.510> press<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:30.450> makes<00:04:31.450> this<00:04:31.690> come<00:04:32.410> out

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
so when you press it makes this come out

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.610 
so when you press it makes this come out
once<00:04:34.330> you<00:04:34.450> do<00:04:34.570> that<00:04:35.100> you<00:04:36.100> can<00:04:36.280> pull<00:04:36.460> this<00:04:36.610> out

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
once you do that you can pull this out

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.800 
once you do that you can pull this out
finally<00:04:38.620> open<00:04:38.830> the<00:04:38.920> door<00:04:41.340> so<00:04:42.340> the<00:04:43.150> mechanism

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
finally open the door so the mechanism

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.260 
finally open the door so the mechanism
is<00:04:44.110> pretty<00:04:44.410> simple<00:04:44.710> but<00:04:44.920> very<00:04:45.190> hard<00:04:45.760> to<00:04:46.000> find

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
is pretty simple but very hard to find

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.750 
is pretty simple but very hard to find
all<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.630> buttons<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.290> what<00:04:48.160> things<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.520> pull

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
all the buttons and what things to pull

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.160 
all the buttons and what things to pull
out<00:04:49.710> but<00:04:50.710> took<00:04:51.130> me<00:04:51.340> about<00:04:52.530> two<00:04:53.530> days<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.770> build

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
out but took me about two days to build

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.780 
out but took me about two days to build
it<00:04:56.170> was<00:04:56.320> pretty<00:04:56.560> complicated<00:04:57.280> but<00:04:57.370> after<00:04:57.730> I

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
it was pretty complicated but after I

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.570 
it was pretty complicated but after I
got<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:58.660> gist<00:04:58.900> of<00:04:59.080> it<00:04:59.400> it<00:05:00.400> was<00:05:00.490> pretty<00:05:00.670> easy

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
got the gist of it it was pretty easy

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.700 
got the gist of it it was pretty easy
yep<00:05:03.580> and<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:04.720> didn't<00:05:04.990> take<00:05:05.110> me<00:05:05.260> very<00:05:05.290> long<00:05:05.530> to

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
yep and it didn't take me very long to

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.850 
yep and it didn't take me very long to
unlock<00:05:06.460> it<00:05:06.490> because<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.540> already<00:05:07.810> try<00:05:08.230> and<00:05:08.620> I

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
unlock it because I already try and I

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.010 
unlock it because I already try and I
sort<00:05:09.730> of<00:05:09.940> succeeded<00:05:10.780> oh<00:05:11.020> I<00:05:11.940> almost<00:05:12.940> broke<00:05:13.840> it

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
sort of succeeded oh I almost broke it

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.330 
sort of succeeded oh I almost broke it
in<00:05:14.110> the<00:05:14.170> process<00:05:14.710> um<00:05:16.410> yes<00:05:17.410> it's<00:05:17.680> an<00:05:17.770> amazing

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
in the process um yes it's an amazing

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.660 
in the process um yes it's an amazing
trick<00:05:18.610> box<00:05:18.820> and<00:05:19.410> all<00:05:20.410> these<00:05:20.740> wall<00:05:21.010> panels<00:05:21.490> on

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
trick box and all these wall panels on

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.850 
trick box and all these wall panels on
it<00:05:21.990> make<00:05:22.990> it<00:05:23.020> look<00:05:23.320> very<00:05:23.590> complicated<00:05:25.500> but<00:05:26.500> I

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
it make it look very complicated but I

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.450 
it make it look very complicated but I
also<00:05:27.250> put<00:05:27.760> a<00:05:27.790> special<00:05:28.240> design<00:05:28.570> on<00:05:28.780> each<00:05:28.960> one<00:05:29.460> 1

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
also put a special design on each one 1

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.420 
also put a special design on each one 1
by<00:05:30.490> 4<00:05:30.940> on<00:05:31.030> that<00:05:31.180> side<00:05:31.480> one<00:05:32.200> I'm<00:05:32.470> four<00:05:32.950> by<00:05:33.070> two<00:05:33.100> on

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
by 4 on that side one I'm four by two on

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.360 
by 4 on that side one I'm four by two on
that<00:05:33.580> side<00:05:33.640> one<00:05:34.480> back<00:05:34.660> on<00:05:34.840> that<00:05:35.050> side<00:05:35.080> 2<00:05:36.010> by<00:05:36.160> 4

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
that side one back on that side 2 by 4

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.000 
that side one back on that side 2 by 4
on<00:05:36.460> that<00:05:36.580> side<00:05:36.820> one<00:05:37.180> by<00:05:37.390> before<00:05:38.260> and<00:05:38.500> then<00:05:38.650> too

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
on that side one by before and then too

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:41.460 
on that side one by before and then too
bad<00:05:39.210> so<00:05:40.210> that's<00:05:40.360> just<00:05:40.540> the<00:05:40.750> design<00:05:41.050> that<00:05:41.440> I

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
bad so that's just the design that I

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.800 
bad so that's just the design that I
made<00:05:41.770> it<00:05:41.890> in<00:05:42.040> there<00:05:42.670> not<00:05:42.820> really<00:05:43.030> it<00:05:43.120> they

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
made it in there not really it they

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.350 
made it in there not really it they
aren't<00:05:44.410> attached<00:05:44.650> by<00:05:44.800> anything<00:05:45.330> except<00:05:46.330> for

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
aren't attached by anything except for

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:54.050 
aren't attached by anything except for
that<00:05:46.960> piece<00:05:48.000> so<00:05:51.480> yep<00:05:52.480> that<00:05:52.870> was<00:05:52.960> my<00:05:53.050> trick<00:05:53.230> box

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060
