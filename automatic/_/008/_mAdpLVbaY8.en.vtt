00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
important to be relaxed and it's

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.880 
important to be relaxed and it's
important<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.510> let<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> stick<00:00:34.110> move<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.800> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
important to let the stick move in the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
important to let the stick move in the
hand<00:00:35.190> instead<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.730> trying<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> control<00:00:36.510> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
hand instead of trying to control the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.240 
hand instead of trying to control the
stick<00:00:36.930> all<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> time<00:00:37.469> what<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.800> mean<00:00:38.010> by<00:00:38.070> this

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
stick all the time what I mean by this

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.910 
stick all the time what I mean by this
is<00:00:38.540> allowing<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.660> stick<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> bounce<00:00:40.290> freely

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
is allowing the stick to bounce freely

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.119 
is allowing the stick to bounce freely
in<00:00:41.879> our<00:00:42.059> hand<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.020> when<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.260> takes<00:00:43.440> balancing

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
in our hand and when it takes balancing

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.060 
in our hand and when it takes balancing
we<00:00:44.250> control<00:00:44.730> these<00:00:45.000> bounces<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:46.469> give<00:00:46.649> us<00:00:46.800> our

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
we control these bounces to give us our

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.060 
we control these bounces to give us our
secondary<00:00:48.000> notes<00:00:48.360> playing<00:00:49.020> three<00:00:49.379> or<00:00:49.620> four<00:00:49.920> or

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
secondary notes playing three or four or

secondary notes playing three or four or
five<00:00:50.250> notes<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.850> time<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.719> one<00:00:52.050> flick<00:00:52.410> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
five notes and time with one flick of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.630 
five notes and time with one flick of
the<00:00:52.590> wrist<00:00:57.440> so<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.590> order<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.859> do<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.309> one<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640

the first things we need to work on is

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.179 
the first things we need to work on is
creating<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.210> pivot<00:01:03.510> point<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.960> our<00:01:04.080> hand<00:01:04.379> or

this is an exercise to help you get the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.699 
this is an exercise to help you get the
feel<00:02:13.190> of<00:02:13.580> what<00:02:14.090> it<00:02:14.180> feels<00:02:14.420> like<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.959> let<00:02:15.560> that

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
feel of what it feels like to let that

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.339 
feel of what it feels like to let that
stick<00:02:16.040> move<00:02:16.750> we<00:02:17.750> use<00:02:17.870> a<00:02:17.900> lot<00:02:17.989> of<00:02:18.110> energy

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
stick move we use a lot of energy

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.899 
stick move we use a lot of energy
playing<00:02:18.769> the<00:02:18.860> drums<00:02:19.129> and<00:02:19.310> every<00:02:19.549> time<00:02:19.700> we

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:19.909 
playing the drums and every time we

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.720 
playing the drums and every time we
strike<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.330> drum<00:02:20.540> we're<00:02:20.720> using<00:02:20.870> energy<00:02:21.730> let's

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
strike the drum we're using energy let's

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.820 
strike the drum we're using energy let's
use<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.330> energy<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.720> our<00:02:24.049> advantage<00:02:24.349> by

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
use that energy to our advantage by

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.479 
use that energy to our advantage by
letting<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.610> stick<00:02:25.970> move<00:02:26.239> and<00:02:26.860> then<00:02:27.860> bring

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
letting that stick move and then bring

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:35.110 
letting that stick move and then bring
the<00:02:28.700> stick<00:02:28.940> back<00:02:29.150> in<00:02:29.420> with<00:02:29.569> our<00:02:29.720> fingertips<00:02:34.120> to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
the stick back in with our fingertips to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.780 
the stick back in with our fingertips to
get<00:02:35.269> more<00:02:36.879> out<00:02:37.879> of<00:02:37.940> our<00:02:38.239> playing<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.920> from<00:02:40.250> this

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
get more out of our playing so from this

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.759 
get more out of our playing so from this
exercise<00:02:41.420> here<00:02:41.750> a<00:02:41.959> full<00:02:42.379> rebound<00:02:42.799> you're

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
the tips on the stick as well and then

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.550 
the tips on the stick as well and then
from<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:57.829> position<00:02:58.540> select<00:02:59.540> fingers<00:03:00.140> relax

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
from this position select fingers relax

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.470 
from this position select fingers relax
and<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.730> stick<00:03:02.000> is<00:03:02.180> going<00:03:02.359> to<00:03:02.420> fall<00:03:02.659> by<00:03:02.900> itself

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
and the stick is going to fall by itself

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.180 
and the stick is going to fall by itself
right<00:03:05.480> above<00:03:05.659> your<00:03:05.840> drum<00:03:06.079> and<00:03:06.799> our<00:03:06.980> rest

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
right above your drum and our rest

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.280 
right above your drum and our rest
position<00:03:07.640> this<00:03:08.450> is<00:03:08.599> what<00:03:08.720> relaxed

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
position this is what relaxed

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.580 
position this is what relaxed
comfortable<00:03:09.709> play<00:03:10.299> six<00:03:11.299> bounces<00:03:11.659> up<00:03:11.690> lacks

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
comfortable play six bounces up lacks

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.340 
comfortable play six bounces up lacks
down<00:03:12.889> up<00:03:13.849> down

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.600 

so<00:03:21.950> once<00:03:22.220> we<00:03:22.430> get<00:03:22.580> a<00:03:22.850> hold<00:03:23.690> on<00:03:23.840> this<00:03:24.250> now<00:03:25.250> we<00:03:25.310> can

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
so once we get a hold on this now we can

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.880 
so once we get a hold on this now we can
begin<00:03:25.760> to<00:03:25.910> see<00:03:26.030> how<00:03:26.420> to<00:03:27.380> use<00:03:27.530> this<00:03:27.680> to<00:03:27.740> our

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
begin to see how to use this to our

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.520 
begin to see how to use this to our
advantage<00:03:28.460> can<00:03:29.300> pop<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.630> stick<00:03:29.840> up<00:03:29.990> if<00:03:30.230> I<00:03:30.350> want

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
advantage can pop the stick up if I want

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:39.490 
advantage can pop the stick up if I want
to<00:03:30.560> collect<00:03:30.800> with<00:03:31.010> my<00:03:31.160> fingers<00:03:31.520> I<00:03:38.320> can<00:03:39.320> pull

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
to collect with my fingers I can pull

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.230 
to collect with my fingers I can pull
that<00:03:39.530> stick<00:03:39.920> in<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:41.170> generate<00:03:43.000> another<00:03:44.000> if

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
that stick in and generate another if

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.060 
that stick in and generate another if
you<00:03:44.330> want<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.720> fingers<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.170> be<00:03:45.440> lightly<00:03:45.740> on

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
you want the fingers to be lightly on

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:47.800 
you want the fingers to be lightly on
the<00:03:46.190> stick<00:03:46.430> and<00:03:46.640> always<00:03:47.210> following<00:03:47.660> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
the stick and always following the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.900 
the stick and always following the
movement<00:03:48.110> of<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.260> stick<00:03:50.560> so<00:03:51.560> I'm<00:03:51.800> playing<00:03:52.100> two

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
movement of the stick so I'm playing two

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.950 
movement of the stick so I'm playing two
beats<00:03:53.120> down<00:03:54.190> elect<00:03:55.210> another<00:03:56.210> important<00:03:56.870> thing

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
beats down elect another important thing

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.840 
beats down elect another important thing
to<00:03:57.110> remember<00:03:57.230> is<00:03:57.560> when<00:03:57.650> you<00:03:57.800> hit<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.340> drum<00:03:58.610> and

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
to remember is when you hit the drum and

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.750 
to remember is when you hit the drum and
you<00:03:59.480> allow<00:03:59.660> that<00:03:59.690> stick<00:04:00.080> to<00:04:00.170> come<00:04:00.320> up<00:04:00.760> come

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
you allow that stick to come up come

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.170 
you allow that stick to come up come
down<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.180> this<00:04:02.510> knuckle<00:04:02.930> stays<00:04:03.290> down

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
down and this knuckle stays down

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.130 
down and this knuckle stays down
tendency<00:04:05.180> for<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.570> lot<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:05.840> new<00:04:05.990> drivers

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
tendency for a lot of new drivers

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.070 
tendency for a lot of new drivers
learning<00:04:06.590> this<00:04:06.680> technique<00:04:06.830> is<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:07.700> try<00:04:08.090> to<00:04:08.120> get

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.080 
learning this technique is to try to get

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.080 
learning this technique is to try to get
more<00:04:09.320> on<00:04:09.500> that<00:04:09.680> second<00:04:10.040> beat<00:04:10.160> by<00:04:10.340> yanking<00:04:10.940> up

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
more on that second beat by yanking up

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.260 
more on that second beat by yanking up
on<00:04:11.270> the<00:04:11.360> stick<00:04:11.860> when<00:04:12.860> in<00:04:12.980> fact<00:04:13.010> if<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.060> stay

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:14.270 
on the stick when in fact if you stay

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.320 
on the stick when in fact if you stay
down<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.750> keep<00:04:15.350> this<00:04:15.470> knuckle<00:04:15.830> down<00:04:16.330> you're

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
down and keep this knuckle down you're

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.970 
down and keep this knuckle down you're
generating<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.810> lot<00:04:17.900> more<00:04:18.049> power<00:04:18.320> into<00:04:18.710> that

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
generating a lot more power into that

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.360 
generating a lot more power into that
drum<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.910> you<00:04:20.000> can<00:04:20.150> generate<00:04:20.420> to<00:04:20.600> bits<00:04:20.780> three

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
drum so you can generate to bits three

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:33.040 
drum so you can generate to bits three
beats<00:04:27.910> five<00:04:28.910> beats<00:04:29.440> as<00:04:30.440> you<00:04:30.620> can<00:04:30.740> see<00:04:32.050> i'm

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
beats five beats as you can see i'm

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.200 
beats five beats as you can see i'm
making<00:04:33.410> is<00:04:33.440> that<00:04:33.530> these<00:04:33.890> up<00:04:34.160> these<00:04:34.790> beats<00:04:35.060> all

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
making is that these up these beats all

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.140 
making is that these up these beats all
happen<00:04:35.630> with<00:04:36.020> one<00:04:36.380> flick<00:04:36.770> of<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:36.920> wrist<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:37.460> a

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
happen with one flick of the wrist and a

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.810 
happen with one flick of the wrist and a
collection<00:04:38.630> of<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.870> fingers<00:04:39.290> in<00:04:39.800> time<00:04:40.490> so

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
collection of the fingers in time so
