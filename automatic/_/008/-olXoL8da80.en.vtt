00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.730
 yes my name is klaus hollmann i am 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.610
 in the kaff field, a bioland 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.250
 north of hamburg and i am 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.269
 here just the summer honey too 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.330
 harvest it is the end of july temperatures 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:22.740
 are ideal 34 and 25 degrees 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:24.420
 and yet I have a hit here 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.680
 and it just depends on it 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.689
 that no bees are aligned so use 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.329
 still for bees on the warm one 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.210
 I'm sitting down in here 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.520
 this year, finally 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.239
 rectangular bucket that is very 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.579
 practically you can see that now Libya 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.590
 fall into this bucket so that I can 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.649
 not every time which above purely capable 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.620
 wait again for the next have the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.329
 Young people mostly stay in the container 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:01:01.199
 back the older vienna fly up and 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:05.180
 go back to your prey with 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.560
 I do not like working with bees 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.500
 once a day before here 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.049
 You do not have to go much standlight 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.530
 near his residence 120 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.560
 kilometers away and to the other 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.080
 I made the experience that we have 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.960
 but not to be so warmed from ironing 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.049
 as if the order in the people and then 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.740
 sometimes worse after the control 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:38.259
 through the sieve in the bar then already 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.259
 a low temperature have the 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.670
 once I use 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.469
 that should also clean the floor completely 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.079
 normal once, however, rectangular 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:52.439
 and is very suitable like that 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:55.229
 Weighing is allowed to see now with stock 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.140
 meisel only the first was the 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.319
 I can then solve the next elections well 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.979
 with my being and I then again 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:09.960
 to the derogatory use the offended 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.540
 were the ones here are well covered 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.850
 a number that is on the golf booty 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.420
 one is a wooden cross 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.390
 the two peoples are doing business there 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.420
 it just wanted to concede one of 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.760
 network military this guy i believe 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.300
 serve more here on the stand 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.190
 The beekeepers will also look for it 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.640
 who are in training and you 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:41.100
 getting to know different types of floor 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:43.110
 Yes, this is what she wants to do before 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.030
 Of course, it's easy if they were good 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.550
 are concealed because even hidden 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.980
 warm little bees sit if the 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.470
 warm only to two thirds only 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.010
 Half in the summer sometimes only ten 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.620
 percent are covered then that's 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:03.030
 a little harder the bees there too 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.120
 find because even the broom slowly 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.970
 united and you have to go if you want that 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.820
 next follows from harvesting before times 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.760
 cleanse those beings again 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.110
 so that you are not injured in them 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.480
 brings if this is too hard 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.460
 yes, that is of course before we have 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.790
 there keeps colors in there that I would them 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.790
 now save that people here to see 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.390
 Well, that's what we did 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.780
 continue javascript is that have become 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:56.230
 visibly, I bump the bees again 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:59.230
 down and run on the wall is once 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:05.620
 high and also over the ridge and are 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:07.980
 then a doctor here is the chime 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.930
 taken off with knocking it off again 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.700
 now and again that the bees 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.400
 do not leak 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.000
 Burst and now the grid 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.000
 solved 

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:28.990
 I then knock the lattice off the bees 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.820
 the prey is falling and now very important 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.050
 not the same on it and cover 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.520
 on it but first vienna out of the bucket 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.220
 to return 1 man to the people 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.310
 in this case I am in favor 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.150
 dior wearer decided something else too 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.770
 Scrape off what to scrape off to sad 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.229
 the bees are not down 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.240
 Out 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.340
 the reason is that I am in the 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.970
 next days then with suitable 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:02.040
 weather sponge cloth with soda user and 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:06.160
 coworkers against the varroa the 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.630
 treated peoples and there it is 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.560
 always good when i go through the top 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.139
 are on it 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.080
 I do not know with the acid 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.370
 Anyway, I'm doing the crowds like that 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.729
 Rubber gloves are always whole 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.539
 it is helpful that you are not there 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.909
 Honey honey or wax fits hands 

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:28.879
 from until then been rather annoying 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:31.939
 you see i'll throw the best if it is 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:33.620
 only small amounts are and it is bigger 

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:34.520
 bugs bridges winter on summery 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.699
 given growth 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:43.370
 Sonnenberg sister and then become 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:47.449
 used again for pouring own 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.999
 middle walls yes to that is still to say 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:54.770
 I center walls with other beekeepers 

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:57.349
 together out of some bugs 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.259
 so we own a chrysler wax 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:04.699
 I have many colors in my fight 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:06.710
 that can not be harmful 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:10.159
 Here they see the day of yet only times 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:12.490
 cleaned something so you have everything 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:12.490
 well prepared 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.930
 as I said, they do not forget him 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:28.720
 to give in again already follows 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.310
 everything happens already today in 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.380
 Processing after that still stand 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.330
 he is still the one with the 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:38.050
 Bees that it is not so by just everything 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:43.720
 again on foil and lid on it 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:47.500
 and that works with the panel 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:50.290
 honey i get in frieds needs one 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.960
 foil is my format normal that 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:56.160
 the positon and speaks hopefully 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.160
 is always very hesitant though
