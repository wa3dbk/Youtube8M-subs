 3 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:21.130
 this persists 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.589
 these sad 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:27.429
 the budding and head sciences are some of the qualities 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.269
 contemplate so if you want to isolate the work of this artist from the pastry shop 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.170
 two 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.240
 during his master class a payment was shown why he is the teacher 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.760
 money price ohio goal 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.330
 fayyad 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.290
 currently libya impeccable work confesses sector that I started to efe is 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.790
 highly recognized 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.420
 efe 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.040
 According to official figures, almost all current workshop registration offices 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.760
 illustration 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
 it was his first response 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 these accesses by the first step mumbai 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.730
 this step that you are going to see you this is 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.230
 syrup 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.440
 at 40 degrees temperature 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.370
 from here we will create what are the liquid crystals forest 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.079
 inside the other sugar bark 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.420
 that we can even make salty 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.870
 this is a contribution for the kitchen 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.010
 and what we do in the drawers as file x 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.410
 we are not updating we are not putting it looked completely 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.120
 we create our own forms we can create the long ones 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.170
 round square rectangular 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.450
 this is done because 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.600
 we're going to put it inside desserts and drawers even left behind or any 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.260
 other idea 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.350
 and we will be able to inside a liquid this liquid for the effect already warned that no 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.600
 can absorb the plane will create an outer crust 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.460
 in a recipient 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.850
 sugar 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.229
 and it depends on the time we want 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.109
 we can reach 31 32 degrees baumé 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.109
 they say that how fast we want to dry 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:18.339
 i is fundamental 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:21.279
 that when we are cooking 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.239
 in times very well the walls with a 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.339
 inter 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:28.249
 or with water because if there is some degree of crystal they caused recrystallization 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.939
 of the sugar itself 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.819
 once the sugar is the video of this note the temperature that unwanted 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.759
 We have to sing it as we chose, we have a wine very carefully because 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:45.549
 this weekend of the height that we decant or of the movements the speed we want 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.219
 thicker or thinner crystals 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.899
 and here we add any brave act not 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.700
 as an example of service such as 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.729
 linares de módena corresponds to any type 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:03:00.129
 you have to leave it covered with a damp cloth for five and ten minutes 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.900
 so that it passes will be completely steam like all the aromas of the 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:05.679
 costs 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:08.939
 well it's brandy h romances fugaces way patent 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.829
 and here he is filling his holes this as we go up we do a lot 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.579
 with a lot of quantity we even sell for restaurants 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.729
 there is a fort but that final defeat because then they jump from each job 

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:24.339
 all the speculation will come out 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:26.339
 and not in taking the steps back 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.379
 here we are another model 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.620
 I made depending on the thickness that put installed for example the caviar 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.339
 interviewed in 12 minutes together 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:36.310
 that was just 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.509
 two or three hours 4 there the tables that we have made 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:41.709
 to know what the time is 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.179
 it's also important that we covered it 

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:47.749
 we have to say that we do not have to cover up with the starch itself what it is 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:50.369
 what happens that starch does not allow 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:55.019
 the union does not allow it to act because it retains moisture however it goes 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.339
 crystallizing originating an outer crust 

00:03:58.339 --> 00:04:01.829
 until we get in glass and depending on how long you have it 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.820
 before the problem 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.919
 the starch 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:08.650
 it will be more bone - with wefts and it is not more delicate it is better to be 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:11.149
 already once already dry 

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:14.089
 What we do is remove them from the DNA doctors 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:17.650
 once we have removed the starch that the equipment needed we already have 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.299
 despite all the 20 that are completely different here we have 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.840
 what you suffer from chocolate with caviar 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:28.099
 in the bosca affair 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.469
 Nowadays it is a luxury to change with your mouth, that is why the idea is to create a 

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:33.129
 toast 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.389
 that when we bit the blues is to capture it and we ate we broke the 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.360
 crystal beads in the mouth and it is finished or changed 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.400
 here we have what are some chocolates with the cuts 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.040
 that take case by afip and endemol 800 these shots we take it towards service 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.099
 so that there is 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.409
 that are life water of any kind that have frozen if 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:55.409
 the client chooses it in both cases concacaf area 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.379
 but let's move on to the bells of san martín 

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:08.200
 for that reason it occurs to them to say 2 3% 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.140
 paco torreblanca showed in a simple way one of his masterpieces whose 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.280
 protagonists were cancerous and forms of his house 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.949
 here we have an adding and adding can be found in many but many 

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:22.069
 formats 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.120
 have a powder side 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.120
 and in the end we realized that by adding 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.370
 8 grams per thousand 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.159
 we find an important elasticity 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:36.939
 this sugar unlike the other sugars you can model constantly 

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:39.080
 because there is no recrystallization 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.839
 more than 190 work 

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:44.029
 pérez that is 180 apartments at the box office and josé the web 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:49.300
 the result is that there is your last letter there will be 190 degrees 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.360
 carbonization 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.349
 there to the million jobs because it is a firm five positioned 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:57.729
 But for that to be toxic, I recommend that your schemes 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.559
 used 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.080
 of space is the sugar inside 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.219
 and let stand almost three minutes of the end of this distance is sugar 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.550
 this goes and know why he wanted to give in to those who did speak to see that city is 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.229
 another system in venezuela 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.550
 lorenzo and this the only thing I do is so she tells the young people the 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.620
 bell you're really going to see the finished pieces you can put extra effort 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.580
 inside hodges driveways study and always believed that the idea is very 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.990
 important each one that contribute 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.169
 whatever you consider your techniques of that technique you have to leave in your own way 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.680
 informs defense me soil mendez the style is that it means that the 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.150
 chestnuts in that country 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:44.050
 confirmed once again that we regret Spanish activities if something happens 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.050
 step forward 

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.899
 we accompany 

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:51.699
