00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
think it could have made it a little

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.780 
think it could have made it a little
better<00:01:48.340> you<00:01:49.340> could<00:01:49.490> have<00:01:49.580> made<00:01:49.700> the

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
better you could have made the

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.270 
better you could have made the
background<00:01:50.330> just<00:01:50.840> not<00:01:51.170> plain<00:01:51.530> blue<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:52.190> it

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
background just not plain blue and it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.280 
background just not plain blue and it
could<00:01:52.400> have<00:01:52.490> made<00:01:52.670> some<00:01:52.970> crowds<00:01:53.570> instead<00:01:54.200> of

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
could have made some crowds instead of

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.410 
could have made some crowds instead of
those<00:01:54.470> it<00:01:55.340> looks<00:01:55.490> like<00:01:55.640> it's<00:01:55.850> just<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.150> team

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
those it looks like it's just the team

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.820 
those it looks like it's just the team

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
gameplay a seven point 0 because it was

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.540 
gameplay a seven point 0 because it was
pretty<00:02:22.000> good<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:23.560> it<00:02:23.800> was<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.400> know<00:02:24.519> not

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
pretty good but it was you know not

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.949 
pretty good but it was you know not
great<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:26.319> overall<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.709> do<00:02:26.980> this<00:02:27.190> game<00:02:27.489> a<00:02:27.959> 7.5

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
great so overall I do this game a 7.5

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.680 
great so overall I do this game a 7.5
out<00:02:29.290> of<00:02:29.379> 10<00:02:29.620> because<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:30.400> an<00:02:30.489> ok<00:02:30.790> game<00:02:31.060> I'm

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
out of 10 because it's an ok game I'm

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.990 
out of 10 because it's an ok game I'm
not<00:02:31.930> amazing<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:33.489> if<00:02:33.670> you're<00:02:33.790> in<00:02:33.910> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
not amazing so if you're in the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.180 
not amazing so if you're in the
basketball<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.569> forcing<00:02:35.049> that<00:02:35.709> kind<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:35.980> stuff

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
basketball is forcing that kind of stuff

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.070 
basketball is forcing that kind of stuff
I<00:02:36.340> definitely<00:02:36.610> recommend<00:02:36.849> picking<00:02:37.360> up<00:02:37.750> for<00:02:38.049> a

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
I definitely recommend picking up for a

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.280 
I definitely recommend picking up for a
cool<00:02:38.349> old<00:02:38.709> fashioned<00:02:39.959> sports<00:02:40.959> game

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
cool old fashioned sports game

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.170 
cool old fashioned sports game
especially<00:02:42.069> if<00:02:42.370> you're<00:02:42.489> in<00:02:42.549> the<00:02:42.670> basketball

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
especially if you're in the basketball

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.089 
especially if you're in the basketball
if<00:02:44.049> you're<00:02:44.290> into<00:02:44.470> like<00:02:44.590> football<00:02:45.069> or

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:45.099 
if you're into like football or

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:46.650 
if you're into like football or
something<00:02:45.400> maybe<00:02:45.760> should<00:02:46.090> wait<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.299> little<00:02:46.420> bit

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
something maybe should wait a little bit

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.880 
something maybe should wait a little bit
because<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.680> getting<00:02:47.950> okay<00:02:48.239> but<00:02:49.890> that's

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
because it's getting okay but that's

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.650 
because it's getting okay but that's
actually<00:02:51.250> pretty<00:02:51.579> much<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.940> almost<00:02:52.150> for<00:02:52.510> my

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
actually pretty much it almost for my

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.580 
actually pretty much it almost for my
