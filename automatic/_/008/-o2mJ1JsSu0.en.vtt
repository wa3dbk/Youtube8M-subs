00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.350
 the time in the diary and they are 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.880
 known and loved by many people like 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.430
 It feels like having on the same court 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.430
 let's say in the substitute bank to 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.100
 bianchi inside the field riquelme 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.340
 the truth is they are the most of the mouth and 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.530
 it's an awesome experience a 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.990
 pride being with sharing with the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.970
 guys always coincide and when they go up 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.180
 make super more elements with first 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:48.700
 in which Carlos is a simple guy like 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.670
 would define if I also think the same 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.950
 it is true very very humble very simple 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.150
 and as you can see as he sees it 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.300
 people 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.850
 it's like for some technicians that 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.920
 they think about them but think about the good 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.780
 of mouth and the truth so so 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.509
 little I know him person a man 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.970
 wing you are conscious god despite the 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.980
 short age that you have if you are today 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.570
 playing in reserve and you have ownership 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.790
 beyond your conditions means 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.590
 that he also recognizes that he knows 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.540
 that you have many conditions and that you are 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.240
 very close the first obviously 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.330
 still missing but well there is already one step 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.140
 great and good, I think that by strengthening 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.410
 in reserve 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.900
