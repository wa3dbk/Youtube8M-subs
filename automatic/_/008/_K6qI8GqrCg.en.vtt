00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.139
 my ladies and gentlemen, I greet you all 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.910
 Sincerely to the brand whisper our topic 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.920
 gold is the next chance today 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.650
 now maybe the yellow metal has 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.539
 For a long time really the possibility 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.070
 a big liberation here too 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.109
 accomplish because today there was one 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.760
 grotto bad us real estate data the 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.490
 some are question but ask 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.890
 right now we had more on the 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.260
 agenda it was a rather quiet overall 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.030
 day that was almost to be expected but one 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.760
 few highlights there were volmer located 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.739
 The ceo of microsoft is within the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.210
 resign the next twelve months 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.430
 whole is not so surprising 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.520
 because under the leadership of ballmer has 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.149
 Microsoft actually has many important new ones 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.010
 markets almost overslept and that has 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.809
 the market hoped that the farmers 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.360
 finally step back and then one 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.520
 fresh successor here the markets on 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.960
 he can be considered as a brake pad and 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.149
 not surprisingly that is 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.760
 today is the case then we had the 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.799
 message that moody's the grading of 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.439
 some big banks are looking at it 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.909
 grothmann 16 why because in the usa 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.409
 financial reforms are pending and that will 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.150
 mean that the state 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.310
 support for banks 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.140
 and that could be down to the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.009
 balance sheets then soon be reflected in 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.890
 but we are not sure yet 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.450
 had some statements from fed today 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.770
 members in jackson hole yes this 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.689
 big important central bank conference 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.630
 but without Ben Bernanke without Mario 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.700
 draghi insofar the second guard only 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.710
 but here were some big ones like 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.430
 james bond he said so very well 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.229
 maybe it's not that serious with that 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.479
 tape bringmann would definitely be the one 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.619
 wait for economic data etc 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.090
 you try a bit too much 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.040
 appease and that could be necessary 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.960
 because we had the us today 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.700
 Newbuild sales bad the grottoes 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.009
 were -13 4 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.070
 even the pre-month was significantly after 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.799
 below revised why because just in the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.479
 last months since may more precisely 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.040
 The mortgage rates are dramatic 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.099
 these mortgage rates have risen 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.789
 are coupled to the ten-year-old 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.380
 US government bond and there are the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.230
 returns went up massively 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.720
 september has announced catering here 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.070
 want to operate or at least the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.480
 possibility in the room 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.160
 Since then, the risks are also increasing 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.940
 the mortgage rates and that is for 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.440
 the american 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.880
 for the average american each 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.770
 The property he becomes becomes clear 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.520
 more expensive and for those the loans 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.010
 need to serve 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.840
 he applies the same and the next 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.250
 mean that the fed now we see 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.170
 by this announcement of 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.790
 catering made sure that the 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.310
 mortgage rates so high up 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.710
 go and the real estate market was the 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.120
 growth driver in the usa this 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.510
 growth may break if I break 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.280
 and that could lead to a rethink 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.260
 the markets then say maybe 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.940
 well so the fed will be 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.590
 can not afford here and that 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.910
 to further stall the real estate market 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.440
 insofar this tape will bring 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.270
 maybe not get it and that 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.800
 led to some authoritative 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.230
 We will move here 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.480
 look there we have and the 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.670
 euro / dollar from the stand then 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.460
 over the single 34 has risen 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.460
 this level does not quite keep up to date 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:13.380
 139 89 the stock markets are more likely 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.170
 behave responsive to the dax here 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.180
 on an exact basis on 1419 after all over 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.510
 the 8000 of the 400 brand here the dow 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.710
 Jones still struggles with the 15,000 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.720
 the brand here is just one 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.400
 relevant resistance just under 15,000 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.490
 if we could go over it 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.350
 definitely continue to run then the 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.060
 already mentioned by us 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.770
 ten-year US government bond maybe 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.020
 the most important step ever since 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.550
 Many things are coupled to the 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.340
 Stock markets react strongly to the 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.940
 development here of the bond and we 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.550
 see here 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.900
 this massive green candle seem here 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.850
 maybe a floor in the short term 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.290
 to have found and this quality 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.959
 really certifies that 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.459
 bad us data but who are here 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.830
 was happy and that's the title 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.930
 is gold and we see here we have 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.900
 the chance now at 1400 where the 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.180
 Goldpreis aktuell notes that this is a big jump 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.700
 about this brand then here 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.980
 Connection purchases up to the area 1480 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.320
 Once you can regenerate and 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.080
 maybe then if the story 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.940
 Catering from the table should still be 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.550
 further price gains but still that is 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.260
 Not 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.420
 really sure you have to wait and see how 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.860
 the next dates will be but it is 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.650
 definitely a strong braking track 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.330
 that the real estate market here 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.650
 obviously his job has found the 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.790
 older ones will remember 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.830
 we have always had in the last few weeks 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.660
 Again, that could be the case 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.700
 and that's how it came now 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.040
 another view of microsoft here 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.720
 in conclusion this is just the result of 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.270
 the resignation of Steve Ballmer massive 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.570
 but consolidated a bit 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.400
 the whole thing out again so the question 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.530
 is that in the short term in so much brings 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.940
 nevertheless steve becomes ballmer 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.500
 may still be on board until 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.670
 just a follower is found so 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.380
 maybe we have one today 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.570
 very important day experienced a game 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.820
 changer experienced when the real estate data 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.160
 then they can be so bad 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.960
 actually do not do that 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.210
 what she has announced, namely catering 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:07.000
 and that could then become a renaissance 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.440
 Some precious metals like gold 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.360
 or even for the renaissance of 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.040
 Stock markets are a weakness of the 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.260
 dollars we have to wait and see 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.340
 Most times is look at the action 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.340
 broker experts
