niggas know I said it I told you that
though<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.159> use<00:01:14.369> GPU<00:01:15.240> was<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.780> least<00:01:16.229> two

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890

this<00:01:21.840> confirms<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:23.210> but<00:01:24.210> he<00:01:24.299> goes<00:01:24.540> on<00:01:24.979> says<00:01:25.979> it

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
this confirms it but he goes on says it

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.580 
this confirms it but he goes on says it
allows<00:01:26.460> many<00:01:26.909> things<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.570> are<00:01:27.720> not<00:01:27.960> possible
