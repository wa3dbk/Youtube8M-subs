00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.470
 Hi, I'm from Spain and downloaded a 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.719
 a must-have recipe because you will not miss 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.449
 because they 're going to make a loaf in just one 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.660
 step and without wasting the time that we have 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:17.690
 flour flour three or four zeros the one 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.340
 get three perfect super pasteur 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.250
 we add here 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.130
 and without a mixer and nothing by hand 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.679
 eye with that 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.779
 wholemeal bark dietetics 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.110
 or anywhere they sell in your 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.840
 home because I super also learn 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.489
 areas one between having these two flours 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.949
 which can obviously replace it 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.980
 can do all of integral or all the 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:48.270
 line 30 or 40 that would make them much more 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:51.540
 of barely if instant 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.020
 it will be fine 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.420
 it's a full bread full of seeds and van 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.850
 to see that it is not worth going hard and 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.090
 you do not even have to wait for him to give 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.330
 another very important data then 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.330
 seeds 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:09.030
 I have flax seed seeds 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.310
 sunflower we have many seeds that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.960
 nowadays in the market they can 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.150
 find easily can be 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.280
 counted or unroasted if you have this 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.290
 monegros this case once 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.410
 we have this with good hands 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.470
 clean tiqui tiqui tiqui we make the 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:28.630
 famous swirl hole in the center 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.610
 what are we going to add powder for 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.550
 bake and what he will give 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:38.650
 a little hat well the mount is of payment 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.650
 and a little bit of baking soda 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.190
 one 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.110
 with this little bit more also once 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:54.220
 we have all this we have to add 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.220
 milk we have here whole milk in this 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:00.400
 case there is 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.440
 that more would be enough with a little salt or 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.910
 We use yeast so we do not have to 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.320
 have no care about almost the ligature 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:10.250
 and the salt are together a little honey 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.250
 there is 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.340
 and finally some olive oil 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.019
 once we have all these 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.739
 ingredients the only thing that remains is 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.739
 Mix 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.310
 once we have this look at 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.490
 consistency that you have left if we look for a 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:37.550
 mold I have it here back like win 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.660
 Win English if you can see it is very very 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.240
 common against any caste of 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.630
 pastry and I in this case as it is 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.020
 I put a paper because a butter paper 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.900
 because when you mold it, it's like that, tic and 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.730
 the bread tastes perfect easier than 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.730
 this there is not you can complain 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.770
 quiet 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.790
 since there are many practical missions 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.790
 easy and fast 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.910
 then here we fill the mold 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.490
 do not forget butter paper because it's 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:20.720
 a very important fact and we preheat 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.250
 the oven at 180 degrees to 180 degrees as 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.730
 moderate what you have without seeking to feel 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.730
 a man neither too strong nor too soft 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:37.220
 one after in fact a little turn that 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.620
 it sits well fine in the background and 41 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.299
 minutes 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.980
 clin clin clin and you have to be inside 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:48.909
 hollow will sound like there's nothing 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.909
 when only so the one that is already perfect 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:57.530
 the performance is so amazing next 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.530
 homework
