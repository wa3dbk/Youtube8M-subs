00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
Prix was good is it something that we

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.990 
Prix was good is it something that we
almost<00:00:28.080> all<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:28.920> accept<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.519> Ferrari

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
almost all have to accept that Ferrari

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.820 
almost all have to accept that Ferrari
do<00:00:30.330> get<00:00:30.539> off<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.900> slow<00:00:30.990> start<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.619> season

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
do get off to a slow start of the season

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.670 
do get off to a slow start of the season
well<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.669> think<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.360> year<00:00:33.660> last<00:00:34.110> year<00:00:34.410> it<00:00:34.559> was

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
well I think this year last year it was

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.450 
well I think this year last year it was
maybe<00:00:35.480> more<00:00:36.480> difficult<00:00:37.050> because<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:38.160> was<00:00:38.340> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
maybe more difficult because it was the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.560 
maybe more difficult because it was the
first<00:00:38.489> year<00:00:38.940> for<00:00:39.450> me<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.050> Ferrari<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.570> 2009

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
first year for me in Ferrari and 2009

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.600 
first year for me in Ferrari and 2009
was<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.110> great<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> team<00:00:44.010> either<00:00:44.280> so

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
was not great for the team either so

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.450 
was not great for the team either so
this<00:00:45.450> year<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.719> think<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.110> different<00:00:46.890> it's<00:00:47.370> just

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
this year I think is different it's just

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.369 
this year I think is different it's just
the<00:00:47.700> Windtunnel<00:00:48.420> problems<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.960> we<00:00:49.110> had<00:00:49.260> at

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the Windtunnel problems that we had at

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.990 
the Windtunnel problems that we had at
the<00:00:49.469> end<00:00:49.500> of<00:00:49.680> winter<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:50.219> has<00:00:50.399> slowed<00:00:50.550> us<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
the end of winter that has slowed us a

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000 
the end of winter that has slowed us a
lot<00:00:51.510> in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.260> first<00:00:52.379> couple<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.800> races

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
lot in the in the first couple of races

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.549 
lot in the in the first couple of races
but<00:00:53.539> it's<00:00:54.539> true<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.140> both<00:00:55.320> occasions

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
but it's true that in both occasions

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.340 
but it's true that in both occasions
unfortunately<00:00:56.430> we<00:00:56.550> start<00:00:56.960> losing<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.199> lot<00:00:58.320> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
unfortunately we start losing a lot of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.990 
unfortunately we start losing a lot of
points<00:00:58.800> at<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.949> beginning<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.489> year<00:00:59.640> so

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
points at the beginning of the year so

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.450 
points at the beginning of the year so
we<00:01:00.809> need<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> improve<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.070> part<00:01:02.309> of<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
we need to improve that part of the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
we need to improve that part of the
championship<00:01:02.969> for<00:01:03.120> 2012<00:01:03.780> surely<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
championship for 2012 surely you

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.080 
championship for 2012 surely you
wouldn't<00:01:04.799> sign<00:01:05.010> for<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> team<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.580> started

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
wouldn't sign for a team that started

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.210 
wouldn't sign for a team that started
its<00:01:06.360> championship<00:01:06.900> hopes<00:01:07.110> halfway<00:01:08.010> through

its championship hopes halfway through

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.950 
its championship hopes halfway through
the<00:01:08.310> season<00:01:08.520> yeah<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.090> course<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.570> course<00:01:09.600> we

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the season yeah of course of course we

we want to fight for the championship

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.640 
we want to fight for the championship
every<00:01:11.909> year<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.390> raise<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.900> we<00:01:13.110> know<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
every year we raise and we know that the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.160 
every year we raise and we know that the
first<00:01:14.250> half<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> season<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> key<00:01:15.900> part

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
first half of the season is a key part

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.980 
first half of the season is a key part
of<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.470> only<00:01:16.830> championship<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.580> it's

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
of the only championship so it's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.359 
of the only championship so it's
something<00:01:18.990> that<00:01:19.140> for<00:01:19.290> sure<00:01:19.680> we<00:01:19.920> will<00:01:20.130> improve

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
something that for sure we will improve

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.609 
something that for sure we will improve
in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.990> next<00:01:22.259> couple<00:01:22.439> of

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
in the in the in the next couple of

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.010 
in the in the in the next couple of
years<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.310> I<00:01:23.610> think<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.509> Ferrari<00:01:24.810> before

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
years and I think in Ferrari before

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.310 
years and I think in Ferrari before
later<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.159> success<00:01:26.549> will<00:01:26.759> come<00:01:26.970> because<00:01:27.320> it's

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
later the success will come because it's

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.980 
later the success will come because it's
a<00:01:28.409> great<00:01:28.590> team<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.150> they<00:01:30.150> have<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.750> huge

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
a great team and they have a huge

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.200 
a great team and they have a huge
potential<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.860> well<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
potential to do well do you think that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.940 
potential to do well do you think that
Sebastian<00:01:33.659> Vettel<00:01:33.990> winner<00:01:34.259> or<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.710> somebody

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
Sebastian Vettel winner or can somebody

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.550 
Sebastian Vettel winner or can somebody
else<00:01:35.100> take<00:01:35.490> his<00:01:35.909> hands<00:01:36.090> at<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.810> moment<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.229> is

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
else take his hands at the moment is is

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.510 
else take his hands at the moment is is
difficult<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:39.150> think<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.200> anyone<00:01:41.040> can<00:01:41.220> can

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
difficult to think that anyone can can

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.100 
difficult to think that anyone can can
recover<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.000> gap<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.600> honest<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
recover the gap to be honest and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.620 
recover the gap to be honest and
realistic<00:01:43.759> Sebastian<00:01:44.759> did<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.000> fantastic

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
realistic Sebastian did a fantastic
