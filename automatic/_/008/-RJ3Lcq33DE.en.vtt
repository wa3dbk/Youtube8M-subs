00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.780
 hello caradisiac presents you a 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.420
 preview the new opel insignia 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.760
 which will be officially presented to 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.760
 Frankfurt lounge next September 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.550
 as you can see it is 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.320
 outside of a restyling and not 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.240
 an entirely new model and 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.360
 amendments also concern 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.270
 running gear of new engines and to 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.160
 within a simplification of 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.270
 controls on the center console and 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.280
 so we have a lot more ergonomics 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.450
 now as we will see everything at 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.510
 the time outside as you 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.850
 note this is a restyling and 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.590
 not a complete overhaul of the model the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.170
 front panel has been completely redesigned 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.770
 as well for the calender the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.780
 projectors that the shield for the 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.360
 calender for example it is lower 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.280
 more tapered which gives an impression 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.280
 wider widths to the car 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.560
 for the profile no change to 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.740
 report if not on the five doors 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.750
 this art he refined that gives a 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.180
 feeling of cutting more assertive than 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.370
 previously 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.560
 in the back we will notice mainly the 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.840
 chrome rush that placed lower and which 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.790
 now incorporates the brand logo 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.590
 and continues inside the fires 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.049
 who are new to these small fires 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.909
 detail we will note that they are powered 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.799
 by diodes as well for the fires 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.049
 only for stop lamps 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.939
 inside all the changes are 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.579
 concentrated under the eyes of the driver 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.409
 everything else does not change so the 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.100
 dashboard look at its volumes 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.140
 there are just the inserts that changes and this 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.609
 which is really very different is the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.740
 center console which is my request 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:06.219
 get rid of a multitude of pimples 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:09.250
 we now have a central touch screen 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:11.170
 20 cm diagonal that allows to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.590
 order several great functions 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.810
 novelty we also have a touchpad that 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.050
 is available as standard on all 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.150
 versions except on the base edition this 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.850
 pad allows you to order all 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.700
 infotainment functions including 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.200
 radio and navigation 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.620
 except console changes 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.570
 power plant 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.730
 there is also a new block 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:40.310
 instruments it's very pretty very 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.310
 practical and very readable 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.240
 for opel below announces 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.010
 significant changes in 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.320
 running gear for example with 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.110
 new dampers or bars 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.090
 stabilizers change that we'll see this 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.000
 that it gives during the test to 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.890
 autumn for engines some 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.750
 remain unchanged as the diesel the 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.820
 more powerful 195 horses 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.300
 the most interesting of the new range 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.960
 it's a 2 liter 140 horsepower that's 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:16.270
 given for 3 liters 7 and 99 g 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.720
 to note also for the amateurs of the senses 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:22.810
 again in the running direct injection that 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.370
 gave for 6 liter 1 and 144 g which 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.000
 is still not bad for a big 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.990
 family size of insignia 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.240
 insignia will no longer be offered in 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.850
 france in version 5 doors and in 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.310
 break tourer the 4-door version that does not 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.290
 only 2% of sales 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.680
 abandoned 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.800
 launched at the end of 2008 and car of the year 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.670
 2009 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.050
 the opel insignia sold in europe to 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.990
 580 1000 copies so far 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.940
 of which thirty thousand in France with this 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.280
 restyling that does not only concern 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.060
 the facelift or the front 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.580
 engines 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.170
 it's gone for a ride and after 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.510
 we for three or four years 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.100
 still the orders of the insignia 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.620
 restyled are already possible 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.420
 the first deliveries will take place 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.210
