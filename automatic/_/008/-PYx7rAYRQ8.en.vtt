00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
thought i would write about the perfect

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.720 
thought i would write about the perfect
linux<00:00:40.480> desktop<00:00:40.960> three<00:00:41.559> contenders<00:00:41.980> mainly

linux desktop three contenders mainly

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.540 
linux desktop three contenders mainly
for<00:00:43.380> windows<00:00:44.380> users<00:00:44.800> of<00:00:44.980> what<00:00:45.100> i<00:00:45.130> believe<00:00:45.520> to

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
for windows users of what i believe to

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.820 
for windows users of what i believe to
be<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.850> top<00:00:46.210> three<00:00:46.510> choices<00:00:46.540> sorry<00:00:47.290> perfect

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:47.830 
be the top three choices sorry perfect

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.190 
be the top three choices sorry perfect
linux<00:00:48.220> desktop<00:00:48.520> and<00:00:49.000> this<00:00:49.120> would<00:00:49.300> be<00:00:49.330> linux

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
linux desktop and this would be linux

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.150 
linux desktop and this would be linux
mint<00:00:50.440> lubuntu<00:00:51.100> and<00:00:52.320> Zoren<00:00:53.320> in<00:00:53.530> no<00:00:53.860> particular

let's<00:01:29.350> get<00:01:29.560> started<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:30.100> first<00:01:30.130> thing<00:01:30.640> is<00:01:30.850> the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
think the number two I think the pc the

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.600 
think the number two I think the pc the
linux<00:02:34.950> pc<00:02:35.450> should<00:02:36.450> look<00:02:36.740> cool<00:02:37.740> I<00:02:38.010> mean<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
linux pc should look cool I mean the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.910 
linux pc should look cool I mean the
default<00:02:39.030> desktop<00:02:39.300> should<00:02:39.840> look<00:02:40.020> very<00:02:40.050> easy<00:02:40.620> to

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
default desktop should look very easy to

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.310 
default desktop should look very easy to
use<00:02:40.950> now<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.090> three<00:02:42.360> zoran<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.020> course

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
use now of the three zoran of course

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.790 
use now of the three zoran of course
looks<00:02:43.740> closest<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.340> windows<00:02:45.410> although<00:02:46.410> linux

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
looks closest to windows although linux

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.620 
looks closest to windows although linux
mint<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.220> Ubuntu<00:02:47.280> unity<00:02:48.060> are<00:02:48.209> not<00:02:48.390> difficult

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
mint and Ubuntu unity are not difficult

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.830 
mint and Ubuntu unity are not difficult
to<00:02:48.959> learn<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.700> use<00:02:50.700> i've<00:02:51.030> been<00:02:51.180> using<00:02:51.360> unity

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
to learn and use i've been using unity

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.270 
to learn and use i've been using unity
for<00:02:52.260> over<00:02:52.440> two<00:02:52.650> weeks<00:02:53.570> let's<00:02:54.570> see<00:02:54.810> ya<00:02:55.320> over<00:02:56.130> two

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
for over two weeks let's see ya over two

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.120 
for over two weeks let's see ya over two
weeks<00:02:56.489> now<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:57.239> seems<00:02:57.420> fine<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.860> third

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
weeks now and it seems fine the third

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.710 
weeks now and it seems fine the third
thing<00:02:59.160> i<00:02:59.520> wanted<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.820> mention<00:02:59.940> is<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.450> price

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
thing i wanted to mention is the price

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.570 
thing i wanted to mention is the price
now<00:03:01.140> I<00:03:01.200> realized<00:03:01.800> that<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.190> international

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
now I realized that the international

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.330 
now I realized that the international
exchange<00:03:03.330> rate<00:03:03.720> can<00:03:04.050> fluctuate<00:03:04.350> but<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.950> linux

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
exchange rate can fluctuate but a linux

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.250 
exchange rate can fluctuate but a linux
desktop<00:03:05.580> should<00:03:06.090> be<00:03:06.239> priced<00:03:06.480> lower<00:03:06.870> than

Windows or Mac number for bugs the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
perfect linux desktop should have zero

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.520 
perfect linux desktop should have zero
bugs<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.850> all<00:03:15.000> software<00:03:15.750> should<00:03:15.959> work<00:03:16.200> out<00:03:16.380> of
