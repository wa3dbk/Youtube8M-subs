00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.600 
know have have particles that'll create
those<00:03:02.140> micro<00:03:02.530> swirlies<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.160> always<00:03:03.310> see

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
those micro swirlies that you always see

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.020 
those micro swirlies that you always see
so<00:03:07.980> seems<00:03:08.980> like<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:09.220> did<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.370> good<00:03:09.520> job<00:03:09.580> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
so seems like it did a good job the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.390 
so seems like it did a good job the
watch<00:03:10.210> was<00:03:10.510> relatively<00:03:11.350> clean<00:03:11.740> before<00:03:11.980> hand

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
watch was relatively clean before hand

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.090 
watch was relatively clean before hand
but<00:03:13.030> it<00:03:13.150> could<00:03:13.840> use<00:03:14.050> it<00:03:14.230> could<00:03:14.500> use<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.710> cleaning

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
but it could use it could use a cleaning

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.330 
but it could use it could use a cleaning
there<00:03:15.250> I<00:03:15.520> guess<00:03:16.680> there's<00:03:17.680> some<00:03:17.710> spots<00:03:18.160> in

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
there I guess there's some spots in

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.920 
there I guess there's some spots in
there

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.970 

they<00:03:26.930> don't<00:03:27.109> really<00:03:27.260> talk<00:03:27.530> too<00:03:27.769> much<00:03:27.920> about

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
they don't really talk too much about

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.440 
they don't really talk too much about
what's<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.639> it<00:03:28.790> but<00:03:30.879> it's<00:03:31.879> supposed<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.329> be

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
what's in it but it's supposed to be

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.059 
what's in it but it's supposed to be
very<00:03:32.689> gentle<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.469> clean<00:03:35.499> the<00:03:36.499> cost<00:03:36.769> is<00:03:36.950> really

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
very gentle and clean the cost is really

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.089 
very gentle and clean the cost is really
relatively<00:03:37.999> low<00:03:38.810> as<00:03:38.989> well<00:03:39.170> I'm<00:03:39.650> gonna<00:03:39.769> give<00:03:39.980> it

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
relatively low as well I'm gonna give it

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.729 
relatively low as well I'm gonna give it
one<00:03:40.219> more<00:03:40.400> shot<00:03:40.459> here<00:03:41.120> just<00:03:42.049> to<00:03:42.109> trap<00:03:42.379> this<00:03:42.560> on

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
one more shot here just to trap this on

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.479 
one more shot here just to trap this on
a<00:03:42.769> cloth<00:03:43.900> they<00:03:44.900> recommend<00:03:45.349> doing<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:45.799> once

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
a cloth they recommend doing this once

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:52.420 
a cloth they recommend doing this once
every<00:03:48.280> week<00:03:50.560> to<00:03:51.560> maintain<00:03:51.769> your<00:03:52.159> watch

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
every week to maintain your watch

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:09.280 
every week to maintain your watch
cleanliness

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.100 

so<00:04:09.830> that's<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.160> have<00:04:10.250> a<00:04:10.390> watch<00:04:11.390> care<00:04:11.690> product

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:12.110 
so that's to have a watch care product

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.250 
so that's to have a watch care product
though<00:04:12.849> it's<00:04:13.849> pretty<00:04:14.209> inexpensive<00:04:14.480> I<00:04:15.050> think

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
though it's pretty inexpensive I think

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.229 
though it's pretty inexpensive I think

nice

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.180 

I<00:04:41.460> like<00:04:42.120> this<00:04:42.330> one<00:04:42.740> quite<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.770> bit<00:04:43.889> more<00:04:44.070> than

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
I like this one quite a bit more than

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.939 
I like this one quite a bit more than
the<00:04:44.250> microsuede<00:04:44.729> it<00:04:44.910> seems<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.650> the<00:04:46.650> micro

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
the microsuede it seems to the micro

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.770 
the microsuede it seems to the micro
silk<00:04:47.190> seems<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.790> pick<00:04:48.180> up<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.570> moisture

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
silk seems to pick up the moisture

00:04:48.780 --> 00:05:10.270 
silk seems to pick up the moisture
better<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:54.710> that's<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:57.330> two<00:04:57.570> products<00:04:58.020> there

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.770 

so<00:05:13.190> overall<00:05:14.190> this<00:05:14.430> is<00:05:14.490> uh<00:05:14.669> this<00:05:15.449> is<00:05:15.510> a<00:05:15.600> nice

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:35.699 
really isn't a dedicated product out

00:06:35.699 --> 00:06:41.000

there<00:06:36.830> the<00:06:37.830> watch<00:06:38.039> valet<00:06:38.370> and<00:06:38.940> and<00:06:39.830> maybe<00:06:40.830> the

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
there the watch valet and and maybe the

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.659 
there the watch valet and and maybe the
micro<00:06:41.370> suede<00:06:41.550> cloth<00:06:41.940> are<00:06:42.210> nice<00:06:42.990> touches<00:06:43.229> too<00:06:43.669> I

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
don't think it's entirely necessary I

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:50.390 
don't think it's entirely necessary I
think<00:06:47.180> the<00:06:48.180> the<00:06:48.449> the<00:06:48.479> two<00:06:49.169> key<00:06:49.680> products<00:06:50.099> here

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
think the the the two key products here

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.399 
think the the the two key products here
the<00:06:51.270> this<00:06:51.599> micro<00:06:51.960> silk<00:06:52.289> cloth<00:06:52.620> and
