hey guys today I'm going to show you the
midnight<00:00:05.100> shift<00:00:05.509> I<00:00:06.509> looked<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.290> YouTube<00:00:07.470> and

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
midnight shift I looked on YouTube and

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.680 
midnight shift I looked on YouTube and
there<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.160> no<00:00:08.490> tutorials<00:00:09.210> for<00:00:09.420> it<00:00:09.510> at<00:00:09.630> least

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
there is no tutorials for it at least

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.930 
there is no tutorials for it at least
not<00:00:09.929> that<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:10.110> could<00:00:10.349> find<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:11.130> I'll<00:00:11.700> be<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
not that I could find so I'll be the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.690 
not that I could find so I'll be the
first<00:00:12.440> it's<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> really<00:00:13.679> cool<00:00:13.799> shift<00:00:14.130> it's

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
first it's a really cool shift it's

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.150 
first it's a really cool shift it's
almost<00:00:14.910> invisible<00:00:15.120> when<00:00:15.570> done<00:00:15.690> correctly

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
almost invisible when done correctly

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.859 
almost invisible when done correctly
it's<00:00:17.160> motivated<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.449> can<00:00:18.600> do<00:00:18.660> it<00:00:18.779> pretty

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
it's motivated and you can do it pretty

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.380 
it's motivated and you can do it pretty
slow<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.410> I'll<00:00:19.710> show<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:19.949> what<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.100> looks<00:00:20.250> like

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
slow so I'll show you what it looks like

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.730 
slow so I'll show you what it looks like
to<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.510> car<00:00:21.720> select<00:00:22.050> from<00:00:22.320> somewhere<00:00:22.619> near

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
to have a car select from somewhere near

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.170 
to have a car select from somewhere near
the<00:00:22.769> middle<00:00:23.010> we'll<00:00:23.910> use<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.180> ten<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.420> diamonds

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
the middle we'll use the ten of diamonds

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.820 
the middle we'll use the ten of diamonds
and<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.269> idea<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.750> if<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:27.900> just<00:00:27.990> give<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
and the idea is if you just give the

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.070 
and the idea is if you just give the
size<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.070> little<00:00:29.490> square<00:00:29.849> make<00:00:30.840> sure<00:00:30.960> your

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
size a little square make sure your

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.799 
size a little square make sure your
cards<00:00:31.289> lost<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.710> pack<00:00:32.149> it<00:00:33.149> actually<00:00:33.600> comes

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
cards lost in the pack it actually comes

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.380 
cards lost in the pack it actually comes
back<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.620> top<00:00:34.940> I'll<00:00:35.940> do<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.180> once<00:00:36.329> more

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
back to the top I'll do it once more

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.290 
back to the top I'll do it once more
face<00:00:36.750> up<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.170> guys<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.320> get<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.649> idea<00:00:37.950> I

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
face up so you guys can get the idea I

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.280 
face up so you guys can get the idea I
guess<00:00:39.300> if<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.629> leave<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> card<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
guess if you leave the card in the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.420 
guess if you leave the card in the
center<00:00:42.469> comes<00:00:43.469> right<00:00:43.620> back<00:00:43.770> to<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.950> top<00:00:44.160> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
center comes right back to the top and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.250 
center comes right back to the top and
that<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.059> Steve<00:00:45.329> drones<00:00:45.780> midnight<00:00:46.590> shift<00:00:48.260> now

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
that is Steve drones midnight shift now

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.420 
that is Steve drones midnight shift now
we're<00:00:49.440> going<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> get<00:00:49.680> into<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> workings<00:00:50.340> of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
we're going to get into the workings of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.920 
we're going to get into the workings of
it<00:00:50.489> it's<00:00:51.390> based<00:00:51.629> on<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> Herman<00:00:52.140> pass<00:00:52.820> which

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
it it's based on the Herman pass which

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.270 
it it's based on the Herman pass which
if<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.079> don't<00:00:55.260> know<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.649> classic<00:00:56.070> pass

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
if you don't know the classic pass

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.510 
if you don't know the classic pass
brings<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> top<00:00:57.510> packet<00:00:57.930> underneath<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:59.250> so

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
brings the top packet underneath like so

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.700 
brings the top packet underneath like so
and<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.120> Herman<00:01:00.449> pass<00:01:00.660> does<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
and the Herman pass does just the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.889 
and the Herman pass does just the
opposite<00:01:02.010> brings<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.370> bottom<00:01:02.670> packet<00:01:02.879> on<00:01:03.570> top

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
opposite brings the bottom packet on top

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.910 
opposite brings the bottom packet on top
and<00:01:04.339> that's<00:01:05.339> what<00:01:06.150> we're<00:01:06.240> going<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> be<00:01:06.510> doing

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
and that's what we're going to be doing

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.490 
and that's what we're going to be doing
so<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.070> you're<00:01:08.189> gonna<00:01:08.280> want<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.549> do<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:09.470> get<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
so what you're gonna want to do is get a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.370 
so what you're gonna want to do is get a
little<00:01:10.710> finger<00:01:10.860> break<00:01:11.990> next<00:01:12.990> I'll<00:01:13.140> show<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
little finger break next I'll show you a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.630 
little finger break next I'll show you a
method<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.680> where<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:13.979> don't<00:01:14.250> need<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.430> finger

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
method to where you don't need a finger

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.770 
method to where you don't need a finger
break<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.090> that's<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> one<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.630> usually

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
break and that's the one that I usually

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.950 
break and that's the one that I usually
use<00:01:16.189> but<00:01:17.299> I'll<00:01:18.299> teach<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> from<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> finger

use but I'll teach you from a finger
break<00:01:19.229> first<00:01:19.439> so<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.220> use<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.640> two<00:01:20.700> parts

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
break first so we use this a two parts

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.370 
break first so we use this a two parts
I'm<00:01:21.180> gonna<00:01:21.479> leave<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.750> face<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.290> can

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
I'm gonna leave it face up so you can

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.550 
I'm gonna leave it face up so you can
see<00:01:22.470> what's<00:01:22.619> going<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:23.960> to<00:01:24.960> catch<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.320> little

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.359 
see what's going on to catch a little
finger<00:01:25.710> break<00:01:26.270> okay<00:01:28.009> now<00:01:29.009> what<00:01:29.130> you're<00:01:29.250> going

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369

mechanics group because you took this

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.449 
mechanics group because you took this
part<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.840> D<00:02:10.259> deck<00:02:10.440> off<00:02:10.679> you're<00:02:11.310> going<00:02:11.400> to

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
part of the D deck off you're going to

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.690 
part of the D deck off you're going to
rotate<00:02:11.670> this

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
rotate this

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.720 
rotate this
with<00:02:13.000> your<00:02:13.150> palm<00:02:13.330> out<00:02:13.810> like<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:14.260> okay<00:02:14.730> you

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
with your palm out like this okay you

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.910 
with your palm out like this okay you
can<00:02:15.940> even<00:02:16.090> do<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.300> with<00:02:16.630> your<00:02:17.319> pointer<00:02:17.709> finger

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
can even do it with your pointer finger

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.010 
can even do it with your pointer finger
underneath<00:02:18.160> if<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.209> makes<00:02:19.360> it<00:02:19.480> easier<00:02:19.750> for<00:02:19.780> you

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
underneath if it makes it easier for you

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.330 
underneath if it makes it easier for you
I<00:02:20.080> don't<00:02:20.230> like<00:02:20.410> that<00:02:20.590> method<00:02:20.709> as<00:02:20.950> much<00:02:21.130> because

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
I don't like that method as much because

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.220 
I don't like that method as much because
you<00:02:21.430> lose<00:02:21.580> a<00:02:21.640> little<00:02:21.970> bit<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.150> cover<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.540> your

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
you lose a little bit of cover that your

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.360 
you lose a little bit of cover that your
pointer<00:02:23.500> finger<00:02:23.709> would<00:02:23.830> give<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.100> but<00:02:24.280> you

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
pointer finger would give you but you

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.270 
pointer finger would give you but you
can<00:02:24.610> do<00:02:24.790> that<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.680> like<00:02:26.800> I<00:02:26.920> said<00:02:26.980> you're<00:02:27.160> going

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
can do that so like I said you're going

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.090 
can do that so like I said you're going
to<00:02:27.340> move<00:02:27.459> this<00:02:27.640> packet<00:02:28.030> forward<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.770> as<00:02:29.920> you

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
to move this packet forward and as you

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.530 
to move this packet forward and as you
do<00:02:30.250> that<00:02:30.280> you're<00:02:30.819> going<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:30.970> rotate<00:02:31.180> this

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
do that you're going to rotate this

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.840 
do that you're going to rotate this
packet<00:02:32.069> I'm<00:02:33.069> going<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.370> show<00:02:33.489> this<00:02:33.640> to<00:02:33.700> you

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
packet I'm going to show this to you

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.760 
packet I'm going to show this to you
underneath<00:02:34.390> like<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.750> okay

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
underneath like this okay

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:40.710 
underneath like this okay
now<00:02:38.040> you're<00:02:39.040> going<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.459> slowly<00:02:39.819> or<00:02:40.450> slightly

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
now you're going to slowly or slightly

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.350 
now you're going to slowly or slightly
dip<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.290> packet<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:42.400> right<00:02:42.580> hand<00:02:42.819> to

meet the pack and the left hand as you

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.199 
meet the pack and the left hand as you
rotate<00:02:46.360> your<00:02:46.540> entire<00:02:46.900> left<00:02:47.290> hand<00:02:48.000> toward<00:02:49.000> you

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
rotate your entire left hand toward you

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.130 
rotate your entire left hand toward you
like<00:02:49.870> this<00:02:51.420> now<00:02:52.420> you're<00:02:52.600> going<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.780> use<00:02:52.930> your

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
like this now you're going to use your

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.780 
like this now you're going to use your
thumb<00:02:53.200> on<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.590> top<00:02:53.830> and<00:02:54.040> middle<00:02:54.370> finger<00:02:54.670> on

so again it's going to look like this

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.059 
so again it's going to look like this
what<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.300> card<00:03:10.630> selected<00:03:11.050> from<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.290> center<00:03:11.590> you

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
what a card selected from the center you

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.729 
what a card selected from the center you
catch<00:03:12.310> a<00:03:12.400> little<00:03:12.550> finger<00:03:12.850> break<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.739> you're

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.530 
catch a little finger break and you're
going<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:14.950> with<00:03:15.580> your<00:03:15.700> hand<00:03:15.910> at<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.150> diagonal

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
going to with your hand at a diagonal

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.560 
going to with your hand at a diagonal
your<00:03:16.900> pointer<00:03:17.140> finger<00:03:17.410> like<00:03:17.530> this<00:03:18.570> you're

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
your pointer finger like this you're

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.569 
your pointer finger like this you're
going<00:03:19.660> to<00:03:19.720> grab<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:19.959> deck<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:21.100> know<00:03:21.220> lift<00:03:21.400> up

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
going to grab the deck you know lift up

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.310 
going to grab the deck you know lift up
slightly<00:03:21.790> to<00:03:22.150> give<00:03:22.360> just<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.810> little<00:03:22.840> clearance

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
slightly to give just a little clearance

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.860 
slightly to give just a little clearance
you're<00:03:23.920> going<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.130> move<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.310> forward<00:03:24.870> I'm

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
you're going to move it forward I'm

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.390 
you're going to move it forward I'm
exaggerating<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.560> little<00:03:26.590> for<00:03:26.829> the<00:03:26.920> camera<00:03:27.220> and

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
exaggerating a little for the camera and

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.900 
exaggerating a little for the camera and
that<00:03:28.360> makes<00:03:28.600> it<00:03:28.750> a<00:03:28.959> lot<00:03:29.500> easier<00:03:29.560> to<00:03:29.920> cover<00:03:30.280> this

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
that makes it a lot easier to cover this

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.910 
that makes it a lot easier to cover this
motion<00:03:31.390> of<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.720> left<00:03:31.900> hand<00:03:32.170> rotating

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
motion of the left hand rotating

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.080 
motion of the left hand rotating
underneath<00:03:33.690> so<00:03:34.690> then<00:03:34.870> this<00:03:35.019> dips<00:03:35.350> slightly<00:03:36.090> to

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
underneath so then this dips slightly to

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.270 
underneath so then this dips slightly to
meet<00:03:37.329> this<00:03:37.510> packet<00:03:37.959> as<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.320> hand<00:03:38.590> comes<00:03:38.709> up<00:03:39.130> in

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
meet this packet as the hand comes up in

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:47.099 
meet this packet as the hand comes up in
squares<00:03:39.730> like<00:03:40.630> this<00:03:43.109> so<00:03:44.109> at<00:03:44.290> speed<00:03:45.989> like<00:03:46.989> I

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
squares like this so at speed like I

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.030 
squares like this so at speed like I
said<00:03:47.290> it's<00:03:47.440> going<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.620> look<00:03:47.680> something<00:03:47.859> like

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
said it's going to look something like

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:56.220 
said it's going to look something like
this<00:03:48.400> nine<00:03:49.269> of<00:03:49.390> clubs<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.880> it's<00:03:55.720> control<00:03:56.109> to

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
this nine of clubs and it's control to

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.080 
this nine of clubs and it's control to
the<00:03:56.350> top<00:03:58.950> now<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.010> reason<00:04:00.459> that<00:04:00.489> I<00:04:00.640> told<00:04:00.970> you

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
the top now the reason that I told you

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.170 
the top now the reason that I told you
guys<00:04:01.180> to<00:04:01.930> move<00:04:02.890> this<00:04:03.190> front<00:04:03.459> packet<00:04:03.760> for<00:04:03.970> if

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
guys to move this front packet for if

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.580 
guys to move this front packet for if
you<00:04:04.269> don't<00:04:04.540> move<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.750> front<00:04:04.959> packet<00:04:05.290> forward

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
you don't move the front packet forward

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.220 
you don't move the front packet forward
this<00:04:06.310> is<00:04:06.489> what<00:04:06.670> they're<00:04:06.820> going<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:06.970> see

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.470 

they're<00:04:11.230> going<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.410> see<00:04:11.560> this<00:04:11.820> and<00:04:12.820> you'd<00:04:13.390> be

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
they're going to see this and you'd be

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.180 
they're going to see this and you'd be
amazed<00:04:13.840> by<00:04:14.079> if<00:04:14.350> you<00:04:14.470> just<00:04:14.650> move<00:04:14.859> this<00:04:14.950> forward

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
amazed by if you just move this forward

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.550 
amazed by if you just move this forward
just<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.489> little<00:04:15.519> bit<00:04:15.730> that<00:04:16.690> visual<00:04:17.109> disappears

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
just a little bit that visual disappears

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.969 
just a little bit that visual disappears
okay<00:04:18.220> I<00:04:18.539> guess<00:04:19.539> that<00:04:19.660> if<00:04:19.750> you're<00:04:19.870> here<00:04:20.200> you<00:04:20.830> can

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
okay I guess that if you're here you can

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:25.390 
okay I guess that if you're here you can
see<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.190> deck<00:04:21.370> if<00:04:22.120> you<00:04:22.510> come<00:04:22.690> here<00:04:23.260> you<00:04:24.220> can't

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
see the deck if you come here you can't

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.510 
see the deck if you come here you can't
okay<00:04:27.470> so<00:04:28.470> that's<00:04:28.650> what<00:04:28.920> I<00:04:28.950> wanted<00:04:29.190> you<00:04:29.310> guys<00:04:29.370> to

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
okay so that's what I wanted you guys to

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.910 
okay so that's what I wanted you guys to
understand<00:04:30.030> I'm<00:04:30.900> going<00:04:31.080> to<00:04:31.170> show<00:04:31.380> you<00:04:31.410> a

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
understand I'm going to show you a

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.010 
understand I'm going to show you a
different<00:04:32.910> method<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.150> doing<00:04:33.420> it<00:04:33.540> like<00:04:33.570> I<00:04:33.810> said

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
different method of doing it like I said

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.060 
different method of doing it like I said
we<00:04:34.110> already<00:04:34.230> learned<00:04:34.470> how<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.590> do<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:34.860> from<00:04:34.950> a

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
we already learned how to do it from a

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.800 
we already learned how to do it from a
break<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:35.790> any<00:04:36.000> way<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.420> can<00:04:36.540> obtain<00:04:36.660> a

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
break so any way that you can obtain a

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.380 
break so any way that you can obtain a
break<00:04:37.080> you<00:04:37.950> can<00:04:38.070> go<00:04:38.220> ahead<00:04:38.310> and<00:04:38.610> now<00:04:38.970> do<00:04:39.030> that

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
break you can go ahead and now do that

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.590 
break you can go ahead and now do that
in<00:04:39.600> that<00:04:39.720> shift<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:41.120> bring<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.210> card<00:04:42.420> to<00:04:42.510> the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
in that shift and bring the card to the

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.260 
in that shift and bring the card to the
top<00:04:43.610> but<00:04:44.610> I'm<00:04:44.700> going<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:44.880> teach<00:04:45.000> you<00:04:45.120> a<00:04:45.150> way<00:04:45.240> to

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
top but I'm going to teach you a way to

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.150 
top but I'm going to teach you a way to
do<00:04:45.480> it<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:45.780> little<00:04:46.260> bit<00:04:46.470> quicker<00:04:46.590> and<00:04:46.920> without<00:04:47.130> a

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
do it a little bit quicker and without a

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.120 
do it a little bit quicker and without a
break<00:04:47.430> if<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:48.870> just<00:04:49.020> want<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:49.230> use<00:04:49.350> as<00:04:49.470> a<00:04:49.770> card

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
break if you just want to use as a card

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.190 
break if you just want to use as a card
control<00:04:50.400> this<00:04:50.910> is<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.210> method<00:04:51.480> that<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:51.960> would

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
control this is the method that I would

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.580 
control this is the method that I would
suggest<00:04:52.640> if<00:04:53.640> you<00:04:53.790> dribble<00:04:54.060> the<00:04:54.090> cards<00:04:54.560> have<00:04:55.560> a

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
suggest if you dribble the cards have a

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.830 
suggest if you dribble the cards have a
spectator<00:04:56.010> called<00:04:56.250> stop<00:04:56.580> leave<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:57.540> face-up

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
spectator called stop leave a face-up

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.080 
spectator called stop leave a face-up
and<00:04:58.230> then<00:04:59.190> you're<00:04:59.310> going<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.490> use<00:04:59.610> the<00:04:59.760> dribble

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
and then you're going to use the dribble

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.970 
and then you're going to use the dribble
control<00:05:00.390> all<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:01.110> drug<00:05:01.290> control<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.770> instead

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:01.980 
control all the drug control is instead

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.320 
control all the drug control is instead
of<00:05:02.040> dribbling<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.430> cards<00:05:02.670> directly<00:05:03.000> on<00:05:03.120> top

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
of dribbling the cards directly on top

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.880 
of dribbling the cards directly on top
you're<00:05:03.900> going<00:05:04.020> to<00:05:04.080> start<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.410> dribble<00:05:04.710> a

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:04.890 
you're going to start the dribble a

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:06.500 
you're going to start the dribble a
little<00:05:05.400> bit<00:05:05.490> farther<00:05:05.700> back<00:05:05.970> to<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.240> cards

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
little bit farther back to the cards

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.840 
little bit farther back to the cards
land<00:05:06.720> in<00:05:06.840> this<00:05:06.960> area<00:05:07.490> do<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.580> over<00:05:08.760> the

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
land in this area do it over the

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.390 
land in this area do it over the
shoulder<00:05:09.060> you<00:05:09.840> can<00:05:09.960> see<00:05:10.020> this<00:05:10.260> and<00:05:10.500> then<00:05:11.310> you

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
shoulder you can see this and then you

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.580 
shoulder you can see this and then you
slowly<00:05:11.640> dribble<00:05:11.940> them<00:05:12.060> up<00:05:12.180> so<00:05:13.140> there<00:05:13.290> creates

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
slowly dribble them up so there creates

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.620 
slowly dribble them up so there creates
a<00:05:13.680> step<00:05:14.100> in<00:05:14.310> the<00:05:14.610> back<00:05:14.760> of<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.030> deck<00:05:15.210> know<00:05:15.450> if

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:15.630 
a step in the back of the deck know if

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:17.900 
a step in the back of the deck know if
you<00:05:15.690> guys<00:05:15.780> can<00:05:15.990> see<00:05:16.170> this<00:05:16.290> but<00:05:16.610> it<00:05:17.610> creates<00:05:17.850> a

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
you guys can see this but it creates a

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.560 
you guys can see this but it creates a
step<00:05:18.620> okay<00:05:19.670> so<00:05:20.670> what<00:05:20.760> you<00:05:20.820> do<00:05:20.940> is<00:05:21.060> pull<00:05:21.330> up<00:05:21.360> on

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
step okay so what you do is pull up on

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.110 
step okay so what you do is pull up on
that<00:05:21.720> step<00:05:22.050> now<00:05:22.740> as<00:05:23.010> you<00:05:23.310> pull<00:05:23.520> up<00:05:23.640> on<00:05:23.730> the<00:05:23.820> step

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
that step now as you pull up on the step

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.950 
that step now as you pull up on the step
you<00:05:25.670> are<00:05:26.670> already<00:05:26.910> automatically<00:05:27.630> put<00:05:27.840> your

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
you are already automatically put your

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.160 
you are already automatically put your
hand<00:05:28.080> in<00:05:28.170> this<00:05:28.230> position<00:05:28.710> so<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:29.580> pull<00:05:29.820> up

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
hand in this position so you pull up

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.810 
hand in this position so you pull up
Anglet<00:05:31.170> forward<00:05:31.530> or<00:05:32.040> moving<00:05:32.340> forward<00:05:32.610> just<00:05:32.640> a

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
Anglet forward or moving forward just a

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.160 
Anglet forward or moving forward just a
little<00:05:32.850> bit<00:05:33.180> as<00:05:33.360> you<00:05:33.390> go<00:05:33.570> right<00:05:33.870> into<00:05:34.050> the

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
little bit as you go right into the

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:40.310 
little bit as you go right into the
shift<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:34.620> square<00:05:35.460> up<00:05:36.740> again<00:05:38.990> like<00:05:39.990> I<00:05:40.140> said

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 
shift and square up again like I said

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.260 
shift and square up again like I said
you<00:05:40.410> do<00:05:40.530> it<00:05:40.620> from<00:05:40.710> a<00:05:40.830> dribble<00:05:41.160> so<00:05:41.940> you<00:05:42.030> do<00:05:42.150> the

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
you do it from a dribble so you do the

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.710 
you do it from a dribble so you do the
dribble<00:05:42.570> control<00:05:43.910> you<00:05:44.910> pull<00:05:45.180> up<00:05:45.360> and<00:05:45.600> that

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
dribble control you pull up and that

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.500 
dribble control you pull up and that
starts<00:05:46.080> your<00:05:46.170> past<00:05:46.410> immediately<00:05:47.240> so<00:05:48.240> that<00:05:48.420> you

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
starts your past immediately so that you

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:49.670 
starts your past immediately so that you
don't<00:05:48.660> have<00:05:48.720> to<00:05:48.870> fumble<00:05:49.050> around<00:05:49.200> with<00:05:49.380> getting

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
don't have to fumble around with getting

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.910 
don't have to fumble around with getting
a<00:05:49.740> break<00:05:50.070> a<00:05:50.370> lot<00:05:50.850> of<00:05:50.970> people<00:05:51.560> you<00:05:52.560> know<00:05:52.680> they'll

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
a break a lot of people you know they'll

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.220 
a break a lot of people you know they'll
leave<00:05:53.310> a<00:05:53.340> card<00:05:53.700> and<00:05:54.060> then<00:05:54.570> they<00:05:54.660> gotta<00:05:54.840> get<00:05:55.050> the

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
leave a card and then they gotta get the

leave a card and then they gotta get the
break<00:05:55.500> and<00:05:55.830> then<00:05:56.310> they<00:05:56.400> got<00:05:56.550> a<00:05:56.580> just<00:05:57.120> and<00:05:57.360> go<00:05:57.420> to

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:57.510 
break and then they got a just and go to

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:00.320 
break and then they got a just and go to
the<00:05:57.600> classic<00:05:57.990> pass<00:05:58.200> that<00:05:58.950> sucks<00:05:59.370> if<00:05:59.730> I<00:06:00.090> mean

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
the classic pass that sucks if I mean

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.180 
the classic pass that sucks if I mean
the<00:06:00.900> midnight<00:06:01.230> shift<00:06:01.440> you<00:06:01.620> can<00:06:01.650> be<00:06:01.860> so<00:06:02.040> much

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
the midnight shift you can be so much

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.980 
the midnight shift you can be so much
faster<00:06:02.460> you<00:06:02.910> know<00:06:03.390> you<00:06:03.450> got<00:06:03.570> the<00:06:03.660> ace<00:06:03.780> of

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
faster you know you got the ace of

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:06.600 
spades there you just pull right up oops

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.690 
spades there you just pull right up oops
almost<00:06:06.780> lost<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.170> break<00:06:07.350> at<00:06:08.310> the<00:06:08.460> ace<00:06:08.550> of

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:08.700 
almost lost the break at the ace of

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:11.420 
almost lost the break at the ace of

spades there you pull up and you go

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:12.530 
spades there you pull up and you go
right<00:06:11.610> into<00:06:11.730> the<00:06:11.850> ship<00:06:12.090> so<00:06:12.240> it<00:06:12.300> looks<00:06:12.450> like

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.540 
right into the ship so it looks like

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.570 
right into the ship so it looks like
you're<00:06:12.720> just<00:06:13.020> doing<00:06:13.830> an<00:06:13.920> all-around<00:06:14.250> square

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
you're just doing an all-around square

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.430 
you're just doing an all-around square
up<00:06:14.670> type<00:06:14.880> of<00:06:15.000> move<00:06:15.150> and<00:06:15.390> it's<00:06:16.110> fast<00:06:16.940> so<00:06:18.290> like<00:06:19.290> I

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
up type of move and it's fast so like I

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.230 
up type of move and it's fast so like I
said<00:06:19.500> that<00:06:19.650> is<00:06:19.800> the<00:06:19.950> midnight<00:06:20.340> shift<00:06:20.550> I'll<00:06:21.090> go

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
said that is the midnight shift I'll go

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.160 
said that is the midnight shift I'll go
over<00:06:21.330> one<00:06:21.540> more<00:06:21.720> time

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
over one more time

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:24.590 
over one more time
just<00:06:22.740> so<00:06:22.830> you<00:06:22.890> guys<00:06:23.010> understand<00:06:23.490> I<00:06:23.700> said

just so you guys understand I said

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.309 
just so you guys understand I said
you're<00:06:24.780> going<00:06:24.900> to<00:06:25.370> catch<00:06:26.370> a<00:06:26.430> break

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 
you're going to catch a break

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:30.139 
you're going to catch a break
with<00:06:29.099> your<00:06:29.219> hand<00:06:29.369> in<00:06:29.490> a<00:06:29.580> diagonal<00:06:29.939> you're

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:30.149 
with your hand in a diagonal you're

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:32.029 
with your hand in a diagonal you're
going<00:06:30.270> to<00:06:30.330> slide<00:06:30.569> this<00:06:30.809> top<00:06:31.169> packet<00:06:31.649> forward

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
going to slide this top packet forward

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.489 
going to slide this top packet forward
while<00:06:32.369> rotating<00:06:33.029> this<00:06:33.539> underneath<00:06:33.960> packet

00:06:34.489 --> 00:06:34.499 
while rotating this underneath packet

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:36.769 
while rotating this underneath packet
this<00:06:35.039> way<00:06:35.249> you're<00:06:35.969> going<00:06:36.089> to<00:06:36.149> coalesce<00:06:36.419> them

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:36.779 
this way you're going to coalesce them

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:38.209 
this way you're going to coalesce them
I'm<00:06:37.169> going<00:06:37.289> to<00:06:37.379> drop<00:06:37.559> the<00:06:37.740> right<00:06:37.860> hand<00:06:38.039> down<00:06:38.159> to

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:38.219 
I'm going to drop the right hand down to

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:40.459 
I'm going to drop the right hand down to
coalesce<00:06:38.580> them<00:06:38.879> and<00:06:39.059> rotate<00:06:39.419> it<00:06:39.509> back<00:06:39.659> up<00:06:39.899> as

00:06:40.459 --> 00:06:40.469 
coalesce them and rotate it back up as

00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:43.700 
coalesce them and rotate it back up as
you<00:06:40.619> square<00:06:41.869> you<00:06:42.869> can<00:06:42.990> also<00:06:43.139> do<00:06:43.319> as<00:06:43.439> a<00:06:43.469> color

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
you square you can also do as a color

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.209 
you square you can also do as a color
change<00:06:44.029> if<00:06:45.029> you're<00:06:45.569> at<00:06:45.749> if<00:06:46.589> you're<00:06:46.740> spectators

00:06:47.209 --> 00:06:47.219 
change if you're at if you're spectators

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:49.010 
change if you're at if you're spectators
towards<00:06:47.490> your<00:06:47.610> right<00:06:47.789> that's<00:06:48.330> the<00:06:48.509> optimum

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
towards your right that's the optimum

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.540 
towards your right that's the optimum
angle<00:06:49.229> from<00:06:49.680> the<00:06:49.830> front<00:06:50.099> or<00:06:50.189> from<00:06:50.249> the<00:06:50.339> right

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
angle from the front or from the right

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.279 
angle from the front or from the right
but<00:06:50.729> from<00:06:50.879> the<00:06:50.969> right<00:06:51.210> for<00:06:51.779> a<00:06:51.809> color<00:06:52.050> change

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.289 
but from the right for a color change

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.029 
but from the right for a color change
it's<00:06:52.499> going<00:06:52.619> to<00:06:52.680> look<00:06:52.800> the<00:06:52.860> best<00:06:53.509> so<00:06:54.889> let's<00:06:55.889> say

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 
it's going to look the best so let's say

00:06:56.039 --> 00:06:59.299 
it's going to look the best so let's say
we<00:06:56.189> have<00:06:56.399> a<00:06:56.669> nine<00:06:57.330> of<00:06:57.509> diamonds<00:06:57.689> you<00:06:58.159> just<00:06:59.159> give

00:06:59.299 --> 00:06:59.309 
we have a nine of diamonds you just give

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:04.309 
we have a nine of diamonds you just give
a<00:06:59.339> twist<00:06:59.669> and<00:07:00.029> it<00:07:00.569> changes<00:07:02.569> so<00:07:03.569> that's<00:07:03.749> a<00:07:03.899> cool

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 
a twist and it changes so that's a cool

00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.879 
a twist and it changes so that's a cool
application<00:07:04.889> for<00:07:05.129> it<00:07:05.990> but<00:07:06.990> on<00:07:07.169> the<00:07:07.469> only<00:07:07.709> angle

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:07.889 
application for it but on the only angle

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:09.409 
application for it but on the only angle
you're<00:07:08.039> going<00:07:08.069> to<00:07:08.219> want<00:07:08.369> to<00:07:08.430> avoid<00:07:08.699> is<00:07:08.999> from

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419 
you're going to want to avoid is from

00:07:09.419 --> 00:07:11.089 
you're going to want to avoid is from
your<00:07:09.539> far<00:07:09.809> left<00:07:09.839> I<00:07:10.319> mean<00:07:10.499> you're<00:07:10.619> you're

00:07:11.089 --> 00:07:11.099 
your far left I mean you're you're

00:07:11.099 --> 00:07:13.249 
your far left I mean you're you're
pretty<00:07:11.399> covered<00:07:11.789> at<00:07:12.059> most<00:07:12.360> angles<00:07:12.689> even<00:07:12.990> at

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:13.259 
pretty covered at most angles even at

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.889 
pretty covered at most angles even at
your<00:07:13.709> left<00:07:14.039> I<00:07:14.309> mean<00:07:14.550> it<00:07:14.669> still<00:07:14.999> is<00:07:15.209> relatively

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:15.899 
your left I mean it still is relatively

00:07:15.899 --> 00:07:18.679 
your left I mean it still is relatively
invisible<00:07:17.330> just<00:07:18.330> looks<00:07:18.479> like<00:07:18.509> you're

00:07:18.679 --> 00:07:18.689 
invisible just looks like you're

00:07:18.689 --> 00:07:20.119 
invisible just looks like you're
squaring<00:07:18.930> the<00:07:19.050> cards<00:07:19.349> but<00:07:19.649> if<00:07:19.770> you're<00:07:19.919> at<00:07:20.009> your

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:20.129 
squaring the cards but if you're at your

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:22.639 
squaring the cards but if you're at your
