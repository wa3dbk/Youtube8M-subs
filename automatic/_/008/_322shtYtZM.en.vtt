00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.610
 in the kitchen of pÃ©gate 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.430
 because it gets into the kitchen in the most 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.500
 there 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.439
 and today we dedicate the kitchen to the winner 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.810
 of the best panama jet contest and 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.060
 melvin with authenticity is my love 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.310
 in this gold hobbies and school among the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.430
 recipes that we grabbed a man full of 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.199
 shrimp so we go there and we want 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.510
 thank all the public for this 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:46.070
 great reception that this segment had 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:48.080
 so let's go over the ingredients 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.930
 look first of all let's start 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.180
 as I put like this where we ask the 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.620
 banana over low heat this banana what 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.989
 We cut into slices not very large and 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.519
 equal more or less the same 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.799
 size so they are cooked at the same 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.670
 time they are fried and 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:06.799
 then we are going to throw it here in the 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.790
 reef where we already have three teeth 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.880
 garlic and a little salt 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.130
 and mailing decided to use cracklings 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.130
 blown up for this tremendous idea 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.690
 these that we no longer only have a 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.360
 advance that is already prepared where 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.680
 it tells me very brutal vote was in the enel 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:35.450
 won 6 in the stir fry he used bacon and 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.450
 ham where we already fry it 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.540
 and it's worse 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.770
 here we have bacon and ham and then he 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.230
 He used a sofrito that has onions 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.480
 green pepper so is sweet cilantro 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.480
 capers olives and tomato 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.130
 that's good because when you have to 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.659
 give a good taste of truth is good one 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.429
 and also make your own stir-fry 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.340
 we are going to suffer this, we are going to 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.140
 cooking we no longer only have the shrimp 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.060
 which were the ones we used were 60 80 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.290
 which is the size of shrimp shrimp 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.290
 It is completely cooked 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.520
 once we have it here well decided 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.750
 use ketchup 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.690
 what are we going to take a little bit of start 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.060
 the act we are here giving a little 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.800
 of lemon also to make as a 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.590
 salsita I'm going to try this recipe thousand 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.000
 millions and 100 truth this we're going to 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.880
 leave so this is going to turn into a 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.890
 sauce or leaves all the vegetables 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.130
 they are going to insult us your liquids and everything 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.620
 will be joining the hairs and then 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.270
 obviously, we are going to add the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.960
 shrimp paramentos knows that we are going to 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.670
 throw here 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.350
 so that has to affect so that 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:03:00.240
 buy those shrimp that looks 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:01.950
 combines with a miniature that we already have 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.380
 here silver that we use a little bit 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.680
 of cilantrillo to decorate the sides and 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.100
 once all these ingredients are done 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.100
