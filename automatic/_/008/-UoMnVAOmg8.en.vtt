00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
so here's the software and what we're

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.460 
so here's the software and what we're
going<00:00:02.610> to<00:00:02.639> do<00:00:02.850> is<00:00:03.030> we're<00:00:03.179> going<00:00:03.210> to<00:00:03.540> to<00:00:03.959> start

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
going to do is we're going to to start

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.680 
going to do is we're going to to start
from<00:00:04.950> the<00:00:05.130> beginning<00:00:05.549> as<00:00:05.790> if<00:00:06.089> your<00:00:06.240> client

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
from the beginning as if your client

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.900 
from the beginning as if your client
walked<00:00:06.899> in<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.230> door<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:08.220> you're<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.820> to

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
walked in the door and you're going to

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.200 
walked in the door and you're going to
set<00:00:09.150> up<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.420> new<00:00:09.630> file<00:00:10.559> folder<00:00:11.280> for<00:00:11.309> your<00:00:11.700> client

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
set up a new file folder for your client

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.589 
set up a new file folder for your client
and<00:00:12.389> put<00:00:13.019> in<00:00:13.110> an<00:00:13.230> avatar<00:00:13.679> settings<00:00:14.130> file<00:00:14.599> so

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
and put in an avatar settings file so

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.180 
and put in an avatar settings file so
the<00:00:15.809> way<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.139> start<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.680> we<00:00:16.770> go<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:16.980> folder

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
the way we start that is we go to folder

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.580 
the way we start that is we go to folder
selections<00:00:17.880> we're<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.020> create<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.380> new

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
selections we're going to create a new

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.339 
selections we're going to create a new
folder<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.750> we'll<00:00:21.750> call<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:23.150> epoch<00:00:24.890> avatar

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
folder and we'll call this epoch avatar

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:29.929 
folder and we'll call this epoch avatar
and<00:00:28.349> that's<00:00:28.619> our<00:00:28.800> file<00:00:29.039> folder<00:00:29.550> that's<00:00:29.760> our

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
and that's our file folder that's our

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.229 
and that's our file folder that's our
folder<00:00:30.300> name<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.260> say<00:00:31.410> ok<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.250> in<00:00:33.149> this

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
folder name and we say ok and in this

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.450 
folder name and we say ok and in this
case<00:00:33.480> there's<00:00:33.960> already<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.440> settings<00:00:34.920> file<00:00:35.190> so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
case there's already a settings file so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.520 
case there's already a settings file so
I'm<00:00:35.579> going<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.820> say<00:00:35.969> create<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.719> select

alright and now we're running so the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.449 
alright and now we're running so the
first<00:02:05.729> thing<00:02:05.880> I<00:02:06.000> want<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.270> do<00:02:06.770> is<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.130> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
first thing I want to do is this is the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.690 
first thing I want to do is this is the
EEG<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.830> being<00:02:11.069> recorded

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
EEG that is being recorded

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.180 
EEG that is being recorded
here<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:12.540> my<00:02:12.720> z-scores<00:02:13.410> now<00:02:13.770> remember<00:02:14.160> that

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
here are my z-scores now remember that

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.690 
here are my z-scores now remember that
this<00:02:14.430> is<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> combination<00:02:16.160> settings<00:02:17.160> file<00:02:17.370> with

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
this is a combination settings file with

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.070 
this is a combination settings file with
both<00:02:17.959> z-scores

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
both z-scores

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.710 
both z-scores
and<00:02:19.260> we're<00:02:20.130> training<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.640> ROI<00:02:21.030> we<00:02:21.630> are<00:02:22.160> we're

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
and we're training the ROI we are we're

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.250 
and we're training the ROI we are we're
going<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.810> train<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:26.510> the<00:02:27.510> posterior

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
going to train the the posterior

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.760 
going to train the the posterior
cingulate<00:02:28.920> which<00:02:29.100> is<00:02:29.489> ROI<00:02:30.360> 28<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.560> we're

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
cingulate which is ROI 28 and we're

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.910 
cingulate which is ROI 28 and we're
going<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.920> train<00:02:32.160> that<00:02:32.190> with<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:34.020> Train<00:02:34.290> beta

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
going to train that with the Train beta

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.470 
going to train that with the Train beta
down<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.989> posterior<00:02:37.380> cingulate<00:02:38.420> okay<00:02:39.420> so

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
down in the posterior cingulate okay so

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.500 
down in the posterior cingulate okay so
let's<00:02:39.810> now<00:02:40.170> look<00:02:40.200> at<00:02:41.060> first<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.180> all<00:02:42.300> our

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
let's now look at first of all our

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.420 
let's now look at first of all our
z-scores<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.200> we're<00:02:43.320> going<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.280> see

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
z-scores and we're going to you can see

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.120 
z-scores and we're going to you can see
the<00:02:44.550> top<00:02:44.790> box<00:02:45.090> is<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.510> z-score<00:02:45.959> box<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.890> lower

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
the top box is the z-score box the lower

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.820 
the top box is the z-score box the lower
one<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.400> our<00:02:47.850> ROI<00:02:48.330> training<00:02:48.870> screen<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.380> down

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
one is our ROI training screen and down

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.220 
one is our ROI training screen and down
below<00:02:50.160> that<00:02:50.400> tells<00:02:50.670> us<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.540> percentage<00:02:52.110> of

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
below that tells us the percentage of

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.590 
below that tells us the percentage of
reward<00:02:52.680> now<00:02:53.280> let<00:02:53.459> me<00:02:53.550> get<00:02:53.670> that<00:02:53.820> set<00:02:54.150> up<00:02:54.180> first

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
reward now let me get that set up first

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.199 
reward now let me get that set up first
so<00:02:56.150> I'm<00:02:57.150> gonna<00:02:57.269> go<00:02:57.450> into<00:02:57.630> setup<00:02:58.880> viewer<00:02:59.880> change

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
so I'm gonna go into setup viewer change

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.740 
so I'm gonna go into setup viewer change
settings<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:00.900> into<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.230> event<00:03:01.530> wizard<00:03:02.750> I'm

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
settings and into the event wizard I'm

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.320 
settings and into the event wizard I'm
gonna<00:03:03.900> go<00:03:04.080> to<00:03:04.140> event<00:03:04.620> six<00:03:05.090> and<00:03:06.090> I'm<00:03:06.150> gonna

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
gonna go to event six and I'm gonna

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.630 
gonna go to event six and I'm gonna
change<00:03:06.720> so<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:06.959> can<00:03:07.200> see<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.620> it's<00:03:07.769> at<00:03:08.250> ROI

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
change so you can see that it's at ROI

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.210 
change so you can see that it's at ROI
50<00:03:09.209> I'm<00:03:09.329> going<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.630> put<00:03:09.750> ROI<00:03:10.049> 28<00:03:10.680> which<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:10.980> the

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
50 I'm going to put ROI 28 which is the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.500 
50 I'm going to put ROI 28 which is the
posterior<00:03:11.700> cingulate<00:03:12.299> and<00:03:13.170> we'll<00:03:13.680> put<00:03:13.950> band<00:03:14.510> 6

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
posterior cingulate and we'll put band 6

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.680 
posterior cingulate and we'll put band 6
which<00:03:16.140> is<00:03:16.320> high<00:03:16.530> beta<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:18.209> will<00:03:18.390> check

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
which is high beta and I will check

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:22.880 
which is high beta and I will check
equation<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:20.010> this<00:03:20.250> looks<00:03:20.519> good<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.860> we<00:03:22.860> are

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
equation and this looks good so we are

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.390 
equation and this looks good so we are
then<00:03:23.250> going<00:03:23.459> to<00:03:23.549> save<00:03:23.850> these<00:03:24.120> settings<00:03:25.400> by

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
then going to save these settings by

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.160 
then going to save these settings by
saying<00:03:26.670> use<00:03:26.910> now<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:28.400> ok<00:03:29.600> then<00:03:30.600> I<00:03:30.630> exit

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
saying use now and ok then I exit

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.920 
saying use now and ok then I exit
alright<00:03:31.650> now<00:03:31.980> in<00:03:32.640> order<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.180> get<00:03:33.720> this

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
alright now in order to get this

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.710 
alright now in order to get this
properly<00:03:34.560> done<00:03:35.100> in<00:03:35.370> order<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.760> use<00:03:36.090> the

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.750 
dampening factor that we're using for
training<00:03:39.239> in<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.420> ROI<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.900> use<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.530> H<00:03:40.739> key<00:03:41.160> and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
training in the ROI I use the H key and

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.050 
training in the ROI I use the H key and
I<00:03:41.880> hit<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> H<00:03:42.269> key<00:03:42.299> a<00:03:42.540> couple<00:03:42.780> of<00:03:42.989> times

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.360 

there<00:03:49.630> we<00:03:49.720> are<00:03:52.470> now<00:03:53.470> hopefully<00:03:53.650> you<00:03:53.980> can<00:03:54.100> hear

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
there we are now hopefully you can hear

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:04.949 
there we are now hopefully you can hear
the<00:03:55.380> reward<00:03:56.380> sound<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:04.540> now<00:04:04.720> we're<00:04:04.870> gonna

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 
the reward sound and now we're gonna

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.260 
the reward sound and now we're gonna
bring<00:04:05.170> in<00:04:05.410> our<00:04:05.560> z-scores<00:04:06.100> by<00:04:06.430> adjusting<00:04:07.030> the

and<00:04:59.890> train<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.340> so<00:05:00.520> that<00:05:00.669> it's<00:05:00.790> going<00:05:01.150> down<00:05:01.450> so

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
and train it so that it's going down so

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.020 
and train it so that it's going down so
either<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.140> viewer<00:05:02.380> change<00:05:02.680> settings<00:05:03.160> into

the H key again and bring up my dampened
reward<00:05:44.650> threshold<00:05:54.180> there's<00:05:55.180> my<00:05:55.360> z<00:05:55.569> score

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:55.599 
reward threshold there's my z score

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:04.469 
reward threshold there's my z score
reward<00:05:56.589> as<00:05:56.889> well<00:06:02.939> so<00:06:03.939> I<00:06:03.999> have<00:06:04.089> both<00:06:04.270> things

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
reward as well so I have both things

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:06.629 
reward as well so I have both things
going<00:06:04.719> on<00:06:04.870> on<00:06:05.259> the<00:06:05.439> one<00:06:05.620> hand<00:06:05.830> you<00:06:05.949> hear<00:06:06.159> organ

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:06.639 
going on on the one hand you hear organ

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.489 
going on on the one hand you hear organ
sound<00:06:06.879> that<00:06:07.120> sounds<00:06:07.419> like<00:06:07.539> this<00:06:07.810> oh<00:06:10.319> that<00:06:11.319> is

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:11.499 
sound that sounds like this oh that is

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:14.070 
sound that sounds like this oh that is
the<00:06:11.650> ROI<00:06:11.949> reward<00:06:12.520> and<00:06:12.879> then<00:06:13.810> you're<00:06:13.960> the

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
the ROI reward and then you're the

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:18.089 
the ROI reward and then you're the
z-scores<00:06:14.560> which<00:06:15.009> are<00:06:15.159> a<00:06:15.189> string<00:06:15.580> reward<00:06:17.099> so

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:18.099 
z-scores which are a string reward so

00:06:18.099 --> 00:07:04.839 
z-scores which are a string reward so
both<00:06:18.310> things<00:06:18.339> are<00:06:18.729> going<00:06:18.969> on<00:06:19.150> at<00:06:19.300> once

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:04.849 

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.980 

oh<00:07:06.699> I<00:07:07.699> see<00:07:08.059> what's<00:07:08.209> going<00:07:08.389> on<00:07:08.479> hang<00:07:08.779> on<00:07:08.929> a

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990 
oh I see what's going on hang on a

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.309 
oh I see what's going on hang on a
minute

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 
minute

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:20.469 
minute
I<00:07:09.379> see<00:07:09.939> let's<00:07:10.939> go<00:07:11.059> down<00:07:11.209> to<00:07:11.240> voxels<00:07:18.759> now<00:07:19.759> please

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 
I see let's go down to voxels now please

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:23.049 
I see let's go down to voxels now please
turn<00:07:20.749> this<00:07:20.839> around<00:07:21.139> here<00:07:21.789> so<00:07:22.789> you<00:07:22.819> can

00:07:23.049 --> 00:07:23.059 
turn this around here so you can

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:26.499 
turn this around here so you can
actually<00:07:23.240> see<00:07:23.659> the<00:07:23.809> posterior<00:07:24.229> cingulate<00:07:25.509> and

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:26.509 
actually see the posterior cingulate and

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:31.829 
actually see the posterior cingulate and
there<00:07:26.749> it<00:07:26.839> is

00:07:31.829 --> 00:07:31.839 

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:36.459 

so<00:07:32.839> when<00:07:33.770> it<00:07:33.889> turns<00:07:33.919> red<00:07:34.719> there's<00:07:35.719> excess<00:07:36.289> high

00:07:36.459 --> 00:07:36.469 
so when it turns red there's excess high

00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:39.339 
so when it turns red there's excess high
beta<00:07:36.740> when<00:07:37.249> it<00:07:37.369> turns<00:07:37.610> green<00:07:37.990> the<00:07:38.990> bait<00:07:39.199> is

00:07:39.339 --> 00:07:39.349 
beta when it turns green the bait is

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:47.949 
beta when it turns green the bait is
lowered<00:07:42.039> green<00:07:43.039> or<00:07:43.219> blue<00:07:46.449> so<00:07:47.449> we're<00:07:47.599> looking

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:47.959 
lowered green or blue so we're looking

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:49.869 
lowered green or blue so we're looking
at<00:07:48.110> the<00:07:48.319> brain<00:07:48.589> now<00:07:48.830> from<00:07:49.189> the<00:07:49.339> bottom<00:07:49.519> from

00:07:49.869 --> 00:07:49.879 
at the brain now from the bottom from

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:51.489 
at the brain now from the bottom from
underneath<00:07:50.269> this<00:07:50.599> is<00:07:50.749> the<00:07:50.839> back<00:07:51.050> of<00:07:51.199> the<00:07:51.289> brain

00:07:51.489 --> 00:07:51.499 
underneath this is the back of the brain

00:07:51.499 --> 00:08:03.440 
underneath this is the back of the brain
here's<00:07:52.069> the<00:07:52.189> front<00:07:52.429> of<00:07:52.580> there

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.450 

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:09.600 

okay<00:08:04.450> there<00:08:05.290> we<00:08:05.410> have<00:08:05.440> it<00:08:06.420> all<00:08:07.420> right
