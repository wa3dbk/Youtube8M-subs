00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.009
 good afternoon kids today we are going to 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.950
 Sunday and at least in Madrid makes a 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.839
 day a regulin tidy regulate them and that 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.759
 I imagine that many of you 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.709
 you will be at home you will be playing at 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.900
 play or watching videos on youtube as is 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.880
 in this case or studying what it is that 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.939
 I'm going to do nothing more to finish this 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.099
 comment you know yesterday I was in all 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.019
 the day of communion so I could not give myself 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.839
 no comment no private message 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.269
 or no no I did not see anything doing you anything and 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:32.190
 this morning, yes, I did it and it has 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.860
 surprised not because yesterday was Saturday 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.050
 supposedly it played the last assembly to 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.790
 sniper in the channel that we had 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.820
 reserved for a long time and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.830
 nobody has asked anything at all 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.170
 so good for that department well 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.080
 because the assembly is not made by 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.390
 I'm still missing a week or two 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.580
 weeks to be completed because there was 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.890
 problems like the previous the 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.780
 addiction is not finished good has 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.730
 there were problems with the editor and it has 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.620
 had to go to the root we have not given to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.990
 Rai again to nacho and you know him 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.730
 many of you so good when 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.600
 we can take out that assembly because what 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.490
 we will remove 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.500
 soon play another montage plus the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.080
 special one year that has not yet started 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.750
 or to prepare it then play the next 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.490
 assembly of this is not an assembly like this 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.649
 quoting between quotes 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.899
 so good mounts are going to have the 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.610
 channel to bore this month and the 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.640
 next surely also when 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.799

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.299

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.799
 of entering to talk about what you are 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.750
 seeing in the title my favorite weapon 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.909
 because la caixa has become my 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.009
 favorite weapon many of you 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.259
 have you asked how the subject is? 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.210

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.950

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.030

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.429

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.039
 say a lot of people who have told me frames 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.659
 I have a video capture device not a 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.369
 graphic card that made us for nothing 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.380
 I'll sell it for 50 euros 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.570
 others that frames I have a source of 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.290
 food that I give you but I live 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.840
 in argentina 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.569
 and notice how to pass tiles good much 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.099
 support on your part the truth other 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.680
 people who have suggested by the 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.439
 comments also that we make a 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.480
 donations page or that we open I do not know 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:29.819
 what donation things that the truth does not 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.260
 I know how you think about that 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.359
 other subscribers that have also 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.269
 directly offered boats I give you 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:39.840
 five dollars or I give you a little money 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.370
 uncle that I have saved I do not know that I the 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.129
 I really do not know what you think about that topic 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.769
 and there are Americans who have done it for 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.599
 buy playstation3 and play with their 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.099
 Subscribers in prices are three that I 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.859
 I have brought them because I want to play 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.019
 with them too but I do not know how is that 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.389
 subject has been taken several times in the 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.819
 Comment section with many votes 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:02.280
 positive many little hands up but I 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.930
 It is not something you want to do unless 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.000
 you want because if not the people 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.370
 crush me and there I do not want to do this 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.590
 kind of things so good the computer 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.150
 It will be achieved when you can 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.489
 get if it's not this month will be the 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.620
 if not within the next three months 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:18.329
 because until there is no pasta is not going 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.770
 to compare the computer that is clear 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:22.410
 Because it is not 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:24.270
 materially possible so good 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.340
 thank you very much for all the messages from 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.540
 support you sent me and other people 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.910
 they call have said they are 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.410
 computer scientists who are engineers that 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.900
 they mount the computer that they live in madrid 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.880
 and I thank you because it's going to be like that 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.280
 I do not know how to assemble computers is not 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.620
 install windows is not install in little 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.120
 thing there are people who go to me 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.820
 ride the computer that live around here 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.580
 by madrid and you will let me be very 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.260
 grateful so good talking about me 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.610
 favorite weapon to the caisse je that we 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.130
 will finish the gameplay in nothing 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.140
 I caught a little rachet I had here 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.020
 by cnooc town a pretty little party 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.970
 pretty girl who burned myself because what 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.130
 human the only bad thing that this weapon has 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.960
 is that if there is bad connection it happens 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.150
 same as with the snipers we do 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.670
 wrong because the bullets do not arrive or go 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.740
 delayed or directly do not go in the 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.360
 objective not because you write badly but 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.610
 because there is a little bit at the other times 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.070
 it's because we aim badly in this game 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.570
 I got nervous I do not know why I thought 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.970
 that I was going to get more than 100 casualties 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.890
 I was playing with mayor a friend and 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.720
 I thought I was going to take them out 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.790
 all routed but in the end spoil 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.990
 the game exceedingly 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.610
 so well I hope you enjoyed 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.400
 the little party to the street that has 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.320
 become my new favorite weapon 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.760
 because it's cool because it's fun because 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.550
 it's a shotgun I shotguns me 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.410
 they love you already know it and it is that a 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.910
 sniper so he has all this 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.070
 weapon, I encourage you to try it and 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.990
 you count so well we'll see you in the 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.970
 next video a greeting see you later and 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.970
