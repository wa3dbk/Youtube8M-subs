 under 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.830
 much

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.770
 the last time you had so if my 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.390
 memories are good the soul kia 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.250
 today is a day a little 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.110
 particular because try 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.220
 you have two surprises today the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.600
 first is a vehicle a little 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.640
 original called the nissan cube 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.150
 for a pretty Japanese vehicle 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.059
 eccentric 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.370
 the second that I reserve for you is a 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.000
 little trainee with the brand name of the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.890
 first grade 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.739
 here is exactly I let you discover 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:01:00.979
 by that, ok I'm going to have a good day 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:01:03.949
 thank you hello hello then me it's 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.610
 eva sumarti ok we sing and I was told 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.200
 I had a small intern 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:14.710
 today so being able to have played you 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.710
 drive go we go there 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.400
 [Applause] 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:29.810
 [Music] 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.990
 so what do you think of 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:40.130
 dashboard already web we find that a 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.060
 little big for me otherwise the design is 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.920
 not bad I find 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.579
 it's rather successful it seems to me a little 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:51.590
 lower areola and crickets 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.170
 another positive aspect for me that's it 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.030
 so in fact was just then 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.909
 that they have that limits to do a little 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.219
 visibly the Japanese walls 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.530
 teixeira but it pays well that's it 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.200
 goes like this sarah hand and new 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.759
 there therefore a very nice and 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.000
 so looked at you so you have not 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:14.720
 the paper aspect of rice I do not know and so 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.350
 it bothers you and armed yeah completely 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.370
 closed or stay there 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.370
 ok if we close as ingenious 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.000
 too much that very good that I too 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.130
 good me I would still like a 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.500
 little criticism despite everything as a 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.910
 passenger I'm not super big but 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.650
 so if I want to open the glove box 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.570
 that falls directly on my 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.020
 legs and it does not crush your legs 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.040
 badly done all practice and I do not like 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.420
 of me as a glove so I 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.890
 maybe an armrest but I have no 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.140
 low wood is normal 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:54.180
 why will it lead you 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.100
 never bataves have then I find myself 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.990
 not that great because if you get lost 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.070
 meaning is a city dweller if we misplace is 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.550
 very close to a car we can not 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.410
 open our chest is not it yes 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.200
 but here is me first 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:13.320
 for me alone the game I think about the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.140
 badiane lost my job but I put 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:23.700
 none of that we can impose anything is to 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:25.470
 scratch did not hide I hid by 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.840
 against look there is a pussy the 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.640
 rear window actually that spans 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.440
 the side also it's a single headband 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.070
 black we know design and for as much I 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.070
 find that it's missed 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.150
 and we 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.710
 no 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.540
 laughs 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.540
 question 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.490
 [Music] 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.790
 the proper handling only those above 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:03.200
 were not used to this contact there 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:05.359
 ruth sheen with a start &amp; stop 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.470
 yeah marie matte case has all a little 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:13.359
 art for paris I think we do not 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:22.639
 not see much by career 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:26.210
 seats and a seat not the big retro 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.160
 yes and so if I find that it's not 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.039
 wrong yes but I find that I'm when 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.720
 even a lot of noise and it's hard but 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.860
 good who is maybe denouncing it I 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.590
 know nothing 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.500
 well you pass it and names so we do not 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:52.680
 change nothing in exchange 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:57.060

 catastrophic comfort the seats by 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.550
 against really I stay here I 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.139
 think we were really good I 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.029
 find very retro I agree with 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:17.340
 you do that they are wide like 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:19.289
 that's fine yes and there for the 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.009
 coup we still have a very good 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.189
 visibility 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:25.740
 we want you do not know you 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:29.000

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.000
 look at the car and who is in a 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:39.330
 mini cooper and gasoline and make 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.279
 competition is neither soul nor first 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.979

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:51.560

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:51.560
 for the car I stand 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.660
 shameful 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.990
 [Music] 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.990
 Maya

 yeah yes it went well very well 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.160
 now martin is taking advantage of the points 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.690
 positive and negative points of this 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:17.930
 test is Tunisian the positives 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:20.449
 it's not difficult, it's still 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.820
 the sunroof with three positions I 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.300
 found that it is a dream to me 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.610
 negative 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.610
 negative point for aesthetics 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:38.240
 very negative point when we drive on 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:40.340
 does not have a rear vision the chest too 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.570
 little not good I stop there he says 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.570
 we stop 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.780
 positive point the same thing 

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.030
 this sunroof or we can alternate in 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.130
 more with brioude paper I do not 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.660
 do not know what's called another point 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.890
 positive the camera on the back 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.080
 actually as said martin we did not 

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:02.090
 no visibility when we go back and 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:07.000
 so this camera still does not bring 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:09.500
 bad things design of this car 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.570
 not at the design level it looks like 

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:12.980
 really a hearse 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.120
 I just like the little window before 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.710
