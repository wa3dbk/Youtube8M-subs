check that out and just so you can get

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.370 
check that out and just so you can get
the<00:00:21.210> basis<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.600> on<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:21.869> side<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.140> don't<00:00:22.170> have

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
the basis of on the side you don't have

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.509 
the basis of on the side you don't have
to<00:00:22.439> watch<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.710> whole<00:00:22.859> thing<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.250> probably

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
to watch the whole thing it's probably

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.230 
to watch the whole thing it's probably
about<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:24.410> don't<00:00:25.410> know<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:26.250> first<00:00:26.519> 10-15
