00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:30.330 

I'm<00:01:24.700> just<00:01:24.970> naming<00:01:25.180> these<00:01:25.510> fingers<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:29.340> that

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
I'm just naming these fingers and that

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.490 
I'm just naming these fingers and that
is<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.850> secret<00:01:31.210> pure<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:31.960> simple

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
is the secret pure and simple

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.100 
is the secret pure and simple
is<00:01:32.590> using<00:01:33.250> this<00:01:33.400> smaller<00:01:33.970> muscle<00:01:34.570> groups<00:01:34.840> our

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
is using this smaller muscle groups our

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.700 
is using this smaller muscle groups our
fingers<00:01:36.480> now<00:01:39.479> we're<00:01:40.479> still<00:01:40.810> we're<00:01:41.530> going<00:01:41.650> to

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
fingers now we're still we're going to

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.230 
fingers now we're still we're going to
use<00:01:41.800> a<00:01:41.830> combination<00:01:42.130> of<00:01:42.490> all<00:01:42.700> those<00:01:42.910> when<00:01:43.210> we

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
use a combination of all those when we

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.270 
use a combination of all those when we
play<00:01:43.660> and<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.440> can<00:01:44.560> actually<00:01:44.890> give<00:01:45.070> some

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
play and that can actually give some

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.830 
play and that can actually give some
great<00:01:45.490> dynamics<00:01:46.180> like<00:01:46.360> if<00:01:46.479> I<00:01:46.600> use<00:01:46.810> some

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
great dynamics like if I use some

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.960 
great dynamics like if I use some
fingers<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.770> go<00:01:48.010> all<00:01:48.190> the<00:01:48.220> way<00:01:48.310> to<00:01:48.460> my<00:01:48.580> arms

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
fingers and go all the way to my arms

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:56.340 
fingers and go all the way to my arms
yeah<00:01:52.440> you<00:01:53.440> know<00:01:53.530> something<00:01:53.860> like<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:55.350> you

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
yeah you know something like that you

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.830 
yeah you know something like that you
end<00:01:56.530> up<00:01:56.619> using<00:01:56.680> all<00:01:57.160> of<00:01:57.310> it<00:01:57.430> now<00:01:58.330> let<00:01:58.630> me<00:01:58.690> tell

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
end up using all of it now let me tell

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.030 
end up using all of it now let me tell
you<00:01:58.930> about<00:01:58.990> this<00:01:59.170> practice<00:01:59.380> pad<00:01:59.680> I'm<00:01:59.830> going<00:01:59.979> to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.010 
unscrew it from this cymbal stand it has
a<00:02:05.259> threaded<00:02:05.830> hole<00:02:06.009> so<00:02:06.790> you<00:02:06.820> can<00:02:07.240> mount<00:02:07.509> it<00:02:07.780> to

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
a threaded hole so you can mount it to

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.469 
a threaded hole so you can mount it to
simple<00:02:08.560> stand<00:02:08.800> I'll<00:02:09.459> tell<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.759> how<00:02:09.880> I<00:02:09.910> use<00:02:10.300> it

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.750 
just practice this finger technique in
the<00:02:25.930> past<00:02:26.200> when<00:02:26.680> I<00:02:26.770> would<00:02:26.890> do<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.070> single<00:02:27.550> stroke

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the past when I would do a single stroke

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.370 
the past when I would do a single stroke
roll<00:02:28.120> which<00:02:28.269> is<00:02:28.480> just<00:02:28.690> right<00:02:28.900> left<00:02:29.140> right<00:02:29.230> left

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
roll which is just right left right left

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.180 
roll which is just right left right left
right<00:02:29.680> left<00:02:30.269> when<00:02:31.269> I<00:02:31.299> would<00:02:31.570> do<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.049> I<00:02:32.470> would

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
right left when I would do that I would

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.940 
right left when I would do that I would
use<00:02:33.340> my<00:02:33.519> wrist<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.299> I<00:02:35.110> never<00:02:35.290> could<00:02:35.530> get<00:02:35.709> but

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
use my wrist and I never could get but

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.560 
use my wrist and I never could get but
so<00:02:36.190> fast<00:02:37.380> wow<00:02:38.380> that's<00:02:38.650> really<00:02:38.799> annoying<00:02:39.570> there

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
so fast wow that's really annoying there

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.400 
so fast wow that's really annoying there
we<00:02:40.660> go<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:42.430> only<00:02:42.459> get<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.000> fast<00:02:43.239> and<00:02:43.660> then<00:02:44.380> I

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
we go I can only get so fast and then I

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.990 
we go I can only get so fast and then I
decided<00:02:44.950> well<00:02:45.250> I'm<00:02:45.310> going<00:02:45.489> to<00:02:45.519> start<00:02:45.820> doing

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
decided well I'm going to start doing

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.880 
decided well I'm going to start doing
this<00:02:46.209> this<00:02:46.450> is<00:02:46.510> what<00:02:46.750> I<00:02:46.780> should<00:02:47.170> be<00:02:47.410> doing<00:02:47.440> I

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
this this is what I should be doing I

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.310 
this this is what I should be doing I
just<00:02:48.130> need<00:02:48.280> to<00:02:48.430> start<00:02:48.670> doing<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.120> when<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:50.049> first

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
just need to start doing it when I first

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.949 
just need to start doing it when I first
started<00:02:50.680> practicing<00:02:51.190> it<00:02:51.340> I<00:02:51.549> was<00:02:52.150> even<00:02:52.480> slower

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
started practicing it I was even slower

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.039 
started practicing it I was even slower
even<00:02:53.830> more<00:02:54.209> inconsistent<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.510> was<00:02:55.780> pretty

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
even more inconsistent it was pretty

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.680 
even more inconsistent it was pretty
horrible<00:02:56.410> but<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.580> was<00:02:57.940> like<00:02:58.060> I<00:02:58.150> just<00:02:58.180> need<00:02:58.480> to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
horrible but I was like I just need to

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.590 
horrible but I was like I just need to
keep<00:02:58.870> on<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.530> I<00:03:00.250> got<00:03:00.670> over<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.120> hump<00:03:01.180> and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
keep on it and I got over that hump and

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.979 
keep on it and I got over that hump and
now<00:03:01.690> I'm<00:03:02.290> faster<00:03:02.980> than<00:03:03.910> ever<00:03:04.209> about<00:03:04.600> single

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
now I'm faster than ever about single

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.290 
now I'm faster than ever about single
stroke<00:03:05.230> roll<00:03:05.400> thanks<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.700> the

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
stroke roll thanks to the

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.100 
stroke roll thanks to the
my<00:03:08.840> fingers<00:03:09.290> instead<00:03:09.650> of<00:03:09.770> my<00:03:09.920> wrists<00:03:10.960> now<00:03:11.960> when

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
my fingers instead of my wrists now when

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.190 
my fingers instead of my wrists now when
you<00:03:12.200> first<00:03:12.380> start<00:03:12.530> practicing<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:13.640> roll<00:03:14.360> is

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
you first start practicing a roll is

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.120 
you first start practicing a roll is
probably<00:03:15.620> going<00:03:15.740> to<00:03:15.830> be<00:03:15.920> a<00:03:15.950> little

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
probably going to be a little

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.300 
probably going to be a little
frustrating<00:03:16.850> I<00:03:17.120> would<00:03:18.110> suggest<00:03:18.320> doing<00:03:18.650> 8<00:03:19.070> with
