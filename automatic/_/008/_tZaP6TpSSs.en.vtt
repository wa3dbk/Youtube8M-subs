eight this the glass method is an

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.619 
eight this the glass method is an
ancient<00:00:43.739> art<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:45.120> one<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.450> first

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
ancient art and it's one of the first

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.610 
ancient art and it's one of the first
things<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:46.110> people<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.010> palma<00:00:47.309> polymer<00:00:48.000> clay

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
things that people in palma polymer clay

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.560 
things that people in palma polymer clay
started<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:49.739> do<00:00:49.890> was<00:00:50.100> Cain<00:00:50.370> work<00:00:50.579> so<00:00:51.300> today

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
started to do was Cain work so today

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.340 
started to do was Cain work so today
we're<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.870> look<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:53.390> for<00:00:54.390> very<00:00:55.170> very

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
we're going to look at for very very

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.170 
we're going to look at for very very
basic<00:00:55.920> hanes<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.489> should<00:00:56.699> be<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.940> first

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
basic hanes they should be the first

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.910 
basic hanes they should be the first
couple<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.719> anyone<00:00:58.430> learns<00:00:59.430> and<00:01:00.800> here<00:01:01.800> they

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
couple that anyone learns and here they

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.270 
couple that anyone learns and here they
are<00:01:01.949> first<00:01:02.820> one<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> jelly<00:01:03.480> roll<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:05.100> in

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
are first one is the jelly roll and in

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.300 
are first one is the jelly roll and in
two<00:01:05.489> ways<00:01:06.530> then<00:01:07.530> we'll<00:01:07.740> move<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
two ways then we'll move on to the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.660 
two ways then we'll move on to the
bullseye<00:01:09.740> we'll<00:01:10.740> take<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:10.979> little<00:01:11.159> break<00:01:11.430> and

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
bullseye we'll take a little break and

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.219 
bullseye we'll take a little break and
come<00:01:11.850> back<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.330> some<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.840> little<00:01:13.020> more

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
come back and do some a little more

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.160 
come back and do some a little more
complex<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.430> flower<00:01:14.729> cane<00:01:15.180> real<00:01:15.689> basic

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
complex it's a flower cane real basic

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.920 
complex it's a flower cane real basic
flower<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.030> we'll<00:01:18.030> do<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> checkerboard<00:01:18.750> which

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
flower and we'll do a checkerboard which

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
flower and we'll do a checkerboard which
is<00:01:19.110> useful<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.799> lot<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:21.650> finishing<00:01:22.650> up<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
is useful for a lot of finishing up of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.240 
is useful for a lot of finishing up of
canes<00:01:23.220> doing<00:01:23.790> borders<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.330> stuff<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.710> let's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
canes doing borders and stuff so let's

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.910 
canes doing borders and stuff so let's
get<00:01:26.430> started<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.570> jelly<00:01:27.780> roll<00:01:29.900> I'm

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
get started with the jelly roll I'm

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.880 
get started with the jelly roll I'm
going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.100> use<00:01:32.600> it<00:01:33.600> just<00:01:33.840> make<00:01:34.020> small<00:01:34.200> samples

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
going to use it just make small samples

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.700 
going to use it just make small samples
so<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> don't<00:01:35.630> waste<00:01:36.630> your<00:01:36.869> time<00:01:37.049> making<00:01:37.350> huge

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
so I don't waste your time making huge

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.730 
so I don't waste your time making huge
canes<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.759> basically<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.229> can<00:01:40.380> do<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.619> with

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
canes but basically you can do it with

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.170 
canes but basically you can do it with
multiple<00:01:41.130> colors<00:01:41.460> but<00:01:41.610> let's<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:42.000> start

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
multiple colors but let's just start

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.300 
multiple colors but let's just start
with<00:01:42.270> using<00:01:42.720> two<00:01:42.930> pink<00:01:43.619> two<00:01:43.799> contrasting

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
with using two pink two contrasting

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.300 
with using two pink two contrasting
colors<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:46.220> you<00:01:47.220> know

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
colors so that you can see the you know

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.380 
colors so that you can see the you know
really<00:01:47.460> see<00:01:47.700> what's<00:01:47.880> going<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.360> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
really see what's going on at the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.219 
really see what's going on at the
pattern<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.729> i<00:01:50.729> have<00:01:51.270> chosen<00:01:51.450> white<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
pattern and i have chosen white and a

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.679 
pattern and i have chosen white and a
blue<00:01:52.439> these<00:01:53.310> are<00:01:53.490> rolled<00:01:53.729> out<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
blue these are rolled out to the

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.600 
blue these are rolled out to the
thickest<00:01:55.500> setting<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.860> my<00:01:55.890> pastor<00:01:56.340> machine

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
thickest setting on my pastor machine

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.039 
thickest setting on my pastor machine
which<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.880> number<00:01:57.030> one<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.540> cut<00:01:58.500> one<00:01:58.530> into<00:01:59.399> a

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
which is number one I cut one into a

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.080 
which is number one I cut one into a
sort<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.140> square<00:02:01.439> I'm<00:02:02.369> going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.640> put<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.939> on

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
sort of square I'm going to put it on

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.149 
sort of square I'm going to put it on
top<00:02:03.390> of<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.960> other<00:02:04.770> one

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
top of the other one

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.949 
top of the other one
and<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:08.530> not<00:02:08.709> going<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.979> cut<00:02:09.129> them<00:02:09.280> exactly

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
and I'm not going to cut them exactly

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.390 
and I'm not going to cut them exactly
the<00:02:10.959> same<00:02:11.230> I'm<00:02:11.560> going<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.739> do<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:11.980> top<00:02:12.160> and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.350 

but<00:02:18.280> the<00:02:19.230> size<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:21.610> i'm<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.180> start

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
but the size that i'm going to start

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.119 
but the size that i'm going to start
rolling<00:02:22.540> from<00:02:22.930> i'm<00:02:23.170> going<00:02:23.349> to<00:02:23.410> cut<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> little

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
rolling from i'm going to cut a little

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.750 
rolling from i'm going to cut a little
bit<00:02:24.489> extra<00:02:26.160> so<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.340> can<00:02:27.489> see<00:02:27.610> the<00:02:27.730> bottom

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
bit extra so you can see the bottom

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.869 
bit extra so you can see the bottom
layer<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:28.480> a<00:02:28.510> little<00:02:29.110> bit<00:02:29.290> longer<00:02:30.280> than<00:02:30.700> that

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
layer is a little bit longer than that

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:38.539 
layer is a little bit longer than that
way<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:32.500> this<00:02:33.370> way<00:02:34.980> there's<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.099> good<00:02:36.280> reason

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.309 

it<00:02:39.549> just<00:02:39.610> makes<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.150> little<00:02:40.180> bit<00:02:40.480> easier<00:02:41.049> to

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
it just makes it a little bit easier to

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.220 
it just makes it a little bit easier to
seal<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:42.099> edges<00:02:42.250> at<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.970> end<00:02:43.150> to<00:02:43.720> seal<00:02:43.959> the

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
seal the edges at the end to seal the

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.339 
seal the edges at the end to seal the
seam<00:02:45.160> and<00:02:45.519> it<00:02:46.000> makes<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.269> little<00:02:46.599> bit<00:02:46.720> easier<00:02:47.049> to

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
seam and it makes a little bit easier to

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.130 
seam and it makes a little bit easier to
start<00:02:47.769> that<00:02:48.069> in<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.640> roll<00:02:48.910> if<00:02:49.329> you<00:02:49.510> leave<00:02:49.690> just<00:02:49.989> a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
start that in a roll if you leave just a

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.619 
start that in a roll if you leave just a
little<00:02:50.170> bit<00:02:50.530> extra<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.129> in<00:02:51.640> fact<00:02:51.910> it's<00:02:52.510> even

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:52.629 
little bit extra and in fact it's even

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.640 
little bit extra and in fact it's even
easier<00:02:52.930> if<00:02:53.440> you<00:02:54.190> just<00:02:55.140> kind<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.170> bet<00:02:56.349> on<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:56.620> a

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
easier if you just kind of bet on this a

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.289 
easier if you just kind of bet on this a
little<00:02:56.950> bit<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.760> can<00:02:57.910> do<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.090> with<00:02:58.180> your

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299 
little bit you can do it with your

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.069 
little bit you can do it with your
roller<00:02:58.540> or<00:02:58.900> you<00:02:59.019> can<00:02:59.200> do<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.410> by<00:02:59.560> hand<00:02:59.829> just

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
roller or you can do it by hand just

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.550 
roller or you can do it by hand just
just<00:03:02.079> press<00:03:03.480> I'm<00:03:04.480> just<00:03:04.690> using<00:03:04.840> paper<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.410> get<00:03:05.530> a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
just press I'm just using paper to get a

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.610 
just press I'm just using paper to get a
smoother<00:03:06.430> edge<00:03:06.579> fit<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:07.180> actually<00:03:07.690> pressing

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
smoother edge fit and actually pressing

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.390 
smoother edge fit and actually pressing
it<00:03:08.950> down<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.700> it's<00:03:13.530> not<00:03:14.530> as<00:03:14.739> harsh<00:03:14.980> of<00:03:15.099> an<00:03:15.250> edge

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
it down so it's not as harsh of an edge

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000 
it down so it's not as harsh of an edge
it's<00:03:15.639> a<00:03:15.730> little<00:03:15.940> bit<00:03:16.290> tapered<00:03:17.290> is<00:03:17.650> the<00:03:17.829> mood

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
it's a little bit tapered is the mood

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.479 
it's a little bit tapered is the mood
I'm<00:03:18.130> looking<00:03:18.370> for<00:03:18.579> all<00:03:19.239> right<00:03:20.310> that's<00:03:21.310> your

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
basic easy construction now we're going

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.259 
basic easy construction now we're going
to<00:03:23.530> roll<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.799> up<00:03:24.040> like<00:03:24.519> a<00:03:24.549> jelly<00:03:24.880> roll<00:03:24.970> because

Hos you know what I'm talking about
we're<00:03:31.540> going<00:03:31.630> to<00:03:31.690> start<00:03:31.750> by<00:03:31.989> pulling<00:03:32.349> this

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
we're going to start by pulling this

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.150 
we're going to start by pulling this
edge<00:03:32.919> up<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.989> don't<00:03:35.200> want<00:03:35.380> an<00:03:35.470> air<00:03:35.650> gap<00:03:35.889> in

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
edge up you don't want an air gap in

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.580 
edge up you don't want an air gap in
there<00:03:36.400> and<00:03:37.359> you<00:03:37.720> can<00:03:37.840> see<00:03:38.019> it's<00:03:38.139> just<00:03:38.349> a<00:03:38.440> little

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
there and you can see it's just a little

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.580 
there and you can see it's just a little
bit<00:03:38.769> easier<00:03:39.010> because<00:03:39.519> i<00:03:39.760> left<00:03:40.209> that<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.720> little

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
bit easier because i left that a little

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.400 
bit easier because i left that a little
bit<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:41.739> extra<00:03:41.950> clay<00:03:42.780> so<00:03:43.780> you<00:03:43.840> can<00:03:44.139> see<00:03:44.290> I've

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
bit of extra clay so you can see I've

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.030 
bit of extra clay so you can see I've
got<00:03:44.440> a<00:03:44.620> nice<00:03:44.970> smooth<00:03:45.970> yep<00:03:46.870> there's<00:03:47.620> no<00:03:47.829> gap

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
got a nice smooth yep there's no gap

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.030 
got a nice smooth yep there's no gap
there<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.310> nice<00:03:48.489> smooth<00:03:48.730> find<00:03:49.090> there<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.349> then

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
there a nice smooth find there and then

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.729 
there a nice smooth find there and then
I'm<00:03:51.280> going<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.030> slowly<00:03:52.569> just<00:03:53.019> start<00:03:53.349> to<00:03:53.530> pull

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
I'm going to slowly just start to pull

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.900 
I'm going to slowly just start to pull
it<00:03:53.889> and<00:03:54.099> roll<00:03:54.849> it<00:03:54.880> and<00:03:55.239> take<00:03:56.109> the<00:03:56.620> and<00:03:57.549> I'll<00:03:57.700> can

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
it and roll it and take the and I'll can

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.809 
it and roll it and take the and I'll can
get<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.090> get<00:03:58.269> used<00:03:58.419> to<00:03:58.599> starving<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.620> it's<00:04:00.609> not

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
get a get used to starving it it's not

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.140 
get a get used to starving it it's not
always<00:04:01.000> pretty<00:04:02.099> I'm<00:04:03.099> going<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.549> push<00:04:04.000> your

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
always pretty I'm going to push your

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.750 
always pretty I'm going to push your
ends<00:04:04.419> in<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.769> just<00:04:06.069> once<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:06.430> get<00:04:06.609> started

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
ends in and just once I get started

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:14.289 
ends in and just once I get started
it'll<00:04:07.150> it'll<00:04:07.450> just<00:04:07.720> really<00:04:08.139> easily<00:04:09.599> roll<00:04:10.599> up

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.640 

then<00:04:15.299> you<00:04:15.450> want<00:04:15.629> to<00:04:15.659> take<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.930> time<00:04:16.139> to<00:04:16.289> make

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
then you want to take the time to make

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.610 
then you want to take the time to make
sure<00:04:16.859> your<00:04:17.009> ends<00:04:17.250> are<00:04:17.340> going<00:04:17.579> in<00:04:17.759> there<00:04:18.620> keep

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
sure your ends are going in there keep

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.770 
sure your ends are going in there keep
on<00:04:19.829> rolling<00:04:20.370> now<00:04:20.759> you<00:04:20.820> can<00:04:21.060> do<00:04:21.209> this<00:04:21.329> obviously

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
on rolling now you can do this obviously

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.230 
on rolling now you can do this obviously
much<00:04:22.079> much<00:04:22.320> bigger<00:04:22.669> you<00:04:23.669> can<00:04:23.850> do<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.120> with

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
much much bigger you can do it with

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.260 
much much bigger you can do it with
multiple<00:04:24.780> colors<00:04:25.430> now<00:04:26.430> I've<00:04:26.639> got<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.030> the<00:04:27.120> end

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
multiple colors now I've got to the end

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.909
