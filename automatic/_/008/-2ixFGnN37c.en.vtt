00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello girls welcome your biggest and 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.120
 consist of side 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.350
 although I have a somewhat different tutor 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.510
 and the truth is that I am very nice 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.720
 today and I bring many ideas from 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.480
 my head then taking advantage of that 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.400
 I have david that I have a chela and that 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.610
 I have many little things here that comprise 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.010
 and vice play I want to make them arrive is 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.580
 a great fun way that you're going to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.400
 obviously need to see that the 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.220
 makeup is with that super perfect 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.950
 but seeing it is something that if once we 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.780
 we wake up and the us that got desperate and you 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.120
 normal hair what is supporting 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.450
 well then that means that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.950
 you need a hair treatment 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.020
 what do I have right now and then 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.820
 of so much treatment and all though 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.530
 improved I always have to be 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.809
 putting treatments and I have to be 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.450
 going to the beauty salon but now you see 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.290
 I have an option for the house that you are going to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:14.360
 need you need treatments this is 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.360
 of grief and placenta 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:23.100
 This is macadamia powder to hydrate 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.530
 and then this one is also macadamia or 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.340
 me but this one is to give it shine in the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.990
 hair 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.780
 ay this is to restore it the first 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.910
 milestone that is taught that he was going to 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.560
 need a corrido like this that is 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.600
 all right 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.910
 and what we're going to do is that it's going to be 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.370
 that penetrates more the treatment that 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.590
 We are using on the hair and so 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.130
 you can have better results 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.440
 then they accompany the first one wetting us 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.410
 my little hair I bring it by encouraging 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.720
 more days and months already I dry up we are 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.030
 wet it if you can go out to bathe and 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.050
 wash your hair also that was what 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.050
 what I did a while ago 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:14.320
 and after this we are going to take 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.909
 a little dish and we're going to mix all 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.129
 our 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:24.390
 treatments remove them all all all 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:27.170
 all all all all all all 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.170
 everyone 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:47.670
 and it 's very good and very rich we're going to 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:49.290
 Take a little bit too, you do not have it 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.310
 than to throw all this in fact you can 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.840
 use nothing else with your hair dry 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.520
 You can also put it on and then 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.840
 comb what you normally do 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.840
 I'm going to mix like this 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.750
 and I think it's ready 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.160
 well then what is it that has its 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.220
 That's how the burrito is and 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.620
 then you have this tube that connects to 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.210
 your dryers and you just have to 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.240
 can do it 10 minutes or even 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.850
 ideal if you have tubes for hair 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.340
 you can put them on and cut them and these will 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.890
 You also put it to better grip the 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.290
 the tube and the curl and nothing else you need 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.470
 your dryers the only thing you need 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.420
 and this is what we are going to do there 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.040
 have to have it ready because after all 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.690
 absolutely hair to be able 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.340
 place it in its place and if nothing else 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.640
 get in running 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.640
 we start applying in all the hair 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.069
 and you're going to put the treatment on everything 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.049
 the hair and especially in the areas 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.610
 who have more dehydrated for example 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.430
 if you bring that look man like me 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.489
 then we will apply more in this 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.370
 area to be restored to 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:21.079
 return the brightness 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:22.790
 and how good I am ready to challenge the 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.370
 hair so that it will grip better so that 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.370
 do not leave let's apply the hat 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:36.280
 I'm going to apply it and you have to press it 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.280
 pretty good 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:45.940
 so it squeezes well what cool I see 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:49.900
 and remember that you must already be connected 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:52.900
 to your dryer so that they can already 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.620
 begin to dry it and it has to last 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.620
 10 minutes 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.830
 also if you have nothing to do 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:06.290
 while you are doing this you can 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.990
 it does away that there are flying its 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:12.070
 boyfriend also what may have to 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.070
 say elephant 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.730
 you have to assure it because if not 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.730
 fly out 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:31.420
 well after 10 minutes you leave it 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.050
 rest and without heat is your hair and 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.050
 ready 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.070
 i
