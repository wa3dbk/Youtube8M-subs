00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
work this case although you can easily

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.539 
work this case although you can easily
take<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:36.200> off<00:01:36.320> without<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:36.860> game<00:01:37.039> to<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.369> case

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
take it off without and game to the case

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.179 
take it off without and game to the case
on<00:01:37.909> the<00:01:38.390> back<00:01:38.570> leather<00:01:38.899> camera<00:01:39.289> hole<00:01:39.500> no<00:01:40.009> hope

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
on the back leather camera hole no hope

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.570 
on the back leather camera hole no hope
for<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.429> satellite<00:01:40.939> on<00:01:41.869> the<00:01:41.960> bottom<00:01:42.549> for<00:01:43.549> the

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
for the satellite on the bottom for the

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:46.020 
for the satellite on the bottom for the
loop<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:44.149> think<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.319> looks<00:01:45.350> like<00:01:45.590> it'll<00:01:45.770> work

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
loop I think it looks like it'll work

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.719 
loop I think it looks like it'll work
because<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:47.149> kind<00:01:47.299> of<00:01:47.330> lowers<00:01:47.630> it<00:01:47.840> down<00:01:50.560> mmm
