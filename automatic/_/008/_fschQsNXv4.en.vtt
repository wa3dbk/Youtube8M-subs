00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.710
 johnny cook and we are going to prepare a 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.929
 hot dog the easy way has several 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.639
 ways to make hot dogs more 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.590
 I'm going to show you a very practical way today. 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.269
 and easy and fast and you prepare with 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.880
 they will hit us before 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.189
 so personal but you have only be 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.970
 Hot dog here she is. 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.220
 I recommend you reveal before with water 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 up there in tea and drop all the dye 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.820
 all preservatives it will separate the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.890
 water you draw water and you will only leave 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.920
 leave the track 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.899
 taking it before you prepare you 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.719
 warm the water and come back only inside 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.329
 lets show you how leaves 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:46.110
 water after boiling the hot dog 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:49.230
 not wanting to see the hot dog in the water 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.410
 when I wake up with the coloring of the water I think 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.440
 who will enjoy yellow and are the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.780
 preservatives that have nothing like dog 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.510
 hot sauce to make the sauce 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.710
 cup tomato extract if you use 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.769
 tomato paste 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.350
 Do you use a cup and a half will you need it? 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.260
 also to be good at half a onion 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.330
 grated or half onion sliced 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.670
 The way you're making it taste great. 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.830
 onion flavor so I drain is the taste 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.780
 it does not give consistency I love the taste 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.740
 onion more consistency not liking 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.979
 of a well - stocked spoon of stock 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.180
 exact butter salt and pepper 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.900
 August 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.000
 This is hot pepper I 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.549
 I recommend you do not dilate it with 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.340
 firm you do not wear it if you 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.829
 to like you do you need also fordow 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.659
 the average laurel leaves or a large 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.659
 this question is actually two means 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.970
 what a great break and an average that 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.340
 there and also a glass of water more or 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.920
 less will depend on your own 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.350
 I like it very far . 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.490
 I do not expect any better consistency 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.469
 but I will show 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.729
 I'm going to use more or less of a medium. 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.710
 cup to a glass 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.960
 let's go then the people there the water already 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.200
 It's distant phenom I'm going to put this 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.080
 I'm just fixing this, you put the 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.459
 medium oven bake butter 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.810
 butter to melt 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.030
 So guys when the butter starts to 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.750
 paint that even she'll start to 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.230
 to paint 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.200
 You go there and play the onion plays fast 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.040
 play soccer so be careful not to 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.760
 subtle splashing is very hot leaves to 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.010
 onion the double onion start the 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.930
 brown very well 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.670
 You'll play the extract me guys. 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.980
 forgive me that you are in the middle of the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.150
 process when the onion has started 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.430
 to brown 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.550
 I forgot to speak at the beginning of the recipe 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.660
 only one tablet of beef broth 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.910
 so this car home work 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.660
 can be chicken what you cold or 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.980
 car 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.640
 then you throw a stick of broth 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.100
 meat and knead it as well 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.180
 I think it's a good idea to break a 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:04.319
 a little 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:06.360
 already mass and mix with being good if 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:11.519
 mix the meat stock thoroughly 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:15.480
 to be good and when she starts to 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.519
 Rain is just beginning to love more 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.579
 or less she 's more or less pain year 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.530
 let me see the year senator when she 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.530
 starts when she has improved 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.810
 you throw extract extract or pulp 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.209
 beauty tomato began to cry 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.739
 I also love going to have to play their 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:37.980
 cup tomato paste or the pulp 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.430
 Tomatoes as you prefer a kick of 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.600
 I gave up all the chic from here that became 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.720
 a little cup 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.850
 I will never waste anything in the kitchen 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.570
 from here you get a 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.430
 little water 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:53.810
 A little bit of water was left in the 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.760
 panela just a little bit just for the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.200
 strategy extract a little more dense 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.340
 then you are good you use water to 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.380
 just a little 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.709
 You're leaving a little bit here. 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.799
 on average brandÃ³n fire had more or 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.980
 less then when the damage I 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.760
 already getting hot enough already 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.910
 they started to look 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.770
 Boil, are you going to play? 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:27.310
 the salt I use more or less is a uh-12 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:29.530
 So, you see here I think it gives a 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.310
 teaspoon of salt 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:35.080
 Boto more or less, this is preferably 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.080
 Thank God I got nothing to worry about. 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.419
 pressure that I did not check once 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.080
 like hot dog ever and food 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:49.570
 who started out with more good boots that spoon 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:52.600
 of salt and boot the hot dog put 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.419
 the hot dog this sauce is a few years old 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.400
 hot dog only how it looks good 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:05:01.449
 distributed sauce will still throw water 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.229
 but until you hit the water well 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.580
 here o 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:09.220
 the bay leaves the bay leaves 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:13.110
 I will also put more or less the same 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:19.389
 amount of black pepper 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:20.979
 half a cup of tea and I like 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:25.810
 Calabrian pepper to vote only one 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:33.610
 bit puts up a 200 ml beaker more 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:37.270
 200 non or less cml 100 ml of water 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.710
 only to cover the dog still not a 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:45.280
 hot dog the dog sausage 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:48.610
 Hot you lid and let some more 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.949
 10 minutes to watch is to catch the taste 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.979
 of the hill and that's it people are ready 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:57.729

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:59.710
 15 minutes - a little more here 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:01.900
 consistency of sauce that I like 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:06.430
 I would like to be a little bit not so much. 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:08.860
 rare but also not very thick 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.229
 if you like him more 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.070
 Thicker it's only the time you have to 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.349
 observe 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:16.600
 Leave the ten minutes if you want 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.580
 he is right there 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.590
 Thick sacrifice can go about 15 minutes 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.510
 a little more 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:24.880
