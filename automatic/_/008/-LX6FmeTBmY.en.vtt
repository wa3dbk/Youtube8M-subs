00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
is moving on to envy and I'm wondering

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.640 
is moving on to envy and I'm wondering
if<00:02:13.659> they'll<00:02:13.780> move<00:02:13.989> into<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.290> team<00:02:14.470> house

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
if they'll move into the team house

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.289 
if they'll move into the team house
there<00:02:14.890> because<00:02:15.250> they<00:02:15.370> they<00:02:15.640> all<00:02:15.760> have<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> team

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
there because they they all have a team

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.899 
there because they they all have a team
house<00:02:16.480> so<00:02:16.810> he<00:02:17.290> might<00:02:17.470> move<00:02:17.739> into<00:02:18.040> another<00:02:18.489> team

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
house so he might move into another team

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.880 
house so he might move into another team
house<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.390> know<00:02:19.450> what<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.599> mean<00:02:19.629> and<00:02:19.989> he<00:02:20.709> might
