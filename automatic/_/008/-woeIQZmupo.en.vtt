 hello escape welcome back to me 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.690
 Youtube channel today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:13.969
 how I made this mini album for it 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:16.009
 we need 7 photos of 10 x 7.5 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.410
 centimeters I in this case link 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.620
 printed with the white border but that 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:26.320
 you can do it to your liking 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:29.439
 you also need a metal clamp 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.510
 a piece of wood 20 x 15 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.870
 centimeters that you can replace it with 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.200
 a piece of cardboard that you can paint 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.480
 or put a piece of paper this and this 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.950
 you can find it in an 'all a hundred' 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.800
 I bought it in an 'all a hundred' 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.280
 ok but if I do not already tell you this 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.360
 you can replace with a piece of cardboard 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.930
 and then you need 5 sheets of paper that 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.450
 measure 14 centimeters by 19 centimeters 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.300
 it's worth 14 for 19 and 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.720
 to two centimeters mark to fold 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.170
 so that we make the game like this is worth two 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.740
 centimeters we mark 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.470
 then once I have the leaves 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.320
 cut what I have to do is 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.729
 decorating leaf by leaf is worth what I have 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.700
 fact has been decorating on each sheet with 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.020
 a photo or several and some title and 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.020
 adornment look 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.310
 once I have it decorated 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:40.060
 simply 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:44.860
 we have it we stick it in the woods 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.580
 and we hold it with the clamp and so 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.670
 we would have ready in our mini album 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.980
 ok that's a very simple option and 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.950
 very showy since in addition then if it came 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.270
 album with this clip we can hang it and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.040
 It is ideal to make a special gift 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.440
 I hope you liked the idea if you 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.250
