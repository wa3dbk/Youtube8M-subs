frozen desserts aren't only just about

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:11.589 
frozen desserts aren't only just about
ice<00:00:08.809> cream<00:00:09.020> sorbet<00:00:09.620> frozen<00:00:10.519> yogurt<00:00:10.849> gelato<00:00:11.150> as

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:11.599 
ice cream sorbet frozen yogurt gelato as

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:13.720 
ice cream sorbet frozen yogurt gelato as
well<00:00:11.780> so<00:00:12.530> what<00:00:12.740> we've<00:00:12.860> done<00:00:13.040> is<00:00:13.250> developed<00:00:13.670> a

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
well so what we've done is developed a

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.520 
well so what we've done is developed a
machine<00:00:13.880> that<00:00:14.269> understands<00:00:14.809> how<00:00:15.080> hardly

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
machine that understands how hardly

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.160 
machine that understands how hardly
contents<00:00:16.219> is<00:00:16.369> so<00:00:16.939> for<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:17.240> user<00:00:17.480> all<00:00:17.779> you<00:00:17.990> need

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:18.170 
contents is so for the user all you need

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.830 
contents is so for the user all you need
to<00:00:18.289> dial<00:00:18.500> up<00:00:18.710> is<00:00:19.699> how<00:00:19.970> hard<00:00:20.240> you'd<00:00:20.480> like<00:00:20.630> your

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
to dial up is how hard you'd like your

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.410 
to dial up is how hard you'd like your
ice<00:00:20.960> cream<00:00:21.230> frozen<00:00:21.800> yogurt<00:00:22.340> press<00:00:23.000> go<00:00:23.180> and<00:00:23.359> the

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
ice cream frozen yogurt press go and the

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.490 
ice cream frozen yogurt press go and the
Machine<00:00:23.720> does<00:00:23.900> the<00:00:23.930> rest

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
Machine does the rest

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.710 
Machine does the rest
so<00:00:24.980> as<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.340> Machine<00:00:25.670> understands<00:00:26.269> how<00:00:26.449> hard

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
so as the Machine understands how hard

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.140 
so as the Machine understands how hard
the<00:00:26.840> contents<00:00:27.410> is<00:00:27.560> once<00:00:28.279> it's<00:00:28.490> there<00:00:28.550> it

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
the contents is once it's there it

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.419 
the contents is once it's there it
simply<00:00:29.570> turns<00:00:29.779> itself<00:00:30.019> off<00:00:30.230> it's<00:00:31.099> got<00:00:31.279> some

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429 
simply turns itself off it's got some

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:33.640 
simply turns itself off it's got some
great<00:00:31.550> features<00:00:31.670> as<00:00:32.150> well<00:00:32.330> we've<00:00:33.019> got<00:00:33.230> a<00:00:33.410> keep

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
great features as well we've got a keep

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.250 
great features as well we've got a keep
cool<00:00:34.010> feature<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:35.120> once<00:00:35.390> it's<00:00:35.600> ready<00:00:35.780> every

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
cool feature so once it's ready every

cool feature so once it's ready every
three<00:00:36.500> minutes<00:00:36.649> that<00:00:36.950> paddle<00:00:37.370> turns<00:00:37.640> again

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
three minutes that paddle turns again

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.729 
three minutes that paddle turns again
and<00:00:38.000> understands<00:00:38.750> if<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.079> ice<00:00:39.290> cream<00:00:39.559> has<00:00:39.649> got

and understands if the ice cream has got

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.740 
and understands if the ice cream has got
a<00:00:39.770> little<00:00:40.040> bit<00:00:40.160> softer<00:00:40.610> compress<00:00:41.420> it<00:00:41.570> kicks

a little bit softer compress it kicks

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.299 
a little bit softer compress it kicks
back<00:00:41.809> in<00:00:42.110> again<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:42.500> gets<00:00:42.649> it<00:00:42.800> back<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.160> where

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
back in again and gets it back to where

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.799 
back in again and gets it back to where
you<00:00:43.520> chose<00:00:43.790> it<00:00:43.969> to<00:00:44.000> be<00:00:44.180> in<00:00:44.270> the<00:00:44.329> first<00:00:44.480> place

you chose it to be in the first place
we've<00:00:45.620> also<00:00:45.860> got<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:46.190> pre<00:00:46.520> cool<00:00:46.760> function<00:00:47.180> so

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
we've also got a pre cool function so

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.450 
we've also got a pre cool function so
before<00:00:48.110> starting<00:00:48.590> your<00:00:48.739> ice<00:00:48.829> cream<00:00:49.070> process

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
you can call the Machine right down to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.020 
you can call the Machine right down to
its<00:00:51.140> optimum<00:00:51.530> starting<00:00:51.950> temperature<00:00:52.370> it<00:00:52.789> just

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
its optimum starting temperature it just

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.000 
its optimum starting temperature it just
makes<00:00:53.270> the<00:00:53.420> whole<00:00:53.449> process<00:00:53.600> quicker<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:54.680> the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
makes the whole process quicker and the

we'll simply dial the ice cream machine

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.890 
we'll simply dial the ice cream machine
up<00:01:15.380> to<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.920> ice<00:01:16.040> cream<00:01:16.310> setting<00:01:16.720> we're<00:01:17.720> going

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
up to the ice cream setting we're going

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.010 
up to the ice cream setting we're going
to<00:01:18.490> tip<00:01:19.490> in<00:01:19.700> a<00:01:19.880> glass<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:20.270> a<00:01:20.330> half<00:01:20.420> of<00:01:20.600> milk<00:01:21.909> and

so<00:01:36.680> what's<00:01:36.800> happening<00:01:37.070> now<00:01:37.130> is<00:01:37.400> your<00:01:37.520> ice

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
so what's happening now is your ice

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.700 
so what's happening now is your ice
cream<00:01:37.850> machine<00:01:38.150> is<00:01:38.180> chilling<00:01:38.690> down<00:01:38.870> and<00:01:39.380> that

paddle<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.190> going<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.400> continuously<00:01:40.909> turn

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
paddle is going to continuously turn

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.120 
paddle is going to continuously turn
scraping<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.080> ice<00:01:42.110> cream<00:01:42.440> crystals<00:01:42.920> off<00:01:43.040> the
