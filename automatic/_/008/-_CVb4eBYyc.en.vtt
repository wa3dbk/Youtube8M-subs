00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:26.790 
base for the xbox 360 I don't know the

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.750 
base for the xbox 360 I don't know the
exact<00:00:27.330> model<00:00:27.960> name<00:00:28.380> but<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.770> is<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.220> the

exact model name but this is that the
newer<00:00:29.940> one<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.570> have<00:00:30.930> the<00:00:31.110> white<00:00:31.260> one<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.800> was

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
newer one I have the white one that was

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.910 
newer one I have the white one that was
previous<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.669> this<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:32.850> work<00:00:33.809> great<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.440> I

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
previous to this one work great but I

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.549 
previous to this one work great but I
decide<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.520> upgrade<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:36.570> this<00:00:36.720> so<00:00:36.989> matches<00:00:37.440> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
decide to upgrade to this so matches the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.619 
decide to upgrade to this so matches the
controllers<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.250> know<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.550> silly<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:38.940> that's

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
controllers I know it's silly but that's

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.689 
controllers I know it's silly but that's
just<00:00:39.900> the<00:00:40.050> way<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.680> also<00:00:41.250> the

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
just the way it is and also the

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.619 
just the way it is and also the
intercooler<00:00:42.420> FPS<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.650> xbox<00:00:44.129> 360<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:45.510> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
intercooler FPS for the xbox 360 that is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.780 
intercooler FPS for the xbox 360 that is
off<00:00:45.809> camera<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.650> I<00:00:46.980> cannot<00:00:47.280> fit<00:00:47.580> all

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
off camera because I cannot fit all

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.710 
off camera because I cannot fit all
three<00:00:48.030> things<00:00:48.390> with<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> 360<00:00:49.610> in<00:00:50.610> one<00:00:51.269> camera

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
three things with the 360 in one camera

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.090 
three things with the 360 in one camera
view<00:00:51.900> so<00:00:52.110> we're<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.440> go<00:00:52.470> with<00:00:52.559> chargers

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
view so we're going to go with chargers

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.049 
view so we're going to go with chargers
then<00:00:53.339> we're<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.580> to<00:00:53.670> go<00:00:53.790> with<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
then we're going to go with the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.530 
then we're going to go with the
intercooler<00:00:54.570> sts<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:56.250> first<00:00:56.699> things<00:00:56.909> first<00:00:57.000> is

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
intercooler sts so first things first is

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.160 
intercooler sts so first things first is
the<00:00:57.720> xbox<00:00:58.050> 360<00:00:58.890> charge<00:00:59.250> base<00:00:59.570> this<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:00.870> is

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
the xbox 360 charge base this one is

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.350 
the xbox 360 charge base this one is
really<00:01:01.350> cool<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:01.860> for<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.729> price<00:01:03.000> which

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
really cool because for the price which

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.760 
really cool because for the price which
is<00:01:03.390> 3299<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:05.220> get<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:06.030> batteries<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:07.500> each

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
is 3299 you get the batteries for each

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.480 
is 3299 you get the batteries for each
controller<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.350> I<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.740> fact<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:11.250> when

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
controller and I like the fact that when

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.270 
controller and I like the fact that when
you<00:01:11.720> through<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> head<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.740> take<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.189> off

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
you through the head and take it off

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.880 
you through the head and take it off
again<00:01:14.399> you<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.149> charger<00:01:16.049> one<00:01:16.229> charger<00:01:16.649> two

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
again you see charger one charger two

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.760 
again you see charger one charger two
shows<00:01:17.549> which<00:01:17.969> Chargers<00:01:18.539> are<00:01:18.869> charging<00:01:19.590> and

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
shows which Chargers are charging and

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
shows which Chargers are charging and
you<00:01:20.130> can<00:01:20.280> see<00:01:20.430> now<00:01:20.579> they<00:01:20.759> are<00:01:20.880> fully<00:01:21.149> charged

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
you can see now they are fully charged

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.969 
you can see now they are fully charged
lights<00:01:22.380> out<00:01:22.939> 3299<00:01:24.049> very<00:01:25.049> good<00:01:25.259> bye<00:01:25.439> always

lights out 3299 very good bye always

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.370 
lights out 3299 very good bye always
recommend<00:01:26.430> having<00:01:26.640> these<00:01:27.210> types<00:01:28.079> of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
recommend having these types of

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.190 
recommend having these types of
batteries<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.490> charged<00:01:29.939> basis<00:01:30.479> for<00:01:31.079> your

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
batteries and charged basis for your

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.249 
batteries and charged basis for your
controllers<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:32.490> that's<00:01:32.939> cold<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.719> get<00:01:33.990> down

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
controllers now that's cold you get down

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.950 
controllers now that's cold you get down
the<00:01:34.409> way<00:01:34.530> real<00:01:34.770> quick<00:01:35.299> the<00:01:36.299> charge<00:01:36.659> beats

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
the way real quick the charge beats

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.399 
the way real quick the charge beats
three<00:01:37.469> for<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.250> ps3<00:01:38.810> which<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.929> do<00:01:39.990> not<00:01:40.079> have

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
three for the ps3 which I do not have

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.899 
three for the ps3 which I do not have
yet<00:01:40.679> that's<00:01:40.859> why<00:01:40.920> there's<00:01:41.159> no<00:01:41.280> controllers<00:01:41.759> in

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
yet that's why there's no controllers in

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.359 
yet that's why there's no controllers in
there<00:01:42.060> right<00:01:42.240> now<00:01:42.479> is<00:01:42.859> actually<00:01:43.859> one<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
there right now is actually one that I

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.179 
there right now is actually one that I
prefer<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.090> got<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.299> smaller<00:01:45.630> footprint<00:01:46.350> than

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
prefer it's got a smaller footprint than

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.260 
prefer it's got a smaller footprint than
the<00:01:47.609> charge<00:01:47.909> base<00:01:48.270> for<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.380> xbox<00:01:49.770> 360<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.700> like

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
the charge base for the xbox 360 I like

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.569 
the charge base for the xbox 360 I like
the<00:01:51.450> fact<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:52.079> has<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.640> really<00:01:55.189> cool<00:01:56.189> stand

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the fact that it has a really cool stand

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.239 
the fact that it has a really cool stand
that<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.820> fold<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.479> like<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:58.439> then

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.249 
that can fold up just like that and then

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:01.459 
that can fold up just like that and then
go<00:01:59.399> back<00:01:59.520> like<00:01:59.729> that<00:01:59.999> now<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.749> unique<00:02:01.200> thing

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
go back like that now the unique thing

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.399 
go back like that now the unique thing
about<00:02:01.499> this<00:02:01.890> to<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.429> can<00:02:02.549> see<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.969> has<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:04.380> USB

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
about this to you can see it has the USB

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.520 
about this to you can see it has the USB
the<00:02:05.100> mini<00:02:05.310> USB<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.109> edge<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.380> the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
the mini USB that is on the edge of the

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.080 
the mini USB that is on the edge of the
controller<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.160> plug<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.520> controller<00:02:08.850> in

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
controller so you plug the controller in

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.000 
controller so you plug the controller in
like<00:02:09.899> that<00:02:10.229> now<00:02:10.830> what's<00:02:11.039> cool<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:12.450> can<00:02:12.480> see

like that now what's cool is you can see

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.730 
like that now what's cool is you can see
there's<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.100> little<00:02:15.319> connector<00:02:16.319> right<00:02:16.470> there

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
there's a little connector right there

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.160
