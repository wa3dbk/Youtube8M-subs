game its outrun to outrun - SP and coast
to<00:01:11.860> coast<00:01:12.240> basically<00:01:13.240> it's<00:01:13.390> just<00:01:13.450> a<00:01:13.750> massive

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
to coast basically it's just a massive

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.480 
to coast basically it's just a massive
blend<00:01:14.800> of<00:01:15.039> outrun<00:01:15.640> and<00:01:15.880> it<00:01:16.420> works<00:01:16.690> really<00:01:17.080> well

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
it's got the odd drifting around the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.840 
it's got the odd drifting around the
corners<00:01:20.649> thing<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.039> I<00:01:21.130> don't<00:01:21.190> really<00:01:21.670> care

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
corners thing that I don't really care

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.940
