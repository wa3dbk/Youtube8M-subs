let's see that's the key that's the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.860 
let's see that's the key that's the
stuff<00:00:40.170> I'm<00:00:40.290> easily<00:00:40.559> I'm<00:00:40.680> also<00:00:40.800> using<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
stuff I'm easily I'm also using a

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.540 
stuff I'm easily I'm also using a
slightly<00:00:42.870> different<00:00:43.320> version<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.430> I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
slightly different version of it which I

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.049 
slightly different version of it which I
think<00:00:44.760> it's<00:00:44.910> just<00:00:45.120> newer<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.399> usually<00:00:47.850> use

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
think it's just newer so I usually use

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.220 
think it's just newer so I usually use
that<00:00:48.329> as<00:00:48.420> well<00:00:50.660> two<00:00:51.660> things<00:00:51.690> you're<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.110> to

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.870 
one that burns the back also seems to be
a<00:02:27.980> spot<00:02:28.340> where<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.640> they<00:02:28.910> leak<00:02:30.370> it<00:02:31.370> seems<00:02:31.790> to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
a spot where you they leak it seems to

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.660

come in to heal for some reason and I

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.729 
come in to heal for some reason and I
imagine<00:02:35.209> it's<00:02:35.360> because<00:02:35.780> that's<00:02:36.230> how<00:02:36.440> you<00:02:36.500> pull

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
imagine it's because that's how you pull

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.160

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
the bottom so really just cram it in

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.340 
the bottom so really just cram it in
there<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.549> little<00:02:44.390> bit<00:02:44.630> of<00:02:44.690> pressure<00:02:44.959> on<00:02:45.170> the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
there a little bit of pressure on the

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.470 
there a little bit of pressure on the
brush<00:02:45.769> and<00:02:45.830> just<00:02:46.160> get<00:02:46.459> it<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.870> just<00:02:47.870> push<00:02:48.170> on<00:02:48.470> it

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480
