the very well yeah let's want it very
well<00:03:25.380> and<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.650> was<00:03:25.799> you<00:03:26.010> know<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.160> very<00:03:26.790> small

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
well and that was you know a very small

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.430 
well and that was you know a very small
film<00:03:27.329> but<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.630> actually<00:03:27.750> did<00:03:27.989> well<00:03:28.140> made<00:03:28.290> a<00:03:28.319> lot

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
I think it'd be a beautiful thing it

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.110 
I think it'd be a beautiful thing it
doesn't<00:03:32.130> have<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.430> think<00:03:32.579> we<00:03:32.700> put<00:03:32.819> that<00:03:32.940> dollar

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
is great when it's interpreted and

that's a movie that was also artistic
and<00:03:56.010> experimental<00:03:56.700> but<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:56.970> cost<00:03:57.209> millions

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
and experimental but it cost millions

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.840 
and experimental but it cost millions
and<00:03:58.440> millions<00:03:58.470> of<00:03:58.889> dollars<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.459> didn't<00:03:59.700> make

that money back henceforth business

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.460 
that money back henceforth business

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
equals meeting art at a failure point I

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.920 
equals meeting art at a failure point I
like<00:04:04.920> to<00:04:05.069> know<00:04:05.190> a<00:04:05.220> lot<00:04:05.579> but<00:04:06.239> if<00:04:06.510> I<00:04:06.660> was<00:04:06.810> the

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
like to know a lot but if I was the

like to know a lot but if I was the
person<00:04:07.109> who<00:04:07.260> put<00:04:07.470> all<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.709> money<00:04:07.769> and<00:04:08.160> I'd<00:04:08.310> be

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
person who put all that money and I'd be

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.890 
person who put all that money and I'd be
really<00:04:08.670> pissed<00:04:08.790> because<00:04:09.209> I<00:04:09.329> would<00:04:09.569> have<00:04:09.630> now

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
really pissed because I would have now

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.300 
really pissed because I would have now
been<00:04:10.079> bankrupt<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:10.739> it's<00:04:10.889> sort<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.100> one<00:04:11.220> of

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
been bankrupt so it's sort of one of

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.220 
been bankrupt so it's sort of one of
those<00:04:11.400> things<00:04:11.609> where<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:12.480> know<00:04:12.510> if<00:04:12.900> you're

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
those things where you know if you're

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.229 
those things where you know if you're
making<00:04:13.590> an<00:04:13.709> artistic<00:04:14.190> venture<00:04:14.579> you<00:04:15.000> have<00:04:15.120> to

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
making an artistic venture you have to

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.610 
making an artistic venture you have to
be<00:04:15.359> able<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.630> make<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:15.810> for<00:04:16.049> less<00:04:16.590> money

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
be able to make it for less money

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.490 
be able to make it for less money
because<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.370> might<00:04:17.549> not<00:04:17.729> be<00:04:17.789> as<00:04:18.269> smooth<00:04:19.049> and

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
because it might not be as smooth and

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.680 
because it might not be as smooth and
homogenized<00:04:20.370> as<00:04:20.640> a<00:04:20.669> lot<00:04:20.880> of<00:04:20.970> other<00:04:21.120> larger

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
homogenized as a lot of other larger

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.150 
homogenized as a lot of other larger
films<00:04:22.049> are<00:04:22.229> and<00:04:22.680> hamad

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
films are and hamad

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.550 
films are and hamad
not<00:04:23.670> in<00:04:23.850> a<00:04:23.940> bad<00:04:24.180> term<00:04:24.570> it's<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.900> way<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.290> so

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
not in a bad term it's a way that so

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.710 
not in a bad term it's a way that so
that<00:04:25.740> most<00:04:26.220> more<00:04:26.670> people<00:04:27.060> can<00:04:27.210> see<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.570> as

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
that most more people can see it as

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.870 
that most more people can see it as
opposed<00:04:28.050> to<00:04:28.200> a<00:04:28.380> selective<00:04:29.190> group<00:04:29.220> of<00:04:29.580> people

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
opposed to a selective group of people

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.300 
opposed to a selective group of people
so<00:04:30.030> if<00:04:30.150> you're<00:04:30.360> targeting<00:04:31.050> a<00:04:31.530> selective<00:04:32.280> group

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
so if you're targeting a selective group

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.370 
so if you're targeting a selective group
of<00:04:32.640> people<00:04:33.030> you<00:04:33.240> can<00:04:33.600> be<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.870> little<00:04:34.050> bit<00:04:34.230> more

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
of people you can be a little bit more

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.900 
of people you can be a little bit more
experimental<00:04:34.920> you<00:04:35.010> could<00:04:35.160> take<00:04:35.340> more<00:04:35.520> risks

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
experimental you could take more risks

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.120 
experimental you could take more risks
and<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.510> as<00:04:36.990> long<00:04:37.230> as<00:04:37.290> it<00:04:37.440> doesn't<00:04:37.590> take<00:04:37.920> as

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
and you as long as it doesn't take as

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.980 
and you as long as it doesn't take as
much<00:04:38.160> money<00:04:38.340> because<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.030> way<00:04:39.180> that<00:04:39.810> these

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
much money because the way that these

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.620 
much money because the way that these
bit<00:04:40.950> movies<00:04:41.400> and<00:04:41.700> television<00:04:42.150> all

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
bit movies and television all
