00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.740
 I am from quality brands and I want to 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.130
 join us today 2015 quÃ©bec products close 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.820
 imagine 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.260
 this the camel beck logo 2015 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.779
 while the logo has always been so far 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 a pure drinking system with three liters 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.279
 was and a bit of space for tooling 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.740
 or small stuff had that is already 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.950
 a real backpack with six liters 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.850
 volume plus 3 liters of drinking volume so 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.650
 about what the mule used to have 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.720
 the volume is as follows 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.520
 split that means I have one once 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.590
 big main subject where I too 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.900
 reservoir think that means I can 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.460
 reeser was filling it without it 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.500
 to take a backpack out 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.120
 So I can fill it so here 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:01.500
 I also a big fold what down 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.900
 into it reaches one floor before that I have 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.840
 a big fold what also down 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.200
 enough where I for example jersey or 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.560
 a pump or something like that 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.240
 can pack in during the ride 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.160
 between the small compartment in front and the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.770
 main subject I have an open subject here 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.980
 what for example a raincape or 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.030
 similar things are suitable that we 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.040
 need a bit of air 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.920
 maybe I can not therefore here 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.180
 it is superfluous in the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.370
 other subjects in the small forward 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.200
 that is very well organized that is 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.770
 I have a holder for one here 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.480
 key 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.060
 that means the key is not 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.840
 Lost when I got to this 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.130
 Fach ran 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.490
 and here i can for example 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.810
 various tools tire lift pumps 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.560
 Replacement hose and such things 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.560
 accommodate 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.000
 if you turn the backpack rom then 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.380
 you can see that the logo and a lot 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.840
 high quality back system has that is 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.330
 the new axiom system that is called here 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.599
 Air can circulate between them 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.180
 individual pads and these petz fit 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.380
 ideal the spine shape to the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:21.850
 Carrier of the logo are very ergonomic 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:25.310
 Shaped and own one at height 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.650
 adjustable chest strap and this is 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.590
 Also something with a rubber band 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.760
 stored so I do not breathe 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.239
 get in trouble 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.920
 below I have a hip belt who without 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.209
 Waist belt can ride this too 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.360
 easy removal, without being on the go 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.880
 a new feature for 2015 is the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.980
 new bracket for the hose during 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.319
 the hose always used to be in one 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.360
 brace was plastered you have that now 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.769
 again overworked that means here is 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.170
 a magnetic lock i can 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.600
 just pull out the hose and 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.130
 put back from above or else 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.470
 from the side of actually finds 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:09.350
 Already his goal is the logo 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.600
 There are four colors in black in there 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.030
 this strong blue and orange and in 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.370
 a special color that is 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.780
 divided into two, that means a page is joe 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.609
 kaeser on the other side a whole 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.970
 dark gray so an asymmetric 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.970
 design
