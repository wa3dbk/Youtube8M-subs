00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.500
 between invoking satan and speaking with voice 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.919

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.189
 medium of a few new sounds 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.260
 some of them are cool to me but this is 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.780
 like a bit of and the one click click click 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.480

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.690
 Macedonian and a new one if they do not change in 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.640
 no nomad I think this would be 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.800
 quite interesting because neither 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.539
 I want them to have enough troops 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.460
 projectiles or good troops dependent 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.740
 like to back out and I think that 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.899
 It will be a little short 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:16.329
 32 good hello hello long friend here that 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.549
 could come to comment the case is that 

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:20.649
 we are in the battle of two for two already 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.420
 we are on the subject we are not going to try 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:25.149
 that you face the ground and I the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.220
 Macedonian yes please would be the best 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.150
 although you against the Macedonian may 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.230
 go fuck a little 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.720
 I do not worry about the Macedonian is that 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.270
 clear Macedonians with spades against you that 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.550
 has no explanations can help a little 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:47.220
 chivalry 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:49.590

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.670
 medium also to the right moves me 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.200
 to the right and if it is in the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.480
 left I go to the left 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.150
 If my floor does not put all the center I 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.600
 as I vote cavalry and until it's worth 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.790
 as well 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.150
 although for micro management 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.150
 my two flanks 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.340
 of the last 34 battles haha with the 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.380
 studies that was changed that so 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.390
 unless you get rando or something uncle 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.510
 it's a very map 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.180
 familiar people like it and you make it 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.069
 thinking about them is all thought is 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.319

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.170
 it's good that you want to go that is and I 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.120
 and then I already position myself to start will vary 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.940
 we are going to promote and absolute dad everything is 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:48.780

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.220
 as why why all my cavalry to 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.100
 good because your chivalry your grandson does not 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.360

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.700
 the c2 was missing with the sweet ones that as 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:07.180
 send messages per team this is one 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:14.370
 It is the honor power is that people 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.370
 that people say that we find 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.300
 fast air everything there is of everything there is some 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.370
 that controls better than another being some 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.160
 pull cables to everything all everything 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.680
 question as to the cables not the 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.870
 exercise but it gives me all the fear of 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.140
 what do you say 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:35.120
 rage with and gives me in part 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.680
 but losses does not say of berna claudia 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.330
 to put in the video edition 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.150
 when to a to have a range music 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:47.250
 music 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.860
 let's see with this has a little 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.130
 Macedonian sure that comes as peros 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.320
 no it's not micro micro with aspis tell me 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.790
 economic with aspis roommates 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.610
 good peer cavalry does not come 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.610
 wrong with that and things are better 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.510

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.580

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.730
 easy for the Macedonians seriously you or 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.019
 you are Macedonian you get 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.299
 swordsmen with hearts to catch you 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:24.620
 of the neck and hit him uncle but against 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.540
 table is the same as you had left if you 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.790
 There was no need for four Uncle units to come 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.350
 this one is a leftover that has been 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:35.720
 caught the Brno stellar who has those 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.400
 throwing us shit what's that if it's the 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.919
 The first thing I see, are fucking stones in 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.810
 the ground or afterwards they did it to us 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.910
 several times but what are these 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.870
 low stones of the cavalry to the 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.310
 chivalry are the agrarias ajÃ¡ vale 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.930

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.910
 breakdown will bother you is not for nothing 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.290

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.930

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.350
 jump this man has complex of 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.350
 goalkeeper 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:05.130
 2 seen the ground in such a way that it is 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.540
 as easy as jumping all the time 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.420
 to turn around then I remove the 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:13.800
 ground is true uncle are all archers 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:14.940
 balistas and taltal supports but does not have and 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.880
 your elite units 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.930
 but leave the game seriously so 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:25.710
 soon but he starts to camp and abandons 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.260
 the game but why why 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:33.230
 that is, if he can not do anything 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.230
 Come on uncle, look better at the amia 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.230

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.610
 heavy arrows and with all this 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.550
 projectile cavalry that is that what 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.520
 you are going to flip are so many dioceses that go 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:49.819

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:54.400
 another ate I say that comes seriously 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.390
 first it would have been to victory and second 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.420
 you have the shortest battle of it 

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:10.380
 also the rosemary but what the fuck 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:13.600
