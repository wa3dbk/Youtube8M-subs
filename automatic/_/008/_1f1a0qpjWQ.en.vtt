Effects and you're losing your dissolves
a<00:00:21.960> quick<00:00:22.740> way<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.070> can<00:00:23.220> fix<00:00:23.460> that<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.850> to

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
a quick way that you can fix that is to

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.099 
a quick way that you can fix that is to
keyframe<00:00:25.769> that<00:00:25.800> dissolves<00:00:26.580> yourself<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.960> when

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
keyframe that dissolves yourself so when

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.240 
keyframe that dissolves yourself so when
you<00:00:28.199> bring<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> footage<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.920> what<00:00:29.099> should

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
you bring the footage in what should

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.460 
you bring the footage in what should
usually<00:00:29.550> happen<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.480> layers<00:00:30.689> will<00:00:30.929> get<00:00:31.050> up

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
usually happen is the layers will get up

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.229 
usually happen is the layers will get up
sort<00:00:31.949> of<00:00:32.040> stacked<00:00:32.489> over<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.820> top<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.149> each

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
sort of stacked over the top of each

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.490 
sort of stacked over the top of each
other<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.780> let<00:00:33.960> me<00:00:34.050> zoom<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.410> little

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
other like this let me zoom in a little

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.380 
other like this let me zoom in a little
bit<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.579> can<00:00:35.700> see<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.210> is

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
bit here and you can see that this is

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.520 
bit here and you can see that this is
you<00:00:36.690> know<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> layer<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.290> would<00:00:37.410> be

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
you know the layer that would be

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
you know the layer that would be
dissolving<00:00:38.010> into<00:00:38.190> this<00:00:38.370> layer<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.059> it's

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
dissolving into this layer here so it's

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.540 
dissolving into this layer here so it's
very<00:00:39.450> very<00:00:39.809> similar<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.950> old<00:00:40.980> way<00:00:41.340> in

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
very very similar to the old way in

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.580 
very very similar to the old way in
which<00:00:41.700> film<00:00:42.059> was<00:00:42.510> actually<00:00:42.989> blended<00:00:43.500> or

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
which film was actually blended or

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.619 
which film was actually blended or
actually<00:00:43.890> dissolved<00:00:44.489> from<00:00:44.730> one<00:00:45.090> clip<00:00:45.360> into

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
actually dissolved from one clip into

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.959 
actually dissolved from one clip into
another<00:00:45.809> clip<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.980> so<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:47.789> very

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
another clip and so we can do very

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.029 
another clip and so we can do very
quickly<00:00:48.239> here<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:49.440> can<00:00:49.590> go<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
quickly here is we can go to the

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.920 
quickly here is we can go to the
beginning<00:00:50.160> of<00:00:50.430> this<00:00:50.520> clip<00:00:50.730> by<00:00:50.969> hitting<00:00:51.180> AI<00:00:51.480> by

thing about this method of doing a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.990 
thing about this method of doing a
dissolve<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.159> select<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.549> clip<00:01:35.790> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
dissolve is if I select this clip and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.569 
dissolve is if I select this clip and
then<00:01:36.150> if<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.420> hit<00:01:36.570> command<00:01:37.020> shift<00:01:37.170> C<00:01:37.799> or<00:01:38.040> control

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
then if I hit command shift C or control

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.440 
then if I hit command shift C or control
shift<00:01:38.610> C<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.119> you're<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> PC<00:01:39.920> and<00:01:41.450> pre-comp

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
shift C if you're on a PC and pre-comp

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.630 
shift C if you're on a PC and pre-comp
that<00:01:42.630> as<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.869> test<00:01:43.170> you'll<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.490> my

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
that as a test you'll see that my

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.149 
that as a test you'll see that my
dissolve<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.180> still<00:01:45.390> there<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:45.960> now<00:01:46.159> even

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
dissolve is still there so now even

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.100 
dissolve is still there so now even
though<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.610> in<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.970> different<00:01:48.750> composition

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
though it's in a different composition

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.170 
though it's in a different composition
it<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.649> still<00:01:49.890> dissolving<00:01:50.430> from<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.880> layer

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
it is still dissolving from that layer

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.109 
it is still dissolving from that layer
into<00:01:52.079> this<00:01:52.229> layer<00:01:52.439> which<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.430> really<00:01:53.880> great

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
into this layer which is really great

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.719 
into this layer which is really great
and<00:01:54.360> makes<00:01:54.869> things<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.140> lot<00:01:55.259> easier<00:01:55.670> but<00:01:56.670> for

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
and makes things a lot easier but for

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.609 
and makes things a lot easier but for
those<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.479> who<00:01:57.689> aren't<00:01:57.930> using<00:01:58.110> color<00:01:58.409> gear

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
those of you who aren't using color gear

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.980 
those of you who aren't using color gear
or<00:01:58.770> don't<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.250> color<00:01:59.460> gear<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.990> color

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
or don't know what color gear is color

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.899 
or don't know what color gear is color
gear<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.350> system<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.950> invented<00:02:02.399> for

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
gear is a system that I invented for

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.289 
gear is a system that I invented for
Adobe<00:02:03.210> After<00:02:03.509> Effects<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.930> allows<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
Adobe After Effects that allows you to

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:08.570 
Adobe After Effects that allows you to
basically<00:02:06.299> turn<00:02:06.509> After<00:02:06.869> Effects<00:02:07.140> into<00:02:07.710> da

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
basically turn After Effects into da

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.960 
basically turn After Effects into da
Vinci<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:10.400> you<00:02:11.400> know<00:02:11.489> working<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
Vinci so you know working in the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.270 
Vinci so you know working in the
industry<00:02:12.330> as<00:02:12.450> a

industry as a
colourist<00:02:13.910> one<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.569> things<00:02:14.720> that<00:02:14.840> used<00:02:14.930> to

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
colourist one of the things that used to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.809 
colourist one of the things that used to
frustrate<00:02:15.260> me<00:02:15.560> was<00:02:15.770> that<00:02:15.950> it<00:02:16.490> was<00:02:16.640> that

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
frustrate me was that it was that

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.100 
frustrate me was that it was that
node-based<00:02:17.780> coloring<00:02:18.640> even<00:02:19.640> in<00:02:20.300> in<00:02:20.660> final

node-based coloring even in in final
cuts<00:02:21.319> color<00:02:21.650> program<00:02:22.640> just<00:02:23.390> really<00:02:23.630> wasn't

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
cuts color program just really wasn't

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.170 
cuts color program just really wasn't
real<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.130> wasn't<00:02:25.280> there<00:02:25.520> for<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.700> masses<00:02:26.060> he

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
real it wasn't there for the masses he

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.160 
real it wasn't there for the masses he
was<00:02:26.300> kind<00:02:26.480> of<00:02:26.540> had<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.720> know<00:02:26.840> what<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.050> were

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
was kind of had to know what you were

was kind of had to know what you were
doing<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.940> or<00:02:28.940> he<00:02:29.060> had<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.240> spend<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.660> know

thousands of dollars to get a system

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.540 
thousands of dollars to get a system
that<00:02:33.500> would<00:02:33.590> allow<00:02:33.739> you<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.950> do<00:02:34.069> professional

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
that would allow you to do professional

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.260 
that would allow you to do professional
grading<00:02:34.910> at<00:02:35.300> home<00:02:35.720> on<00:02:36.590> your<00:02:36.650> own<00:02:36.830> footage<00:02:37.270> and

grading at home on your own footage and

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
grading at home on your own footage and
for<00:02:38.600> some<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.870> us

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
for some of us

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.590 
for some of us
the<00:02:39.590> frustration<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.520> that<00:02:40.670> resolve<00:02:41.030> the

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
the frustration is is that resolve the

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.210 
the frustration is is that resolve the
free<00:02:41.810> version<00:02:42.170> it<00:02:42.500> doesn't<00:02:42.739> seem<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.980> want<00:02:43.130> to

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
free version it doesn't seem to want to

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.160 
free version it doesn't seem to want to
run<00:02:43.430> on<00:02:43.760> every<00:02:44.420> system<00:02:44.600> that's<00:02:44.900> out<00:02:45.020> there

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
run on every system that's out there

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.110 
run on every system that's out there
it's<00:02:45.320> kind<00:02:45.500> of<00:02:45.560> finicky<00:02:45.800> but<00:02:46.670> After<00:02:46.940> Effects

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
it's kind of finicky but After Effects

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.630 
it's kind of finicky but After Effects
will<00:02:47.269> run<00:02:47.420> on<00:02:47.540> almost<00:02:47.959> any<00:02:48.290> system<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.920> so

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
will run on almost any system and so

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.150 
will run on almost any system and so
color<00:02:49.880> gear<00:02:50.090> is<00:02:50.239> designed<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:51.590> basically<00:02:51.860> turn

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
color gear is designed to basically turn

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.449 
color gear is designed to basically turn
After<00:02:53.120> Effects<00:02:53.360> into<00:02:53.870> a<00:02:53.920> node-based<00:02:54.920> or

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
After Effects into a node-based or

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.729 
After Effects into a node-based or
modular<00:02:56.030> based<00:02:56.269> color<00:02:57.019> grading<00:02:57.290> system<00:02:57.560> and

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
modular based color grading system and

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.470 
modular based color grading system and
what<00:02:58.250> you<00:02:58.340> get<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:58.610> a<00:02:58.640> bunch<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.880> gears<00:02:59.120> like

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
what you get is a bunch of gears like

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.710 
what you get is a bunch of gears like
these<00:02:59.720> here<00:03:00.640> here's<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:02.090> tool<00:03:02.269> kit<00:03:02.480> as<00:03:02.600> it
