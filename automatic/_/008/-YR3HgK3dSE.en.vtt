00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.640 
somewhat to vary up a little bit but my
own<00:01:24.030> oya<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.450> long<00:01:24.869> as<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.110> comes<00:01:25.290> probably<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
own oya as long as it comes probably the

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.380 
own oya as long as it comes probably the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
best goalkeeper on the game and then

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.730 
best goalkeeper on the game and then
we're<00:01:27.479> gonna<00:01:27.570> lose<00:01:27.659> castaways<00:01:28.259> on<00:01:28.350> every

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
we're gonna lose castaways on every

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.870 
we're gonna lose castaways on every
single<00:01:28.979> one<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.130> our<00:01:29.220> school<00:01:29.490> boards<00:01:29.759> because

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
single one of our school boards because

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.060 
single one of our school boards because
he<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.360> damn<00:01:30.570> good<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.990> luckily<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.950> this

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
he is so damn good and luckily in this

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.649 
he is so damn good and luckily in this
team<00:01:32.280> he<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.299> gave<00:01:33.450> the

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
team he was the one that gave the

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.300 
team he was the one that gave the
chemistry<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> was<00:01:34.500> kind<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.799> get<00:01:34.950> lose<00:01:35.159> now

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
chemistry so I was kind of get lose now

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310 
chemistry so I was kind of get lose now
it's<00:01:35.460> like<00:01:35.549> an<00:01:35.670> excuse<00:01:36.180> maybe<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.960> actually

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
it's like an excuse maybe to actually

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.929 
it's like an excuse maybe to actually

the convo you annoyed that Liga do

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.839 
the convo you annoyed that Liga do
gone<00:02:14.200> or<00:02:14.409> do<00:02:14.769> you<00:02:14.829> think<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.129> kind<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.370> opens<00:02:15.730> up

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
gone or do you think it kind of opens up

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.360 
gone or do you think it kind of opens up
a<00:02:16.060> new<00:02:16.719> side<00:02:17.079> of<00:02:17.109> things<00:02:17.319> where<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:18.159> can

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
a new side of things where you can

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.800 
a new side of things where you can
potentially<00:02:18.700> get<00:02:18.879> the<00:02:19.030> Turkish<00:02:19.450> league<00:02:19.629> with

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
potentially get the Turkish league with

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.959 
potentially get the Turkish league with
Ukrainian<00:02:20.349> league<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.769> in<00:02:21.099> then<00:02:21.250> ones<00:02:21.489> we're

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:21.969 
Ukrainian league and in then ones we're

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.610 
Ukrainian league and in then ones we're
putting<00:02:22.299> get<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.450> lot<00:02:22.599> more<00:02:22.629> 5<00:02:22.959> star<00:02:23.200> ski<00:02:23.230> as<00:02:23.500> we

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
putting get a lot more 5 star ski as we

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.050 
putting get a lot more 5 star ski as we
actually<00:02:23.890> had<00:02:24.010> on<00:02:24.129> this<00:02:24.250> one<00:02:24.459> so<00:02:24.609> overall<00:02:25.000> I

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
actually had on this one so overall I

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.759 
actually had on this one so overall I
think<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.359> kind<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.569> a<00:02:25.689> decent<00:02:26.349> position<00:02:26.439> to

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
think it's kind of a decent position to

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.160 
think it's kind of a decent position to
be<00:02:26.920> in<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.129> hope<00:02:27.909> it<00:02:28.090> hopefully<00:02:28.689> they<00:02:29.109> do

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
be in and hope it hopefully they do

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.860 
be in and hope it hopefully they do
release<00:02:29.469> a<00:02:29.680> new<00:02:29.890> full<00:02:30.670> league<00:02:30.909> to<00:02:31.329> replace<00:02:31.629> it

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
release a new full league to replace it

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.599 
release a new full league to replace it
the<00:02:32.109> two<00:02:32.260> strikers<00:02:32.620> overhead<00:02:32.889> Lukaku<00:02:33.370> on<00:02:33.519> the

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
the two strikers overhead Lukaku on the

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.759 
the two strikers overhead Lukaku on the
right<00:02:33.790> Stryker<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.389> etta<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.349> left<00:02:35.590> and

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
right Stryker and etta on the left and

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.500 
right Stryker and etta on the left and
then<00:02:35.920> if<00:02:36.609> you<00:02:36.730> look<00:02:36.819> at<00:02:36.939> the<00:02:37.000> goals<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.299> game

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
then if you look at the goals the game

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.970 
then if you look at the goals the game
fri<00:02:37.719> so<00:02:37.870> it's<00:02:38.049> not<00:02:38.170> great<00:02:38.379> but<00:02:38.409> the<00:02:38.620> assist

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
fri so it's not great but the assist

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.220 
fri so it's not great but the assist
kind<00:02:39.219> of<00:02:39.280> makes<00:02:39.430> up<00:02:39.609> for<00:02:39.639> if<00:02:39.879> 15<00:02:40.569> goals<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.019> 14

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
kind of makes up for if 15 goals and 14

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.619 
kind of makes up for if 15 goals and 14
assists<00:02:41.709> isn't<00:02:42.280> too<00:02:42.430> shabby<00:02:42.459> and<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.420> is<00:02:43.540> the

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:43.629 
assists isn't too shabby and this is the

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:46.289 
assists isn't too shabby and this is the

that's<00:02:47.409> the<00:02:47.439> most<00:02:47.680> expensive<00:02:48.159> version<00:02:48.609> with

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
that's the most expensive version with

that's the most expensive version with
all<00:02:48.879> informs<00:02:49.329> would<00:02:49.750> not<00:02:49.930> suggest<00:02:50.139> that<00:02:50.379> too
