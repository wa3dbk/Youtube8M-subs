00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.700
 Hello dear viewers with you clone 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.039
 today again rather ordinary 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.760
 tutorial on maikop mechanism 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:23.550
 but you see I have an hour to the side 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.490
 The picture is such an awesome map painted 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.840
 my one of my followers and would like to 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.060
 I'll cut him big 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.130
 big thanks to big 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.190
 thankful sparta without glasses but nothing 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.579
 a plan that's a bit like yes and a drawing 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.070
 generally excellent personally exactly epic but to 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.850
 sorry i stand him on mikecroft and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.059
 youtube on the cap or there I can not in general 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:51.449
 dude thank you for this drawing you 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:54.140
 done okay in general, let's perhaps 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.100
 pudding considered a regular mechanism a 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.820
 Mechanisms today pretty probably 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.710
 already chewed let's say this but this is mine 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.329
 version of the ladder let's first go 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.280
 up as you see us such 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.299
 beautiful flowers transit hops 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.840
 new arrangements 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.600
 there is loading started on the gate 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.430
 well then we go down we see 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.530
 I 'm responsible for chuck here 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.240
 opens the stairs opens on 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.360
 pretty quick as you are right 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.939
 noticed we go through here and here on 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.110
 I do not know the type of smiley box 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.990
 Is it really an ode to diamonds in general you understood yes 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.479
 This is a good such mechanism. 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.880
 his minus to the fact that he is a finger 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:41.340
 this hole well, yes, all I'll do another 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.390
 version of course I will try to remove 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.670
 so that here was the same blocks and here 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.050
 Please call him built so we 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.970
 perhaps I will build on this 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.220
 whose platform for probably notice 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.710
 when I surveyed this mechanism and not 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.530
 let's shook we will build it on 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.250
 what we put here so 4 pistons 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 turns and here in the second 2 pistons yet 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.920
 set so here we set here yes let 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.080
 the ladder went to the pistons 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.750
 now we do discipline hole yet 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.840
 that did not put here perhaps the blocks 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.730
 eat like this 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.890
 stand by our delay repeaters 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.530
 cross the river here we lay redstone 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.890
 here are the repeaters without 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.190
 delay put blocks 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.630
 then we connect the upper pistons then 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.680
 have u like this here standing 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.850
 semi blocks here we put blocks and 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.570
 surfaces on these plows 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.019
 semi-blocks we can our tutors can 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:47.030
 principle without delay 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:50.329
 then he took just such a structure also 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:56.239
 we do not put this block here 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:58.430
 here is such a peter without delay and stone 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.860
 to speak him then we repeat 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.450
 same design from this side 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.600
 that is, such 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.350
 so here is our scheme now 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.260
 works gift works completely 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:16.850
 that's how we see it it works but 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.560
 we have an old staircase with does not move 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.240
 We put that so well, you can principle with 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.670
 that side do the same thing yes in 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.510
 principle of no difference here we put 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.000
 redstone torch here put lipitor 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.520
 here we put our piston here we put 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.070
 turn block 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.850
 so then put here cr and found peter 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:41.070
 again and there is so here we put blocks then 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.140
 go call me everton here here so here a 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.720
 river tara without delay all mechanism 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.980
 the novel of Peter 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.980
 as we see everything is good fast
