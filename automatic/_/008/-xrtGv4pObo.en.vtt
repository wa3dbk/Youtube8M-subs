the<00:04:08.250> scoring<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.549> was<00:04:08.669> thinking<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.030> know<00:04:09.060> what

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
the scoring I was thinking you know what

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.599 
the scoring I was thinking you know what
this<00:04:09.630> is<00:04:09.780> probably<00:04:10.049> at<00:04:10.470> money<00:04:10.769> well<00:04:11.040> spent<00:04:11.070> on

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
this is probably at money well spent on

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.760 
this is probably at money well spent on
Benzema<00:04:12.120> but<00:04:12.510> my<00:04:12.660> opponent<00:04:13.079> does<00:04:13.199> hit

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
Benzema but my opponent does hit

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.620 
Benzema but my opponent does hit
with<00:04:13.980> an<00:04:14.100> absolute<00:04:14.790> wonder<00:04:15.300> girl<00:04:15.450> from

with an absolute wonder girl from

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.590 
with an absolute wonder girl from
Emenike<00:04:16.230> and<00:04:16.489> yeah<00:04:17.489> my<00:04:17.790> keeper<00:04:18.120> couldn't<00:04:18.450> do

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
Emenike and yeah my keeper couldn't do

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.870 
Emenike and yeah my keeper couldn't do

player that I tried to bid on and the

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.510 
player that I tried to bid on and the
problem<00:05:24.780> is<00:05:24.900> that<00:05:25.170> I'm<00:05:25.920> finding<00:05:26.370> is<00:05:26.490> that

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
problem is that I'm finding is that

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.880 
problem is that I'm finding is that
every<00:05:27.480> single<00:05:27.720> player<00:05:28.020> I'm<00:05:28.230> bidding<00:05:28.470> on<00:05:28.680> is

every single player I'm bidding on is

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.770 
every single player I'm bidding on is
getting<00:05:29.220> bit<00:05:29.520> up<00:05:29.550> right<00:05:30.060> to<00:05:30.270> their<00:05:30.420> American

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
getting bit up right to their American

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.420 
getting bit up right to their American
values<00:05:31.050> so<00:05:31.200> there's<00:05:31.380> literally<00:05:31.680> no<00:05:31.920> profit<00:05:32.400> to

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
values so there's literally no profit to

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.550 
values so there's literally no profit to
be<00:05:32.610> made<00:05:32.640> whatsoever<00:05:33.450> and<00:05:33.690> the<00:05:33.900> market<00:05:34.140> is<00:05:34.320> so

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
be made whatsoever and the market is so

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.720 
be made whatsoever and the market is so
dead<00:05:34.770> because<00:05:34.920> there's<00:05:35.130> not<00:05:35.250> half<00:05:35.460> as<00:05:35.580> much

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
dead because there's not half as much
