00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
the last tutorial we added a variable to

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.190 
the last tutorial we added a variable to
this<00:00:12.570> enemy

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
this enemy

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.010 
this enemy
we're<00:00:13.620> said<00:00:13.889> ok<00:00:14.429> action<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.179> equal<00:00:15.480> right<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
we're said ok action can equal right and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.599 
we're said ok action can equal right and
we're<00:00:16.139> also<00:00:16.289> going<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.680> have<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.220> action

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
we're also going to have it so action

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.779 
we're also going to have it so action
can<00:00:17.850> equal<00:00:18.150> left<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:19.260> those<00:00:19.529> words<00:00:19.859> need<00:00:20.369> mean

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
can equal left but those words need mean

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.630 
can equal left but those words need mean
nothing<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> game<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:22.920> what<00:00:23.220> does<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.490> mean

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
nothing to the game so what does it mean

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.660 
nothing to the game so what does it mean
when<00:00:23.970> right<00:00:24.750> well<00:00:25.260> it<00:00:25.470> doesn't<00:00:25.650> mean<00:00:25.890> go<00:00:26.400> right

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
when right well it doesn't mean go right

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.730 
when right well it doesn't mean go right
doesn't<00:00:27.060> mean<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.930> know<00:00:28.050> jump<00:00:28.349> up<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.560> down

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
doesn't mean you know jump up and down

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.859 
doesn't mean you know jump up and down
is<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.490> now<00:00:29.670> supposed<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.210> eat<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.390> potato

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
is this now supposed to eat a potato

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.310 
is this now supposed to eat a potato
whenever<00:00:31.679> its<00:00:32.550> action<00:00:32.969> equals<00:00:33.300> right<00:00:33.480> even

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
whenever its action equals right even

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.950 
whenever its action equals right even
though<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:35.010> know<00:00:35.280> what<00:00:35.820> rate<00:00:36.030> means<00:00:36.270> and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
though what we know what rate means and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.930 
though what we know what rate means and
obviously<00:00:37.440> we<00:00:37.710> want<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.980> snap<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.219> curl<00:00:38.520> right

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
obviously we want to snap a curl right

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.420 
obviously we want to snap a curl right
we<00:00:39.360> need<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.660> tell<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.960> game<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.340> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
we need to tell the game that's what it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.810 
we need to tell the game that's what it
means<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.870> order<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.350> do<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.680> hop<00:00:44.460> over<00:00:44.789> to

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
means so in order to do that hop over to

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.279 
means so in order to do that hop over to
your<00:00:45.090> event<00:00:45.390> XI<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.780> we're<00:00:45.899> gonna<00:00:45.989> add<00:00:46.260> some

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
your event XI and we're gonna add some

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.170 
your event XI and we're gonna add some
events<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:48.239> first<00:00:48.539> one<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.230> event<00:00:49.620> and

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
events the first one is at event and

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.819 
events the first one is at event and
also<00:00:51.180> since<00:00:51.449> there's<00:00:51.719> no<00:00:51.870> bounding<00:00:52.289> box<00:00:52.500> first

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
also since there's no bounding box first

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.410 
also since there's no bounding box first
now<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.129> can<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.550> work<00:00:53.699> directly<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.329> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
now we can just work directly on the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.910 
now we can just work directly on the
snow<00:00:54.600> object<00:00:54.960> which<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.289> makes<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> lot

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
snow object which is makes it a lot

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.840 
snow object which is makes it a lot
easier<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.430> explain<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.809> snail<00:00:58.079> enemy<00:00:58.500> and

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
easier to explain so the snail enemy and

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.869 
easier to explain so the snail enemy and
what<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.090> want<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.600> set<00:01:00.870> now<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.469> actually<00:01:01.980> since

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
what I want to set now is actually since

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.010 
what I want to set now is actually since
we're<00:01:03.329> working<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.690> an<00:01:04.049> instance<00:01:04.500> variable

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020 
we're working with an instance variable

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.350 
we're working with an instance variable
we<00:01:07.020> want<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.290> put<00:01:07.470> compare<00:01:08.070> instance<00:01:08.909> variable

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
we want to put compare instance variable

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.020 
we want to put compare instance variable
so<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.799> variable<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.490> made<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
so the variable that we just made in the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.850 
so the variable that we just made in the
only<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.720> select<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.500> makes<00:01:13.740> it

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
only one we can select which makes it

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.300 
only one we can select which makes it
even<00:01:13.950> easier<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.549> action<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.320> when<00:01:16.590> action<00:01:17.100> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
even easier is action so when action is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.840 
even easier is action so when action is
equal<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:19.200> use<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> quotations<00:01:20.460> right<00:01:20.670> here

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
equal to and use a quotations right here

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.330 
equal to and use a quotations right here
or<00:01:21.450> quotes<00:01:21.780> when<00:01:22.590> action<00:01:22.950> is<00:01:23.189> equal<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.000> right

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
or quotes when action is equal to right

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.249 
or quotes when action is equal to right
what<00:01:26.340> do<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.520> want<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:27.000> well<00:01:27.600> we<00:01:27.780> just<00:01:27.960> want

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
what do I want to do well we just want

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.410 
what do I want to do well we just want
to<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.680> snail<00:01:28.950> crawl<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.240> other

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
to have the snail crawl right in other

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.969 
to have the snail crawl right in other
words<00:01:30.630> move<00:01:31.020> right<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.829> also<00:01:32.280> use<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.090> same

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
words move right and also use the same

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.490 
words move right and also use the same
animation<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.159> he's<00:01:35.340> using<00:01:35.670> right<00:01:35.700> now

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
animation as he's using right now

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.200 
animation as he's using right now
because<00:01:37.500> it's<00:01:37.680> hilarious

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
because it's hilarious

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.120 
because it's hilarious
alright<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.930> action<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.829> want<00:01:40.860> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
alright so the action that we want to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.069 
alright so the action that we want to
occur<00:01:41.369> whenever<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.329> variable<00:01:42.780> equals

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
occur whenever this variable equals

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.460 
occur whenever this variable equals
right<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.560> snail<00:01:44.159> enemy<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.960> if<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.079> scroll

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
right is snail enemy and if you scroll

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.289 
right is snail enemy and if you scroll
down<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:47.070> platform<00:01:47.729> behavior<00:01:48.090> you're<00:01:48.210> gonna

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
down to platform behavior you're gonna

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.940 
down to platform behavior you're gonna
find<00:01:48.600> one<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.869> says<00:01:49.049> simulate<00:01:50.869> control

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
find one that says simulate control

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.219 
find one that says simulate control
right<00:01:52.950> here<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:54.140> we'll<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.170> simulate<00:01:55.740> right

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
right here and we'll just simulate right

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.649 
right here and we'll just simulate right
so<00:01:58.229> basically<00:01:58.670> whenever<00:01:59.670> this<00:02:00.030> variable<00:02:00.509> is

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
so basically whenever this variable is

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.179 
so basically whenever this variable is
right<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.469> what's<00:02:01.710> going<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.860> happen

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
right and this is what's going to happen

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
pressing right for him in other words

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.600 
pressing right for him in other words
he's<00:02:08.849> gonna<00:02:09.090> crawl<00:02:09.479> right<00:02:10.110> now<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.160> only

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
he's gonna crawl right now the only

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.520 
he's gonna crawl right now the only
other<00:02:11.760> thing<00:02:12.000> we<00:02:12.030> have<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.360> do<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.720> make<00:02:13.500> sure

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
other thing we have to do is make sure

other thing we have to do is make sure
that<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:13.920> and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
that the and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:23.320 
that the and
mission<00:02:14.550> is<00:02:14.870> we<00:02:15.870> go<00:02:16.020> snail<00:02:17.240> set<00:02:18.240> animation<00:02:21.770> and

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
mission is we go snail set animation and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.230 
mission is we go snail set animation and
actually<00:02:24.330> did<00:02:24.980> sent<00:02:25.980> me<00:02:26.070> right<00:02:26.310> here<00:02:26.550> not

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
actually did sent me right here not

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.320 
actually did sent me right here not
mirrored<00:02:28.070> so<00:02:29.070> just<00:02:29.310> like<00:02:29.430> before<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.120> not

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
mirrored so just like before the not

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.970 
mirrored so just like before the not
mirrored<00:02:30.660> one<00:02:30.840> is<00:02:31.020> basically<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.770> default

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
mirrored one is basically the default

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.220 
mirrored one is basically the default
animation<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.880> him<00:02:33.360> looking<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.050> right

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
animation of him looking to the right

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.550 
animation of him looking to the right
and<00:02:34.440> humping<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.770> ground<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.880> right<00:02:36.090> now

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
and humping the ground so right now

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.920 
and humping the ground so right now
whenever<00:02:37.560> um<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:39.120> game<00:02:39.300> starts

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
whenever um the game starts

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.140 
whenever um the game starts
since<00:02:40.350> this<00:02:40.740> is<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.070> default<00:02:41.280> value<00:02:41.910> for<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
since this is the default value for the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.190 
since this is the default value for the
variable<00:02:42.300> he's<00:02:43.170> going<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.800> crawl<00:02:44.250> right<00:02:44.490> and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
variable he's going to crawl right and

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.960 
variable he's going to crawl right and
use<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.410> same<00:02:46.680> animation<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.459> him<00:02:47.640> humping

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
use that same animation of him humping

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.510 
use that same animation of him humping
the<00:02:48.000> ground<00:02:48.330> so<00:02:49.140> now<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.740> course<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.340> need<00:02:50.490> to

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
the ground so now of course we need to

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.820 
the ground so now of course we need to
do<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.850> same<00:02:51.030> thing<00:02:51.300> for<00:02:51.750> left<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.650> had<00:02:52.800> a

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
do the same thing for left so I had a

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.540 
do the same thing for left so I had a
whole<00:02:53.070> nother<00:02:53.250> event<00:02:53.670> snail<00:02:54.600> enemy<00:02:58.340> where<00:02:59.340> my

whole nother event snail enemy where my

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.190 
whole nother event snail enemy where my
instance<00:02:59.970> variable<00:03:00.420> is<00:03:00.450> compare<00:03:00.840> instance

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
instance variable is compare instance

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.430 
instance variable is compare instance
variables<00:03:02.090> now<00:03:03.090> when<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.420> action<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.990> equal

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
variables now when the action is equal

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:14.650 
variables now when the action is equal
to<00:03:04.740> left<00:03:07.130> it's<00:03:08.130> now<00:03:08.310> enemy<00:03:12.980> simulate<00:03:13.980> control

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
to left it's now enemy simulate control

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.770 
to left it's now enemy simulate control
left<00:03:15.660> right<00:03:16.080> there<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:17.670> also<00:03:18.000> at<00:03:18.239> the<00:03:18.360> action

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
left right there and also at the action

using the same animation and whenever

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.970 
using the same animation and whenever
but<00:03:53.670> we<00:03:53.760> changed<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.630> variable<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.620> instance

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
but we changed the variable the instance

events look good the animations look

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.650 
events look good the animations look
good<00:04:10.049> however<00:04:10.620> how<00:04:11.610> is<00:04:11.850> that<00:04:12.060> variable

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
good however how is that variable

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.680 
good however how is that variable
actually<00:04:13.010> changed<00:04:14.010> because<00:04:14.400> right<00:04:15.030> now<00:04:15.209> we

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
actually changed because right now we

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.449 
actually changed because right now we
just<00:04:15.900> put<00:04:16.080> two<00:04:16.320> invisible<00:04:16.620> blocks<00:04:17.160> on<00:04:17.370> the

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
just put two invisible blocks on the

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.479 
just put two invisible blocks on the
screen<00:04:17.700> we<00:04:18.359> didn't<00:04:18.690> tell<00:04:18.900> the<00:04:19.049> game<00:04:19.290> that<00:04:20.010> one

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
screen we didn't tell the game that one

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.060 
screen we didn't tell the game that one
this<00:04:20.729> now<00:04:20.940> actually<00:04:21.390> comes<00:04:21.690> in<00:04:21.810> contact<00:04:22.109> with

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
this now actually comes in contact with

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.820 
this now actually comes in contact with
this<00:04:23.250> edge<00:04:23.490> marker<00:04:24.030> that's<00:04:24.870> when<00:04:25.410> we<00:04:25.530> want<00:04:25.710> you

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
this edge marker that's when we want you

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.000 
this edge marker that's when we want you
to<00:04:25.950> change<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.310> variable

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
to change the variable

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.800 
to change the variable
and<00:04:27.490> remember<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.030> only<00:04:28.180> other<00:04:28.450> thing<00:04:28.780> that

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
and remember the only other thing that

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.960 
and remember the only other thing that
we<00:04:29.020> have<00:04:29.200> to<00:04:29.230> do<00:04:29.530> to<00:04:30.220> get<00:04:30.340> them<00:04:30.460> to<00:04:30.490> turn<00:04:30.820> around

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
we have to do to get them to turn around

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.440 
we have to do to get them to turn around
is<00:04:31.420> change<00:04:32.140> this<00:04:32.710> action<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.460> left<00:04:33.700> once<00:04:34.360> he

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
is change this action to left once he

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.240 
is change this action to left once he
does<00:04:34.600> that<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:35.110> events<00:04:35.500> will<00:04:35.800> take<00:04:35.950> it<00:04:36.070> from

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
does that the events will take it from

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.710 
does that the events will take it from
there

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
there

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.290 
there
so<00:04:37.720> how<00:04:38.200> do<00:04:38.260> we<00:04:38.440> do<00:04:38.590> that<00:04:39.010> well<00:04:39.550> we<00:04:39.790> need<00:04:39.970> to<00:04:40.120> add

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
so how do we do that well we need to add

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.600 
so how do we do that well we need to add
another<00:04:40.860> event<00:04:41.860> of<00:04:41.980> course<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:44.220> the<00:04:45.220> event

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
another event of course and the event

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.940 
another event of course and the event
for<00:04:45.760> this<00:04:45.850> is<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.600> we're<00:04:47.200> gonna<00:04:47.290> be<00:04:47.620> doing<00:04:47.890> a

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
for this is and we're gonna be doing a

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.250 
for this is and we're gonna be doing a
couple<00:04:48.130> sub<00:04:48.460> events<00:04:48.790> the<00:04:49.240> first<00:04:49.270> thing<00:04:49.840> that

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
couple sub events the first thing that

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.310 
couple sub events the first thing that
we<00:04:50.380> want<00:04:50.560> to<00:04:50.680> add<00:04:50.830> is<00:04:51.360> the<00:04:52.360> snail<00:04:52.690> Menna<00:04:52.930> me

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
we want to add is the snail Menna me

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.920 
we want to add is the snail Menna me
did<00:04:53.800> I<00:04:53.830> say<00:04:54.070> snail<00:04:54.370> man<00:04:54.550> me<00:04:54.760> what<00:04:55.390> the<00:04:55.600> heck<00:04:55.810> is

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
did I say snail man me what the heck is

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.820 
did I say snail man me what the heck is
a<00:04:55.960> snow<00:04:56.230> man<00:04:56.410> me<00:04:57.360> so<00:04:58.360> when<00:04:58.570> the<00:04:58.750> snail<00:04:59.110> collides

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
a snow man me so when the snail collides

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.220 
a snow man me so when the snail collides
with<00:05:00.010> another<00:05:00.130> object<00:05:00.640> do<00:05:01.210> something<00:05:01.660> well

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
with another object do something well

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.720 
with another object do something well
what<00:05:02.530> do<00:05:02.650> you<00:05:02.740> want<00:05:02.890> to<00:05:02.980> check<00:05:03.220> if<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.520> snail

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:03.730 
what do you want to check if the snail

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.760 
what do you want to check if the snail
collides<00:05:04.060> with<00:05:04.180> well<00:05:04.630> it's<00:05:04.900> this<00:05:05.110> edge<00:05:05.320> marker

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
collides with well it's this edge marker

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:06.840 
collides with well it's this edge marker
object<00:05:06.280> right<00:05:06.550> here

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
object right here

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.680 
object right here
so<00:05:07.720> whenever<00:05:08.020> the<00:05:08.500> snail<00:05:09.150> collides<00:05:10.150> with<00:05:10.300> one

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
so whenever the snail collides with one

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.550 
so whenever the snail collides with one
of<00:05:10.810> these<00:05:10.960> edge<00:05:11.410> markers<00:05:12.010> this<00:05:12.580> is<00:05:12.730> what<00:05:12.910> we<00:05:13.030> do

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
of these edge markers this is what we do

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.770 
of these edge markers this is what we do
we<00:05:14.560> want<00:05:14.710> to<00:05:14.860> click<00:05:15.430> it<00:05:15.640> and<00:05:15.790> hit<00:05:15.850> sub<00:05:16.480> event

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
we want to click it and hit sub event

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.260 
we want to click it and hit sub event
and<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:18.100> only<00:05:18.280> other<00:05:18.460> thing<00:05:18.550> we<00:05:18.760> want<00:05:19.030> to<00:05:19.150> do

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
and the only other thing we want to do

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.170 
and the only other thing we want to do
is<00:05:19.480> pretty<00:05:20.110> much<00:05:20.200> change<00:05:21.100> his<00:05:21.490> action<00:05:22.030> and

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
is pretty much change his action and

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.280 
is pretty much change his action and
this<00:05:22.240> is<00:05:22.390> actually<00:05:22.720> really<00:05:22.870> easy

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
this is actually really easy

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:29.580 
this is actually really easy
so<00:05:23.890> snail<00:05:24.280> enemy<00:05:27.960> not<00:05:28.960> gonna<00:05:29.140> be<00:05:29.200> able<00:05:29.350> to<00:05:29.410> find

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
so snail enemy not gonna be able to find

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.660 
so snail enemy not gonna be able to find
this<00:05:29.710> again<00:05:29.890> I'm<00:05:29.980> just<00:05:30.100> going<00:05:30.280> to<00:05:30.310> punch<00:05:30.520> my

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
this again I'm just going to punch my

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.780 
this again I'm just going to punch my
computer<00:05:31.060> screen<00:05:32.430> compare<00:05:33.430> instance

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
computer screen compare instance

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:40.230 
computer screen compare instance
variable<00:05:34.240> is<00:05:34.530> action<00:05:35.530> equal<00:05:35.980> to<00:05:37.410> right<00:05:39.240> I'm

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
variable is action equal to right I'm

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.880 
variable is action equal to right I'm
just<00:05:40.420> gonna<00:05:40.540> coat<00:05:41.170> this<00:05:41.350> all<00:05:41.530> and<00:05:41.680> then<00:05:41.770> we're

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
just gonna coat this all and then we're

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.140 
just gonna coat this all and then we're
gonna<00:05:42.040> talk<00:05:42.220> because<00:05:42.370> it's<00:05:42.760> kind<00:05:42.910> of<00:05:42.970> making

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:43.150 
gonna talk because it's kind of making

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.870 
gonna talk because it's kind of making
me<00:05:43.680> confuse<00:05:44.680> have<00:05:44.890> not<00:05:45.100> typing<00:05:45.610> all<00:05:45.760> this

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
me confuse have not typing all this

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:55.200 
me confuse have not typing all this
logic<00:05:46.150> just<00:05:46.680> now<00:05:47.680> enemy<00:05:53.370> this<00:05:54.370> is<00:05:54.640> variable

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210 
logic just now enemy this is variable

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:01.380 
logic just now enemy this is variable
action<00:05:55.870> equal<00:05:56.290> to<00:05:59.130> and<00:06:00.130> then<00:06:00.610> we<00:06:00.940> need<00:06:01.090> to<00:06:01.270> add

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:01.390 
action equal to and then we need to add

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:11.100 
action equal to and then we need to add
an<00:06:01.720> else<00:06:05.730> add<00:06:06.730> actions<00:06:07.510> now<00:06:08.020> enemy<00:06:09.540> cool<00:06:10.540> you

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
an else add actions now enemy cool you

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.480 
an else add actions now enemy cool you
guys<00:06:11.260> can<00:06:11.440> probably<00:06:11.560> see<00:06:12.070> what's<00:06:12.220> going<00:06:12.370> on

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
guys can probably see what's going on

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.420 
guys can probably see what's going on
already<00:06:13.140> the<00:06:14.140> value<00:06:14.470> of<00:06:14.530> this<00:06:14.680> equal<00:06:15.400> to<00:06:15.430> right

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:17.430 
already the value of this equal to right

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:19.020 
already the value of this equal to right
all<00:06:18.430> right

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
all right

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:22.110 
all right
so<00:06:19.360> hopefully<00:06:19.660> this<00:06:20.320> works<00:06:20.560> basically<00:06:21.340> um

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
so hopefully this works basically um

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.540 
so hopefully this works basically um
we're<00:06:23.020> telling<00:06:23.380> our<00:06:23.500> game<00:06:23.680> whenever<00:06:24.220> the

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
we're telling our game whenever the

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.720 
we're telling our game whenever the
snail<00:06:24.820> collides<00:06:25.480> with<00:06:25.780> an<00:06:26.020> edge<00:06:26.200> marker<00:06:26.730> see

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
snail collides with an edge marker see

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.720 
snail collides with an edge marker see
what<00:06:28.300> their<00:06:28.510> instance<00:06:29.350> variable<00:06:29.800> is<00:06:29.920> if<00:06:30.160> it's

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:30.730 
what their instance variable is if it's

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.850 
what their instance variable is if it's
equal<00:06:30.880> to<00:06:31.240> right<00:06:31.480> then<00:06:32.080> change<00:06:32.350> it<00:06:32.500> to<00:06:32.530> left

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:32.860 
equal to right then change it to left

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.000 
equal to right then change it to left
else<00:06:33.750> in<00:06:34.750> week<00:06:35.050> we<00:06:35.320> could<00:06:35.500> have<00:06:35.620> add<00:06:35.770> is

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
else in week we could have add is

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.710 
else in week we could have add is
actually<00:06:36.430> equal<00:06:36.640> to<00:06:36.700> left<00:06:36.970> but<00:06:37.180> this<00:06:37.390> else<00:06:37.570> is

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
actually equal to left but this else is

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.540 
actually equal to left but this else is
just<00:06:37.900> a<00:06:37.990> whole<00:06:38.140> lot<00:06:38.290> easier<00:06:38.320> oh<00:06:38.770> if<00:06:39.220> it's<00:06:39.340> not

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.550 
just a whole lot easier oh if it's not

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.930 
just a whole lot easier oh if it's not
equal<00:06:39.700> to<00:06:40.000> right<00:06:40.210> then<00:06:40.450> it<00:06:40.540> must<00:06:40.690> be

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:40.940 
equal to right then it must be

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.540 
equal to right then it must be
two<00:06:41.180> left<00:06:41.390> so<00:06:41.900> change<00:06:42.230> it<00:06:42.380> three<00:06:42.710> and<00:06:43.100> of

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
two left so change it three and of

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.490 
two left so change it three and of
course<00:06:43.850> whenever<00:06:44.300> their<00:06:44.540> action<00:06:44.900> is<00:06:45.050> equal<00:06:45.200> to

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:45.500 
course whenever their action is equal to

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.160 
course whenever their action is equal to
left<00:06:45.740> or<00:06:45.860> right<00:06:46.070> it's<00:06:46.670> going<00:06:47.060> to<00:06:47.240> make<00:06:48.020> the

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.170 
left or right it's going to make the

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:50.560 
left or right it's going to make the
enemy<00:06:48.500> behave<00:06:48.890> in<00:06:49.100> the<00:06:49.190> proper<00:06:49.610> way<00:06:49.640> as<00:06:50.030> we

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:50.570 
enemy behave in the proper way as we

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:52.900 
enemy behave in the proper way as we
told<00:06:50.810> it<00:06:50.960> right<00:06:51.350> here<00:06:51.710> and<00:06:52.010> right<00:06:52.430> here

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910 
told it right here and right here

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.870 
told it right here and right here
so<00:06:53.390> now<00:06:53.600> let's<00:06:53.870> test<00:06:54.050> this<00:06:54.200> out<00:06:54.410> and<00:06:54.800> check<00:06:55.790> it

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:55.880 
so now let's test this out and check it

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.570 
so now let's test this out and check it
out

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:57.580 
out

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.300 
out
so<00:06:58.580> the<00:06:58.880> snail<00:06:59.120> starts<00:06:59.510> out<00:06:59.800> going<00:07:00.800> right<00:07:01.100> and

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:01.310 
so the snail starts out going right and

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.150 
so the snail starts out going right and
hopefully<00:07:01.670> once<00:07:02.180> he<00:07:02.270> gets<00:07:02.450> right<00:07:02.630> here<00:07:03.160> it

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
hopefully once he gets right here it

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.340 
hopefully once he gets right here it
says<00:07:04.370> okay<00:07:04.760> I<00:07:04.790> collided<00:07:05.480> with<00:07:05.570> that<00:07:05.810> now

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:06.350 
says okay I collided with that now

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.520 
says okay I collided with that now
change<00:07:06.710> my<00:07:06.920> action<00:07:07.370> to<00:07:07.970> right<00:07:08.210> go<00:07:08.900> this<00:07:09.110> way

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:09.530 
change my action to right go this way

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.350 
change my action to right go this way
collided<00:07:10.040> with<00:07:10.070> this<00:07:10.310> change<00:07:10.910> it<00:07:11.060> back<00:07:11.180> to

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
collided with this change it back to

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.680 
collided with this change it back to
left<00:07:11.600> go<00:07:12.290> this<00:07:12.530> way<00:07:12.740> back<00:07:13.610> and<00:07:13.910> forth<00:07:13.970> and<00:07:14.630> back

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
left go this way back and forth and back

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.350 
left go this way back and forth and back
and<00:07:14.870> forth<00:07:15.110> he<00:07:15.470> goes<00:07:15.650> so<00:07:16.190> now<00:07:16.400> of<00:07:16.730> course<00:07:16.790> we

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
and forth he goes so now of course we

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.900 
and forth he goes so now of course we
can<00:07:17.540> still<00:07:17.840> run<00:07:18.260> into<00:07:18.590> him<00:07:18.770> and<00:07:19.010> get<00:07:19.190> hurt<00:07:19.430> and

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:19.910 
can still run into him and get hurt and

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.020 
can still run into him and get hurt and
also<00:07:20.420> kill<00:07:20.810> him<00:07:20.960> if<00:07:21.620> I<00:07:21.710> can<00:07:21.890> land<00:07:22.040> on<00:07:22.250> them<00:07:22.400> just

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:23.030 
also kill him if I can land on them just

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:26.200 
also kill him if I can land on them just
like<00:07:23.180> before<00:07:23.710> so<00:07:24.710> again<00:07:24.740> like<00:07:25.370> I<00:07:25.520> said<00:07:25.760> this

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.210 
like before so again like I said this

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:27.820 
like before so again like I said this
isn't<00:07:26.450> the<00:07:26.660> smartest<00:07:27.200> snail<00:07:27.440> in<00:07:27.560> the<00:07:27.620> world

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:27.830 
isn't the smartest snail in the world

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.340 
isn't the smartest snail in the world
but<00:07:28.130> that<00:07:28.280> is<00:07:28.400> your<00:07:28.520> very<00:07:29.080> basics<00:07:30.080> to

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:30.350 
but that is your very basics to

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.100 
but that is your very basics to
artificial<00:07:30.860> intelligence<00:07:31.580> and<00:07:32.110> that's

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.110 
artificial intelligence and that's

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.570 
artificial intelligence and that's
pretty<00:07:33.320> much<00:07:33.470> like<00:07:33.740> how<00:07:33.950> they<00:07:34.130> made<00:07:34.310> the<00:07:34.430> game

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:34.580 
pretty much like how they made the game

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.030 
pretty much like how they made the game
like<00:07:34.790> Sonic<00:07:35.240> and<00:07:35.390> Super<00:07:35.630> Mario<00:07:35.840> Brothers<00:07:36.260> of<00:07:36.740> a

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:37.040 
like Sonic and Super Mario Brothers of a

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.370 
like Sonic and Super Mario Brothers of a
large<00:07:37.370> majority<00:07:37.970> of<00:07:38.000> the<00:07:38.180> game<00:07:38.360> that's<00:07:39.110> just

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:39.380 
large majority of the game that's just

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.500 
large majority of the game that's just
how<00:07:40.040> they<00:07:40.430> I<00:07:40.610> mean<00:07:40.760> they<00:07:40.910> didn't<00:07:41.180> use<00:07:41.330> the

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:41.510 
how they I mean they didn't use the

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.730 
how they I mean they didn't use the
software<00:07:41.870> but<00:07:42.140> that's<00:07:42.320> pretty<00:07:42.440> much<00:07:42.560> the

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:42.740 
software but that's pretty much the

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.030 
software but that's pretty much the
logic<00:07:43.160> behind<00:07:43.310> it<00:07:43.670> so<00:07:44.390> for<00:07:45.050> now<00:07:45.230> now<00:07:45.740> that<00:07:45.919> we

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:46.040 
logic behind it so for now now that we

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.040 
logic behind it so for now now that we
got<00:07:46.190> our<00:07:46.280> snail<00:07:46.550> working<00:07:47.030> perfectly<00:07:47.510> we're

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:48.050 
got our snail working perfectly we're

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.450 
got our snail working perfectly we're
ready<00:07:48.200> to<00:07:48.350> move<00:07:48.500> on<00:07:48.650> to<00:07:48.980> the<00:07:49.070> next<00:07:49.250> tutorial

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:49.460 
ready to move on to the next tutorial

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.520 
ready to move on to the next tutorial
