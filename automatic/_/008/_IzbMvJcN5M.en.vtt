00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.019
 In the previous chapter we ended up in Reus, 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.349
 so in this we start in Vinaròs. 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.539
 We came at night to bathe in the sea, and you have not seen anything because you could not see 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.359
 nothing; there is no light But the water was very rich, what was very strong, it had some waves 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:23.919
 impressive and we could not get much because he pulled a lot inside. 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.820
 And finished Vinaròs, we went to Valencia. 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.740
 We are in Valencia, in the City of Arts and Sciences, and this is very nice. 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.819
 It's funny to see how Calatrava, 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:44.520
 designed a large part of the buildings to look like eyes, 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.880
 he even designed them with a mechanism to move a kind of 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.300
 metal tabs and blinked. 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.690
 What happens is that something must have miscalculated because they do not work. 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.540
 The next day we went to Alicante, where we could not see anything but signatures, 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.140
 signatures and more signatures. 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.900
 The good thing is that the next morning we enjoyed the port area before 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.220
 to leave for Murcia 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.509
 where once again 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.350
 We saw nothing but signatures. 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.980
 What now awaited us were two days of rest in Almería, 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.780
 and on the way we saw the famous Plastic Sea, 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.720
 so called because it is almost completely covered 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.180
 by greenhouses. 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.940
 After a short stop in Cabo de Gata, 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.490
 We ended the day on the seafront of Almeria, prepared 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.950
 to get up early the next day. 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.659
 We are in Cabo de Gata, one of the coastal areas of Almeria and we have come 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.359
 to do scuba diving 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.960
 We are already in the area of ​​the beach and now we have to get in here, 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.839
 we are there putting on the diving suit, 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:13.979
 and we go inside. 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.820
 Diving 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.880
 is incredible. 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.700
 Ester: The Sierra Nevada thing is on the left, is not it? 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.340
 Borja: Yes. 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:14.369
 During the break in Almeria I had a contracture in the back and it was several days 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:15.389
 hurting me very much 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.110
 A very nice girl on Twitter, who is from Granada, told me that if she came 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.530
 his mother physiotherapist 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.949
 I would do a massage. And here I am, in Granada, 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.359
 willing to go to the massage. 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.419
 And I have already left the massage, it has been very good; He needs it very much, he has left my back 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:29.169
 Awesome 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:33.359
 Now we are in the Albaicín de Granada, one of the most beautiful cities, 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.009
 in my opinion, from Spain. I love it, I've come many times here and it does not stop 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.729
 love me 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.850
 In the next chapter: The level of the hotel is so bad, that we have changed it. And we're going to a real hotel.
