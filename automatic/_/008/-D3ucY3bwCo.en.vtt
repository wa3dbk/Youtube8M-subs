00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.170
 hello girls here you have me again this 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.560
 We are going to do a tutorial of some 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.540
 black nails totally black as good 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.050
 the closest thing to black what I have is 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.200
 a kiko enamel that is the 264 that the 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.060
 true, it is a very dark effect that 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.000
 let's do it matte effect and in the 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.790
 tip is a shine effect it's as if 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.840
 let's say like a French but from a 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.070
 same color 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.100
 only that they change 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.950
 the finish then that 's the one we're going 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.000
 to explain today I hope you like it here 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.880
 I leave you 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.940
 we started by putting a base I have chosen 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.940
 the Chinese games is the flash film 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.580
 we wait for it to dry and then place 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.570
 our enamel 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:39.410
 I chose the one from Kiko the Nai Lakers that 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:44.570
 is the 264 as I said before it 's a 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:47.330
 color as a purple a little bit like they have 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.880
 clarified but I really have put in 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.880
 the nail is totally black 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.690
 we have to place it in such a way 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.690
 let us stain as little as possible 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.770
 the area of ​​the cuticle as it happened to me 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.920
 here 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.250
 malisse happens so we 're in the 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.250
 a 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.420
 I'm taking a pretty captain 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.180
 gross 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.000
 with enough quantity to not pass 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.000
 many times 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.250
 A) Yes 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.110
 you can also choose what a little 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.510
 finest and then wait for it to dry 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.400
 and then place another hand 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.720
 but in this case because I am 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.720
 working like this 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.180
 you see that the color is almost like a black 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.180
 true 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.650
 this is how he stays 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.790
 I will introduce the enamel kiko 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.750
 3 in 1 of sea that I was also 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.349
 commenting on my blog because it's a three in 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.200
 one because apart from fortifying it is a 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.329
 Quick drying has a whole base 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.509
 quad base that could have been put at 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.930
 start also and then a top coat that 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.930
 is the 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.449
 I apply it in such a way that it does not leave 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.180
 all the corners the sides 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.910
 without passing it because then it will give the 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.330
 sing with 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.600
 with the finish true then we go over 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.390
 well, if it's necessary, we're going to pass the other 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.990
 hand 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.540
 I recommend that this stay on 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.900
 dark enamel that we have put the 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.950
 home quite dry because the truth 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:04.230
 that then it takes like as it whitens 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.230
 when we put the peacemaker 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.580
 once this step is done I will wait for 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:31.669
 begin to be notified as you see 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:36.370
 here here they are still bright they will be 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.370
 a few seconds is not an immediate effect 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:44.240
 once already relatively dry as 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:44.240
 you can see I'm going to place 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.590
 a glaze shine and I'm going to draw the 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.190
 line of the French 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:53.190
 A) Yes 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:13.600
 so that the tip looks shiny 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.630
 as we had said 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.410
 that has two finishes you can thicken 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.410
 the little bit more 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.660
 if it is a little more we go over 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:34.270
 last and that's how he stays 

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:41.530
 very nice truth 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.530
 As you can see we have the matte finish 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.280
 and then the brightness at the tip of the 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.740
 nail 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.110
 no need to pass a tocoa base 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.240
 because as I said that the kiko enamel 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.940
 I had all those functions 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.460
 then our nail is already protected 

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:01.669
 Well that if you liked you 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:04.700
 I invite that what you share with 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:07.550
