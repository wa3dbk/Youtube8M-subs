how<00:00:12.610> deal<00:00:12.790> this<00:00:13.000> is<00:00:13.150> Shane<00:00:13.360> we're<00:00:13.600> looking<00:00:13.840> at

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 
how deal this is Shane we're looking at

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.609 
how deal this is Shane we're looking at
the<00:00:14.020> equalizer<00:00:14.639> ge7<00:00:15.670> by<00:00:15.940> boss<00:00:16.209> it<00:00:16.540> allows<00:00:17.440> you

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
the equalizer ge7 by boss it allows you

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.980 
the equalizer ge7 by boss it allows you
to<00:00:17.650> get<00:00:17.830> more<00:00:17.890> treble<00:00:18.730> bass<00:00:19.090> mids<00:00:19.570> and<00:00:19.779> so

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
to get more treble bass mids and so

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.530 
to get more treble bass mids and so
forth<00:00:20.290> in<00:00:20.860> your<00:00:20.920> sound<00:00:21.460> and<00:00:21.700> possible<00:00:22.360> just

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540 
forth in your sound and possible just

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.690 
forth in your sound and possible just
from<00:00:22.689> your<00:00:22.810> amplifier<00:00:23.349> so<00:00:23.680> I'm<00:00:24.310> just<00:00:24.460> going<00:00:24.610> to

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:24.700 
from your amplifier so I'm just going to

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.040 
from your amplifier so I'm just going to
play<00:00:24.880> something<00:00:25.300> and<00:00:25.480> then<00:00:25.630> I'm<00:00:25.810> going<00:00:26.020> to

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
play something and then I'm going to

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.750 
play something and then I'm going to
turn<00:00:26.230> this<00:00:26.320> thing<00:00:26.380> on<00:00:26.680> and<00:00:27.010> see<00:00:27.070> what<00:00:27.640> I<00:00:27.699> need

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
turn this thing on and see what I need

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.689 
turn this thing on and see what I need
to<00:00:28.090> adjust<00:00:28.180> in<00:00:28.690> my<00:00:28.840> sound<00:00:29.140> so<00:00:29.470> I<00:00:29.770> use<00:00:30.279> my<00:00:30.460> hands

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
to adjust in my sound so I use my hands

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:49.570 
to adjust in my sound so I use my hands
for<00:00:30.850> this<00:00:31.000> one

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.300 

that<00:00:50.480> sounds<00:00:50.960> pretty<00:00:51.170> good<00:00:51.350> as<00:00:51.620> it<00:00:51.950> is<00:00:52.070> but<00:00:52.250> I

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
that sounds pretty good as it is but I

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.090 
that sounds pretty good as it is but I
want<00:00:52.580> a<00:00:52.640> bit<00:00:52.760> more<00:00:52.790> tops<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.500> I<00:00:54.560> turn<00:00:54.830> the<00:00:54.860> top

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
want a bit more tops so I turn the top

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.310 
want a bit more tops so I turn the top
end<00:00:55.280> up<00:00:55.430> here<00:00:55.670> maybe<00:00:56.630> turn<00:00:56.870> a<00:00:56.900> little<00:00:57.080> of<00:00:57.260> the

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
end up here maybe turn a little of the

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
end up here maybe turn a little of the
base<00:00:57.530> out<00:00:57.800> let's<00:00:58.700> kick<00:00:58.850> it<00:00:58.880> in<00:00:59.090> now

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
base out let's kick it in now

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.990 
base out let's kick it in now
immediately<00:01:01.340> when<00:01:01.880> I<00:01:01.910> click<00:01:02.360> this<00:01:02.570> pedal<00:01:02.960> in<00:01:03.110> I

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
immediately when I click this pedal in I

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.310 
immediately when I click this pedal in I
hear<00:01:05.000> some<00:01:05.570> hiss<00:01:05.960> I<00:01:07.630> heard<00:01:08.630> that<00:01:08.810> out<00:01:09.050> of<00:01:09.260> the

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
hear some hiss I heard that out of the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.260 
hear some hiss I heard that out of the
behringer<00:01:09.770> pedal<00:01:10.100> and<00:01:10.250> I<00:01:10.580> thought<00:01:10.970> it<00:01:11.180> was

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270 
behringer pedal and I thought it was

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.260 
behringer pedal and I thought it was
just<00:01:11.540> a<00:01:11.630> Behringer<00:01:11.990> pedal<00:01:12.380> but<00:01:12.760> it<00:01:13.760> seems<00:01:14.090> to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
just a Behringer pedal but it seems to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.410 
just a Behringer pedal but it seems to
be<00:01:14.300> that<00:01:14.930> well<00:01:15.619> now<00:01:16.040> from<00:01:16.490> experience

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
be that well now from experience

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.900 
be that well now from experience
most<00:01:18.410> of<00:01:18.560> these<00:01:18.650> EQ<00:01:19.040> pedals<00:01:19.400> will<00:01:19.670> give<00:01:19.820> you

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
most of these EQ pedals will give you

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.330 
most of these EQ pedals will give you
more<00:01:20.060> hiss<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.510> that<00:01:21.260> also<00:01:21.680> said<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:21.950> have<00:01:22.160> just

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
more hiss and that also said I have just

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.930 
more hiss and that also said I have just
boosted<00:01:22.790> the<00:01:22.940> top<00:01:23.150> end<00:01:23.390> of<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:24.940> frequency

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
boosted the top end of the frequency

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.210 
boosted the top end of the frequency
range<00:01:26.390> on<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:26.869> pedal<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:27.410> here<00:01:27.710> we<00:01:27.800> go<00:01:27.920> here's

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
range on the pedal so here we go here's

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.590 
range on the pedal so here we go here's
the<00:01:28.250> same<00:01:28.490> part<00:01:28.790> and<00:01:28.970> I<00:01:29.000> turn<00:01:29.149> it<00:01:29.270> on<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:29.509> off

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
the same part and I turn it on and off

00:01:29.600 --> 00:02:05.650 
the same part and I turn it on and off
as<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:29.930> play

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.719 

there's<00:02:06.660> a<00:02:06.870> massive<00:02:07.320> massive<00:02:07.830> difference<00:02:08.040> in

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
there's a massive massive difference in

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.780 
there's a massive massive difference in
the<00:02:08.880> tops<00:02:09.410> now<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.710> this<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.370> may<00:02:11.490> even

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the tops now that this is on I may even

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:42.220 
the tops now that this is on I may even
play<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.150> lead<00:02:39.650> it's<00:02:40.650> really<00:02:40.920> cool

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
play and lead it's really cool

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.630 
play and lead it's really cool
not<00:02:43.230> necessarily<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.890> sound<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.250> like<00:02:44.400> but

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
not necessarily the sound I like but

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.229 
not necessarily the sound I like but
that's<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:45.620> bit<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.709> an<00:02:46.800> example<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.400> how<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.580> EQ

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
that's a bit of an example of how the EQ

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.360 
that's a bit of an example of how the EQ
can<00:02:49.110> change<00:02:49.440> your<00:02:49.709> sound<00:02:49.920> dramatically<00:02:50.610> and

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
can change your sound dramatically and

00:02:52.370 --> 00:04:15.250 
can change your sound dramatically and
bring<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.459> bass<00:02:53.670> Becky

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:40.980 

you

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.860 

that's<00:04:41.530> basically<00:04:41.890> an<00:04:42.100> example<00:04:42.220> of<00:04:42.760> how<00:04:43.420> an<00:04:43.540> EQ

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:43.870 
that's basically an example of how an EQ

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.690 
that's basically an example of how an EQ
pedal<00:04:44.140> can<00:04:44.290> dramatically<00:04:44.950> change<00:04:45.070> your<00:04:45.490> tone

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
pedal can dramatically change your tone

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.880 
pedal can dramatically change your tone
in<00:04:46.060> any<00:04:46.510> way<00:04:46.720> that<00:04:46.900> you<00:04:47.020> like<00:04:47.050> you<00:04:47.500> can<00:04:47.620> scoop

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
in any way that you like you can scoop

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.500 
in any way that you like you can scoop
the<00:04:48.040> mids<00:04:48.250> you<00:04:48.340> can<00:04:48.490> add<00:04:48.700> more<00:04:48.880> mids<00:04:49.180> you<00:04:49.330> can

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
the mids you can add more mids you can

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.150 
the mids you can add more mids you can
just<00:04:49.750> use<00:04:49.900> it<00:04:49.930> as<00:04:50.200> a<00:04:50.230> basically<00:04:50.620> like<00:04:50.890> as<00:04:51.100> a

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
just use it as a basically like as a

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.640 
just use it as a basically like as a
boost<00:04:51.940> pedal<00:04:52.180> as<00:04:52.480> well<00:04:52.690> like<00:04:52.990> if<00:04:53.140> you<00:04:53.260> if<00:04:53.530> you

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
boost pedal as well like if you if you

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.440 
boost pedal as well like if you if you
pump<00:04:53.920> the<00:04:54.100> mids<00:04:54.310> up<00:04:54.490> a<00:04:54.640> little<00:04:54.850> bit<00:04:54.970> more<00:04:55.210> and

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
pump the mids up a little bit more and

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.060 
pump the mids up a little bit more and
then<00:04:55.960> turn<00:04:56.200> it<00:04:56.320> on<00:04:56.410> you're<00:04:56.590> going<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.770> get<00:04:56.890> a

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
then turn it on you're going to get a

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:58.950 
then turn it on you're going to get a
lot<00:04:57.310> more<00:04:57.340> decibels<00:04:58.030> of<00:04:58.210> sound<00:04:58.270> coming<00:04:58.690> out<00:04:58.900> of

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
lot more decibels of sound coming out of

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.920 
lot more decibels of sound coming out of
your<00:04:59.170> app<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.680> it's<00:05:00.400> really<00:05:00.820> cool<00:05:01.150> so<00:05:01.630> you<00:05:01.690> can

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
your app and it's really cool so you can

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.140 
your app and it's really cool so you can
use<00:05:02.380> it<00:05:02.530> as<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.710> lead<00:05:02.950> boost<00:05:03.250> or<00:05:03.520> just<00:05:03.850> to<00:05:03.940> change

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
use it as a lead boost or just to change

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.850 
use it as a lead boost or just to change
your<00:05:04.330> tone<00:05:04.510> or<00:05:04.540> to<00:05:04.810> give<00:05:04.960> you<00:05:05.080> some<00:05:05.680> of<00:05:05.770> those

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
your tone or to give you some of those

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
frequencies that you think you might be

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.430 
frequencies that you think you might be
missing<00:05:07.800> if<00:05:08.800> the<00:05:08.860> only<00:05:09.280> downside<00:05:09.820> of<00:05:09.850> it<00:05:10.060> is<00:05:10.440> it

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
missing if the only downside of it is it

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:18.470 
missing if the only downside of it is it
does<00:05:11.680> make<00:05:11.890> your<00:05:12.070> amp<00:05:12.430> his<00:05:14.790> let's<00:05:15.790> put<00:05:15.970> it<00:05:16.060> off

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.580 

and<00:05:19.480> that's<00:05:19.630> with<00:05:19.810> it<00:05:19.840> on<00:05:20.020> I<00:05:20.260> don't<00:05:20.320> know<00:05:20.500> if

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
and that's with it on I don't know if

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.230 
and that's with it on I don't know if
that's<00:05:20.770> going<00:05:20.890> to<00:05:20.950> come<00:05:21.130> through<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.520> video

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
that's going to come through the video

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.350 
that's going to come through the video
cameras<00:05:22.660> or<00:05:22.810> not<00:05:22.930> but<00:05:23.320> um<00:05:23.490> it<00:05:24.490> does<00:05:24.730> add<00:05:24.940> a<00:05:25.210> lot

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
cameras or not but um it does add a lot

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.080 
cameras or not but um it does add a lot
of<00:05:25.420> noise<00:05:25.830> or<00:05:26.830> a<00:05:27.070> lot<00:05:27.220> of<00:05:27.340> Natural<00:05:28.060> History

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
of noise or a lot of Natural History

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.130 
of noise or a lot of Natural History
where<00:05:28.600> much<00:05:29.500> like<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:29.830> behringer<00:05:30.220> one<00:05:30.370> did<00:05:30.550> so

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
where much like the behringer one did so

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.660 
where much like the behringer one did so
that's<00:05:32.140> just<00:05:32.260> one<00:05:32.440> of<00:05:32.530> those<00:05:32.650> things<00:05:32.920> but<00:05:33.220> in<00:05:33.550> a

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
that's just one of those things but in a

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:35.820 
that's just one of those things but in a
live<00:05:33.880> situation<00:05:34.120> you<00:05:34.690> get<00:05:35.020> more<00:05:35.290> benefit<00:05:35.680> out

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
live situation you get more benefit out

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.100 
live situation you get more benefit out
of<00:05:35.890> that<00:05:36.160> as<00:05:36.310> well<00:05:36.940> as<00:05:37.120> recording<00:05:37.870> you<00:05:37.960> can

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
of that as well as recording you can

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.520 
of that as well as recording you can
probably<00:05:38.700> EQ<00:05:39.700> this<00:05:40.630> exact<00:05:41.020> sort<00:05:41.260> of<00:05:41.350> sound

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
probably EQ this exact sort of sound

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.410 
probably EQ this exact sort of sound
that<00:05:41.620> you<00:05:41.680> do<00:05:41.860> want<00:05:42.100> and<00:05:42.310> thanks<00:05:43.300> to<00:05:43.390> that
