00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.309
 hello girls hello everyone then there 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.500
 I wanted to make this video to show you 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.689
 the last riches I made 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.270
 you will soon see the tutorial because it 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:23.900
 I'm getting ready I don't know if you'll see before 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.740
 this video or the tutorial anyway 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.580
 I will do it soon 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.040
 then I show you some accomplishment 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.420
 I tell you the scheme is always that though 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.030
 I made it with different colors 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.620
 with different yarn and I mounted in 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.239
 a different way 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.140
 then this one was made with 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.879
 a yarn blended from white to light green 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.260
 a very special child because in the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.360
 moment when I had to find some 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.460
 pearls that were good for us really was 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.230
 very difficult and a bird that I don't know 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.670
 define you I don't know what it's called 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.500
 but still the only thing was 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.030
 these mother of pearl that I found that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.870
 they attacked so I had to put them 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.010
 I immediately applied rhinestones to the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.899
 question and strass 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.149
 I had a little bit of difficulty 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.410
 at the beginning because he starts making gods 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:12.900
 paste with the first straw glue thing 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.130
 I therefore mean for pastrocchi 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.900
 maybe you see well I had entered 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.630
 put this stress practically after 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.220
 having put the glue on the component in 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.170
 actually you see all the glue that 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.490
 in short, it comes out that it has dried on 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.770
 outside the rhinestones 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.710
 and these are really horrible therefore 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.909
 will go into oblivion I think that 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.700
 maybe you don't see them well though 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.380
 in short, I see them live with them 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.100
 the drooled glue of a thing 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.600
 really not very cute so then I have 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.640
 decided to apply it in a way 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.530
 different then to put the glue 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.479
 on the layer and then to apply it 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.579
 and so it went a little better I am 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:55.049
 trying to reflect on the possible 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.330
 buying a hotfix applicator ie 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.760
 of those 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.170
 of those particular rhinestones which is one 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.520
 when heated they stick together 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.200
 perfectly to the fabric 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.480
 but still I haven't bought yet 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.440
 nothing we will see then here I have entered 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.080
 these rhinestones 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.850
 you don't see smudges they are perfect then 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.090
 in short, I have put a knot of lore; 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.470
 this component because the hole was 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.300
 really very thin I had to 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.860
 take an equally thin thread 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:28.640
 this is a very thin 5 mm 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.590
 and then this is the final result 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.390
 I like them very much I am very unique 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.600
 detail that are a little long 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.240
 so they should be worn during 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.910
 summer or short hair 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.590
 or else they are beautiful tall, etc. because of me 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.070
 I am already behind me, I dove 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.940
 dinner then always on the same scheme I have 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.340
 made these brown with 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.690
 what is said brown anyway color 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:00.890
 brown I inserted inside the 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.530
 brown yarn a golden yarn and therefore 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.900
 this type of processing has come and 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.360
 sharp that let me remember a moment 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.980
 I had purchased a series at the lidl 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.970
 of spools of threads among which there was also 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.260
 the golden one 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:18.650
 then I applied this small and yes 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:22.610
 called ribbon I call fiocchetto that is 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.470
 that is, the film was purchased 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.900
 ribbon was purchased by some 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.530
 Chinese and then I did this little one 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.820
 little bow with simple nun color 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.739
 golden I didn't want to add 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.959
 nothing else because I think they are 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.630
 so beautiful they are very elegant like this 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.150
 so I didn't want to add anything else 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.250
 other is quite large as you see 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.739
 they cover the whole palm of my hand 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.800
 maybe if you see some singles 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.510
 therefore they cover the whole palm better 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.299
 of my hand because the yarn 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.950
 used it put all three of them 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.200
 these three yarns together so it is 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.209
 a pretty big thing came and 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.330
 show respect to those of before 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.580
 here they are definitely definitely 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.250
 bigger then even bigger than 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.770
 those 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.960
 god how huge are these 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.360
 here made with a cable yarn 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.730
 number 5 to these are fine as 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.900
 practically a flat fact or a 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.430
 under 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.359
 not even a coaster I think 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.920
 are too big for 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.900
 coaster would go right for 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.570
 those fruit cards because they are 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.400
 really huge but nothing I wanted 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.680
 try this scheme and then for 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.990
 try it I always use a yarn 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.360
 very large to see the mesh better 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.980
 to see where I can go wrong etc. 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.350
 above all we have to invent 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.360
 so I wanted to try a yarn 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.550
 so great are these mats 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.830
 beautiful that you can use during the 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.380
 your Christmas or not Easter holidays 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.200
 I know really really huge though 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.930
 then embellished them with a ribbon on the 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.230
 It violates this blue and I put this on 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.740
 little bow here both one and 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.560
 to the other decidedly flashy 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.110
 I don't know if they are wearable 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.360
 however, they are quite a few 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:10.320
 earrings then proceed with these up here 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:15.229
 these fuchsia I have practically inserted 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:17.790
 the rhinestones on the whole central part 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.520
 and therefore to practically every shirt 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.220
 high I did see you put these 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:25.050
 these rhinestones glued to deburred 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.990
 little because this had been the 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.360
 second test I did after those 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.220
 reds that are regrets and therefore me 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.560
 liked them so I left them simple 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.750
 very simple added nothing because already 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.580
 stress from enough light then not 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.250
 in short, I would like everyone to turn into one 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.700
 time I can then leave it there 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.940
 quite simple quite large but 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:51.750
 I do n't show you so much in comparison 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:56.430
 to the placemat and in comparison to these 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:59.610
 which were the largest and finally to these 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:03.450
 here therefore we say that they are similar more or 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:06.300
 less these as like size e 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:08.370
 nothing so these are dyed here 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.830
 unity only on fuchsia 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:16.320
 I have also always done the same 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:18.480
 these are the last ones then 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.190
 the others are still to dry 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.960
 among other things, I'm making a video of you 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:26.550
 also on how to starch on the various methods 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:29.190
 that I use to admire and nothing there 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.890
 I explain closely what I did together 

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.500
 two yarns a blue yarn is a yarn 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.520
 green and then I made the decoration 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.830
 crocheted 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.210
 I have done everything in the end I have 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:44.700
 put this satin ribbon color 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.590
 fuchsia not mixed three colors here 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.810
 they were enjoying me so great 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.610
 since every time tone on tone 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.710
 in short we are young we must give a 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.550
 a little bit of color is added to an agate 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.740
 then put the nun and then it is 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:01.230
 released this cute earring mi 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.180
 I like them very much they are very much 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:07.320
 nice and i like things a lot 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:09.330
 colored I am a little little cicchetti e 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:11.600
 I don't like the favonio very much 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.600
 what's this 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.480
 very elegant etcetera us 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.400
 square one thing a little more frivolous 

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.070
 very colorful they have to give me 

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.750
 in short, I have to give myself some joy 

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:23.760
 radiance when wearing them 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:26.220
 so the ones I prefer the most are 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.120
 these here on fuchsia obviously color 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:29.430
 favorite 

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.670
 then these because they always have a 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:34.440
 something fuchsia too i have to 

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.180
 say that I liked a lot but I think 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.040
 The wearing just really well 

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.140
 because I have very few things on which 

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.520
 to match them I am very sporty 

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.330
 etcetera etc. so these here 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.100
 goodbye 

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:46.050
 goodbye and we will use some of these 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.030
 as underplates for Easter 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.160
 having said that I greet you I hope your ideas 

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.080
 there may be help you can 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.690
 make your earrings in short 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:58.550
 some way nicer and see you 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:58.550
 to the next video, hello everyone
