as staying put it's only when I found

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.030 
as staying put it's only when I found
myself<00:03:40.270> doing<00:03:40.660> pretty<00:03:40.960> heavy<00:03:41.260> exercises<00:03:41.950> that

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
myself doing pretty heavy exercises that

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.190 
myself doing pretty heavy exercises that
I<00:03:42.100> had<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.400> adjust<00:03:42.730> these<00:03:42.940> things<00:03:43.270> to<00:03:43.810> stay<00:03:44.020> put

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
I had to adjust these things to stay put

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.420 
I had to adjust these things to stay put
in<00:03:44.290> my<00:03:44.380> ear<00:03:44.530> about<00:03:44.620> every<00:03:45.040> three<00:03:45.070> minutes

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
in my ear about every three minutes

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.100 
in my ear about every three minutes
which<00:03:45.670> is<00:03:45.820> kind<00:03:46.150> of<00:03:46.180> annoying<00:03:46.450> but

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
which is kind of annoying but

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.720 
which is kind of annoying but
everybody's<00:03:47.680> ears<00:03:47.920> are<00:03:48.070> different<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:48.520> for

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
everybody's ears are different so for

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.040 
everybody's ears are different so for
some<00:03:48.880> people<00:03:48.910> they<00:03:49.150> may<00:03:49.330> work<00:03:49.510> better<00:03:49.780> than

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
some people they may work better than

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.900 
some people they may work better than
others<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:51.070> that<00:03:51.100> conclusion<00:03:51.460> there's<00:03:51.700> one

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
others so that conclusion there's one

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:52.800
