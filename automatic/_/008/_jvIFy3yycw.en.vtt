500 Watts 80 plus silver power supply
from<00:00:16.710> super<00:00:17.640> flower<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.350> it<00:00:19.350> is<00:00:20.300> semi<00:00:21.300> modular

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
from super flower and it is semi modular

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.570 
from super flower and it is semi modular
so<00:00:22.230> we're<00:00:22.350> gonna<00:00:22.439> open<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:23.189> haven't

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
so we're gonna open it up I haven't

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.839 
so we're gonna open it up I haven't
opened<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.880> yet<00:00:25.130> so<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.220> looks<00:00:26.460> like<00:00:26.550> on<00:00:26.820> the

home manual got a nice bag here it's not
as<00:00:37.710> good<00:00:37.890> as<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:39.320> case<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.559> came<00:00:40.890> with<00:00:41.219> the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
as good as the case that came with the

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.490 
as good as the case that came with the
corsair<00:00:44.190> HX<00:00:44.700> 850<00:00:45.450> that's<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.780> my<00:00:45.899> gaming<00:00:46.170> break

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
corsair HX 850 that's in my gaming break

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.889 
corsair HX 850 that's in my gaming break
but<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.950> one's<00:00:47.160> only<00:00:48.980> 4nh<00:00:49.980> CPC<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:51.239> I'm<00:00:51.780> not

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
but this one's only 4nh CPC so I'm not

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.680 
but this one's only 4nh CPC so I'm not
too<00:00:52.110> worried<00:00:52.379> about<00:00:52.440> that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.600 

we've<00:00:54.989> got<00:00:55.140> all<00:00:55.260> our<00:00:55.289> cables<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:56.100> which<00:00:56.489> is

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
we've got all our cables here which is

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.450 
we've got all our cables here which is
really<00:00:56.850> neat<00:00:57.030> because<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.600> comes<00:00:57.840> with<00:00:58.020> these

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
really neat because it comes with these

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.860 
really neat because it comes with these
ends<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.640> sort<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.969> look<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.090> microphone

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
ends that sort of look like microphone

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:10.850 
ends that sort of look like microphone
cable<00:01:03.680> power<00:01:04.680> cable<00:01:09.290> I've<00:01:10.290> got<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> couple<00:01:10.710> of

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.420 
supply in and then we're gonna open up
the<00:01:18.540> power<00:01:18.720> supply<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:22.070> gonna<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.250> come

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the power supply so gonna have to come

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.700 
the power supply so gonna have to come
back

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
back

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.300 
back
alright<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.920> we<00:01:26.009> got<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.280> open<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:28.130> taking<00:01:29.130> it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
alright so we got it open and taking it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.950 
alright so we got it open and taking it
out<00:01:29.400> now<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:30.470> wish<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.590> had<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> tripod<00:01:32.250> phone<00:01:33.210> here

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.350 

so<00:01:36.960> we've<00:01:37.170> got<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.729> ends<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:38.970> which<00:01:39.180> has

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
so we've got the ends here which has

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.850 
so we've got the ends here which has
little<00:01:39.960> rubber<00:01:40.400> rubber<00:01:41.400> piece<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.119> there

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
little rubber rubber piece on it there

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.590 
little rubber rubber piece on it there
and<00:01:43.860> that's<00:01:43.979> where<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:45.149> microphone

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
and that's where the the microphone

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:53.550 
and that's where the the microphone
connectors<00:01:46.079> go<00:01:46.350> or<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.159> power

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.760 

what<00:01:54.560> does<00:01:54.650> it<00:01:54.740> say<00:01:54.920> here<00:01:55.220> that<00:01:55.570> PCIe<00:01:56.710> say<00:01:57.710> to

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
what does it say here that PCIe say to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.940 
what does it say here that PCIe say to
multi-use<00:01:58.810> it's<00:01:59.810> not<00:02:00.020> pull<00:02:00.230> input<00:02:00.560> connectors

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
multi-use it's not pull input connectors

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.890 
multi-use it's not pull input connectors
all<00:02:01.100> power<00:02:01.310> is<00:02:01.550> operating<00:02:02.090> to<00:02:02.210> avoid<00:02:02.480> damage

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
all power is operating to avoid damage

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.130 
all power is operating to avoid damage
to<00:02:02.930> related<00:02:03.470> components<00:02:04.900> so<00:02:05.900> they<00:02:06.020> have

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
to related components so they have

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.250 
to related components so they have
different<00:02:06.290> ones<00:02:06.680> for<00:02:06.860> I<00:02:07.460> guess<00:02:08.119> these<00:02:08.360> with

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
different ones for I guess these with

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.380 
different ones for I guess these with
the<00:02:09.380> five<00:02:09.619> pins<00:02:09.950> or<00:02:10.190> for<00:02:10.460> the<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:13.610> your<00:02:14.120> four

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
the five pins or for the the your four

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.750 
the five pins or for the the your four
pin<00:02:14.570> power<00:02:14.780> connectors<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.950> SATA<00:02:16.430> and

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
pin power connectors and the SATA and

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.160 
pin power connectors and the SATA and
then<00:02:17.090> these<00:02:17.270> four<00:02:17.630> here<00:02:18.200> are<00:02:18.380> for<00:02:19.190> the<00:02:19.220> PCIe<00:02:20.170> on

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
then these four here are for the PCIe on

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.200 
then these four here are for the PCIe on
the<00:02:21.260> bottom<00:02:21.620> it's<00:02:22.190> got<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.340> fan<00:02:22.670> with<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.000> blue

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
the bottom it's got a fan with a blue

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.420 
the bottom it's got a fan with a blue
LED<00:02:23.510> which<00:02:24.170> I'm<00:02:24.470> not<00:02:24.620> going<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.860> see<00:02:25.070> because

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
LED which I'm not going to see because

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.960 
LED which I'm not going to see because
I'm<00:02:25.580> putting<00:02:25.880> it<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.210> a<00:02:27.110> bit<00:02:27.710> Phoenix<00:02:28.280> Raider

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
I'm putting it in a bit Phoenix Raider

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.080 
I'm putting it in a bit Phoenix Raider
and<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:30.350> also<00:02:30.470> has<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> on-off<00:02:31.430> switch<00:02:31.880> in<00:02:32.000> the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
and it also has a on-off switch in the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.000 
and it also has a on-off switch in the
back<00:02:32.300> it's<00:02:32.870> pretty<00:02:33.050> nice<00:02:33.170> power<00:02:33.620> supply<00:02:33.950> is

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
back it's pretty nice power supply is

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.820 
back it's pretty nice power supply is
really<00:02:34.370> hefty<00:02:34.580> really<00:02:35.150> weighty<00:02:35.830> your

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
really hefty really weighty your

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.570 
really hefty really weighty your
standard<00:02:37.340> pins<00:02:38.500> making<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.590> semi<00:02:39.890> modular<00:02:40.400> are

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
standard pins making a semi modular are

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.940 
standard pins making a semi modular are
the<00:02:41.500> 24<00:02:42.500> pin<00:02:42.709> motherboard<00:02:44.050> double<00:02:45.050> CPU<00:02:45.500> here

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
the 24 pin motherboard double CPU here

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.010 
the 24 pin motherboard double CPU here
and<00:02:46.130> then<00:02:47.200> you've<00:02:48.200> got<00:02:49.510> I'm<00:02:50.510> guessing<00:02:50.870> this<00:02:50.959> is

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
and then you've got I'm guessing this is

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.270 
and then you've got I'm guessing this is
PCIe<00:02:51.680> I'm<00:02:52.100> not<00:02:52.310> sure<00:02:52.610> let's<00:02:53.090> see<00:02:53.980> no<00:02:54.980> this<00:02:55.130> is

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.550 
PCIe I'm not sure let's see no this is
CPU<00:02:55.700> here<00:02:56.620> well<00:02:57.620> I<00:02:57.770> wonder<00:02:58.340> what<00:02:58.610> this<00:02:58.910> guy<00:02:59.150> is

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
CPU here well I wonder what this guy is

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.840 
CPU here well I wonder what this guy is
this<00:03:00.560> is<00:03:00.770> a<00:03:00.800> four<00:03:01.160> pin<00:03:01.400> oh<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:02.750> is<00:03:02.870> the<00:03:02.989> 24<00:03:03.560> pin

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
this is a four pin oh this is the 24 pin

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.970 
this is a four pin oh this is the 24 pin
okay<00:03:04.850> I<00:03:04.880> see<00:03:05.239> it's<00:03:05.390> not<00:03:05.630> it's<00:03:06.200> not<00:03:06.380> one<00:03:06.620> piece

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
okay I see it's not it's not one piece

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.130 
okay I see it's not it's not one piece
like<00:03:07.519> a<00:03:07.550> lot<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:07.970> more<00:03:08.150> modern<00:03:08.480> ones<00:03:08.690> so<00:03:09.019> it

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
like a lot of the more modern ones so it

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.560 
like a lot of the more modern ones so it
comes<00:03:09.350> separate<00:03:09.860> here<00:03:10.160> so<00:03:11.030> you<00:03:11.090> got<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.300> 20

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
comes separate here so you got the 20

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.930 
comes separate here so you got the 20
pin<00:03:11.750> and<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:11.959> 4<00:03:12.170> pin<00:03:12.350> making<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.739> 24<00:03:13.250> pin<00:03:13.459> and

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
pin and the 4 pin making a 24 pin and

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.670 
pin and the 4 pin making a 24 pin and
then<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.239> got<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.480> 8<00:03:14.600> pin<00:03:14.870> in<00:03:15.170> case<00:03:15.500> your

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
then you got the 8 pin in case your

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.250 
then you got the 8 pin in case your
motherboard<00:03:15.890> can<00:03:16.220> use<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.580> mine<00:03:17.480> only<00:03:17.720> uses

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
motherboard can use it mine only uses

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.810 
motherboard can use it mine only uses
the<00:03:19.480> 4<00:03:20.480> pin<00:03:20.690> because<00:03:20.930> I'm<00:03:21.140> using<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:22.040> b75

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
the 4 pin because I'm using a b75

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.460 
the 4 pin because I'm using a b75
