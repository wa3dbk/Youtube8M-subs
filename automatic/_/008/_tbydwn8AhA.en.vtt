00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:10.670
 well then let's see very quickly 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.410
 how the 11 m 12 and its derivatives yes that 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.120
 ruth come with as many people 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.650
 comments is asking me about it 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.990
 that does not know how to activate it and yes that 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.080
 I'm not going to show you 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.400
 how are we going to adjust the first thing 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.520
 phone information 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.070
 the compilation number we give you as 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.449
 seven or eight times until we get out 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.990
 that we have activated the options of 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:38.230
 developer we left here 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.360
 and we see development options let's 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.670
 we go down a bit until we find 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.359
 root access 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.510
 we click on we give applications 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:50.979
 we accept we have the root activated os 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.109
 I'm going to prove as if it's 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:54.950
 running root let's try to 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.800
 to download 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:02.110
 the supersur application that for me is the 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.110
 easier simple and intuitive to use 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.549
 we accept a second 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.570
 we open 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.509
 and here it tells us the binaries need 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.970
 update so perfect that means 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.360
 that is already running root but we 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.450
 they would say you can not access root 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.210
 we update them normally you see and we 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.470
 he asks for root access we let him 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.620
 We give to remember so that we will 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.500
 ask and ready we are already installing 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:39.500
 the new binaries so that everything goes 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 perfectly 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.800
 also very quickly since we have 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.990
 put the developer options os 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.900
 I'm going to teach that in options 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.450
 development in advanced reboot if 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.780
 we activate 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.420
 let's be able to access look at a menu of 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.610
 Advanced restart where we have restart 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.990
 very fast that is that free boot access 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.659
 to the recovery to install 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.989
 updates and others and access to 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.840
 power to flash from the computer 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:17.510
 so I do not expect anything that has served you 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.510
 this little tutorial and until next time
