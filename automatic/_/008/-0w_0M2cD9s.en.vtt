00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.390
 hello very good to all dear 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.119
 subscribers I'm here again with a 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.460
 collection video as you can see 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.919
 in the title in this case of figures 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.439
 custom that as I told you in a 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:33.890
 video that I made some time ago that I will leave you 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.050
 anyway down here 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.930
 which did not talk about the figures 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.239
 custom that are some scale figures 16 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.420
 that you can customize to give 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:47.149
 appearance of the video game character 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:51.470
 movie or whatever you want 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.420
 based on pieces molding his face and 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.640
 acquiring various accessories that 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:57.920
 define one of the characters that also 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.710
 It really struck me apart from John Marston 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.540
 As I said my previous video was a 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.729
 character in this game that so 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.350
 put here the cover of the modern 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.330
 warfare2 and maybe you have already seen 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.240
 a little since I'm raising the camera 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.509
 the character and that I want to talk about 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.610
 It is one jhon davis showmatch 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.979
 soldier here we have it here back as 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.869
 you can see a soldier who appeared in 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.080
 this game was also the protagonist 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.460
 we can remove the game from here and 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.460
 see it in all its splendor 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.330
 in a character that appeared in the 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.100
 first modern warfare game but no 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.380
 we saw his face 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.540
 they came out several images of him 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.340
 here you can see it even with the base 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.000
 personalized that I put modern warfare 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.240
 two 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.880
 We could see it but with a helmet in some 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.350
 images of the first modern warfare and no 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.030
 it was this modern warfare2 until it 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.370
 we could see the face as you can see 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.350
 It is very successful 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.090
 this face does not in fact I is not like the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.800
 from john marston that you are told that what 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.740
 he had sculpted he is made by a 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.340
 company which was commissioned in its 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.160
 time to do your part to take it out 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.990
 of the basis of modern customs 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.060
 warfare and sold the heads the truth 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.740
 I do not know now how much price I will be 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.980
 I took it for 15 dollars and as you can see 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:23.210
 So much is designed with the packaging at 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.070
 level of favelas that has the 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:30.510
 vest this anti tactical bullets the 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.850
 sas with the radio with the 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.070
 cartridge belts here back as you can see 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.470
 has added these grenades and this 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.780
 This smoke grenade 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.030
 fragmentation grenades that are from a 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.130
 Batman figure here back too 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.960
 Take a couple of chargers as you can 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.560
 see and the truth is that it's pretty 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.690
 achieved I also added the how you can 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.319
 see here that we're going a little bit more in 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.010
 detail 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.959
 a weapon of the game I think it was the 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.710
 karachi at that time in the modes 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.470
 warfare 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.700
 also customizable you compose as 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:10.599
 you can see has the look here 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.870
 the typical cylinder head and a charger and good 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.280
 this to aim better let's say this 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.379
 weapon I do not know exactly what 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.849
 I had soup on the level but let's say 

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:20.950
 that was my favorite on the online when 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.019
 I played modern warfare and nothing here is 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.250
 I wanted to buy the already gave the accessories 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.630
 You can also find them by 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.570
 separated 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:31.240
 and nadal or sunny all these are 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.310
 custom carache and I put it on and 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:37.540
 as you can see here a little more in 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.880
 detail also has a flashlight more 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.810
 cartridge belts the logo of the flag 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.430
 British slab the radio and if we continue 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.569
 going down also has an accessory here 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.090
 that is a gun a support pistol 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.940
 that can also be taken out 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.430
 I showed him another little gun 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.250
 support that is a beretta this is the 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.640
 classic pistol of the character that 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:06.090
 we could see in some video scenes 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:07.769
 like when he captures the character is at 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.440
 beginning of the level of the favela leads 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.019
 the classic beretta and apart here too 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:16.829
 we have a backpack to carry 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:18.720
 ammunition or extra grenades also 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.310
 Wear your classic knee brace as you know 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.600
 this character wears a knee brace in 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.940
 this level 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.669
 and some boots as you can see with 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.729
 real coordinates to be able to say 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.200
 run more faster us like the the 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.940
 snow camouflage wearing the 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.740
 typical how are we going then 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.310
 He wears the typical boots that I also 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.510
 liked the design but preferred to do this 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.190
 also as you see, he wears the gloves 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.789
 Characteristics that are not plastic 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.979
 they go on top of the clothes the clothes said 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.560
 on top of the mannequin of what comes to be 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.570
 The mannequin of the hands the body are 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.220
 pretty realistic and the black t-shirt 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.760
 that is also just call us the 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.890
 I bought 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.990
 and let's say he made a fix so that 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.630
 had shorter sleeves and such and 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.180
 to be able to adapt it to and now it 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.460
 taught a little more a plane of the face 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:09.610
 for you to see the excellent work 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.650
 who did it to dyn toys with the faces of 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.110
 these characters and well nothing was 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.330
 basically I wanted to show you this is 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.850
 figure and I tell you that it is a little more 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.500
 random that the network of redemption the 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:25.000
 Andrew's network we understood that I bought the 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:27.190
 suit and more or less that report where 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.990
 find each piece but this let's say 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.900
 that's not exactly where each 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.540
 it belongs as it is let 's say it is 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.520
 purchased from several web pages 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.680
 the vest I bought it on the one hand the 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.390
 shirt on the other pants on the other 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.480
 the head by another let's say it 's in 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.640
 the most random figure that I have 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.500
 as for taste and the truth is that I 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.400
 it was pretty good I do not know what you think 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.080
 you 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.330
 and that I do not expect anything that you liked 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.810
 here another more general view of 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.790
 character of the scj art de lashkar 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.670
 customized as you can see 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.780
 the beretta and here the base as I said 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.570
 can also be purchased online 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:10.110
 if I put a modern primer 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:11.850
 2 warfare that much auto and also had 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.500
 thought of making a design also for 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.810
 show of modern warfare 3 but I do not 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.180
 he really liked the costumes he had and 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.100
 let's say I left it like that they went to kids 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.430
 I hope you liked to leave also 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.470
 down the redemption network video 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.600
 so that you can also take a look at that 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.940
 custom in case you have not seen it since 

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.150
 It is an old video and nothing you know the 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.330
 like favorites he subscribed and until the 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.330
 following
