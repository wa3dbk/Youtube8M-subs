00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.900
 among them in an imaginary classical building 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.510

 platone painted with the appearance of Leonardo da Vinci 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.070
 he holds his work in hand 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.060
 and then gate with a finger 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.840
 indicates the world of ideas 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.990

 to earth 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.550
 on the left Socrates in a green dress 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.550
 dialogue with the group of people in front of him 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.090
 around them and other philosophers and mathematicians are gathered in groups i 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.230
 their followers 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.120
 further to the left there is the epicurean behind whom is present federico gonzaga 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.370
 child 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.369
 in the center in the foreground 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.730
 there is eraclito 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.520
 with the likeness of michelangelo that leans on the elbow on a great block 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.060
 while on the far right we find contracts of the Bramante Euclid 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.580
 who draws earth 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.030
 besides it was figured Pythagoras

 intent on writing about a book 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.750
 only woman of the scene on the left 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.640
 and the mathematics of alexandria hypatia 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.690
 that seems to be the only character who looks at the viewer 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.889
 fresh 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:17.199
 no one else seems to be interested in making contact with 

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:19.409
 the observer 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:24.329
 finally the two young men who are on the far right invest contemporary 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.370
 the era of the creation of the prisco are raffaello's self-portraits 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.080
 same 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.479

 preparatory carton drawn by the same raffaello preserved in the 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.529
 this figure does not appear in the Ambrosian art gallery of Milan 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:50.309
 probably the author after seeing the work of michelangelo in the chapel 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:54.389
 Sistine felt compelled to add the portrait to arrive in 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.879
 his fresco giving it the appearance of the Greek philosopher 

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:03.619

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.969
 Aristotle and Plato 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.289
 almost as if to indicate that the true 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:12.359
 initiates the characteristics intuited by these two philosophers considered the 

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.359
 center of the development of Western thought
