00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.400
 Why is the background of the Bible important? 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.780
 If the text is out of context 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.140
 Text becomes a material that can produce a variety of different meanings 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.000
 Sometimes someone asks me 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.100
 Why do I need to know these extra things - 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:31.020
 Bible background or foreground, history, archaeology, language, etc. 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.200
 The main reason is 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.340
 Text only makes sense in certain situations 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.860
 For example, the word "row" 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:48.360
 In one sentence, it can represent the "one row" seat in the stadium. 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.160
 In other situations 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.340
 May refer to an activity row as a verb 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.620
 "Draw, draw, plan" your ship 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.680
 In the UK, there is a third situation 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.300
 "row" can mean an argument, a fight 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.440
 Independently existing words have no meaning 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.540
 Text only makes sense in context 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.220
 When talking about the Bible 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.480
 It is very important to grasp the true meaning of the text. 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.520
 To do this, you must know the background, the prospects 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.460
 There are also various situational issues 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.420
 Sometimes students will come and tell me 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.000
 Learning the background of the Bible and the context of the scriptures are superfluous 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.400
 Maybe it’s good, but it’s not necessary 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.500
 Some students even came forward to tell me after finishing the New Testament history lesson: 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.180
 Professor Ben, I don't know why I want to learn these backgrounds. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.500
 Why can't I stand on the podium? 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.060
 The Holy Spirit will naturally give me words! 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.940
 I said: Charlie, you can do that. 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.700
 But unfortunately, you don't have more materials for the Holy Spirit. 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.880
 If the text only makes sense in context 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.140
 We must know the scriptures in the original context of the Bible. 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.000
 Including history, archaeology, language, rhetoric, etc. 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.891
 The key point is 

00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:21.360
 Must accurately grasp the background of the Bible 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.540
 Especially history and archaeology 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.580
 Share a tool that can be used to get started 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.740
 My colleague Professor Craig Keener 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.580
 Wrote a very popular book, The New Testament Background Notes 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.540
 As the title suggests 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.220
 He provides background, prospects, situations, etc. 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.980
 Let you understand the text in a reasonable situation 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.680
 Background information can be very interesting 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.420
 Let the text come back to life in a variety of different ways 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.100
 for instance 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.960
 The famous event of Mark 8 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.740
 The incident occurred in Caesarea Philippi outside the Holy City 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.120
 Jesus led the disciples to the outskirts of Galilee 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.198
 Came to the city named Caesarea Philippi 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.180
 Named after Caesar and Herod 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.520
 Jesus took the disciples to that 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.060
 Ask them to say: People say who I am 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.020
 They said: Someone said that it was the resurrection of John the Baptist 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.100
 Some people say that Elijah is also said to be one of Jeremiah or the prophet. 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:49.860
 Jesus pointed to the disciples and asked: Who do you say I am? 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.480
 Peter raised his hand to answer 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.520
 I know! You are Christ, the son of the living God. 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.020
 Jesus said: Yes! 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.460
 The unique thing about this is that 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.080
 Not only communication with each other 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.340
 What’s really interesting is 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.520
 Why did the conversation take place in Caesarea Philippi outside the Holy City? 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.860
 It is a pagan city 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.400
 Formerly known as "Banias", it is the city of Pan Shen 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.660
 There is a cave in the local area called Pan Shen Cave. 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.780
 There are water springs coming out from there 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.200
 Legends will flow to the River Styx 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.460
 The river of the dead 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.320
 According to pagan mythology 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.680
 The deceased will get on board 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.020
 By the ferry Karon will take them to the underworld 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.800
 This city where Jesus is standing 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.600
 a god full of all kinds of pagan gods 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:59.600
 Why did Jesus bring Jewish disciples to this place? 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.159
 Ask them here, "Who am I?" 

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:03.800
 Why is this here? 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:09.160
 Because Jesus wants to declare: I am the Son of God. 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.260
 Other idols are not 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:21.180
 Whether it is Apollo, Pan, Zeus, Venus or Aphrodite 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.460
 Or any pagan god you want to see. 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.330
 They are imitators, I am the winner 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.640
 They are imitators, I am real 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.420
 Jesus took his disciples to this environment 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:42.940
 Let them understand that He is not only the Jewish Messiah. 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.960
 More the savior of the world 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.340
 He is the Lord Christ, the only child of God. 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.100
 He is not one of the sons of the gods but the only begotten Son of God. 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.220
 Jesus took his disciples to this place. 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.800
 Make them have to rethink who He is 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.600
 At the same time, facing the world's discussion of various gods 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.100
 If the text is out of context 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.580
 Text becomes a material that can produce a variety of different meanings 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.280
 Why is it to study the Bible in the original situation? 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.080
 And doing this every day 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.960
 Please think hard 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.940
