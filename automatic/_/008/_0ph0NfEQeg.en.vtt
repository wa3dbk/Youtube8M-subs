00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
control pods in tobacco when you're

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.569 
control pods in tobacco when you're
facing<00:00:37.050> out<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.440> back<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:38.309> want<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.489> be

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
facing out the back you want to be

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.130 
facing out the back you want to be
comfortable<00:00:38.969> in<00:00:39.120> that<00:00:39.300> machine<00:00:39.450> City<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.989> be

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
comfortable in that machine City to be

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.650 
comfortable in that machine City to be
as<00:00:40.469> efficient<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.040> effective<00:00:41.100> as<00:00:41.550> possible

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
as efficient and effective as possible

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.060 
as efficient and effective as possible
so<00:00:42.660> we've<00:00:42.809> made<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.260> control<00:00:43.649> pods<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.980> are

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
so we've made a control pods that are

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.190 
so we've made a control pods that are
adjustable<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.700> both<00:00:44.850> directions<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:46.050> can

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
adjustable in both directions so you can

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.720 
adjustable in both directions so you can
pull<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.469> fore<00:00:46.649> aft<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.100> adjust<00:00:47.430> any

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
pull in the fore aft and adjust any

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.150 
pull in the fore aft and adjust any
multiple<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.300> position<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.469> also<00:00:49.860> with

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
multiple of position and also with

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
multiple of position and also with
inboard/outboard<00:00:50.660> okay<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.719> operator<00:00:52.230> can

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
inboard/outboard okay so operator can

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.229 
inboard/outboard okay so operator can
set<00:00:52.440> those<00:00:52.829> customizing<00:00:53.550> exactly<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> way<00:00:54.210> he

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
set those customizing exactly the way he

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.920 
set those customizing exactly the way he
was<00:00:54.600> now<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.930> electronic

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
was now is that just on on electronic

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.869 
was now is that just on on electronic
control<00:00:58.289> for<00:00:58.500> those<00:00:58.770> pilot<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> hydraulic

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
control for those pilot the hydraulic

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.389 
control for those pilot the hydraulic
that's<00:01:00.510> on<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:01.140> our<00:01:01.350> pilot<00:01:01.770> control<00:01:02.100> receiver

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
that's on all our pilot control receiver

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.399 
that's on all our pilot control receiver
so<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.090> you've<00:01:03.239> got<00:01:03.359> pilot<00:01:03.780> controls<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.320> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
so if you've got pilot controls on the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.710 
so if you've got pilot controls on the
back<00:01:04.729> you're<00:01:05.729> gonna<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.060> those<00:01:06.180> adjustable

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
whatever and your diff lock okay so now

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.490 
whatever and your diff lock okay so now
when<00:01:46.270> you're<00:01:46.390> doing<00:01:46.479> load<00:01:46.780> of<00:01:46.899> work<00:01:47.020> you're<00:01:47.350> in

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
when you're doing load of work you're in

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.080 
when you're doing load of work you're in
the<00:01:47.619> pile<00:01:47.859> we've<00:01:48.340> got<00:01:48.459> one<00:01:48.640> hand<00:01:48.819> on<00:01:49.000> the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
the pile we've got one hand on the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.179 
the pile we've got one hand on the
steering<00:01:49.270> wheel<00:01:49.450> one<00:01:50.380> on<00:01:50.530> them<00:01:50.739> that<00:01:50.920> loader

steering wheel one on them that loader

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.760 
steering wheel one on them that loader
control<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.689> you<00:01:52.929> don't<00:01:52.959> have<00:01:53.229> to<00:01:53.349> be<00:01:53.470> moving

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770

around and operating in the other
picture<00:01:55.000> down<00:01:55.360> yeah<00:01:55.780> that's<00:01:56.020> gonna<00:01:56.170> make<00:01:56.349> a

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
picture down yeah that's gonna make a

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.839 
picture down yeah that's gonna make a
difference<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.860> some<00:01:57.039> folk<00:01:57.219> we're<00:01:57.369> gonna<00:01:57.579> set

00:01:57.839 --> 00:01:57.849 
difference to some folk we're gonna set

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:58.949 
difference to some folk we're gonna set
up<00:01:57.969> we've<00:01:58.119> heard<00:01:58.270> a<00:01:58.329> lot<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.509> positive

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
up we've heard a lot of positive

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:01.619 
up we've heard a lot of positive
feedback<00:01:59.489> various<00:02:00.489> issues<00:02:00.640> but<00:02:01.329> it's<00:02:01.450> not

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:01.629 
feedback various issues but it's not

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:04.380 
feedback various issues but it's not
just<00:02:01.869> about<00:02:01.959> the<00:02:02.289> cab<00:02:02.950> and<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.579> and<00:02:03.909> those

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
just about the cab and and and those

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.050 
just about the cab and and and those
those<00:02:04.869> kinds<00:02:05.289> of<00:02:05.439> aspects<00:02:06.069> of<00:02:06.280> productivity

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
those kinds of aspects of productivity

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.490 
those kinds of aspects of productivity
there's<00:02:07.450> also<00:02:07.629> a<00:02:07.780> pretty<00:02:07.989> significant

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
there's also a pretty significant

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.139 
there's also a pretty significant
efficiency<00:02:08.979> advantage<00:02:09.399> with<00:02:09.549> this<00:02:09.640> year<00:02:09.910> for

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
efficiency advantage with this year for

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.780 
efficiency advantage with this year for
final<00:02:11.049> version<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.769> backhoe<00:02:11.980> right<00:02:12.340> yeah

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
final version of the backhoe right yeah

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.250 
final version of the backhoe right yeah
of<00:02:13.000> course<00:02:13.180> right<00:02:13.390> now<00:02:13.540> fuel<00:02:13.870> costs<00:02:14.170> are

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
of course right now fuel costs are

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.509 
of course right now fuel costs are
pretty<00:02:14.379> nice<00:02:14.620> but<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.069> know<00:02:15.099> we'll<00:02:15.340> you<00:02:15.400> know

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
pretty nice but you know we'll you know

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.680 
pretty nice but you know we'll you know
they're<00:02:15.670> probably<00:02:15.879> not<00:02:16.060> gonna<00:02:16.209> stay<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.540> way

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
they're probably not gonna stay that way

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.300 
they're probably not gonna stay that way
yeah<00:02:17.170> let's<00:02:17.440> hope<00:02:17.560> they<00:02:17.739> stay<00:02:17.769> down<00:02:18.129> there

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
yeah let's hope they stay down there

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.580 
yeah let's hope they stay down there
forever<00:02:18.489> what<00:02:19.180> we've<00:02:19.360> done<00:02:19.510> some<00:02:19.989> things<00:02:20.170> for

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
forever what we've done some things for

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.340 
forever what we've done some things for
fuel<00:02:20.829> efficiency<00:02:21.720> transmission<00:02:22.720> wise<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:23.109> now

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
fuel efficiency transmission wise we now

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.379 
fuel efficiency transmission wise we now
have<00:02:23.650> available<00:02:23.829> an<00:02:24.489> optional<00:02:24.940> lock-up

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:25.389 
have available an optional lock-up

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.180 
have available an optional lock-up
torque<00:02:25.420> converter<00:02:25.959> okay<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.920> if<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.100> were

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
torque converter okay so if you were

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.620 
torque converter okay so if you were
doing<00:02:27.220> a<00:02:27.400> lot<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:27.579> roading<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.269> machine

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
doing a lot of roading on that machine

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:30.910 
doing a lot of roading on that machine
when<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:30.020> get<00:02:30.170> into<00:02:30.290> high<00:02:30.470> gear<00:02:30.500> the

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
when you get into high gear the

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.410 
when you get into high gear the
converter<00:02:31.370> is<00:02:31.520> going<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.700> lock<00:02:31.880> up<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:32.330> like

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
converter is going to lock up it's like

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.910 
converter is going to lock up it's like
going<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.750> direct-drive<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.530> you're<00:02:33.620> gonna<00:02:33.740> be

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
going a direct-drive and you're gonna be

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.070 
going a direct-drive and you're gonna be
more<00:02:34.130> effective<00:02:34.640> higher<00:02:34.880> ground<00:02:35.180> speeds<00:02:35.540> and

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
more effective higher ground speeds and

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.290 
more effective higher ground speeds and
you're<00:02:36.350> saving<00:02:36.560> fuel<00:02:36.910> people<00:02:37.910> have<00:02:38.000> seen<00:02:38.150> up

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
you're saving fuel people have seen up

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.470 
you're saving fuel people have seen up
to<00:02:38.330> 25<00:02:38.810> percent<00:02:39.170> reduction<00:02:39.260> in<00:02:39.860> fuel<00:02:40.480> in

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
to 25 percent reduction in fuel in

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.690 
to 25 percent reduction in fuel in
roading<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.020> with<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.290> vodka<00:02:42.590> okay<00:02:43.070> okay<00:02:43.520> now

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
roading is with the vodka okay okay now

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.520 
roading is with the vodka okay okay now
is<00:02:43.850> it<00:02:43.970> when<00:02:44.480> you<00:02:44.570> say<00:02:44.720> roading<00:02:45.050> is<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:45.230> that

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
is it when you say roading is that that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.350 
is it when you say roading is that that
typically<00:02:46.130> an<00:02:46.550> advantage<00:02:47.000> just<00:02:47.150> for

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
typically an advantage just for

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.050 
typically an advantage just for
transport<00:02:47.990> or<00:02:48.200> are<00:02:48.560> people<00:02:48.890> actually<00:02:49.060> doing

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
transport or are people actually doing

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.310 
transport or are people actually doing
load<00:02:50.330> and<00:02:50.480> carry<00:02:50.660> water<00:02:50.870> they're<00:02:51.110> going<00:02:51.260> to

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
load and carry water they're going to

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.110 
load and carry water they're going to
get<00:02:51.410> better<00:02:51.710> benefits<00:02:52.280> out<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.460> that<00:02:52.730> you'll

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
get better benefits out of that you'll

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.940 
get better benefits out of that you'll
see<00:02:53.270> some<00:02:53.540> benefit<00:02:53.990> in<00:02:54.020> load<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.560> carry<00:02:54.740> but

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
see some benefit in load and carry but

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.890 
see some benefit in load and carry but
the<00:02:55.040> big<00:02:55.190> part<00:02:55.430> is<00:02:55.640> especially<00:02:56.240> governmental

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
the big part is especially governmental

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.680 
yeah you're not gonna see a huge
advantage<00:03:13.730> because<00:03:13.880> you're<00:03:14.210> not<00:03:14.330> doing<00:03:14.630> a

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
advantage because you're not doing a

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.059 
advantage because you're not doing a
liner

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
liner

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.000 
liner
Yeah<00:03:17.060> right<00:03:17.780> another<00:03:18.230> improvement<00:03:18.530> we<00:03:18.799> made

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
Yeah right another improvement we made

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.729 
Yeah right another improvement we made
was<00:03:19.280> we've<00:03:19.610> got<00:03:19.730> an<00:03:19.849> eco<00:03:20.150> mode<00:03:20.180> right<00:03:21.170> ok<00:03:21.709> so

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
was we've got an eco mode right ok so

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.229 
was we've got an eco mode right ok so
there's<00:03:22.069> an<00:03:22.189> eco<00:03:22.430> mode<00:03:22.459> button<00:03:22.640> you<00:03:23.090> can

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
there's an eco mode button you can

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.630 
there's an eco mode button you can
select<00:03:23.390> that<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.799> it's<00:03:25.069> controlling<00:03:25.430> two

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
select that and it's controlling two

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.890 
select that and it's controlling two
things<00:03:25.909> you<00:03:26.120> know<00:03:26.239> we've<00:03:26.420> got<00:03:26.629> the<00:03:26.750> load

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
things you know we've got the load

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.589 
things you know we've got the load

productivity so saving fuel again we've

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.890 
productivity so saving fuel again we've
seen<00:03:46.280> between<00:03:46.489> standard<00:03:47.120> mode<00:03:47.269> and<00:03:47.450> eco<00:03:47.689> mode

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
seen between standard mode and eco mode

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.740 
seen between standard mode and eco mode
about<00:03:48.799> 20<00:03:49.189> percent<00:03:49.549> fuel<00:03:50.060> savings<00:03:50.569> with

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
about 20 percent fuel savings with

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.960 
about 20 percent fuel savings with
virtually<00:03:51.379> no<00:03:51.530> drop<00:03:51.859> in<00:03:52.040> productivity<00:03:52.250> Wow

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
virtually no drop in productivity Wow

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.929 
virtually no drop in productivity Wow
Wow<00:03:53.540> that's<00:03:53.959> from<00:03:54.919> standard<00:03:55.340> mode<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.669> eco

00:03:55.929 --> 00:03:55.939 
Wow that's from standard mode to eco

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.429 
Wow that's from standard mode to eco
mode<00:03:56.120> that's<00:03:56.389> correct<00:03:56.599> okay<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:56.989> when<00:03:57.349> you

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
mode that's correct okay so when you

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.699 
mode that's correct okay so when you
when<00:03:57.739> you<00:03:57.859> compare<00:03:58.250> standard<00:03:59.150> mode<00:03:59.359> in<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.439> f2

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
when you compare standard mode in the f2

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.069 
when you compare standard mode in the f2
to<00:04:01.250> standard<00:04:01.760> mode<00:04:01.790> in<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.180> F<00:04:02.329> what<00:04:02.599> is<00:04:02.930> that

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
to standard mode in the F what is that

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.140 
to standard mode in the F what is that
is<00:04:03.319> that<00:04:03.439> equivalent<00:04:03.739> or<00:04:04.069> yeah<00:04:04.370> for<00:04:04.970> most

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
is that equivalent or yeah for most

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.520 
is that equivalent or yeah for most
people<00:04:05.480> you're<00:04:05.629> gonna<00:04:05.720> see<00:04:05.989> as<00:04:06.139> they<00:04:06.319> move

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
people you're gonna see as they move

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.619 
people you're gonna see as they move
from<00:04:06.739> Tier<00:04:07.040> four<00:04:07.099> to<00:04:07.489> Tier<00:04:07.669> four<00:04:07.730> final<00:04:08.450> which

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
from Tier four to Tier four final which

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.229 
from Tier four to Tier four final which
this<00:04:08.780> machine<00:04:08.959> is<00:04:09.349> that<00:04:10.040> fuel<00:04:10.609> consumption<00:04:11.150> in

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
this machine is that fuel consumption in

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.920 
this machine is that fuel consumption in
general<00:04:11.269> has<00:04:11.689> increased<00:04:12.109> there<00:04:12.459> okay<00:04:13.489> so<00:04:13.930> in

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
general has increased there okay so in

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.689 
general has increased there okay so in
in<00:04:15.379> standard<00:04:16.009> mode<00:04:16.039> you're<00:04:16.310> gonna<00:04:16.400> see<00:04:16.669> a

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
in standard mode you're gonna see a

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.599 
in standard mode you're gonna see a
slight<00:04:17.030> increase<00:04:17.060> in<00:04:17.750> fuel<00:04:18.530> use<00:04:19.009> it's<00:04:19.280> okay

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
slight increase in fuel use it's okay

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.099 
slight increase in fuel use it's okay
more<00:04:20.879> than<00:04:21.090> make<00:04:21.239> up<00:04:21.389> for<00:04:21.449> that<00:04:21.719> when<00:04:21.989> you

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
more than make up for that when you

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.129 
more than make up for that when you
Swiss<00:04:22.349> a<00:04:22.500> eco<00:04:22.800> mode<00:04:23.009> and

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.770 

tame<00:04:25.740> engine<00:04:26.039> horsepower<00:04:26.220> rating<00:04:26.940> same<00:04:27.569> kind

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
tame engine horsepower rating same kind

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.350 
tame engine horsepower rating same kind
of<00:04:27.840> performance<00:04:28.410> out<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.590> this<00:04:28.770> engine<00:04:29.360> but

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
of performance out of this engine but

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.570 
of performance out of this engine but
now<00:04:30.479> you've<00:04:30.690> got<00:04:30.840> a<00:04:30.900> selective<00:04:31.710> catalytic

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
now you've got a selective catalytic

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.300 
now you've got a selective catalytic
reduction<00:04:32.699> system<00:04:33.479> that's<00:04:34.199> right<00:04:34.470> yeah<00:04:34.740> the

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
reduction system that's right yeah the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.800 
reduction system that's right yeah the
way<00:04:35.430> we're<00:04:35.639> meeting<00:04:35.909> Tier<00:04:36.120> four<00:04:36.180> and<00:04:36.569> it's<00:04:36.690> a

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
way we're meeting Tier four and it's a

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.330 
way we're meeting Tier four and it's a
pretty<00:04:36.990> conventional<00:04:37.289> system<00:04:37.949> not<00:04:38.129> that<00:04:38.250> we

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
pretty conventional system not that we

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.950 
pretty conventional system not that we
have<00:04:38.460> a<00:04:38.490> huge<00:04:38.729> breakthrough<00:04:39.030> there<00:04:39.389> yeah<00:04:39.750> but

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
have a huge breakthrough there yeah but

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.589 
have a huge breakthrough there yeah but
we've<00:04:40.470> got<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.740> diesel<00:04:41.039> exhaust<00:04:41.159> fluid<00:04:41.599> and

00:04:42.589 --> 00:04:42.599 
we've got the diesel exhaust fluid and

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.330 
we've got the diesel exhaust fluid and
we've<00:04:42.840> got<00:04:42.990> about<00:04:43.139> a<00:04:43.199> five<00:04:43.409> gallon<00:04:43.620> tank<00:04:44.039> for

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
we've got about a five gallon tank for

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.670 
we've got about a five gallon tank for
death<00:04:44.759> and<00:04:45.629> you'd<00:04:45.840> probably<00:04:46.020> be<00:04:46.259> filling<00:04:46.590> that

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
death and you'd probably be filling that

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.520 
death and you'd probably be filling that
every<00:04:47.009> third<00:04:47.250> or<00:04:47.400> fourth<00:04:47.849> fuel<00:04:48.150> fill<00:04:48.419> okay<00:04:49.020> and

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
every third or fourth fuel fill okay and

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.200 
every third or fourth fuel fill okay and
so<00:04:49.770> we<00:04:49.979> were<00:04:50.099> able<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.430> eliminate<00:04:50.580> the<00:04:50.909> diesel

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
so we were able to eliminate the diesel

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.029 
so we were able to eliminate the diesel
particulate<00:04:51.599> filter<00:04:51.720> on<00:04:52.229> these<00:04:52.379> machines<00:04:52.560> but

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
particulate filter on these machines but

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.770 
particulate filter on these machines but
one<00:04:53.340> other<00:04:53.520> thing<00:04:53.759> I<00:04:53.909> might<00:04:54.120> mention<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.599> you

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
one other thing I might mention to you

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.270 
one other thing I might mention to you
is<00:04:54.810> we've<00:04:55.349> added<00:04:55.530> a<00:04:55.680> new<00:04:55.830> machine<00:04:56.009> in<00:04:56.250> our

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
is we've added a new machine in our

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.600 
is we've added a new machine in our
product<00:04:56.669> lineup<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.870> that's<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.199> 4:15<00:04:58.889> okay

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
product lineup and that's the 4:15 okay

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.779

so the 4:15 is as if you think of our

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:06.050 
so the 4:15 is as if you think of our
416<00:05:03.479> that<00:05:04.349> used<00:05:04.530> to<00:05:04.620> be<00:05:04.770> our<00:05:04.919> entry-level<00:05:05.280> 14th

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
416 that used to be our entry-level 14th

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.920 
416 that used to be our entry-level 14th
floor<00:05:06.180> back<00:05:06.449> though<00:05:06.659> now<00:05:07.440> we<00:05:07.500> bring<00:05:07.800> into<00:05:07.979> 415

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
floor back though now we bring into 415

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.029 
floor back though now we bring into 415
f2<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:11.030> especially<00:05:12.030> on<00:05:12.150> a<00:05:12.210> 416<00:05:12.900> chassis<00:05:13.169> we've

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
f2 and especially on a 416 chassis we've

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:15.469 
f2 and especially on a 416 chassis we've
got<00:05:14.220> a<00:05:14.250> smaller<00:05:14.580> powertrain<00:05:15.180> in<00:05:15.360> there

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
got a smaller powertrain in there

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:16.820 
got a smaller powertrain in there
smaller<00:05:15.810> engine

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
smaller engine

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.089 
smaller engine
so<00:05:17.490> down<00:05:17.669> at<00:05:17.849> about<00:05:17.940> 68<00:05:18.449> necklace<00:05:19.199> power<00:05:19.440> still

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
so down at about 68 necklace power still

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.450 
so down at about 68 necklace power still
salad<00:05:20.940> performance<00:05:21.539> but<00:05:22.319> with<00:05:22.889> the<00:05:23.039> emissions

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460

requirement<00:05:24.030> that<00:05:24.150> allows<00:05:24.659> us<00:05:24.690> to<00:05:24.960> meet

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
requirement that allows us to meet

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.320 
requirement that allows us to meet
emissions<00:05:25.740> without<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.819> need<00:05:27.000> for<00:05:27.030> heat

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
emissions without the need for heat
