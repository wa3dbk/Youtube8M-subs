small amount of hero's range there
behind<00:00:46.720> here<00:00:47.170> is<00:00:47.290> river<00:00:47.590> threes<00:00:48.630> but<00:00:49.630> they're

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 
behind here is river threes but they're

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
you know near near nut hands I think

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.800 
you know near near nut hands I think
it's<00:00:51.820> fair<00:00:52.000> to<00:00:52.060> say<00:00:52.120> ninety<00:00:52.540> five<00:00:52.690> percent

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
it's fair to say ninety five percent

it's fair to say ninety five percent

thing<00:01:21.790> about<00:01:22.270> these<00:01:22.390> equity<00:01:22.750> distributions

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
thing about these equity distributions

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.680 
thing about these equity distributions
is<00:01:23.470> the<00:01:23.530> fact<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:23.890> hero<00:01:24.700> has<00:01:24.940> almost<00:01:25.420> all

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
you know some some real not hands some

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.270 
you know some some real not hands some
pretty<00:01:31.750> much<00:01:31.869> near<00:01:32.110> not<00:01:32.260> hands<00:01:32.650> and<00:01:32.830> then<00:01:33.250> a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
pretty much near not hands and then a

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.530 
pretty much near not hands and then a
bunch<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.580> other<00:01:33.760> stuff<00:01:34.000> down<00:01:34.210> here<00:01:34.390> at<00:01:34.450> the

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
bunch of other stuff down here at the

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.090 
bunch of other stuff down here at the
bottom<00:01:34.810> right<00:01:34.869> with<00:01:35.229> with<00:01:35.619> little<00:01:35.950> to<00:01:36.070> no

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
bottom right with with little to no

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.120 
bottom right with with little to no
equity<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:37.930> can<00:01:38.049> see<00:01:38.170> here<00:01:38.320> that<00:01:38.500> even

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
equity so you can see here that even

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.530 
equity so you can see here that even
though<00:01:39.220> hero<00:01:39.460> is<00:01:39.580> average<00:01:39.970> equity<00:01:40.119> something

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
though hero is average equity something

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.170 
though hero is average equity something
like<00:01:40.630> fifty<00:01:40.869> percent<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:42.580> villains<00:01:42.939> range

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
like fifty percent and so villains range

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.000 
like fifty percent and so villains range
is<00:01:43.360> officer<00:01:43.600> our<00:01:44.049> villains<00:01:44.380> equity<00:01:44.680> is<00:01:44.770> also

is officer our villains equity is also

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.230 
is officer our villains equity is also
something<00:01:45.189> like<00:01:45.280> fifty<00:01:45.610> percent<00:01:45.640> you<00:01:46.180> know

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
something like fifty percent you know

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.050 
something like fifty percent you know
slightly<00:01:46.479> less<00:01:47.670> their<00:01:48.670> equity<00:01:48.970> is

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
slightly less their equity is

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.969 
slightly less their equity is
distributed<00:01:49.840> throughout<00:01:50.110> the<00:01:50.170> range<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.799> very

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
distributed throughout the range is very

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.250 
distributed throughout the range is very

something like 50% equity whereas you

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:57.480

100 or a very high equity in some of his

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.480 
100 or a very high equity in some of his
villains<00:02:00.250> have<00:02:00.400> villains<00:02:01.180> hands<00:02:01.420> have<00:02:02.490> very

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
villains have villains hands have very

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.740 
villains have villains hands have very
low<00:02:03.640> equity<00:02:03.970> so<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.210> is<00:02:04.330> stuff<00:02:04.479> we<00:02:04.570> talked

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
low equity so this is stuff we talked

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.749 
low equity so this is stuff we talked
about<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.140> book<00:02:05.290> a<00:02:05.380> lot<00:02:05.530> I'm<00:02:05.740> not<00:02:05.860> gonna<00:02:06.009> go

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
about in the book a lot I'm not gonna go

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.610 
about in the book a lot I'm not gonna go
over<00:02:06.790> it<00:02:07.150> a<00:02:07.180> ton<00:02:07.450> now<00:02:08.519> I'm<00:02:09.519> going<00:02:09.939> to<00:02:10.530> sort<00:02:11.530> of

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
over it a ton now I'm going to sort of

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.880 
over it a ton now I'm going to sort of
show<00:02:12.610> how<00:02:12.730> we<00:02:12.790> might<00:02:13.110> stylize<00:02:14.110> or<00:02:14.439> abstract

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
show how we might stylize or abstract

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.309 
show how we might stylize or abstract
these<00:02:15.189> these<00:02:15.909> ranges<00:02:16.540> needs<00:02:16.780> distributions

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
these these ranges needs distributions

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.630 
these these ranges needs distributions
out<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.620> bit

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
out a bit

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.900 
out a bit
then<00:02:18.760> set<00:02:19.450> up<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:21.220> know<00:02:21.340> set<00:02:21.550> up<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:21.760> game

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
then set up you know set up the game

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.460 
then set up you know set up the game
tree<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.360> gambit<00:02:25.020> okay<00:02:26.020> great

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
tree and gambit okay great

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.460 
tree and gambit okay great
so<00:02:27.120> let's<00:02:28.120> start<00:02:28.330> out<00:02:28.420> simply<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.050> then<00:02:29.230> later

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
so let's start out simply and then later

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.920 
so let's start out simply and then later
we'll<00:02:29.770> find<00:02:29.800> things<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.430> bit<00:02:30.580> so<00:02:31.569> to<00:02:31.810> get

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
we'll find things a bit so to get

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.690 
we'll find things a bit so to get
started<00:02:32.290> um<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.830> know<00:02:32.920> let's<00:02:33.040> make<00:02:33.220> the

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
started um you know let's make the

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.160 
started um you know let's make the
simplifying<00:02:34.300> assumption<00:02:34.750> that<00:02:34.780> we're

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
simplifying assumption that we're

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.470 
simplifying assumption that we're
essentially<00:02:35.530> dealing<00:02:35.860> with<00:02:36.130> a<00:02:36.550> polar<00:02:37.000> versus

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
essentially dealing with a polar versus

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.360 
essentially dealing with a polar versus
Bluff<00:02:37.660> catching<00:02:38.020> situation<00:02:38.530> here<00:02:38.709> and<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.340> are

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
Bluff catching situation here and we are

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.400 
Bluff catching situation here and we are
we<00:02:39.910> are<00:02:39.940> essentially<00:02:40.360> um<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.959> know<00:02:41.050> villain

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
we are essentially um you know villain

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.680 
we are essentially um you know villain
is<00:02:41.620> mostly<00:02:42.250> polar<00:02:42.520> ice<00:02:42.700> he<00:02:42.970> has<00:02:43.060> mostly<00:02:43.420> nuts

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
is mostly polar ice he has mostly nuts

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.290 
is mostly polar ice he has mostly nuts
or<00:02:43.900> air<00:02:44.050> and<00:02:44.380> Hiro<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.250> mostly<00:02:45.730> Bluff<00:02:45.970> catching

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
or air and Hiro is mostly Bluff catching

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.550 
or air and Hiro is mostly Bluff catching
you<00:02:46.420> know<00:02:46.510> there's<00:02:46.720> some<00:02:46.840> funniness<00:02:47.170> around

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
you know there's some funniness around

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.040 
you know there's some funniness around
the<00:02:47.680> edges<00:02:48.310> of<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.489> equity<00:02:48.850> distribution<00:02:49.420> but

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
the edges of the equity distribution but

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.479 
the edges of the equity distribution but
to<00:02:50.260> good<00:02:50.380> approximation<00:02:50.470> we're<00:02:51.190> dealing<00:02:51.459> with

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
to good approximation we're dealing with

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.370 
to good approximation we're dealing with
a<00:02:51.610> polar<00:02:52.570> burst<00:02:52.810> Bluff<00:02:53.050> catcher<00:02:53.260> situation<00:02:55.380> so

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
a polar burst Bluff catcher situation so

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.759 
a polar burst Bluff catcher situation so
same<00:02:57.310> equity<00:02:57.670> distribution<00:02:58.120> down<00:02:58.269> here<00:02:58.769> we

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
same equity distribution down here we

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.350 
same equity distribution down here we
see<00:02:59.980> that<00:03:00.160> in<00:03:00.430> this<00:03:00.760> you<00:03:01.030> know<00:03:01.090> with<00:03:01.269> this

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
see that in this you know with this

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.090 
see that in this you know with this
approximation<00:03:01.600> villain<00:03:02.530> has<00:03:02.739> something<00:03:03.070> like

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
approximation villain has something like

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.070 
approximation villain has something like
forty<00:03:03.580> percent<00:03:03.700> in<00:03:03.880> our<00:03:03.970> hands<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.510> something

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
forty percent in our hands and something

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.890 
forty percent in our hands and something
like<00:03:05.170> sixty<00:03:05.500> percent<00:03:05.650> air<00:03:06.269> hero<00:03:07.269> has<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.690> bluff

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
like sixty percent air hero has a bluff

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.140 
like sixty percent air hero has a bluff
catcher<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.470> then<00:03:09.280> there's<00:03:09.940> two<00:03:10.060> hundred

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
catcher and then there's two hundred

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.790 
catcher and then there's two hundred
eighty<00:03:10.480> chips<00:03:10.780> in<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.959> pot<00:03:11.110> and<00:03:11.350> three

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
eighty chips in the pot and three

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.160 
eighty chips in the pot and three
hundred<00:03:12.040> and<00:03:12.130> twenty<00:03:12.370> behind<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:13.600> what<00:03:13.900> is<00:03:13.989> the

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
hundred and twenty behind so what is the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.009 
hundred and twenty behind so what is the
equilibrium<00:03:14.610> grape<00:03:15.610> so<00:03:15.850> let<00:03:16.060> me<00:03:16.150> um<00:03:16.360> pull<00:03:16.900> up

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
equilibrium grape so let me um pull up

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.050 
equilibrium grape so let me um pull up
gambit<00:03:17.380> and<00:03:17.560> we'll<00:03:18.280> see<00:03:18.459> how<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.580> set<00:03:18.880> up<00:03:18.970> the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
gambit and we'll see how to set up the

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.120 
gambit and we'll see how to set up the
game<00:03:19.180> tree<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.690> working<00:03:20.560> on<00:03:20.620> solving<00:03:20.920> this

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
game tree and working on solving this

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:30.610 
game tree and working on solving this
sort<00:03:21.370> of<00:03:21.400> situation

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620
