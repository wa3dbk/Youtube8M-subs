00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 Hello everyone today I wanted to tell 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.849
 about motion sensor on iphone 4 which 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.609
 often 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:21.900
 sometimes fails the reason lies in when 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:27.840
 the device put a new screen module and it 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:36.079
 starts to compensate music very 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:39.390
 see here are two iPhones this four 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:44.989
 the difference is this is genuine 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:49.890
 original screen module and there goes sell 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:54.780
 the theme is they are different the difference is that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:58.610
 at one hole under the light sensor 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.610
 arranged perfectly 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.229
 in the hole of the body you can see them 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.470
 now 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:17.790
 exactly and neatly well in china 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:24.150
 Athens is prestige at the top and 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:27.270
 when the screen is put the screen is put they 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.790
 In principle, the sensor itself does not even fall 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:37.350
 there it solves this problem on sticky 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:40.940
 film then rubbing it up with a general marker 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.390
 this is complete bullshit is treated this differently 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.390
 but if 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.860
 as they say do it like this 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.899
 requires that in general here we must take 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.220
 neatly needle and here are these holes 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.190
 move just so that they 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.110
 were in that place where 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.110
 the manufacturer had provided 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 with 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.390
 but you see for yourself that these holes 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.080
 not located at all places where they 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.080
 should be located 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.390
 look I now pushed these holes 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.310
 make smooth round now 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.510
 they just hit the sensor 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.709
 approximations but sensor accordingly 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.269
 approximation will have to work I 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.269
 now everything was going to gather it and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.380
 I will definitely demonstrate these 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:53.209
 paint over holes and a blue marker in 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.209
 generally let's check 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:04.459
 Well, you see, everything works smoothly 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:08.069
 doom what and carefully examine and 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:10.470
 solve the problem of any malfunction 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:16.290
 there is no need to make a motion sensor 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:20.209
 will work in any color just 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:25.470
 there have been cases when we applied 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:29.579
 let's say we went into a dark room and 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:32.220
 The call sensor did not work for a person 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.549
 it stuck there like these stickers more 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.530
 Something in general problems precisely lies 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.630
 so here it is, thank you all for your attention 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.889
 I will still upload videos much 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.889
 more interesting
