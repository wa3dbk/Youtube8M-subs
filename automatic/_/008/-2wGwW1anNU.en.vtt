 tutorial like samsung tc as wifi as 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.240
 router 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.810
 well I do not know if very much a great many 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:21.820
 not that windows 7 windows 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.820
 brings a new tool 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.740
 use your pc as road is called wind fire 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:31.960
 virtual but that is activated by her real 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.070
 of the system as we will 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.170
 well we will enter the ccm of if they have 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.420
 windows or like me 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.100
 they can do it by giving the start key 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.870
 plus 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.460
 there are open that window and here 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.149
 is the system symbol as 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.149
 administrator 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.480
 when entering here 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.460
 you will not leave here to be able to reactivate 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.220
 we have some commands that in the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.590
 description 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.590
 these if the food 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:19.979
 that's what we paste here to paste 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:22.619
 and here where it says s this and like 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.219
 let's see where to put ourselves in that name 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.920
 we remove that and put the name that 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.689
 we want to give it and where it says it says 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.909
 4 we need to conquer it and 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.390
 also from password and we put 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.800
 our password 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.800
 by giving ether 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.850
 some data and they will say that it is 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:51.100
 from that we have to activate as 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.100
 putting another command but it is very very 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.490
 it is to say 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.900
 and I will also leave it in the description 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.549
 make it easier to give before going to the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.569
 net 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.950
 if he does not say that, it's because something is 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.550
 running badly on your computer 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.840
 remember 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.840
 usa uses the 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.620
 the wireless card that brings back 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.760
 that all species 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.790
 and on computers 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.540
 you should have a network card 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.489
 wireless 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.720
 and then give an account if they have a back 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.180
 antenita 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.600
 or I do not know if there will be some that do not have 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.400
 nothing 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.069
 but they have to have that to be able 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:46.840
 use your computer do not grab dude 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.840
 you know you can use it as a router 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.830
 after here after putting this it 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.830
 will make the network and we will go to resources 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.830
 shared 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.920
 here 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:09.270
 as you can see 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.730
 I have my network has black and point is 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.550
 mine 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.420
 created already here we are going to change the 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.420
 adapter configuration 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.230
 and in the normal connection the cable that 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.000
 we have 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.000
 we give you rights click 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.280
 in properties 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:38.500
 here we are going to shared use and here 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.200
 we put the network that we have put as 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.220
 as the wifi here is 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:48.610
 by putting it this will give us internet to 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.099
 that it transmits internet and so 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.840
 We can use it with our phone with 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:54.840
 our the actor and everything 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.600
 I just had to put 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.600
 the same command 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:08.070
 but with this 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.920
 and here is nothing is to access peter to 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:22.670
 well I hope to say it if they have any 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:22.670
 doubt write me 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.590
 that they do well
