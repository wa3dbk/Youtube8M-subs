00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:08.960
 your your spiritual life of 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.960
 rivalries that comes to join us 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.960

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:29.439
 you are an absolute fan of strangers 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:32.780
 What was the trigger 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.220
 ah yes ah yes wait i was watching I 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:41.570
 will you lend a microphone it was not 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:43.490
 planned but come here and eric pib that's the 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.910
 cloud cloud sigoulès and when it was me mar 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.800
 vivo 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.900
 no it's true that when I was handed 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.590
 my birth record and that I read 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.920
 written on it 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.960
 born of unknown father this is where I get 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.160
 am I told fate who decided that 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.050
 in a way I was their 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.730
 girl that's why since I try 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.590
 to look like them so here I am 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.330
 whole except a big one and a black shot 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.330
 that's what makes the personality 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.700
 except change of lane and in good black spot 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.760
 on the other hand to ben yes then that's it 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.930
 the part goes from the knee to the inter 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.950
 leave to choose the parts and finally 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.100
 I chose the most 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.150
 interesting 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.660
 no but you know I think mostly about 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.670
 today 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.680
 france black white butter for me 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.800
 it is outdated and I find that 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:34.100
 unknown represents France big blah 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.270
 show that is for me the new face 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.270
 from this country that parent poor 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.649
 this transformation and riku that one 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.869
 can see these huge here that it's a 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.190
 everyday work I say yes 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.979
 it's true that it did not happen without 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.780
 difficulty then for the party 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.820
 black I inoculated myself with singing 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.200
 Caribbean then there from the first 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.850
 injection i was taken from a desire there 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.720
 are and irrepressible to work at 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.720
 the post office or the tax hotel 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.750
 I plant how much I told myself 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.430
 that it was a little cliché is managed 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.500
 radically change of focus 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.229
 so that today I am help 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.150
 caregiver at the hospital bichat still the 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.500
 party a show it's very simple ben 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.799
 here I shaved my head and without 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.480
 pain 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.040
 especially since it's a tradition in my 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.010
 family since my grandmother was 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:23.980
 shaved on release 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:26.230
 and then bah for each other the other 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.390
 part the voluminous part subscribers 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.180
 I've been to see a taxidermist and I'm 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.099
 surrounded by straw not said but precisely 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.230
 there is one thing that you have to 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.569
 do not talk about doing it normally 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.769
 it is true that it is an alias there 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.420
 so that was a way of making them 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.409
 private tribute in fact these are the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.230
 first syllables 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:45.730
 So that's Pascal Didier Bernard Baudoux 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.810
 so sometimes I say I have the 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.030
 luck because he remember himself by 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.849
 example fate n dominique and michel soret 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.319
 is sodomy and frankly I think that 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.010
 the rules on dory is much more 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.030
 pure to bring then arrived we are delighted 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.650
 to welcome you either because 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.970
 you are an absolute fan and now you 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.450
 have them in front of you that must me 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.450
 do something 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.450
 so that's pretty disappointing 1 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.709
 it's a little embarrassing because I'm here 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.079
 I like them a lot but very recently 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.060
 I deported all affection love 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.170
 that I had for them for another 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.340
 artist named jonathan lambert 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.470
 when I do not know if you know him 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.879
 so him it's something to north 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.370
 bay wait I do not know if you have 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.680
 seen lately he was invited in a 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.720
 emission of alessandra sublet see 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.829
 this cute girl host really 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.129
 there are good she did not invent water 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:36.060
 hot but it's because we live in 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.060
 this phase he was waiting 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.060
 then one evening she makes a show 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.980
 the kind of prime time as they say where 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.680
 she receives the strangers at my house if 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.909
 you remember this trio a little bit 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.030
 trio of comics a little vintage of 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.440
 good 90s and there is a jonathan 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.930
 lambert who landed who made a 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.610
 sketch where he pretended to be a 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.140
 wine d so it was it was a mixture 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.459
 of the three of which he is a bit black a little 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.650
 big to a pig it was really very 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.269
 very funny and in the end not of anything at the 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.620
 end of his skit he is there like that and 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.049
 he takes out of his pocket his dvd in 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.599
 explaining that his defense dvd members 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:15.810
 hanging in all the good during is 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:17.549
 dedicated to doing that by the water when 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.959
 the new year and that I found 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.959

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.540

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.340
