question I'm going to tell you make it
easier<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.420> all<00:00:24.420> right<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:25.530> is<00:00:25.680> obviously

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190 
easier on all right this is obviously

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.430 
easier on all right this is obviously
this<00:00:26.520> was<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:26.940> new<00:00:27.150> product<00:00:27.690> because<00:00:27.990> we

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:28.440 
this was the new product because we

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.850 
this was the new product because we
originally<00:00:28.830> had<00:00:29.070> two<00:00:29.100> 600<00:00:30.380> great<00:00:31.380> product

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
originally had two 600 great product

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.580 
originally had two 600 great product
tons<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.369> issues<00:00:32.930> not<00:00:33.930> going<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.170> get<00:00:34.289> into<00:00:34.530> all

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
tons of issues not going to get into all

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.819 
tons of issues not going to get into all
that<00:00:34.680> new<00:00:35.430> product<00:00:36.020> improvements<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.199> you<00:00:37.680> can

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
that new product improvements as you can

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.740 
that new product improvements as you can
see<00:00:38.039> this<00:00:38.219> one's<00:00:38.430> bigger<00:00:38.899> the<00:00:39.899> rx<00:00:40.730> now<00:00:41.750> the

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
see this one's bigger the rx now the

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.500 
see this one's bigger the rx now the
main<00:00:43.020> difference<00:00:43.470> is<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.850> of<00:00:44.850> course<00:00:45.300> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
main difference is the of course the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.150 
main difference is the of course the
motor<00:00:45.720> is<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.960> little<00:00:46.200> stronger<00:00:46.500> obviously

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
motor is a little stronger obviously

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.410 
motor is a little stronger obviously
it's<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.399> twice<00:00:47.790> the<00:00:48.030> size<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.600> thing

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
it's like twice the size of this thing

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.600 
it's like twice the size of this thing
but<00:00:51.420> besides<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.500> let's<00:00:53.250> get<00:00:53.399> right<00:00:53.550> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
but besides that this let's get right to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.060 
but besides that this let's get right to
the<00:00:53.850> point<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.750> only<00:00:54.960> real<00:00:55.350> difference<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.860> be

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
the point the only real difference to be

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.580 
the point the only real difference to be
real<00:00:56.280> with<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.489> is<00:00:56.880> this<00:00:57.660> makes<00:00:57.930> soup<00:00:58.290> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
real with you is this makes soup and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.670 
real with you is this makes soup and
this<00:00:59.370> has<00:00:59.610> the<00:00:59.910> smart<00:01:00.360> technology<00:01:00.680> where

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
this has the smart technology where

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.069 
this has the smart technology where
instead<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.460> locking<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.210> turning<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.719> it

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
instead of locking it and turning it it

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:06.560 
instead of locking it and turning it it
does<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> cycle<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.670> its<00:01:05.820> own<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.299> don't

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
does the cycle on its own so you don't

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.690 
does the cycle on its own so you don't
have<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.840> think<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.680> just<00:01:07.710> put<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
have to think you just put it on and

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.459 
have to think you just put it on and
runs<00:01:08.969> through<00:01:09.149> the<00:01:09.240> cycle<00:01:09.600> automatically<00:01:10.289> and

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:10.469 
runs through the cycle automatically and

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.010 
runs through the cycle automatically and
it<00:01:10.950> breaks<00:01:11.190> it<00:01:11.369> down<00:01:11.479> and<00:01:12.479> then<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.750> has<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
it breaks it down and then it has the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.810 
it breaks it down and then it has the
soup<00:01:13.260> technology<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.100> makes<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.400> soup<00:01:14.670> it

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
soup technology that makes the soup it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.969 
soup technology that makes the soup it
makes<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.210> hot<00:01:15.420> breaks<00:01:16.020> everything<00:01:16.350> down

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
makes it hot breaks everything down

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.710 
makes it hot breaks everything down
and<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.670> huge<00:01:18.000> cups<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.450> lot<00:01:18.600> of

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
and you have your huge cups a lot of

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.440 
and you have your huge cups a lot of
people<00:01:18.990> they<00:01:19.200> always<00:01:19.380> want<00:01:19.650> bigger<00:01:19.860> cups

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
people they always want bigger cups

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.000 
people they always want bigger cups
that's<00:01:21.450> pretty<00:01:21.780> much<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.229> oh<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:24.470> blades<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
that's pretty much it oh the blades the

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.210 
that's pretty much it oh the blades the
blade<00:01:26.250> differences<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.060> blade<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:28.979> little

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
blade differences the blade is a little

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.950 
blade differences the blade is a little
bit<00:01:30.049> stronger<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.439> seems<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.760> a<00:01:33.600> little<00:01:33.840> bit

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
bit stronger it seems and a little bit

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.810 
bit stronger it seems and a little bit
sturdier<00:01:34.260> a<00:01:34.650> little<00:01:35.070> bit<00:01:35.189> sharper<00:01:35.700> this

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
sturdier a little bit sharper this

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.450 
sturdier a little bit sharper this
original<00:01:36.600> blade<00:01:36.869> isn't<00:01:37.080> sharp<00:01:37.500> at<00:01:37.650> all<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.250> it

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
got the job done this is a sharper it's

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.690 
got the job done this is a sharper it's
just<00:01:43.290> overall<00:01:43.770> seem<00:01:44.130> sturdy

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
now as you know there was a lot of

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.640 
now as you know there was a lot of
issues<00:01:47.369> with<00:01:47.790> these<00:01:47.970> original<00:01:48.840> blades<00:01:49.110> this

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 
issues with these original blades this

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.020 
issues with these original blades this
is<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> second<00:01:50.340> kind<00:01:50.549> of<00:01:50.640> second<00:01:51.000> generation

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
is the second kind of second generation

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.679 
is the second kind of second generation
blade<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.799> haven't<00:01:53.700> had<00:01:53.909> any<00:01:54.150> issues<00:01:54.329> with

they<00:02:01.590> send<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.149> contraption<00:02:03.149> which<00:02:04.020> I

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
they send you a contraption which I

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.440 
they send you a contraption which I
don't<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.470> with<00:02:04.860> me<00:02:05.100> at<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.430> moment<00:02:05.610> they

that<00:02:42.360> stuff<00:02:42.600> so<00:02:42.810> I<00:02:43.550> assume<00:02:45.020> which<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.290> don't

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
that stuff so I assume which I don't

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.020 
that stuff so I assume which I don't
know<00:02:46.920> yet<00:02:47.100> because<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.370> thing<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:47.730> new

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
know yet because this thing is so new

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.210 
know yet because this thing is so new
I'm<00:02:48.450> hoping<00:02:49.020> this<00:02:49.170> thing<00:02:49.200> doesn't<00:02:49.590> leak<00:02:49.890> the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
I'm hoping this thing doesn't leak the

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.010 
I'm hoping this thing doesn't leak the
way<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.490> other<00:02:50.640> one<00:02:50.820> leaks<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.690> doesn't

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
way the other one leaks and it doesn't

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.380 
way the other one leaks and it doesn't
come<00:02:52.170> loose<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:52.680> doesn't<00:02:53.190> rust<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.880> doesn't

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
come loose and doesn't rust it doesn't

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.660 
come loose and doesn't rust it doesn't
it<00:02:54.510> doesn't<00:02:54.750> drip<00:02:55.050> oil<00:02:55.350> all<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.130> stuff<00:02:56.370> today

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
it doesn't drip oil all that stuff today

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.620 
it doesn't drip oil all that stuff today
this<00:02:57.450> one<00:02:57.630> was<00:02:57.750> going<00:02:58.340> all<00:02:59.340> in<00:02:59.520> all<00:02:59.670> as<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.600> said

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
this one was going all in all as I said

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.350 
this one was going all in all as I said
the<00:03:00.960> basic<00:03:01.440> difference<00:03:01.920> is<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.700> functions<00:03:03.210> of

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
the basic difference is the functions of

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.180 
the basic difference is the functions of
this<00:03:03.570> pretty<00:03:04.170> much<00:03:04.410> if<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.590> if<00:03:04.860> you<00:03:04.950> want<00:03:05.130> to

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
this pretty much if you if you want to

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.520 
this pretty much if you if you want to
make<00:03:05.340> hot<00:03:05.520> soup<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.810> need<00:03:06.960> bigger<00:03:07.200> cups

make hot soup and you need bigger cups

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.530 
make hot soup and you need bigger cups
then<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.130> go<00:03:08.250> with<00:03:08.400> this<00:03:08.520> one<00:03:08.730> if<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.270> need

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
then you go with this one if you need

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.600 
then you go with this one if you need
some<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:09.960> you've<00:03:10.140> got<00:03:10.320> smaller<00:03:10.650> stuff<00:03:11.040> you

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
some if you've got smaller stuff you

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.000 
some if you've got smaller stuff you
don't<00:03:11.790> need<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.180> much<00:03:12.330> volume<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:13.080> liquid<00:03:13.800> and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
don't need so much volume of liquid and

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.370 
don't need so much volume of liquid and
stuff<00:03:14.700> go<00:03:15.510> with<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:15.810> one<00:03:16.020> they're<00:03:16.200> both

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
stuff go with this one they're both
