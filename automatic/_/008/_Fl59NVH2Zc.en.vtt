00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
well I'm going to do a video here of of

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.150 
well I'm going to do a video here of of
the<00:00:05.879> program<00:00:06.270> that<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.450> use<00:00:06.750> for<00:00:07.440> figuring<00:00:08.010> out

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
the program that I use for figuring out

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.910 
the program that I use for figuring out
songs<00:00:08.550> or<00:00:08.910> tunes<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.570> it's<00:00:10.469> called<00:00:10.710> the

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
songs or tunes and it's called the

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.249 
songs or tunes and it's called the
amazing<00:00:11.400> slow<00:00:11.670> down<00:00:11.880> er<00:00:11.910> I<00:00:12.240> bought<00:00:12.990> it<00:00:13.139> online

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
amazing slow down er I bought it online

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.480 
amazing slow down er I bought it online
quite<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> few<00:00:14.219> years<00:00:14.370> ago<00:00:14.599> and<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:16.260> think<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.160> paid

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
quite a few years ago and I think I paid

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.109 
quite a few years ago and I think I paid
60<00:00:18.480> for<00:00:18.840> 50<00:00:21.890> I'm<00:00:22.890> not<00:00:23.070> positive<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.760> not<00:00:23.910> real

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
60 for 50 I'm not positive it's not real

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.730 
60 for 50 I'm not positive it's not real
expensive<00:00:24.350> and<00:00:25.350> it's<00:00:25.560> a<00:00:25.650> great<00:00:26.519> program<00:00:27.740> back

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
expensive and it's a great program back

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.759 
expensive and it's a great program back
in<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.949> early<00:00:29.179> 80s<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.510> used<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:31.260> Marantz

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
in the early 80s I used a Marantz

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.200 
in the early 80s I used a Marantz
cassette<00:00:32.450> except<00:00:33.450> player<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.899> had<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:35.210> pitch

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
cassette except player that had a pitch

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.560 
cassette except player that had a pitch
knob<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> half<00:00:37.320> speed<00:00:37.680> button<00:00:38.570> so

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
knob on it and a half speed button so

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.479 
knob on it and a half speed button so
and<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.200> before<00:00:40.350> CDs<00:00:40.770> so<00:00:41.129> that's<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:41.460> I

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
and that is before CDs so that's what I

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.209 
and that is before CDs so that's what I
use<00:00:41.790> for<00:00:41.820> figuring<00:00:42.329> out<00:00:42.420> songs<00:00:42.750> back<00:00:43.110> then<00:00:43.379> and

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
use for figuring out songs back then and

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.860 
use for figuring out songs back then and
I<00:00:44.550> still<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> thing<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.480> believe<00:00:45.660> I

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
I still have the thing I believe I

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.439 
I still have the thing I believe I
bought<00:00:46.020> it<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.320> 1980<00:00:47.420> 79<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.570> 80<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.730> this

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
bought it in 1980 79 or 80 and this

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.600 
bought it in 1980 79 or 80 and this
program<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.199> can<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.559> L<00:00:53.190> play<00:00:53.430> mp3s<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:55.610> CD

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
program you can just L play mp3s or CD

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
program you can just L play mp3s or CD
you're<00:00:56.910> gonna<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.239> an<00:00:57.390> mp3<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.680> it

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
you're gonna have an mp3 if you have it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.290 
you're gonna have an mp3 if you have it
on<00:00:58.859> your<00:00:59.039> desktop<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.699> just<00:00:59.879> drag<00:01:00.090> it

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
on your desktop you can just drag it

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.170 
on your desktop you can just drag it
right<00:01:00.329> into<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.780> swindle<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.969> that<00:01:02.969> would<00:01:03.090> be

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
right into the swindle and that would be

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.170 
right into the swindle and that would be
under<00:01:03.270> file<00:01:03.629> player<00:01:04.309> also<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.489> has<00:01:05.640> right<00:01:05.970> here

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
under file player also it has right here

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.460 
under file player also it has right here
says<00:01:06.420> CD<00:01:06.720> player<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:09.020> I'll<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.140> keep<00:01:10.320> it

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
says CD player so I'll just keep it

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.980 
says CD player so I'll just keep it
under<00:01:10.560> file<00:01:11.090> or<00:01:12.090> else<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.330> can<00:01:12.450> import<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.840> man

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
under file or else you can import a man

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.020 
under file or else you can import a man
under<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.290> other<00:01:13.680> file<00:01:14.040> here<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.200> when<00:01:16.200> I'm

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
under the other file here and when I'm

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.820 
under the other file here and when I'm
got<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.360> now<00:01:18.509> is<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.320> weight<00:01:19.530> by<00:01:19.799> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
got in here now is the weight by the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.609 
got in here now is the weight by the
band<00:01:20.220> I'm<00:01:20.520> thinking<00:01:20.939> about<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.500> showing<00:01:22.500> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
band I'm thinking about of showing that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.359 
band I'm thinking about of showing that
as<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> lesson<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.900> let<00:01:25.229> me<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.530> play<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
as a lesson and let me just play it a

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:35.389 
as a lesson and let me just play it a
little<00:01:26.490> bit

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.850 

so<00:01:36.399> that's<00:01:36.579> the<00:01:36.759> intro<00:01:37.409> now<00:01:38.409> here's<00:01:38.680> the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
so that's the intro now here's the

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.960 
so that's the intro now here's the
features<00:01:39.280> the<00:01:39.820> future<00:01:40.149> really<00:01:40.390> like<00:01:40.689> is<00:01:41.970> under

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
features the future really like is under

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.679 
features the future really like is under
speed<00:01:43.479> you<00:01:44.110> can<00:01:44.289> slow<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.590> down<00:01:44.740> now<00:01:45.600> this<00:01:46.600> is

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
speed you can slow it down now this is

00:01:46.689 --> 00:02:03.719 
speed you can slow it down now this is
thought<00:01:46.899> out<00:01:47.079> a<00:01:47.140> little<00:01:47.350> bit<00:01:47.500> here

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.949 

and<00:02:04.729> we<00:02:05.120> have<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:06.350> pitch<00:02:06.650> and<00:02:07.119> this<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.330> use<00:02:08.569> if

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
and we have the pitch and this I use if

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.680 
and we have the pitch and this I use if
I'm<00:02:09.200> trying<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.590> figure<00:02:09.830> out<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.039> song<00:02:10.540> say<00:02:11.540> like

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
I'm trying to figure out a song say like

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.480 
I'm trying to figure out a song say like
Jimi<00:02:11.959> Hendrix<00:02:12.260> were<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.920> did<00:02:13.100> where<00:02:13.400> you're

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
Jimi Hendrix were you did where you're

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.730 
Jimi Hendrix were you did where you're
tuned<00:02:13.610> down<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.850> half<00:02:13.970> step<00:02:14.240> if<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.290> just<00:02:15.440> go<00:02:15.650> to

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
tuned down a half step if you just go to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.290 
tuned down a half step if you just go to
the<00:02:16.069> right<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.370> little<00:02:16.640> bit<00:02:17.680> until<00:02:18.680> it<00:02:18.770> says

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
the right a little bit until it says

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.540 
the right a little bit until it says
right<00:02:20.300> here<00:02:20.330> it<00:02:20.630> will<00:02:20.690> say<00:02:20.990> oops<00:02:21.560> thought<00:02:22.520> I

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
right here it will say oops thought I

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.720 
right here it will say oops thought I
had<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:25.300> there<00:02:26.300> it<00:02:26.420> says<00:02:26.630> semi-tones<00:02:27.110> one<00:02:28.040> so<00:02:28.670> I

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
had it there it says semi-tones one so I

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:39.470 
had it there it says semi-tones one so I
just<00:02:28.790> raised<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.510> up<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.989> half<00:02:30.620> step

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.380 

okay<00:02:40.530> let<00:02:41.530> me<00:02:41.590> get<00:02:41.710> that<00:02:41.830> pitch<00:02:42.280> back<00:02:42.640> on<00:02:43.630> zero

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
okay let me get that pitch back on zero

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.120 
okay let me get that pitch back on zero
now<00:02:46.390> here's<00:02:46.660> another<00:02:47.170> feature<00:02:47.410> I<00:02:47.620> really<00:02:47.710> like

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
now here's another feature I really like

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.640 
now here's another feature I really like
is<00:02:48.400> under<00:02:49.360> mark<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.840> have<00:02:49.930> your<00:02:50.080> start<00:02:50.470> and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
is under mark you have your start and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.700 
is under mark you have your start and
your<00:02:51.100> end<00:02:51.550> for<00:02:52.060> a<00:02:52.090> loop<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:53.860> I'll<00:02:54.700> hit<00:02:55.710> make

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
your end for a loop so I'll hit make
