football basketball those are the big

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.929 
football basketball those are the big
three<00:00:25.920> there<00:00:26.160> are<00:00:26.220> others<00:00:26.400> that<00:00:26.550> people<00:00:26.640> play

but<00:00:27.119> those<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.390> big<00:00:27.539> ones<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.779> we<00:00:27.869> watch

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
but those are the big ones that we watch

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.210 
but those are the big ones that we watch
are<00:00:28.230> some<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.439> money<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.740> and<00:00:28.890> everything

are some of the money on and everything

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.250 
are some of the money on and everything
it<00:00:29.670> looks<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.000> that<00:00:30.179> may<00:00:30.390> not<00:00:30.570> last<00:00:30.810> much

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
it looks like that may not last much

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.560 
it looks like that may not last much
longer<00:00:31.399> at<00:00:32.399> least<00:00:32.460> according<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.059> what

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
longer at least according to what

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.840 
longer at least according to what
parents<00:00:34.140> would<00:00:34.469> suggest<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> kid<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.730> was

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
parents would suggest to a kid that was

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.100 
parents would suggest to a kid that was
not<00:00:35.969> already<00:00:36.149> playing<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.480> sport<00:00:36.660> what<00:00:36.809> sport

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
not already playing a sport what sport

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.020 
not already playing a sport what sport
they<00:00:37.260> should<00:00:37.590> play<00:00:37.829> does<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:38.550> match<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:38.850> with

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
they should play does not match up with

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.130 
they should play does not match up with
what<00:00:39.239> we<00:00:39.329> might<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.510> thought<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:39.930> let's<00:00:40.050> take

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
what we might have thought so let's take

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.139 
what we might have thought so let's take
a<00:00:40.200> look<00:00:40.260> at<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.440> data<00:00:40.700> we're<00:00:41.700> seeing<00:00:41.969> there's

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
a look at this data we're seeing there's

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.150 
a look at this data we're seeing there's
the<00:00:42.300> total<00:00:42.780> percentage<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> percentage

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the total percentage is the percentage

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.410 
the total percentage is the percentage
of<00:00:44.219> parents<00:00:44.489> saying<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.969> is<00:00:45.120> what<00:00:45.300> they

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
of parents saying that this is what they

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.250 
of parents saying that this is what they
suggest<00:00:45.989> now<00:00:46.680> yes<00:00:47.219> baseball<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:48.090> softball<00:00:48.660> has

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
suggest now yes baseball or softball has

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.560 
suggest now yes baseball or softball has
30%<00:00:50.039> which<00:00:50.190> implies<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:51.000> ever<00:00:51.270> would<00:00:51.539> have

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
30% which implies that I ever would have

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.959 
30% which implies that I ever would have
less<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.379> so<00:00:52.800> we<00:00:53.100> don't<00:00:53.250> know<00:00:53.340> exactly<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.850> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
less and so we don't know exactly is it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.689 
less and so we don't know exactly is it
15<00:00:54.270> 15<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:54.870> those<00:00:54.989> two<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.410> don't<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.489> this

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
15 15 for those two I don't know at this

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.549 
15 15 for those two I don't know at this
pint<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.270> baseball<00:00:57.690> still<00:00:57.870> very<00:00:58.020> popular<00:00:58.469> and

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
rocketed to at least second maybe first

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.710 
rocketed to at least second maybe first
yeah<00:01:32.520> that's<00:01:32.820> really<00:01:33.030> interesting<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.600> mean

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
yeah that's really interesting I mean

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.300 
yeah that's really interesting I mean
obviously<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.229> think<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.799> recent<00:01:35.130> years

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
obviously I think in the recent years

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.740 
obviously I think in the recent years
soccer<00:01:35.520> has<00:01:35.700> always<00:01:35.790> been<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.060> super<00:01:36.570> popular

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
soccer has always been a super popular

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.719 
soccer has always been a super popular
international<00:01:37.680> sport<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.430> think<00:01:38.549> in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
international sport and so I think in

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.370 
international sport and so I think in
the<00:01:38.820> recent<00:01:39.180> years<00:01:39.420> America<00:01:39.990> has<00:01:40.020> adopted

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
the recent years America has adopted

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.899 
the recent years America has adopted
more<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.130> adopted<00:01:41.610> more<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
more of that and adopted more of the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.219 
more of that and adopted more of the
excitement<00:01:42.479> about<00:01:42.780> some<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.140> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
excitement about some of the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.840 
excitement about some of the
international<00:01:43.770> teams<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.220> some<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> I

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
international teams and some like that I

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.310 
international teams and some like that I
also<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.750> lot<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> information

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
also think a lot of the information

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.359 
also think a lot of the information
that's<00:01:46.710> come<00:01:46.890> out<00:01:47.040> about<00:01:48.890> football<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that's come out about football and the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.249 
that's come out about football and the
dangers<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.090> head<00:01:51.509> trauma<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.110> can

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
dangers the head trauma that it can

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.080 
dangers the head trauma that it can
cause<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.619> think<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:53.040> plays<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.430> huge<00:01:53.579> role<00:01:53.850> and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
cause I think that plays a huge role and

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.990 
cause I think that plays a huge role and
last<00:01:54.630> point<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.170> you're<00:01:55.979> seeing<00:01:56.340> kids<00:01:56.759> play

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
last point is you're seeing kids play

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.219 
last point is you're seeing kids play

necessarily gonna be able to dribble and
stuff<00:02:21.110> like<00:02:21.170> that<00:02:21.350> but<00:02:21.860> with<00:02:22.040> soccer<00:02:22.370> like

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
stuff like that but with soccer like

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.180 
stuff like that but with soccer like
they<00:02:23.510> keep<00:02:23.930> kicking<00:02:24.170> it's<00:02:24.500> not<00:02:24.620> gonna<00:02:24.800> go<00:02:24.980> that

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190

I<00:03:23.660> think<00:03:24.080> they<00:03:24.200> at<00:03:24.320> the<00:03:24.440> very<00:03:24.769> least<00:03:24.980> no<00:03:25.340> longer

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
I think they at the very least no longer

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.759 
I think they at the very least no longer
feel<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.060> as<00:03:26.540> much<00:03:26.840> they<00:03:27.140> now<00:03:27.260> feel<00:03:27.500> like<00:03:27.530> oh

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
feel that as much they now feel like oh

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.470 
feel that as much they now feel like oh
you<00:03:27.830> know<00:03:28.040> if<00:03:28.190> they<00:03:28.310> play<00:03:28.519> it<00:03:28.700> it's<00:03:29.299> not<00:03:29.450> a

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
you know if they play it it's not a

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.539 
you know if they play it it's not a
betrayal<00:03:30.080> of<00:03:30.380> America<00:03:30.950> or<00:03:31.070> anything<00:03:31.310> like

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
betrayal of America or anything like

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.220 
betrayal of America or anything like
that<00:03:31.610> yeah<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.660> certainly<00:03:32.810> see<00:03:33.080> that<00:03:33.110> in

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
that yeah and you certainly see that in

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.080 
that yeah and you certainly see that in
support<00:03:33.709> for<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:33.920> American<00:03:34.160> soccer<00:03:34.820> teams

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
support for the American soccer teams

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
support for the American soccer teams
and<00:03:35.269> so<00:03:35.330> that's<00:03:35.450> a<00:03:35.570> lot<00:03:35.720> of<00:03:35.750> the<00:03:35.930> soccer

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
and so that's a lot of the soccer

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.449 
and so that's a lot of the soccer
stories<00:03:36.440> now<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.739> even<00:03:36.860> that<00:03:37.070> we<00:03:37.160> have<00:03:37.340> in

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
stories now that even that we have in

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.520 
stories now that even that we have in
America<00:03:37.880> have<00:03:38.120> been<00:03:38.150> like<00:03:38.510> rose<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:39.019> fame<00:03:39.049> so

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
America have been like rose to fame so

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.199 
America have been like rose to fame so
that<00:03:39.680> probably<00:03:39.980> is<00:03:40.160> is<00:03:40.519> that<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:40.820> Like<00:03:41.000> Beckham

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
that probably is is that to Like Beckham

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.600 
that probably is is that to Like Beckham
yeah<00:03:42.110> having<00:03:42.410> some<00:03:42.560> names<00:03:42.799> catching<00:03:43.459> me<00:03:43.580> a

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
yeah having some names catching me a

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.509 
yeah having some names catching me a
hand<00:03:43.970> yeah<00:03:44.690> exactly<00:03:45.049> having<00:03:45.830> some<00:03:46.160> like<00:03:46.340> big

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
hand yeah exactly having some like big

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.520 
hand yeah exactly having some like big
stars<00:03:46.940> that<00:03:47.330> you<00:03:47.360> can<00:03:47.570> sort<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.810> identify<00:03:47.930> with

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
stars that you can sort of identify with

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.080 
stars that you can sort of identify with
you<00:03:48.769> and<00:03:49.040> they<00:03:49.100> can<00:03:49.250> put<00:03:49.370> the<00:03:49.459> posters<00:03:49.880> on<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
you and they can put the posters on the

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.870 
you and they can put the posters on the
wall<00:03:50.330> they<00:03:50.510> can<00:03:50.660> have<00:03:50.750> a<00:03:50.780> jersey<00:03:51.290> yeah<00:03:52.280> yeah

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
wall they can have a jersey yeah yeah

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.220 
wall they can have a jersey yeah yeah
exactly<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.269> think<00:03:53.360> that<00:03:53.540> that<00:03:53.660> helps<00:03:53.900> as<00:03:54.049> well

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
exactly I think that that helps as well

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.360 
exactly I think that that helps as well
and<00:03:54.410> so<00:03:54.500> look<00:03:54.680> I<00:03:54.799> don't<00:03:54.860> know<00:03:55.070> long-term

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
and so look I don't know long-term

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.850 
and so look I don't know long-term
exactly<00:03:56.060> how<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:56.299> is<00:03:56.420> gonna<00:03:56.480> impact<00:03:56.600> um<00:03:57.320> like

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
exactly how this is gonna impact um like

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.830 
exactly how this is gonna impact um like
it's<00:03:58.010> football<00:03:58.190> gonna<00:03:58.459> die<00:03:58.760> in<00:03:59.120> ten<00:03:59.360> years<00:03:59.510> no

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
it's football gonna die in ten years no

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.970 
it's football gonna die in ten years no
I<00:03:59.870> don't<00:04:00.110> think<00:04:00.290> it's<00:04:00.380> gonna<00:04:00.470> die<00:04:00.680> in<00:04:00.739> ten

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
I don't think it's gonna die in ten

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.050 
I don't think it's gonna die in ten
years<00:04:01.100> there's<00:04:01.340> always<00:04:01.459> gonna<00:04:01.610> be<00:04:01.700> enough

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
years there's always gonna be enough

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.940 
years there's always gonna be enough
people<00:04:02.450> playing<00:04:02.750> that<00:04:02.989> if<00:04:03.049> they<00:04:03.170> want<00:04:03.410> to<00:04:03.470> man

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
people playing that if they want to man

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.400 
people playing that if they want to man
the<00:04:04.100> teams<00:04:04.310> they<00:04:04.519> can<00:04:04.760> but<00:04:05.510> this<00:04:05.720> could<00:04:06.049> if

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
the teams they can but this could if

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.960 
the teams they can but this could if
less<00:04:06.799> people<00:04:06.829> are<00:04:07.130> playing<00:04:07.400> football<00:04:07.579> growing

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
less people are playing football growing

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.580 
less people are playing football growing
up<00:04:08.090> maybe<00:04:08.299> they'll<00:04:08.510> be<00:04:08.660> less<00:04:08.840> football<00:04:09.230> fans

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
up maybe they'll be less football fans

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.490 
up maybe they'll be less football fans
in<00:04:10.010> 20<00:04:10.280> years<00:04:10.519> or<00:04:10.730> maybe<00:04:11.150> that'll<00:04:11.600> prompt<00:04:12.110> like

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
in 20 years or maybe that'll prompt like

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.870 
in 20 years or maybe that'll prompt like
Pop<00:04:12.890> Warner<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:13.430> some<00:04:13.579> of<00:04:13.700> the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
Pop Warner and some of the

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:15.460 
Pop Warner and some of the
other<00:04:13.970> organizations<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.990> make<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.260> game

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
other organizations to make the game

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.490 
other organizations to make the game
safer<00:04:15.820> yeah<00:04:16.820> I<00:04:17.209> hope<00:04:17.840> that<00:04:18.050> that's<00:04:18.200> what<00:04:18.320> they

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
safer yeah I hope that that's what they

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.900 
safer yeah I hope that that's what they
would<00:04:18.620> do<00:04:18.830> what's<00:04:19.010> it<00:04:19.130> called<00:04:19.340> when<00:04:19.550> you<00:04:19.580> flag

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
would do what's it called when you flag

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.490 
would do what's it called when you flag
football<00:04:20.060> yeah<00:04:20.930> I<00:04:20.959> think<00:04:21.290> that<00:04:21.410> that's

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
football yeah I think that that's

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.190 
football yeah I think that that's
probably<00:04:21.860> what<00:04:22.310> you'll<00:04:22.580> see<00:04:22.970> I<00:04:23.330> still<00:04:23.960> think

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
probably what you'll see I still think

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.540 
probably what you'll see I still think
that<00:04:24.230> that's<00:04:24.470> a<00:04:24.590> step<00:04:24.800> along<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.220> death<00:04:25.400> of

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
that that's a step along the death of

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.830 
that that's a step along the death of
football<00:04:25.910> because<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:26.180> don't<00:04:26.450> I<00:04:26.600> don't<00:04:26.660> think

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
football because I don't I don't think

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.840 
football because I don't I don't think
that<00:04:27.140> people<00:04:27.290> know<00:04:27.980> I<00:04:28.040> think<00:04:28.160> it's<00:04:28.370> fun<00:04:28.580> I

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
that people know I think it's fun I

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.390 
that people know I think it's fun I
don't<00:04:29.150> think<00:04:31.210> that<00:04:32.210> touch<00:04:33.200> football<00:04:33.400> two-hand

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
don't think that touch football two-hand

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.960 
don't think that touch football two-hand
touch

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
touch

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.260 
touch

well you might be right

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.080 
well you might be right
I<00:04:38.300> kind<00:04:39.080> of<00:04:39.110> doubt<00:04:39.260> it<00:04:39.580> but<00:04:40.580> anyway<00:04:40.850> let<00:04:41.060> me
