00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:13.960 
swooped but unstyled so you can always

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.020 
swooped but unstyled so you can always
cut<00:05:14.169> her<00:05:14.260> yourself<00:05:14.500> and<00:05:14.979> I'm<00:05:15.430> pretty<00:05:15.610> sure<00:05:15.820> you

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
cut her yourself and I'm pretty sure you

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.610 
cut her yourself and I'm pretty sure you
can<00:05:16.180> watch<00:05:16.300> it<00:05:16.450> enough<00:05:16.630> tutorials<00:05:17.169> on<00:05:17.260> youtube

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
can watch it enough tutorials on youtube

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.830 
can watch it enough tutorials on youtube
so<00:05:17.830> where<00:05:17.979> you<00:05:18.130> can<00:05:18.370> learn<00:05:18.910> how<00:05:18.970> to<00:05:19.210> layer<00:05:19.479> it<00:05:19.510> I

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
so where you can learn how to layer it I

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.540 
so where you can learn how to layer it I
think<00:05:20.320> that<00:05:20.440> if<00:05:20.530> you<00:05:20.620> put<00:05:20.800> a<00:05:20.830> couple<00:05:21.039> layers<00:05:21.280> in

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
think that if you put a couple layers in

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.840 
think that if you put a couple layers in
this<00:05:21.669> bad<00:05:21.910> boy<00:05:22.180> she<00:05:22.570> will<00:05:22.750> be<00:05:22.900> a<00:05:22.930> lot<00:05:23.260> fuller

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
this bad boy she will be a lot fuller

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.540 
this bad boy she will be a lot fuller
and<00:05:24.850> that<00:05:25.570> is<00:05:25.750> what<00:05:25.960> I<00:05:25.990> probably<00:05:26.470> will<00:05:26.710> do<00:05:26.919> I'm

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
and that is what I probably will do I'm

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.670 
and that is what I probably will do I'm
layering<00:05:27.970> does<00:05:28.419> help<00:05:28.720> fill<00:05:29.110> out<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.470> wig

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
layering does help fill out the wig

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.310 
layering does help fill out the wig
meaning<00:05:30.310> it<00:05:30.789> will<00:05:31.000> help<00:05:31.240> make<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:31.660> wood<00:05:31.900> wig

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
meaning it will help make the wood wig

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.920
