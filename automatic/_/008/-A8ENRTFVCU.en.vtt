00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.750 

doubles<00:00:00.659> when<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.589> play<00:00:01.800> double<00:00:02.100> strokes<00:00:02.730> I

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
doubles when I play double strokes I

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.760 
doubles when I play double strokes I
always<00:00:03.389> accent<00:00:04.190> the<00:00:05.190> second<00:00:05.640> stroke<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.899> find

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
always accent the second stroke I find

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.379 
always accent the second stroke I find
that<00:00:07.830> especially<00:00:08.099> important<00:00:08.880> when<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.240> play

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
that especially important when I play

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.980 
that especially important when I play
double<00:00:09.660> stroke<00:00:09.840> roles<00:00:10.580> because<00:00:11.780> that<00:00:12.780> way

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
double stroke roles because that way

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.650 
double stroke roles because that way
they<00:00:13.139> just<00:00:13.320> sound<00:00:13.830> more<00:00:14.340> even<00:00:14.820> at<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.210> faster

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
they just sound more even at a faster

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:33.600 
they just sound more even at a faster
tempo<00:00:16.100> I'll<00:00:17.100> demonstrate

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.170 

if<00:00:34.610> I<00:00:34.790> didn't<00:00:35.120> do<00:00:35.270> that<00:00:35.660> at<00:00:35.720> a<00:00:36.260> faster<00:00:36.739> tempo

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.180 
if I didn't do that at a faster tempo

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
if I didn't do that at a faster tempo
the<00:00:38.180> double<00:00:38.450> stroke<00:00:38.600> roll<00:00:38.660> would<00:00:38.960> sound<00:00:39.110> like

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
the double stroke roll would sound like

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:49.299 
the double stroke roll would sound like
this<00:00:43.420> you<00:00:44.420> can<00:00:44.570> hear<00:00:44.750> that<00:00:44.840> 16<00:00:45.470> notes<00:00:45.620> feel<00:00:48.309> and

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
this you can hear that 16 notes feel and

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.079 
this you can hear that 16 notes feel and
not<00:00:50.059> a<00:00:50.089> really<00:00:50.830> strong<00:00:51.940> thirty-second<00:00:52.940> note

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:53.089 
not a really strong thirty-second note

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.960 
not a really strong thirty-second note
feel<00:00:56.769> especially<00:00:57.769> on<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.309> snare<00:00:58.519> drum<00:00:58.579> it

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:58.970 
feel especially on the snare drum it

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.180 
feel especially on the snare drum it
sounds<00:00:59.300> much<00:00:59.480> better<00:00:59.809> when<00:01:00.470> accenting<00:01:01.010> the

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
sounds much better when accenting the

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:16.240 
sounds much better when accenting the
second<00:01:01.820> stroke<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:15.770> double<00:01:16.039> stroke<00:01:16.190> roll

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
second stroke the double stroke roll

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.980 
second stroke the double stroke roll
just<00:01:16.550> becomes<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:16.910> lot<00:01:17.030> more<00:01:17.060> even<00:01:17.539> at<00:01:17.630> a<00:01:17.690> faster

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
just becomes a lot more even at a faster

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.230 
just becomes a lot more even at a faster
tempo<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.590> when<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:19.490> play<00:01:19.729> double<00:01:20.030> stroke

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
tempo and when I play double stroke

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.389 
tempo and when I play double stroke
rolls<00:01:20.420> in<00:01:20.600> grooves<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:21.500> alters<00:01:21.770> just<00:01:21.979> sound<00:01:22.220> a

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
rolls in grooves the alters just sound a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:39.429 
rolls in grooves the alters just sound a
lot<00:01:22.700> cleaner<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.479> tighter<00:01:24.050> that<00:01:24.350> way<00:01:38.439> that

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
lot cleaner and tighter that way that

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.890 
lot cleaner and tighter that way that
way<00:01:39.590> I<00:01:39.619> can<00:01:39.829> also<00:01:40.009> pull<00:01:40.369> out<00:01:40.720> double<00:01:41.720> stroke

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
way I can also pull out double stroke

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.429 
way I can also pull out double stroke
rolls<00:01:42.110> all<00:01:42.530> over<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.070> kid<00:01:43.280> not<00:01:43.670> just<00:01:43.939> on<00:01:44.439> snare

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
rolls all over the kid not just on snare

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.380 
rolls all over the kid not just on snare
drums<00:01:45.680> or<00:01:45.860> cymbals<00:01:46.280> but<00:01:46.430> all<00:01:46.670> over<00:01:46.729> the<00:01:47.090> toms

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
drums or cymbals but all over the toms

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.749 
drums or cymbals but all over the toms
especially<00:01:48.320> also<00:01:48.470> on<00:01:48.680> low<00:01:48.829> Tom's<00:01:51.159> because<00:01:52.159> I'm

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
especially also on low Tom's because I'm

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:00.960 
especially also on low Tom's because I'm
accenting<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.479> second<00:01:53.840> stroke

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.780 

I<00:02:01.860> used<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.950> practice<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.280> lot<00:02:03.370> of<00:02:03.490> double

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
I used to practice a lot of double

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:20.039 
I used to practice a lot of double
strokes<00:02:04.030> just<00:02:04.300> around<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.720> kit<00:02:04.930> randomly

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.369 

and<00:02:21.819> I<00:02:22.819> used<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.120> try<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.510> develop<00:02:23.780> just<00:02:23.989> a<00:02:24.260> bit

00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:24.379 
and I used to try to develop just a bit

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.619 
and I used to try to develop just a bit
of<00:02:24.470> power<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:25.040> control<00:02:25.430> over<00:02:25.670> double<00:02:26.329> strokes

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:26.629 
of power and control over double strokes

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:28.780 
of power and control over double strokes
and<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:27.290> clean<00:02:27.530> execution<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.310> all<00:02:28.430> playing

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
and a clean execution and all playing

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.239 
and a clean execution and all playing
