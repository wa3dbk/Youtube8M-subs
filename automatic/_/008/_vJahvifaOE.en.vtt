00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.640
 hello everyone how are you, I'm sister 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.460
 roland and today I want to make them 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.200
 a recommendation to improve the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.970
 technique of his right hand or so 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.580
 unless you do the analysis and you already 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.910
 decide if they will change it or they will 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.360
 leave as a state in order are three points 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.360
 of support those that we use the 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.160
 is first the longest is the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.260
 forearm and by saying long I mean 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.970
 the distance between the strings and 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.700
 the point of support that in this case is 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.360
 here on the forearm at this point of 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.940
 support for 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.680
 we are going to favor the here that 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.690
 say that we are going to have a lot 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.050
 force but we will not have so much 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.260
 precision then this is this kind of more 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.300
 this point of support is more advisable 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.300
 when are we going to be rhythmic type with 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.510
 much strength and little precision that is the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.290
 point of support number one which is the 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.780
 Longer fulcrum 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.060
 the following is the point of support on 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.610
 the doll that is the midpoint in this 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.680
 we can make riffs by bone 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.720
 yuting without any problem because the 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.730
 hand the palm of your hand is going to be 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.060
 doing his function there looking at the 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.060
 ropes 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.640
 good 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.580
 and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.920
 Y 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 Y 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.840
 then it's point of support number 2 and 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:59.140
 the midpoint and finally we're going to 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.940
 have the shortest fulcrum that goes 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.720
 to be only with the phalanx of the 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:08.560
 injured this are used by many 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.050
 virtuous metalheads et cetera and this is 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.700
 the point of support that will have more 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.090
 accuracy of all but high will have 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.590
 less force in the attack then I 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.650
 I always use a hybrid between 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.240
 midpoint and the world cut to 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:28.420
 let's say have a nice touch a very 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.700
 good tone but without having to sacrifice 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.380
 so much the technique that if you do not 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.540
 I recommend if you are going to be alone is the 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.540
 long point or forearm point 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.780
 because they are going to be pretty 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.819
 difficult to hit the strings and also 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.620
 that are going to generate a lot of noise because 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.860
 We are covering the ropes that are not 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.590
 we are using 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.980
 then there are those three points of support 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.510
 which I recommend you analyze 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.260
 there are as for the good ones I 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:02.590
 I use of three millimeters was 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.140
 de jean download this light or more for 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:08.380
 there so a little bit more candy 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.510
 gives a rounder sound and all three the 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:14.349
 more script 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.730
 because good to touch it like that is like 

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:18.189
 it sticks to your fingers because it has a 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.079
 anti-skid surface well very very 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:23.349
 good I was I recommend it a lot 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.549
 for when they do rhythm even for 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.129
 acoustic guitars to make 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.280
 Accompaniment are very parents then 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.659
 well nothing else that I wanted to comment 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.150
 Well nothing that if you have any doubt or 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:34.540
 comment then leave it down here in the 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.810
 video 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.760
 give him a like sign yes and anything 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.299
 so leave me a private message 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.299
 we see the next
