in<00:00:18.930> Europe<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.620> rely<00:00:20.370> on<00:00:20.550> other<00:00:20.790> countries<00:00:21.090> to

in Europe we rely on other countries to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.870 
in Europe we rely on other countries to
grow<00:00:21.780> a<00:00:21.810> lot<00:00:22.110> of<00:00:22.320> our<00:00:22.440> food<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.310> developing

grow a lot of our food the developing

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.700 
grow a lot of our food the developing
world<00:00:24.119> already<00:00:24.450> devotes<00:00:25.020> an<00:00:25.230> area<00:00:25.650> of

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
world already devotes an area of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.400 
world already devotes an area of
farmland<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.670> same<00:00:26.910> size<00:00:27.270> as<00:00:27.540> Germany<00:00:28.080> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
farmland the same size as Germany to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.130 
farmland the same size as Germany to
grow<00:00:28.650> our<00:00:28.890> food<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:30.090> our<00:00:30.270> land<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.779> already

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
grow our food but our land is already

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.650 
grow our food but our land is already
producing<00:00:31.770> as<00:00:31.890> much<00:00:31.920> as<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.460> can<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.300> we<00:00:33.480> must

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
producing as much as it can so we must

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.200 
producing as much as it can so we must
import<00:00:34.050> all<00:00:34.379> this<00:00:34.680> food<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.430> feed<00:00:35.670> everyone

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
import all this food to feed everyone

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.369 
import all this food to feed everyone
right<00:00:37.670> actually<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:38.970> don't<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.449> to<00:00:39.720> we're

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
right actually we don't have to we're

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.990 
right actually we don't have to we're
not<00:00:40.590> growing<00:00:40.860> as<00:00:41.190> much<00:00:41.400> as<00:00:41.580> we<00:00:41.730> could<00:00:41.940> in

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
not growing as much as we could in

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.060 
not growing as much as we could in
Europe<00:00:42.449> because<00:00:42.870> we<00:00:43.020> don't<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.410> access<00:00:43.590> to

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
Europe because we don't have access to

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.820 
Europe because we don't have access to
some<00:00:44.280> technologies<00:00:44.970> so<00:00:45.870> we<00:00:46.020> rely<00:00:46.230> on<00:00:46.559> Asia

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
some technologies so we rely on Asia

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.759 
some technologies so we rely on Asia
South<00:00:47.519> America<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.300> Africa<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:49.290> meet<00:00:49.500> our

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
South America and Africa to meet our

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.580 
South America and Africa to meet our
needs<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.579> food<00:00:50.970> it's<00:00:51.570> great<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.200> support

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
needs for food it's great to support

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.670 
needs for food it's great to support
their<00:00:52.770> economies<00:00:53.480> but<00:00:54.480> we<00:00:54.660> also<00:00:54.809> use<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.260> lot<00:00:55.649> of

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
their economies but we also use a lot of

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.819 
their economies but we also use a lot of
their<00:00:55.980> natural<00:00:56.250> resources<00:00:57.020> so<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.320> there

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
their natural resources so is there

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.979 
their natural resources so is there
anything<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.430> could<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.090> Europe<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.719> change

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
anything we could do in Europe to change

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.219 
anything we could do in Europe to change
this<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.380> become<00:01:01.739> more<00:01:01.950> self-sustaining

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:03.229 
this and become more self-sustaining

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.350 
this and become more self-sustaining
actually<00:01:04.229> yes<00:01:04.920> we<00:01:05.550> could<00:01:05.759> increase<00:01:06.090> the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
actually yes we could increase the

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.749 
actually yes we could increase the
productivity<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:07.110> our<00:01:07.440> existing<00:01:08.070> land<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
productivity of our existing land and

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:11.389 
productivity of our existing land and
there<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.300> way<00:01:09.660> to<00:01:09.690> grow<00:01:10.229> more<00:01:10.530> food<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:11.399 
there is a way to grow more food on the

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.109 
there is a way to grow more food on the
same<00:01:11.640> amount<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.149> land<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.619> even<00:01:13.860> has

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
same amount of land and it even has

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.749 
same amount of land and it even has
environmental<00:01:15.119> benefits<00:01:16.250> too<00:01:17.250> good<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.640> be

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
environmental benefits too good to be

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.020 
environmental benefits too good to be
true<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:18.899> facts<00:01:19.380> speak<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:19.740> themselves<00:01:20.030> with

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
true the facts speak for themselves with

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.050 
true the facts speak for themselves with
GM<00:01:21.479> crops<00:01:21.899> 15<00:01:22.679> years<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.069> experience<00:01:23.280> shows

GM crops 15 years of experience shows

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.870 
GM crops 15 years of experience shows
that<00:01:24.090> six<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.110> thirty<00:01:25.410> percent<00:01:25.800> more<00:01:26.160> food<00:01:26.520> can

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that six to thirty percent more food can

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.240 
that six to thirty percent more food can
be<00:01:26.910> grown<00:01:27.030> on<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.539> same<00:01:27.899> amount<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.380> land<00:01:28.590> this

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
be grown on the same amount of land this

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.730 
be grown on the same amount of land this
means<00:01:29.580> there's<00:01:30.000> more<00:01:30.060> land<00:01:30.539> for<00:01:30.720> wild<00:01:31.229> plants

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
means there's more land for wild plants

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.750
