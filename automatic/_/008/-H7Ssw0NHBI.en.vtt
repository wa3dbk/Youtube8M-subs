00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:51.300
 [music] 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.830
 we beat with a mixer protein to sustainable 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.350
 peaks well, that's literally in one and a half 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:03.300
 a minute at a mid-speed mixer we 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.330
 got just such a steady mass of bowl 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.350
 with yolks add one teaspoon 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.700
 instant coffee with a big slide 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.290
 whisk yolks to increase in volume 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.349

 homogeneous mass see three in the bowl 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:41.310
 pour out and cream which we will 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.310
 mix on medium speed 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.250
 that's 500 grams of cream 33 percent i 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.330
 smashed for 9 minutes it's 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:04.340
 education about which sustainable track 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.470
 that is, that's not a finger a finger hole 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.950
 overgrown 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:17.210
 add here a package of vanilla add 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:18.160

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.600
 revs 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.680
 mix until smooth literally 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.680
 not a minute 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:39.989

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.349
 until smooth, beat with a mixer 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.040
 literally for a minute 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.040
 Mama 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:03:02.870
 add condensed milk whisk to 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.660
 homogeneity 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.110
 [music] 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.490

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:19.080
 add more if necessary 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:22.440
 condensed milk or do not add 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:28.440
 mixing the outer mass until smooth 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.440
 I'm starting to pour in cups 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.190
 after which we remove them in the freezer 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.110
 the camera for 4 hours until fully frozen in 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.710
 we end up with 8 cups 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.380
 ice cream weighing each of the average for 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.240
