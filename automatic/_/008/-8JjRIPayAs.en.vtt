most people will tell you not to do that

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.580 
most people will tell you not to do that

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
because if you know your weight

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.160 
because if you know your weight
fluctuates<00:01:21.219> why<00:01:21.579> not<00:01:21.759> always<00:01:22.119> might<00:01:23.049> not

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170

always<00:01:23.350> lose<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:24.159> it<00:01:24.399> stresses<00:01:24.670> you<00:01:24.850> out

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
always lose and it stresses you out

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.990 
always lose and it stresses you out
races<00:01:26.039> certain<00:01:27.039> levels<00:01:27.369> of<00:01:27.490> hormones<00:01:27.610> and

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
races certain levels of hormones and

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.309 
races certain levels of hormones and
your<00:01:28.090> body<00:01:28.240> might<00:01:28.479> actually<00:01:28.659> prevent<00:01:29.170> you

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:29.319 
your body might actually prevent you

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:32.819 
your body might actually prevent you
from<00:01:29.350> losing<00:01:29.649> weight<00:01:30.990> but<00:01:31.990> you<00:01:32.109> know<00:01:32.200> what<00:01:32.350> if

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:32.829

into<00:02:21.430> my<00:02:21.910> forearm<00:02:22.599> actually<00:02:23.019> into<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.349> muscle

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
into my forearm actually into the muscle

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.729 
into my forearm actually into the muscle
that<00:02:23.829> runs<00:02:23.980> right<00:02:24.190> here<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:25.480> figured<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.620> know

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
that runs right here I figured you know

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
you're just trying to get into a muscle

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.240 
you're just trying to get into a muscle
group<00:02:28.120> anyways<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.739> just<00:02:29.980> did<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.160> right

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
group anyways so I just did it right

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.390 
group anyways so I just did it right
here<00:02:30.549> and<00:02:30.760> it<00:02:31.389> was<00:02:31.480> no<00:02:31.599> big<00:02:31.750> deal<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:33.370> know

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
here and it was no big deal you know

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.009 
here and it was no big deal you know
didn't<00:02:33.760> hurt<00:02:33.910> or<00:02:34.060> anything<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.389> that<00:02:34.540> bled<00:02:34.989> a

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
didn't hurt or anything like that bled a

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.530 
didn't hurt or anything like that bled a
little<00:02:35.230> bit<00:02:35.470> more<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:36.069> I<00:02:36.370> got<00:02:36.519> little<00:02:37.359> tiny

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
little bit more and I got little tiny

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.379 
little bit more and I got little tiny
bruise<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.400> was<00:02:39.489> it<00:02:39.609> so<00:02:40.000> I<00:02:40.030> guess<00:02:40.150> if

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.389 
bruise but that was it so I guess if

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:41.580 
bruise but that was it so I guess if
you're<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.599> a<00:02:40.630> pinch<00:02:40.690> in<00:02:41.169> you're<00:02:41.319> in<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> hurry

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
you're in a pinch in you're in a hurry

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.740 
you're in a pinch in you're in a hurry
and<00:02:41.919> he<00:02:42.609> can't<00:02:42.880> inject<00:02:43.150> yourself<00:02:43.269> in<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.630> leg

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
and he can't inject yourself in the leg

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.629 
and he can't inject yourself in the leg
you<00:02:44.019> just<00:02:44.230> inject<00:02:44.500> yourself<00:02:44.650> wherever<00:02:45.489> you

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
you just inject yourself wherever you

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.839 
you just inject yourself wherever you
can<00:02:45.760> find<00:02:45.819> a<00:02:46.030> muscle<00:02:47.579> throughout<00:02:48.579> the<00:02:48.700> day

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849
