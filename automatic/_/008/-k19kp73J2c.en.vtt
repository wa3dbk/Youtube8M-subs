00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.450
 Hello everyone 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.150
 It is the end of the world rubber market 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.760
 I think that I would like to keep in mind the three points to win the rally match this time 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.830
 This question is 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:29.869
 I want to know how to win a rally game such as inquiry 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:33.910
 Sometimes I can't get it when I get stuck or get stuck on a tough course 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:37.650
 Please tell me to be careful about your stance and swing 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.650
 I would like to respond to that say 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:48.250
 I would like to focus on this rally game but I'm not confident 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:55.500
 I wonder if I can not win the rally game recently and I am seriously worried 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.500
 If you think that you are weak in the rally match and want to look back at Mario 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:06.240
 I think there are a lot of thoughts for people who want to strengthen the rally 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.240
 If you are worried about rally, please listen to this story 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:17.290
 Now I would like to explain the point 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:20.760
 No matter where you hit the first point, you will definitely come back and see it firmly 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:26.140
 Please be prepared and wait 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:32.010
 It says fighting rally, taken early deployment that's rally of attack 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:39.590
 I think that it is often a rally called a fast ball with a fast ball pitch 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:41.040
 I think it would be difficult to judge that I would be struck quickly in the direction I was not waiting for 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.990
 Because 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:52.350
 Come yet back to say where to hit good place yourself how much even 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:58.490
 I have a feeling that I do not know where I will come back always and always, anywhere, anywhere 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.490
 It is necessary to keep in mind that you can move and hit 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:07.780
 The second point is 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.990
 Please try to move your opponent a lot when you get into a rally game 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.090
 this is 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.610
 If you move the opponent too much, the attitude of the opponent will be broken. 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.910
 When attitude collapses 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:27.220
 You may say that does not strike only to a certain extent fixed course 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:30.280
 It is easy to take if you know whether the enzyme here is also where struck collapse the posture of the opponent 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:36.190
 Because it is hard to wear a strong ball so much 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.280
 It is first aware that we have to attack easy to an advantageous development as much as possible by moving the opponent 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.280
 Please give me 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.350
 The third point of the 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:54.290
 Firm when hit in about a 90% when hit by about 60% 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.290
 Please try to aware that Tteyuu Uchihake wearing a regulation 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:02.310
 The Tteyuu when hit in about 60% of Once you have the wind to say when firmly take the opponent of course 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.350
 I think it's good 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:13.440
 If you put in force with a full swing by all means, you will get stuck with the course 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:14.850
 If you say either, it will be a ball to go out with one shot, so the other party's with light power 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.370
 Follow the course 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.750
 The attitude 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.120
 Break down 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.110
 After making a big move 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.300
 If the wind of the idea of going to hit a strong ball 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.960
 I think that I can make rally advantageous 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.740
 Firmly 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.530
 Move the opponent with a course of around 60% 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:41.440
 From there 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:43.660
 Practice practicing the breakdown that you go out of the opponent with a strong ball of about 90% firmly 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.730
 Please give me 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.520
 this 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.110
 Three points 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.680
 Hold firmly while watching the other party 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:57.799
 Move your opponent big first 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.799
 When hit in about a 90% when hit by about 60% 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:10.129
 If you firmly practice these three points of using properly 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:10.129
 I think that the probability of winning in the rally match will also increase greatly Please try
