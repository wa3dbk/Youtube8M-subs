00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.599
 today there is the promised 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:15.289
 Duck greens with mixed 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:18.380
 yeasty yeasty us what I of course 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:22.820
 again from a weekly sewing kit 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:25.000
 off and short crust I always have 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.500
 frozen 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.750
 now first the yeast dough 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:38.600
 they are based on our 77th 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:42.230
 people and that's my yeast dough now 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.690
 for a cake obligatory cross 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.710
 so that then roll out nicely rectangle 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.559
 I can feel so much better now and now cold 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:56.510
 so that he has the same strength 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:59.090
 wiedermal now the plums 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.649
 make a decision 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.409
 roll out the partly split dough 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:09.830
 same size and at the same time 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.979
 shortcrust pastry on top and all of it 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.030
 I now have to roll out the single 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:20.119
 roll like puff pastry 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.100
 but that does not work I would have myself 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.490
 to make the drawing so now 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.130
 bursts when we cleared out now and one 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.659
 Couple put together twice 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:36.590
 enough and then put in the form 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.030
 I previously put something fat on the floor 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.200
 have struck 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:46.009
 so that the cake goes out well then yes 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.689
 my camera went on strike again 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.720
 or I do not have to 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:54.560
 to press right pressed therefore 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.150
 now a film clip of apricots 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:02.210
 Tajik certainly took root 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:04.970
 insert the same crumb so that the 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.729
 moisture is absorbed and now 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.410
 again and again in the second game 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.360
 the beloved right 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.080
 in the meantime make mine now 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.560
 Hefezopf finished because I want the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.330
 leave it on the second day 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:30.720
 maybe then the yeast dough de 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:34.080
 did not draw something against that means 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.750
 was going or definitely was 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.280
 destroyed says baked and then now 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:44.940
 Start 40 to 45 minutes at Ober 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.160
 I do not think that's what I mean 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.550
 long left I do not have it 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.310
 expected finally finished I therefore 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.180
 still a bit pale but it is just ok 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.180
 even so 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:06.270
 yes and then solve something from the tin edge 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:10.190
 and then under it put off the grid 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.840
 so he can cool down really nice 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:18.200
 because the coffee cup is already 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.340
 prepared coffee machine on 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.880
 check also below if synonymous 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:31.380
 really good baked and then comes 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:37.820
 again some cosmetics and now one 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:42.270
 magic trick apricot jam boil up 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.570
 brush and then it shines 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:50.340
 plum cake of cakes like a 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:53.340
 you want to do it the same way and there you end it 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:56.730
 I really just want to go 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.760
 to it the expenses to branches 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.320
 It's not really worth mixing 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.560
 but I still want you good 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.100
 succeed in baking and 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.110
 you think my thumb 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:15.200
 there are many new films coming for many 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.200
 this will have to be done until next time
