one-shot KO the thing because I'd live
choice<00:01:39.930> band<00:01:40.259> and<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:41.369> brings<00:01:41.490> back<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
choice band and it brings back the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.660 
choice band and it brings back the
seesaw<00:01:42.390> back<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> field<00:01:43.340> so<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:44.460> guessing

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
seesaw back to the field so I'm guessing

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.249 
seesaw back to the field so I'm guessing
is<00:01:44.970> these<00:01:45.210> definitely<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.020> go<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
is these definitely going to go for the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.170 
is these definitely going to go for the
bullet<00:01:46.560> punch<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.220> might<00:01:47.549> as<00:01:47.610> well<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.030> go

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
bullet punch so I might as well just go

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.730 
bullet punch so I might as well just go
out<00:01:48.299> into<00:01:48.540> my<00:01:48.689> personal<00:01:49.020> custom<00:01:49.500> set

on<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.009> lower<00:01:53.280> its<00:01:53.520> attack<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.820> make

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
on so I can lower its attack and make

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.969 
on so I can lower its attack and make
sure<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> bullet<00:01:55.290> pass<00:01:55.439> does<00:01:55.740> less

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
sure that the bullet pass does less

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.670 
sure that the bullet pass does less
damage<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.610> what<00:01:57.540> my<00:01:57.659> Solomon's<00:01:58.140> consists<00:01:58.530> of

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
damage and what my Solomon's consists of

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.580 
damage and what my Solomon's consists of
is<00:01:58.950> being<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.850> Pokemon<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.689> goes<00:02:00.899> for<00:02:01.110> iron

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.990 
defense which is I think a
fourth-generation<00:02:03.270> move<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.520> being<00:02:05.520> able<00:02:05.700> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000

an iron defense another iram defense and
what<00:03:19.540> I'm<00:03:19.660> basically<00:03:20.079> doing<00:03:20.319> here<00:03:20.769> we're<00:03:20.919> both

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
what I'm basically doing here we're both

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.220 
what I'm basically doing here we're both
sitting<00:03:21.700> up<00:03:21.940> on<00:03:22.060> each<00:03:22.209> other<00:03:22.450> but<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:23.019> thing

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
sitting up on each other but the thing

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.259 
sitting up on each other but the thing
that<00:03:23.260> he<00:03:23.530> hasn't<00:03:23.739> realized<00:03:24.280> yet<00:03:24.430> is<00:03:24.730> that<00:03:25.120> he

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
that he hasn't realized yet is that he

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.839 
that he hasn't realized yet is that he
is<00:03:25.299> toxic<00:03:26.049> so<00:03:26.799> there<00:03:27.069> is<00:03:27.099> no<00:03:27.340> way<00:03:27.489> for<00:03:27.519> him<00:03:27.760> to

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
is toxic so there is no way for him to

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.879 
is toxic so there is no way for him to
win<00:03:28.120> this<00:03:28.269> match<00:03:28.450> anymore<00:03:28.750> because<00:03:29.620> I<00:03:29.769> have

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:29.889 
win this match anymore because I have

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:31.619 
win this match anymore because I have
two<00:03:30.129> layers<00:03:30.310> of<00:03:30.459> toxic<00:03:30.910> spikes<00:03:31.150> on<00:03:31.299> the<00:03:31.359> field

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
two layers of toxic spikes on the field

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.470 
two layers of toxic spikes on the field
and<00:03:31.810> I<00:03:32.410> do<00:03:32.470> have<00:03:32.680> the<00:03:32.859> upper<00:03:33.069> hand<00:03:33.099> so<00:03:33.489> his

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
and I do have the upper hand so his

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.210 
and I do have the upper hand so his
conquered<00:03:34.870> ever<00:03:34.989> goes<00:03:35.200> down<00:03:35.230> without<00:03:35.769> even
