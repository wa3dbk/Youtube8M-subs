it's<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.550> semi<00:00:32.969> modular<00:00:33.510> power<00:00:33.690> supply

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
it's a semi modular power supply

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
it's a semi modular power supply
everything<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.489> modular<00:00:35.969> except<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
everything on is modular except for the

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.530 
everything on is modular except for the
power<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.350> power<00:00:37.530> solid<00:00:38.309> now<00:00:38.879> there's<00:00:39.390> been

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
power the power solid now there's been

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.030 
power the power solid now there's been
some<00:00:39.750> debate<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.680> guess<00:00:40.860> I'll

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
some debate about this and I guess I'll

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.740 
some debate about this and I guess I'll
fold<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.489> guys<00:00:41.670> sure<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.180> does<00:00:42.420> mean<00:00:42.629> it's

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
fold to you guys sure it does mean it's

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.080 
fold to you guys sure it does mean it's
semi<00:00:43.110> modular<00:00:43.739> if<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.160> doesn't<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.760> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
semi modular if it doesn't have the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.930 
semi modular if it doesn't have the
power<00:00:45.120> itself<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:47.129> really<00:00:47.460> don't<00:00:47.670> want

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
power itself but you really don't want

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.520 
power itself but you really don't want
the<00:00:48.120> power<00:00:48.270> connector<00:00:48.690> itself<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.500> a

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
the power connector itself to have a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.799 
the power connector itself to have a
modular<00:00:50.190> connection<00:00:50.579> in<00:00:50.670> any<00:00:50.879> ways<00:00:51.149> by<00:00:51.750> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
modular connection in any ways by it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.080 
modular connection in any ways by it
being<00:00:52.079> semi<00:00:52.530> modular<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.910> better

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
being semi modular I think it's a better

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.139 
being semi modular I think it's a better
power<00:00:54.329> supply<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.020> I'll<00:00:55.140> explain<00:00:55.559> why<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.670> 24

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
power supply and I'll explain why the 24

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.029 
power supply and I'll explain why the 24
pin<00:00:57.329> power<00:00:57.510> connector<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:58.109> goes<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.530> modular

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
pin power connector that goes in modular

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.010 
pin power connector that goes in modular
you<00:00:59.190> need<00:00:59.340> power<00:00:59.489> supply<00:00:59.910> has<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> chances<00:01:00.989> of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
you need power supply has the chances of

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.020 
you need power supply has the chances of
shorting<00:01:01.530> out<00:01:01.620> or<00:01:01.890> disconnecting<00:01:02.550> or<00:01:02.640> causing

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
shorting out or disconnecting or causing

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.460 
shorting out or disconnecting or causing
any<00:01:03.090> kind<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.449> problems<00:01:03.960> with<00:01:04.439> that

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
any kind of problems with that

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.859 
any kind of problems with that
connection<00:01:05.070> when<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.909> cables<00:01:06.299> already<00:01:06.479> built

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
connection when the cables already built

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.660 
connection when the cables already built
in<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.200> steady<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.650> have<00:01:07.830> solid<00:01:08.159> technology

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
in and steady you have solid technology

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.219 
in and steady you have solid technology
going<00:01:09.240> through<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.689> where<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.869> solid

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
going through and where that solid

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.200 
going through and where that solid
technology<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.159> solid<00:01:11.850> current

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
technology but you have a solid current

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.300 
technology but you have a solid current
of<00:01:12.299> electricity<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:13.110> through<00:01:13.290> there's<00:01:14.070> no

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
of electricity going through there's no

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.830 
of electricity going through there's no
other<00:01:14.400> touching<00:01:14.820> parts<00:01:15.150> for<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> short<00:01:15.659> out

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
other touching parts for the short out

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.320 
other touching parts for the short out
at<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> think<00:01:16.770> semi<00:01:17.490> modular<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> better

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
at so I think semi modular is a better

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.660 
at so I think semi modular is a better
power<00:01:18.600> supply<00:01:19.020> than<00:01:19.229> fully<00:01:19.500> modular<00:01:19.770> anyways

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
power supply than fully modular anyways

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.580 
power supply than fully modular anyways
but<00:01:21.270> anyways<00:01:21.570> let's<00:01:21.930> go<00:01:22.080> ahead<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.320> check<00:01:22.439> out

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
but anyways let's go ahead and check out

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.810 
but anyways let's go ahead and check out
this<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:22.979> I'm<00:01:23.130> going<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> talk<00:01:23.400> about<00:01:23.580> this
