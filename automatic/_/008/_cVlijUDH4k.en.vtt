00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.980
 for those who are starting out on the guitar in 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.620
 guitar the basic idea is practice 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.420
 practice will make you touch the 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.139
 guitar you want the songs that you 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.049
 would you like 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.789
 so if you 're starting it's clear that 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.640
 you will have problems in the technical part 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.730
 You 'll have to learn to tighten the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.369
 strings to make a rhythm to strum the 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.410
 strings ensure the guitar feels 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.119
 comfortable with the clear guitar you 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.980
 will have this problem then in the beginning 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.809
 You have to train this technical part. 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.730
 So you gotta have patience at the beginning. 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.160
 for you to make the first 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.280
 chords the first few tones 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.800
 Okay, so soon as you make the first 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.739
 touches the first chords can 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.350
 make a rhythm I say that if you 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.210
 practice about 10 minutes a day what 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 In about a month you can do it. 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.780
 do this basic part but have to 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.480
 practice 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.780
 If you did not practice you can not put 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.120
 the teacher's fault or on my site or 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.860
 on the other site you learned your 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.110
 friend who taught you anything 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.700
 so you have to practice it if you do not 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.189
 practicing does not solve 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.890
 It's but a little practice 10 minutes 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.869
 day and a month you can have already made 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.520
 sound on the guitar and from the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.150
 when you can make a sound 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.259
 The idea is to make repertoire then 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.119
 you start playing the first few 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.240
 chords already have to search for songs 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.340
 easy for you to touch to feel 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.700
 that little you learned is done 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.070
 giving result is then this is do is 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.340
 very important in the motivation part 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.020
 You 'll be motivated to study playing. 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.070
 more and everything more 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.950
 So this is the order of things. 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.890
 you focus on the technical side 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.659
 having patience because it seems that at 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.000
 Sometimes it 's impossible, you will not be able to 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.470
 with little time you get the guitar is and 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.479
 mainly on guitar, right? 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.909
 The guitar is the easiest instrument to 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.340
 If I learn, I'll guarantee this for you, right? 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.990
 so you sure have to have that 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.549
 patience at the beginning but soon you already 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.860
 Can do some things 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.539
 It's after you've got us 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.370
 first chords began to play the 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.500
 first songs plus more songs 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.570
 easy you can get better 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.160
 and then you're cool to save the 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.230
 songs you 've been able to play 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.090
 songs you like to play 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.950
 you play several times because that 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.110
 Going to teach you, will you? 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.550
 continue to train the technical part only 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.400
 now in practice 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.560
 This is the best way to learn. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.900
 guitar is mistrustful of teachers 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.090
 want to spend a lot of theory is in the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.709
 beginning a musical theory is 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.410
 necessary as well as the part 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.870
 technique but you have to at least 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.750
 12 months at most you have to go 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.250
 playing music other than that studio is 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.930
 taking too much or less than you 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.300
 practice this is no use wanting to touch 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.489
 two months you pick up the guitar once 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.090
 For five minutes there is no 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.160
 as 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.500
 but if you have this constant practice 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.880
 this insistence at first with little 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.340
 time you can already take the 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.430
 first songs so it's not a choice 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:08.130
 methods choose teachers and manners 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.050
 to learn music that privilege 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.520
 this practice that at first I say to 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.920
 the students they do not want to learn 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.320
 music they want to learn to play and it's 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.640
 I have a slight difference and why 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.090
 learning music involves the whole question 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.739
 theoretical technical issue and everything and 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.480
 You do not want to learn that in the beginning. 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.430
 Do you want to learn to play after that? 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.470
 you play your songs there you want 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.019
 and that's where you want it. 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.000
 learn music then this is the way 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.670
 What you have to do is a light thing. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.010
 It's not heavy, everyone can do it right. 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.900
 do not have to have talent the gift for the thing 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.430
 everyone can but it has to be with 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.049
 the insistence at the beginning is very 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.360
 It is very important that you 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.010
 insist and soon I see the result in the 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.230
 songs that you like and there you go 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.850
 able to gear their study and always 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.840
 learn new things and improve each 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.840
 one more guitar
