00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
that through a body image feminist lens

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.250 
that through a body image feminist lens
since<00:00:29.210> if<00:00:29.450> you<00:00:29.539> watch<00:00:29.690> my<00:00:29.720> channel<00:00:29.990> that's

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
since if you watch my channel that's

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.109 
since if you watch my channel that's
what<00:00:30.350> you<00:00:30.440> expect<00:00:30.740> from<00:00:30.800> me<00:00:30.950> and<00:00:31.280> I

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
what you expect from me and I

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.880 
what you expect from me and I
specifically<00:00:32.719> want<00:00:32.930> to<00:00:32.989> talk<00:00:33.140> about<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.649> idea

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
specifically want to talk about the idea

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.680 
specifically want to talk about the idea
that<00:00:33.949> race<00:00:34.280> is<00:00:34.310> a<00:00:34.550> construct<00:00:35.150> and<00:00:35.420> therefore

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
that race is a construct and therefore

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.810 
that race is a construct and therefore
doesn't<00:00:35.840> matter<00:00:36.079> because<00:00:36.560> spoiler<00:00:37.340> alert

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
doesn't matter because spoiler alert

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.840 
doesn't matter because spoiler alert
that's<00:00:38.890> so<00:00:39.890> let's<00:00:40.489> end<00:00:40.670> up<00:00:40.730> on

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
that's so let's end up on

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.550 
that's so let's end up on
bodies<00:00:41.210> for<00:00:41.390> a<00:00:41.420> second<00:00:41.720> more<00:00:42.020> specifically

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
bodies for a second more specifically

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.620 
bodies for a second more specifically
let's<00:00:42.800> talk<00:00:43.070> about<00:00:43.190> our<00:00:43.310> bodied<00:00:43.850> experience

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
let's talk about our bodied experience

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.900 
let's talk about our bodied experience
which<00:00:44.899> is<00:00:45.020> a<00:00:45.050> phrase<00:00:45.380> that<00:00:45.410> describes<00:00:45.910> the

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
which is a phrase that describes the

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.600 
which is a phrase that describes the
relationship<00:00:47.059> that<00:00:47.899> we<00:00:48.020> have

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.770 
spiritually with our encasement which is
a<00:00:54.320> huge<00:00:54.829> component<00:00:55.309> of<00:00:55.520> body<00:00:55.670> image<00:00:55.820> in<00:00:56.300> body

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
wonder but this is just fact this is

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.300 
wonder but this is just fact this is
sociological<00:04:13.209> psychological<00:04:13.829> facts<00:04:14.829> that

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
sociological psychological facts that

one we ascribe meaning to physical
characteristics<00:04:18.370> like<00:04:18.459> race<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.570> too<00:04:19.989> we

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
characteristics like race that too we

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.650 
characteristics like race that too we
judge<00:04:21.190> people<00:04:21.450> positively<00:04:22.450> or<00:04:22.630> negatively

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
based on those some

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.020 
based on those some
and<00:04:24.849> that<00:04:25.150> three<00:04:25.479> we<00:04:26.169> act<00:04:26.470> accordingly<00:04:27.160> and<00:04:27.550> it

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
and that three we act accordingly and it

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.390 
and that three we act accordingly and it
is<00:04:28.150> deeply<00:04:28.720> embedded<00:04:28.990> in<00:04:29.560> our<00:04:29.740> consciousness

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
is deeply embedded in our consciousness

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.059 
is deeply embedded in our consciousness
to<00:04:30.789> the<00:04:30.819> point<00:04:31.150> that<00:04:31.210> it's<00:04:31.419> subconscious<00:04:32.069> talk

00:04:33.059 --> 00:04:33.069 
to the point that it's subconscious talk

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:35.670 
to the point that it's subconscious talk
to<00:04:33.190> Freud<00:04:33.430> about<00:04:33.610> that<00:04:34.560> I'm<00:04:35.560> just

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
to Freud about that I'm just

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.790 
to Freud about that I'm just
kidding<00:04:35.979> he's<00:04:36.130> dead<00:04:36.370> should<00:04:37.120> it<00:04:37.240> be<00:04:37.270> that<00:04:37.509> way

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
kidding he's dead should it be that way

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.189 
kidding he's dead should it be that way
 no<00:04:38.830> but<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:39.460> is<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:40.000> that's<00:04:40.599> not<00:04:40.720> okay

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
 no but it is and that's not okay

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.719 
 no but it is and that's not okay
but<00:04:41.710> you<00:04:41.830> want<00:04:42.009> to<00:04:42.069> know<00:04:42.160> what<00:04:42.340> else<00:04:42.460> isn't

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
but you want to know what else isn't

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.330 
but you want to know what else isn't
okay<00:04:43.150> when<00:04:43.690> we<00:04:43.810> just<00:04:44.020> pretend<00:04:44.530> that's<00:04:44.889> not<00:04:45.099> how

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
okay when we just pretend that's not how

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.219 
okay when we just pretend that's not how
things<00:04:45.580> are<00:04:45.910> when<00:04:46.180> we<00:04:46.330> see<00:04:46.479> that<00:04:46.630> we<00:04:46.750> don't<00:04:46.870> see

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
things are when we see that we don't see

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.469 
things are when we see that we don't see
color<00:04:47.560> because<00:04:48.130> that<00:04:48.370> somehow<00:04:48.729> makes<00:04:49.060> us<00:04:49.300> not

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:49.479 
color because that somehow makes us not

want to do that don't do that and one
way<00:05:19.539> to<00:05:19.599> start<00:05:19.960> on<00:05:20.110> learning<00:05:20.409> that<00:05:20.979> is<00:05:21.130> to

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
way to start on learning that is to

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.120 
way to start on learning that is to
say<00:05:21.400> yeah<00:05:21.610> I<00:05:21.639> do<00:05:22.000> see<00:05:22.240> race<00:05:22.479> I<00:05:22.780> do<00:05:23.229> see<00:05:23.860> how

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
say yeah I do see race I do see how

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.339 
say yeah I do see race I do see how
Reese<00:05:24.400> affects<00:05:24.849> people's<00:05:25.270> lived<00:05:25.509> experiences

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
Reese affects people's lived experiences

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.890 
Reese affects people's lived experiences
and<00:05:26.620> I<00:05:26.919> do<00:05:26.979> understand<00:05:27.880> that<00:05:28.030> racism<00:05:28.599> isn't

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
and I do understand that racism isn't

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.990 
and I do understand that racism isn't
always<00:05:29.259> explicit<00:05:30.159> but<00:05:30.310> that<00:05:30.460> it's<00:05:30.580> racism

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
always explicit but that it's racism

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.360 
always explicit but that it's racism
just<00:05:31.360> the<00:05:31.539> same<00:05:31.750> and<00:05:32.289> I<00:05:32.440> do<00:05:32.500> think<00:05:33.070> that<00:05:33.130> that's

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
just the same and I do think that that's

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.339 
just the same and I do think that that's
 up<00:05:33.909> and<00:05:34.150> I<00:05:34.300> want<00:05:34.539> to<00:05:34.630> fix<00:05:34.810> it<00:05:35.050> because

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
 up and I want to fix it because

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:39.149 
 up and I want to fix it because
yeah<00:05:35.830> race<00:05:36.490> matters<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:38.440> if<00:05:38.560> you<00:05:38.710> can't<00:05:39.009> look

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
yeah race matters and if you can't look

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.010 
yeah race matters and if you can't look
around<00:05:39.550> you<00:05:39.820> and<00:05:40.030> see<00:05:40.090> how<00:05:40.240> desperately

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:41.020 
around you and see how desperately
