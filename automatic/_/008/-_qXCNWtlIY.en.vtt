posts<00:00:09.150> now<00:00:10.110> this<00:00:10.290> is<00:00:10.349> pretty

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
posts now this is pretty

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.299 
posts now this is pretty
self-explanatory<00:00:11.300> come<00:00:12.300> down<00:00:12.450> here<00:00:13.190> we<00:00:14.190> have

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
self-explanatory come down here we have

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.660 
self-explanatory come down here we have
eight<00:00:14.490> corners<00:00:15.500> with<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> post<00:00:16.830> on<00:00:17.130> each<00:00:17.369> corner

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
eight corners with a post on each corner

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.120 
eight corners with a post on each corner
so<00:00:18.600> that's<00:00:18.750> going<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:18.990> give<00:00:19.080> us<00:00:19.109> 8<00:00:19.350> posts<00:00:22.130> now

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
so that's going to give us 8 posts now

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.939 
so that's going to give us 8 posts now
we'll<00:00:23.310> go<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.550> furnace<00:00:23.910> trips<00:00:24.890> now<00:00:25.890> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
we'll go to the furnace trips now the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.589 
we'll go to the furnace trips now the
furring<00:00:26.250> strips<00:00:26.519> attached<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.119> either<00:00:27.300> side

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
furring strips attached to either side

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.040 
furring strips attached to either side
of<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.869> post<00:00:28.640> and<00:00:29.640> after<00:00:30.359> all<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> math<00:00:30.779> it

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
of the post and after all the math it

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.810 
of the post and after all the math it
comes<00:00:31.349> out<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:32.730> nine<00:00:33.420> furring<00:00:33.960> strips<00:00:34.820> but

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
comes out to nine furring strips but

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.069 
comes out to nine furring strips but
we're<00:00:35.969> going<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.120> overshoot<00:00:36.540> again<00:00:36.809> on<00:00:36.960> that

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
we're going to overshoot again on that

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.299 
we're going to overshoot again on that
we're<00:00:37.590> just<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:38.010> with<00:00:38.129> another<00:00:38.160> 12

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
we're just going to go with another 12

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.400 
we're just going to go with another 12
ok<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:41.820> move<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> our<00:00:42.360> four<00:00:42.660> foot<00:00:43.050> by<00:00:43.230> 8

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
ok now we move on to our four foot by 8

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.200 
ok now we move on to our four foot by 8
foot<00:00:43.440> by<00:00:43.860> half-inch<00:00:44.460> thick<00:00:44.579> sheets<00:00:45.059> of

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
plywood now we're going to need two of

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.770 
plywood now we're going to need two of
these<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.760> need<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.149> make<00:00:48.300> our<00:00:48.450> six

foot by six foot square then down to the
furniture<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.840> lattice<00:00:55.199> these<00:00:56.070> are<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
furniture to the lattice these are the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.860 
furniture to the lattice these are the
four<00:00:56.550> foot<00:00:56.730> by<00:00:56.910> eight<00:00:57.059> foot<00:00:57.090> at<00:00:57.510> half<00:00:57.660> inch

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.099 
four foot by eight foot at half inch
thick<00:00:58.109> lattice<00:00:59.239> we<00:01:00.239> know<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.809> lattice

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
thick lattice we know that the lattice

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.650 
thick lattice we know that the lattice
is<00:01:01.260> going<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.500> go<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:02.219> these<00:01:02.730> 34<00:01:03.210> inch<00:01:03.420> sides

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
is going to go on these 34 inch sides

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.250 
is going to go on these 34 inch sides
these<00:01:04.500> two<00:01:04.769> foot<00:01:05.010> sides<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.610> only<00:01:06.479> four<00:01:06.750> foot

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
these two foot sides and only four foot

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.469 
these two foot sides and only four foot
up<00:01:07.409> on<00:01:07.560> these<00:01:07.770> other<00:01:07.979> sides<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.390> we're

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
up on these other sides so what we're

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.450 
up on these other sides so what we're
going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:09.810> ahead<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> roof

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
going to go ahead and do and on the roof

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.830 
going to go ahead and do and on the roof
so<00:01:11.850> we're<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> go<00:01:12.270> ahead<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.630> do<00:01:12.689> is

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so we're going to go ahead and do is

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.590 
so we're going to go ahead and do is
that<00:01:12.990> equals<00:01:13.320> out<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.500> four<00:01:13.830> pieces<00:01:14.240> but<00:01:15.240> we're

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that equals out to four pieces but we're

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.910 
that equals out to four pieces but we're
going<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> overshoot<00:01:16.110> again<00:01:16.409> we're<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:16.830> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
going to overshoot again we're going to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.880 
going to overshoot again we're going to
go<00:01:17.040> ahead<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.430> five<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:19.530> way<00:01:19.710> we

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
go ahead and go with five that way we

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.469 
go ahead and go with five that way we
make<00:01:20.040> sure<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.369> have<00:01:20.670> enough<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:21.270> everything

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
make sure we have enough of everything

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.510 
make sure we have enough of everything
we<00:01:21.840> need<00:01:21.990> so<00:01:22.500> that's<00:01:22.710> pretty<00:01:22.950> much<00:01:23.100> all<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
we need so that's pretty much all the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.609 
we need so that's pretty much all the
lumber<00:01:23.790> we're<00:01:23.939> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> need<00:01:24.270> right<00:01:24.479> there

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
lumber we're going to need right there

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.050 
lumber we're going to need right there
now<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.830> hardware<00:01:26.159> we're<00:01:26.790> going<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.970> go

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
now to the hardware we're going to go

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.880 
now to the hardware we're going to go
ahead<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.390> eat<00:01:27.450> some<00:01:27.630> screws<00:01:27.960> i<00:01:28.200> would

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
ahead and eat some screws i would

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.590 
ahead and eat some screws i would
suggest<00:01:29.040> an<00:01:29.400> inch<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.700> five-eighth<00:01:30.060> because

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
suggest an inch and five-eighth because

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.569 
suggest an inch and five-eighth because
all<00:01:31.110> you're<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.439> to<00:01:31.530> be<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.189> screwing

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
all you're going to be really screwing

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.819 
all you're going to be really screwing
into<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.210> your<00:01:33.689> plywood<00:01:33.990> which<00:01:34.409> is<00:01:34.560> only<00:01:34.710> a

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
into is your plywood which is only a

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.020 
into is your plywood which is only a
quarter<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.340> half<00:01:35.369> an<00:01:35.820> inch<00:01:35.970> thick<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:38.030> your

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
quarter or half an inch thick and your

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.969 
quarter or half an inch thick and your
your<00:01:39.720> lattice<00:01:40.049> which<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.350> only<00:01:40.500> half<00:01:40.710> an<00:01:40.860> inch

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.609 
your lattice which is only half an inch
thick<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:42.030> instant<00:01:42.509> 58<00:01:42.840> should<00:01:43.049> be<00:01:43.140> plenty<00:01:43.350> to

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
thick so instant 58 should be plenty to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.560 
thick so instant 58 should be plenty to
get<00:01:43.740> through<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.250> material<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:45.000> into<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
get through that material and into the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.149 
get through that material and into the
two-by-fours<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.500> make<00:01:46.649> sure<00:01:46.799> it's<00:01:46.979> good<00:01:47.009> and

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
two-by-fours to make sure it's good and
