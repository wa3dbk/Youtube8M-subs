00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.260
 like the avengers of swimming matches 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.930
 wants or has already left and you care if 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.400
 I study the center for a few days of course not 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.200
 I see nothing wrong with you leaving it in your 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.539
 hands instead of Asgard and take it 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.960
 immediately do not let him study 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.960
 that center 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.860
 for you promised me the danger and until 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.480
 Now the only thing that has happened is that you 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.360
 you've gotten naked in this pool in the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.000
 cavern I can not help feeling that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.300
 something is missing I'm having a vision 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.300
 do not 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.900
 it's fine I 'm going 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.430
 we have to do something someone knows 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.440
 stop a train unloaded I do not have like 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.030

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:04.809
 marvel for internet 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:07.240
 is the best you can do this is what 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.030
 better than I can say just what 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.720
 I wanted all of you against all 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.720
 functions 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:27.259
 those two are my children who call us 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.259
 mutants 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.289

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.289
 I could save all the time 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.050
 ah 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.050
 do not 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.180
 because they are stopping I thought that you stopped 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.180
 if not 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.799
 and then on a transport died so 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.910
 we end up saving the world again if 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.130
 we did not do the finished throne era 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.050
 I would not call it an era if rather 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.420

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.459

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.590

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:22.989
 we let go adult in the big one by only 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.840
