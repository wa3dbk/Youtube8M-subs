00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
play at the right speed so that's the

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.560 
play at the right speed so that's the
first<00:01:23.240> part<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:24.729> second<00:01:25.729> part<00:01:25.760> uses<00:01:26.360> kind

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570

a bee position so 2nd fret 1st fret
second<00:02:24.050> second<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:31.040> then<00:02:31.220> there's<00:02:31.430> the<00:02:31.550> F<00:02:31.670> and

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
second second and then there's the F and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.470 
second second and then there's the F and
then<00:02:32.090> back<00:02:32.300> to<00:02:32.450> that<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.780> minor<00:02:33.910> hmm<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:35.180> play

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
then back to that a minor hmm so play

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.140 
then back to that a minor hmm so play
the<00:02:35.989> whole<00:02:36.170> thing<00:02:36.410> through<00:02:36.620> once<00:02:36.950> so<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.030> get

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
the whole thing through once so you get

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:49.740 
the whole thing through once so you get
the<00:02:38.269> field

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:03:21.010 

you

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.850 

I<00:03:22.420> guess<00:03:23.420> that's<00:03:23.570> pretty<00:03:23.780> much<00:03:23.930> it<00:03:23.990> if<00:03:24.470> people

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
I guess that's pretty much it if people

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.940 
I guess that's pretty much it if people
want<00:03:25.040> the<00:03:25.190> lyrics<00:03:25.630> there<00:03:26.630> is<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.830> YouTube<00:03:27.830> video

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950

of the entire song being played through

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.830
