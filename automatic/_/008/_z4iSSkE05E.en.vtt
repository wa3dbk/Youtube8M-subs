apparently<00:02:20.110> game<00:02:20.590> doesn't<00:02:20.920> tell<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.280> if<00:02:21.760> it's

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
apparently game doesn't tell you if it's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.620 
apparently game doesn't tell you if it's
in<00:02:22.060> BC<00:02:22.660> or<00:02:22.930> ad

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
in BC or ad

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.790 
in BC or ad
genius

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
genius

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.850 
genius
oh<00:02:26.830> okay<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.450> game<00:02:28.600> finally<00:02:29.080> looks<00:02:29.770> like

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
oh okay so the game finally looks like

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.200 
oh okay so the game finally looks like
it's<00:02:30.130> getting<00:02:30.310> interesting

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
it's getting interesting

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.470 
it's getting interesting
I'll<00:02:31.510> admit<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:31.960> this<00:02:32.260> was<00:02:32.500> fun<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.210> few

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
I'll admit that this was fun for a few

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.090 
I'll admit that this was fun for a few
seconds

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
seconds

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.670 
seconds
why<00:02:36.100> this<00:02:37.090> first<00:02:37.450> off<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.320> to<00:02:38.350> collect

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
why this first off you have to collect

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.220 
why this first off you have to collect
mushrooms<00:02:39.220> and<00:02:39.940> collect<00:02:40.390> ten<00:02:40.660> of<00:02:40.780> them<00:02:40.900> and

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
mushrooms and collect ten of them and

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.170 
mushrooms and collect ten of them and
hopefully<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:42.040> won't<00:02:42.130> get<00:02:42.550> hit<00:02:42.820> into<00:02:43.120> a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
hopefully you won't get hit into a

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.350 
hopefully you won't get hit into a
goddamn<00:02:43.660> spike<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:45.610> after<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.030> collect<00:02:46.180> the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
goddamn spike and after you collect the

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.170 
goddamn spike and after you collect the
ten<00:02:46.480> mushrooms<00:02:47.020> you<00:02:47.560> go<00:02:47.740> through<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.670> portals

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
ten mushrooms you go through the portals

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.080 
ten mushrooms you go through the portals
and<00:02:49.450> then<00:02:50.020> go<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.170> your<00:02:50.320> destination<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:51.910> is

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
and then go to your destination that is

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.280 
and then go to your destination that is
if<00:02:52.270> you<00:02:52.420> didn't<00:02:52.720> get<00:02:52.930> BC<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.740> AD<00:02:54.010> messed<00:02:54.610> up

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
if you didn't get BC and AD messed up

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.290 
if you didn't get BC and AD messed up
now<00:02:56.290> what<00:02:56.650> would<00:02:56.830> happen<00:02:57.040> if<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.610> didn't<00:02:58.060> go

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
now what would happen if you didn't go

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.400 
now what would happen if you didn't go
through<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.320> poor<00:02:59.950> world<00:03:00.220> pool<00:03:00.610> or<00:03:01.030> out

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
through the poor world pool or out

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.920 
through the poor world pool or out
having<00:03:02.410> ten<00:03:02.620> mushrooms<00:03:03.570> then<00:03:04.570> you'll<00:03:04.810> get

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
having ten mushrooms then you'll get

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.140 
having ten mushrooms then you'll get
fucked<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:06.040> you'll<00:03:06.220> go<00:03:06.400> back<00:03:06.580> all<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.000> way<00:03:07.030> to

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
level I think so but before you can talk

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.670 
level I think so but before you can talk
to<00:03:54.760> them

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
to them

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.670 
to them
yet<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.459> fill<00:03:56.700> in<00:03:56.849> all<00:03:57.030> those<00:03:57.209> blanks<00:03:57.689> spaces

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
yet to fill in all those blanks spaces

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.699 
yet to fill in all those blanks spaces
of<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:58.950> correct<00:03:59.459> answer<00:03:59.970> then<00:04:00.840> you<00:04:00.870> can<00:04:01.530> go

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
of the correct answer then you can go

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.569 
of the correct answer then you can go
talk<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:03.000> hero<00:04:03.269> of<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.599> scene<00:04:03.890> well<00:04:04.890> or

need to give them the formula for a
second<00:04:16.139> laws<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:17.130> motion<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:18.419> I<00:04:18.630> give<00:04:18.840> it<00:04:18.870> to

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
second laws of motion so I give it to

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.629 
second laws of motion so I give it to
this<00:04:19.199> ass<00:04:19.440> crack<00:04:19.859> and<00:04:20.070> now<00:04:20.190> he'll<00:04:20.400> tell<00:04:20.579> me
