fingernail on the two clips either side
of<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.570> module<00:01:37.689> that<00:01:37.899> hold<00:01:38.109> it<00:01:38.200> in<00:01:38.320> move<00:01:39.070> that

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
of the module that hold it in move that

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.569 
of the module that hold it in move that
one<00:01:39.399> that<00:01:39.579> way<00:01:39.700> that<00:01:40.479> one<00:01:40.630> that<00:01:41.079> way<00:01:41.460> when<00:01:42.460> you

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
one that way that one that way when you

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.319 
one that way that one that way when you
do<00:01:42.700> that<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.840> more<00:01:43.990> is<00:01:44.079> it<00:01:44.170> will<00:01:44.320> pop<00:01:44.500> up<00:01:45.329> over

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
do that the more is it will pop up over

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.520 
do that the more is it will pop up over
its<00:01:46.479> own<00:01:46.570> accord<00:01:47.219> just<00:01:48.219> like<00:01:48.399> so<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:50.409> can

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
key that's in the memory slot there so

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.500 
key that's in the memory slot there so
they<00:02:14.410> can<00:02:14.560> only<00:02:14.680> go<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:14.950> one<00:02:15.070> way<00:02:15.330> I'm<00:02:16.330> going<00:02:16.480> to
