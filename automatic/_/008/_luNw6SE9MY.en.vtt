00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
hello today we're gonna talk about car

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.900 
hello today we're gonna talk about car
battery<00:00:06.569> killers<00:00:06.990> do<00:00:07.439> you<00:00:07.529> know<00:00:07.620> that<00:00:07.830> this

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.270 

can<00:00:11.910> cause<00:00:11.940> your<00:00:12.240> battery<00:00:12.600> to<00:00:12.720> deteriorate

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
can cause your battery to deteriorate

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.009 
can cause your battery to deteriorate
well<00:00:14.280> let<00:00:14.370> me<00:00:14.400> show<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:15.180> battery<00:00:15.960> is

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:16.019 
well let me show you a battery is

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:17.540 
well let me show you a battery is
comprised<00:00:16.320> of<00:00:16.349> various<00:00:16.830> components<00:00:16.950> that

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
comprised of various components that

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.790 
comprised of various components that
together<00:00:18.060> allows<00:00:18.600> energy<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.170> transfer<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
together allows energy to transfer to

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.100 
together allows energy to transfer to
your<00:00:19.890> vehicle<00:00:20.369> inside<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.570> plates<00:00:21.840> and

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
your vehicle inside the plates and

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.900 
your vehicle inside the plates and
active<00:00:22.530> material<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.220> responsible<00:00:23.760> for

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
active material are responsible for

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.060 
active material are responsible for
transforming<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.539> liquid<00:00:24.990> into<00:00:25.380> electricity

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
transforming the liquid into electricity

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.160 
transforming the liquid into electricity
so<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:26.880> we<00:00:27.029> drive<00:00:27.330> vibrations<00:00:28.050> are

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
so as we drive vibrations are

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.410 
so as we drive vibrations are
unavoidable<00:00:28.740> from<00:00:29.100> starting<00:00:29.520> the<00:00:29.609> car<00:00:29.850> to

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
unavoidable from starting the car to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.770 
unavoidable from starting the car to
uneven<00:00:30.750> roads<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.890> bumps<00:00:32.279> potholes<00:00:32.510> or<00:00:33.510> even

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
uneven roads to bumps potholes or even

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:42.770 
uneven roads to bumps potholes or even
just<00:00:33.929> a<00:00:34.019> few<00:00:34.170> guys<00:00:34.319> shaking<00:00:34.679> the<00:00:34.890> car

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.800 

now<00:00:43.350> how<00:00:43.920> does<00:00:43.980> vibration<00:00:44.880> actually<00:00:45.450> kill<00:00:45.780> a

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
now how does vibration actually kill a

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.800 
now how does vibration actually kill a
battery<00:00:46.850> you<00:00:47.850> see<00:00:48.030> when<00:00:48.330> the<00:00:48.450> battery

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
battery you see when the battery

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.990 
battery you see when the battery
vibrates<00:00:49.380> it<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.739> shake<00:00:50.010> loose<00:00:50.220> or<00:00:50.460> damage

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
vibrates it can shake loose or damage

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.360 
vibrates it can shake loose or damage
the<00:00:51.180> plates<00:00:51.450> and<00:00:51.690> not<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.070> active

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the plates and not just that the active

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.280 
the plates and not just that the active
material<00:00:53.460> pasted<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.420> plates<00:00:54.809> then

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
material pasted on the plates then

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.350 
material pasted on the plates then
experience<00:00:55.739> rapid<00:00:56.160> shedding<00:00:56.550> what<00:00:57.030> happens

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
experience rapid shedding what happens

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.580 
experience rapid shedding what happens
then<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.720> that<00:00:57.750> your<00:00:58.020> battery<00:00:58.290> becomes

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
then is that your battery becomes

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.920 
then is that your battery becomes
ineffective<00:00:59.040> or<00:00:59.520> quite<00:00:59.850> simply<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.420> shorter

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
ineffective or quite simply a shorter

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.260 
ineffective or quite simply a shorter
battery<00:01:01.260> life<00:01:01.500> hmm<00:01:02.280> now<00:01:02.670> here's<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.120> problem
