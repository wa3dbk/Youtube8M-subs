thing<00:01:32.399> for<00:01:32.460> me<00:01:32.759> I<00:01:32.789> think<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.119> was<00:01:33.149> just<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
thing for me I think it was just a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.059 
thing for me I think it was just a
mental<00:01:33.659> match<00:01:33.990> more<00:01:34.229> than<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> physical<00:01:34.679> match

00:01:35.059 --> 00:01:35.069 
mental match more than a physical match

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.249 
mental match more than a physical match
