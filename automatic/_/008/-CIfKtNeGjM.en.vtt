00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
with a cool and I like political is a

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.420 
with a cool and I like political is a
lifestyle<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.480> when<00:00:31.289> people<00:00:31.740> put<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:31.980> Butler

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.910 
lifestyle so when people put on Butler
go<00:00:32.669> they<00:00:33.210> feel<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:33.450> they're<00:00:33.840> attached<00:00:34.649> to
