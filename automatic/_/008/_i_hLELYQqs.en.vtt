00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:14.059
 very good once again leaves you with 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.130
 telephony we bring a new thing or a 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.869
 a new a new boxing but in this 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.730
 case is not anything from phones or much 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.430
 less in this case is of 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.020
 the clock that I promised you and then a 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.180
 review of a case that I bought for 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.310
 the iphone that later we'll see so 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.410
 well let's start a little with him the 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.090
 unboxing good more review because the 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.010
 people wanted to see it 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:42.129
 it is a watch a falsified tag heuer 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.260
 exactly the right model is the micro 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:52.030
 timer 1000 flying I think it's below 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.309
 let's say the exact and good model 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.290
 as you can see it is once requested 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.790
 you are this video if there was not 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.579
 that's why I would not have done it either 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.579
 but good 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.700
 it's a leather strap in theory here 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.970
 he says it's real skin, I doubt it 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.970
 little bit 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.440
 a pretty good finish here we have 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.330
 a tag heuer badge 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.180
 we have here 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.250
 really pretty 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.900
 It gives quite the pego is not typical 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.370
 watches that for example you can bring 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.220
 a street vendor where in the 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.080
 that the spheres in what theory has 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.150
 that mark the months and that are 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.260
 still or are just some are a 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.119
 sticker in this case have no function 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.630
 but if we press them then at least 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.899
 move and we can see what 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.619
 that at least somehow gives the pego 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.270
 it does not seem like it's going to move itself 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.630
 As for the rest, the finishes 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.979
 exteriors are pretty good there's a 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.920
 thing that caught my attention is 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.270
 that here is a button that in theory does not 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.329
 that's how you can see it but the sphere 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.429
 has as small little marquitas 

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:07.990
 instead of having the typical brands of 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:10.899
 12-1 and the minute hands have I do not know if they are 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.850
 they are small marquitas instead of having 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.710
 four between each hour 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.720
 that's because in theory the model 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.820
 original has chronograph then with 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.100
 this button theoretically stops at the 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:26.390
 original and here puts in place to put 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.520
 start stop puts start and store 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.069
 a little badly done but good still 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.709
 here we have the tag heuer badge 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.709
 although you can not see and here 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.600
 jewel also everywhere 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.120
 obviously it's not a web suit 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.920
 it is a fake 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.799
 pretty well I like it is a wheat that 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.230
 to take it day by day without the risk of 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:53.650
 that because being an expensive watch we think 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.400
 the times being an expensive watch I do not 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.790
 like to take it but good 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.950
 I quite like the clock itself I leave you 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.810
 down the link so that if someone is 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.390
 encourage buying this or someone else 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.590
 model 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.750
 To teach you is very easy to buy 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.060
 on that page what you have to do is 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:16.550
 register and once they are registered 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.590
 you go to my account or my account that is 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.770
 as you put it on the page and the 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.330
 left put wish list you enter there and 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.260
 there you can see then all what they are 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.790
 the watches have purses and things like that 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.250
 the truth is that a pretty page 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.330
 good we got a defective watch for 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.370
 a friend but good 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.160
 I've been doing paperwork with them 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.350
 that if I can send it I sent it to me 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.750
 they stopped good stories 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.370
 coming back here I'm with the cover of the 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.180
 iphone 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:51.330
 This case is a steam element case 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.770
 case for in this case for iphone 4 and 4 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.790
 It's a bumper sleeve 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.930
 Y 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.450
 that instead of being rubber 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.909
 silicone anything is aluminum 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.590
 worth the peculiarity that it has is that in 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.180
 instead of being a typical cover that can 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.329
 bring anyone 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.620
 It is very difficult to find in stores 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:19.120
 medium market type and things like that 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.060
 It cost me about six euros of fortune 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.900
 but the original price of one like this 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.840
 it's about 160 it's the same as this one 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.449
 a model like this original can 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.760
 cost about 60 euros that is also 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.830
 money for a cover then good you 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.669
 I will leave below in the link the description and 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.830
 the link of this wonderful world and you 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.520
 you have an eye here I show you how 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.050
 put it 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.810
 As you can see, I have the iphone 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.570
 with my case 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.940
 by the way when I did the tutorial of 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.590
 kernel for the z3 that had a problem 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.750
 with the phone 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.580
 and that's why it has not gone up, I have to 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.110
 upload it still and I have to repeat it 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.000
 because it went wrong and the phone 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.190
 stayed with the android 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.230
 and it did not start me because there was the 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.480
 truth is that quite a lot 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.920
 dismayed about being able to see that 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.770
 I could have been charged to me 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.900
 try skateboarding is a phone that already 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.820
 I said that although I had the iphone 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.170
 I spend it like an ipod 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.610
 say it some way every day what 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.360
 I'm spending because android does not 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:24.490
 would leave even less 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:27.010
 leave it behind the moment I see 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.720
 that maybe he takes out in some phone 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.420
 to convince me at all because 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.280
 possibly I take it too I do not know 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.650
 we'll see later more everything 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.770
 I will decide 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.380
 for now with this I'm pretty much left over 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.330
 I quite like the iphone 4s I'm 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.220
 pretty happy 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:46.169
 and although good people criticizing 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.599
 enough as 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.300
 I like it on my phone and for now I'm going 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:54.449
 to follow with him but good what yes that 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.120
 I 'm going to bring you 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.879
 with the tutorial of installing a pair 

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.849
 of new roms that have come out now 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:05.039
 for zte skate and take a good look 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.419
 I have put two screws one here and one 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:08.490
 here so you can see more or less how it 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.889
 and the truth is that neither is it 

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:13.050
 side so nothing if you want to save a 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:14.490
 little money when buying a 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.309
 tag heuer and when buying a 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.910
 cover like this for the iphone I leave you 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:22.950
 with the description os link 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.900
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:26.520
 as I said I'm going to improve a lot 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:29.310
 reviews on the phones and you'll see it in 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.600
 the next one and in the edition of the videos 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.060
 I'm going to improve it a lot already 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:35.390
 you'll see why so nothing until the 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.390
 next
