00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:15.040
 so here we are at the place of 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:17.140
 the loop so this stone loop there 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.270
 way is the loop that we see on the 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.430
 video and the law is the fool of 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.430
 tree you should head so the plane 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.759
 it is supposed to spit it over here 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:35.410
 about 400 m go we go there 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:36.610
 are you ready peter yates go so 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:44.230
 very quickly this is the kind of terrain in 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:55.840
 which one must evolve with there low 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:57.190
 behind a crevasse a chasm so 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:04.150
 that's the kind of thing that we 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:06.820
 find so knowing that normally he 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.549
 is further but that they risk 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.240
 to be at the bottom of a hole like that of 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.240
 about ten meters deep 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.740
 so for now maybe past 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:47.130
 so the key in the bottom of a hole like that 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:59.880
 will it still affordable short we get 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:02:07.229
 closer to rocks at the bottom it's 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:09.530
 really stuffed with 3 a nice little 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.530
 circus 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.840
 apparently he's not at the bottom 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.849
 not obvious not obvious 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.610
 so that's the area where I think he 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:27.230
 fell 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:27.230
 I walk a little and miracle there it is 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.840
 I can not believe I'm really 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:40.090
 happy and besides looking next to 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:42.310
 what has happened here a gulf that 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.340
 is 20 meters deep or 15 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.670
 meters with snow or alas do it 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:55.359
 is right next to a troops me I 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:58.659
 am happy with the ax he is whole and 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:08.950
 there he is sitting next to a hole but we 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:18.729
 is that with snow or do it too and 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:21.150
 here again a hole as shallow I 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.150
 am happy 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:29.460
 thank you thank you the medal of the holy 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.460
 Virgin
