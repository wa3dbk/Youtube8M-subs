00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.820
 Katy 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.640
 it is a change of our land 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.479
 a friend of the house 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.000
 studying money or at least a large 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.580
 consumer of I consider this I'm going 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.020
 to eat with the computer 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:43.990
 he is a friend there are boyfriends but good 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.760
 minced meat that in this case by 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.040
 passed twice by the hello machine 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.990
 ahead of your own eyes so that you do not 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.330
 you get in the dog so you see 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.340
 what is a robot or what do they put 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.130
 inside the machine and in this way 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.020
 it is nourished by the flavor of the onion 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.260
 and the morrón as they have given markito 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.260
 good ones 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:07.000
 well dear then with the with the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.820
 meat is that I am giving you this way 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.770
 this one I'm giving you a minimum with 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.570
 wooden spoon to mix it well 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.300
 because could the masseur of obvious 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.240
 that I saw a handle at the beginning 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.980
 because it is compacted then one 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.100
 has to elaborate the girl and with a 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.720
 beating with a wooden spoon for 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.130
 that the baby onions 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.300
 the juices released by the onion 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.680
 and from the morro site and from what is a 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.660
 patent but nothing leaves not expensive if 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.250
 there is a nonstick if not 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.190
 always listen to wood never metal 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.160
 because if they do not crack 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.430
 and the amount last you 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.470
 I had to send the planer you saw being 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.780
 always when people go home to 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.980
 eat and you can wash the dishes 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.370
 this space of response from the people 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.750
 future to the kitchen do not forget in return the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.750
 safe warehouse 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:09.310
 we go to a meeting and they grab you half 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.770
 so they arrive and you still do not 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.540
 you finished cooking I parked the 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.580
 that is offered because why is it a 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.740
 fuck because he gets an Argentine 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.810
 because the guy cooks while and since 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:24.330
 street while you put the table I 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.330
 I occupy that torments the pan 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.030
 well I'm going to put a little salt to 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.160
 the question comes because we had 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.680
 talked about condiments and so far 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.630
 good spoonful of olive oil 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.580
 abundant amount of white onion or 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.200
 colored you want the same as the 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.970
 pepper in this case was the colorado 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.209
 but it can be yellow it can be green 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.080
 or it can be a color tutti and some salt 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.080
 some pepper 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:57.220
 a green child 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:59.040
 good but for 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.400
 touch your uncle 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.310

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.310
 a grandfather sent me but dispatches is 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.240
 Now you know I'm going to put onions 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.950
 of greening to give more flavor to the 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.990
 question look at the green onion 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.450
 I put it in another time as the 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.760
 I like to start all 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.790
 recontra hyper cooked because it goes away 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.340
 smoke then I do not have raw totally 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.800
 thing you could do but pretty much 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.070
 you put it in a little while to start 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.040
 sauté the meat be with this the 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.790

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.070
 fill now everything you empty not what 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.440

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.700
 the kitchen all this goes to stop in 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.460
 of the stuffing itself 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.320
