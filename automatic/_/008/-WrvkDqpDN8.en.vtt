00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
they don't reproduce further patches but

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.530 
they don't reproduce further patches but
they<00:01:39.840> do<00:01:39.900> /<00:01:40.680> root<00:01:40.920> division<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.400> well<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.000> we're

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
they do / root division as well so we're

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.090 
they do / root division as well so we're
harvesting<00:01:42.720> some<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.560> an<00:01:43.649> area<00:01:43.920> you're

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
harvesting some in an area you're

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.130 
harvesting some in an area you're
actually<00:01:44.460> encouraging<00:01:44.930> stronger<00:01:45.930> deeper

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
actually encouraging stronger deeper

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.109 
actually encouraging stronger deeper
roots<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.829> encouraging<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> patch<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.880> grow

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
roots and encouraging the patch to grow

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.630 
roots and encouraging the patch to grow
that<00:01:48.360> way<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.810> now<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.680> can<00:01:49.890> actually<00:01:50.159> manage

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
that way so now you can actually manage

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.880 
that way so now you can actually manage
patches<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.390> nettles<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:51.840> create<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.380> better

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
patches of nettles and create a better

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.100 
patches of nettles and create a better
healthier<00:01:53.460> ecosystem<00:01:53.759> for<00:01:54.390> them<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> grow<00:01:54.720> so

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
healthier ecosystem for them to grow so
