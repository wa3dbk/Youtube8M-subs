difficult<00:02:01.830> I<00:02:02.220> think<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:02.700> bold<00:02:02.970> is<00:02:03.180> actually<00:02:03.510> a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
difficult I think the bold is actually a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.800 
difficult I think the bold is actually a
bit<00:02:03.870> quicker<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.550> this<00:02:05.550> version<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:06.600> is

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
bit quicker in this version which is

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.900 
bit quicker in this version which is
really<00:02:07.440> annoying<00:02:07.920> because<00:02:08.220> it<00:02:08.399> keeps<00:02:08.610> on

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
really annoying because it keeps on

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.850 
really annoying because it keeps on
hitting<00:02:09.090> you<00:02:09.360> even<00:02:09.840> though<00:02:09.960> it's<00:02:10.200> like<00:02:10.350> you

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
hitting you even though it's like you

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.610 
hitting you even though it's like you
can't<00:02:11.190> go<00:02:11.340> any<00:02:11.550> faster<00:02:12.150> possibly<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.930> still

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
can't go any faster possibly and still
