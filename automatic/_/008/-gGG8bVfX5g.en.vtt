00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
pretty much staying from the backcourt

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.460 
pretty much staying from the backcourt
and<00:02:09.880> them<00:02:10.570> they're<00:02:10.840> great<00:02:11.020> athletes<00:02:11.170> and

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
and them they're great athletes and

and them they're great athletes and
great<00:02:11.560> movers<00:02:12.070> but<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.240> sürmeli<00:02:14.140> tennis<00:02:14.560> is

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
great movers but the sürmeli tennis is

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.250 
great movers but the sürmeli tennis is
pretty<00:02:15.370> much<00:02:15.550> not<00:02:16.210> happening<00:02:16.690> anymore<00:02:16.900> so

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
pretty much not happening anymore so

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.560 
pretty much not happening anymore so
it's<00:02:17.410> it's<00:02:17.650> change<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:19.060> it<00:02:19.270> through<00:02:19.450> the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
it's it's change is it through the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.060 
it's it's change is it through the
courts<00:02:19.840> speed<00:02:20.020> or<00:02:20.170> technology<00:02:20.620> I<00:02:20.650> don't<00:02:20.800> know

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
courts speed or technology I don't know

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.490 
courts speed or technology I don't know
I<00:02:21.100> just<00:02:21.250> think<00:02:21.550> everyone's<00:02:22.000> growing<00:02:22.270> up

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.690 
I just think everyone's growing up
playing<00:02:23.500> from<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.680> backcourt<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.370> it's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
playing from the backcourt so it's

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.610 
playing from the backcourt so it's
changed<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.630> just<00:02:25.690> looks<00:02:26.020> different<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.500> me

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620
