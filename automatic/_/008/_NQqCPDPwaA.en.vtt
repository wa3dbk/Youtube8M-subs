think<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.930> i<00:01:19.080> think<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.500> more<00:01:19.770> just<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.100> make

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
think so i think it's more just to make

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.100 
think so i think it's more just to make
their<00:01:20.460> team<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.939> little<00:01:21.240> bit<00:01:21.360> better<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.900> little

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
their team a little bit better a little

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.410 
their team a little bit better a little
bit<00:01:22.290> more<00:01:22.409> defensive<00:01:22.950> oriented<00:01:23.420> that's

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
bit more defensive oriented that's

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.929 
bit more defensive oriented that's
really<00:01:24.659> what<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.280> we<00:01:26.280> can't<00:01:26.549> win<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
really what it is we can't win in the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.420 
really what it is we can't win in the
playoffs<00:01:27.060> without<00:01:27.330> d<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.439> I'm<00:01:29.100> picking<00:01:29.369> up

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
playoffs without d so I'm picking up

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.280 
playoffs without d so I'm picking up
some<00:01:29.640> footage<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.390> guess<00:01:30.570> one<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> the

some footage is I guess one of the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.630 
some footage is I guess one of the
easier<00:01:31.560> ways<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.799> kind<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.250> protect<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
easier ways to kind of protect the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
though that's was good about kind of

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.630

being in my situation and I'll never get
a<00:03:27.700> bad<00:03:27.910> book<00:03:28.120> because<00:03:28.360> everybody's<00:03:28.780> always

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
a bad book because everybody's always
