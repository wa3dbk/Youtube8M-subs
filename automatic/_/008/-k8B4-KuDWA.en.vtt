 360 you are going to find it is a 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.350
 little hard here they will learn 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.750
 they're going to learn that it's easier to 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.290
 what you see 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.290
 already 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.920
 well of case 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:33.930
 this game is for the xbox already and 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.720
 these xbox games so you do not 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.820
 work with play 3 or things like that another 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.809
 thing I'm like a little newbie doing 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.700
 these these videos are my cousins are 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.870
 my first videos so to speak 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.140
 I want you to give me a lot of support 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.140
 favor 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.260
 it's loading supposed 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.799
 already 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.760
 I suggest that when they practice what 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.190
 that the free do not practice them in 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:22.790
 I would say that the best 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:25.620
 training you should see from here in 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:30.090
 and more 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:31.740
 here field and 30 field training 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.409
 I have robben because you can 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.490
 change 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.380
 do not put star band back on the button 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.979
 of the xbox to see the modes of 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.560
 training to this one says against one 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.069
 the first part here I made one against 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.450
 one below says train rehearsed play 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:52.720
 training match create play 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.840
 rehearsed 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.420
 create the other in the other and train and 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.180
 now let's put 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.130
 let's put we are going to put 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.740
 train rehearsed play and there kind of 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.350
 plays there are 10 and corner kick 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:14.720
 lack they have to miss 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.720
 and ready continuous 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.200
 there they have come here I am moving 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.750
 the ball you have to move towards the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.850
 place where the lack of sugar 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.130
 28 meters 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:30.030
 well what they should do for example is 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.030
 talk 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.340
 staton 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.730
 let's shoot like a little more 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.710
 forward, the first one arrives better 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.330
 first I'll show you later and see what 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.330
 I'll show you how I'm going to get as 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:59.170
 they have to squeeze 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.239
 he sees that maybe and this is the vowels 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:05.470
 slide I do not know if they have another technique not 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:09.300
 you have to press the b 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.300
 before with this part 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.730
 in this part in this when here we go 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.870
 like this in red unless entering the 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.950
 red to the red bar there they have to 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.950
 do this 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.630
 and only once 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.420
 they calculate well 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.739
 should be noted that if there are four 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:43.849
 defenses should be set that the stoppage be 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.450
 between a barrier or in this 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:48.470
 case is between medium well 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:52.030
 is 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:55.440
 these last two here already 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.440
 then it has been terol 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.870
 and I would say a little less than the 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:08.550
 Red line 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.780
 because something libya lila 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.780
 is high 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.340
 again 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.719
