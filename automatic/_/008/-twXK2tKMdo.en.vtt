specially<00:01:59.040> designed<00:01:59.189> board<00:01:59.759> sort<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.689> a

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
specially designed board sort of like a

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.170 
specially designed board sort of like a
diving<00:02:01.259> board<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:02.100> compress<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.790> springs

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
diving board to compress the springs

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.270 
diving board to compress the springs
that<00:02:03.390> store<00:02:03.960> all<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.350> her<00:02:04.469> energy<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:05.040> then

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
that store all of her energy and then

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.100 
that store all of her energy and then
returned<00:02:05.729> that<00:02:05.939> energy<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.479> when<00:02:06.899> she

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
returned that energy out when she

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.180 
returned that energy out when she
rebounds<00:02:07.619> off<00:02:07.770> the<00:02:07.950> board<00:02:08.160> in

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
rebounds off the board in

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.980 
rebounds off the board in
their<00:02:09.310> words<00:02:09.490> her<00:02:09.970> energy<00:02:10.360> gets<00:02:10.570> stored<00:02:10.630> in

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
their words her energy gets stored in

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:12.840 
their words her energy gets stored in
the<00:02:11.080> compressed<00:02:11.440> Springs<00:02:11.770> of<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:11.980> board<00:02:12.250> when

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
the compressed Springs of the board when

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.460 
the compressed Springs of the board when
the<00:02:12.940> springs<00:02:13.210> are<00:02:13.390> released<00:02:13.660> this<00:02:14.080> turns<00:02:14.380> the

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
the springs are released this turns the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.830 
the springs are released this turns the
stored<00:02:14.830> energy<00:02:15.010> into<00:02:15.640> motion<00:02:16.060> energy<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.690> go

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
stored energy into motion energy to go

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.350 
stored energy into motion energy to go
up<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.230> rotate<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:18.400> is<00:02:18.610> what<00:02:18.790> makes<00:02:19.000> her<00:02:19.150> fly

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
up and rotate this is what makes her fly

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.200 
up and rotate this is what makes her fly
15<00:02:19.960> feet<00:02:20.320> in<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.620> air<00:02:20.650> making<00:02:21.340> two<00:02:21.640> flips<00:02:21.970> and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
15 feet in the air making two flips and

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.800 
15 feet in the air making two flips and
two<00:02:22.540> rotations<00:02:23.110> in<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:23.290> process<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:25.600> then

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
two rotations in the process and then

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.020 
two rotations in the process and then
just<00:02:26.110> as<00:02:26.290> fast<00:02:26.560> as<00:02:26.740> it<00:02:26.890> started<00:02:26.920> she<00:02:27.790> has<00:02:27.910> to

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
just as fast as it started she has to

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.790 
just as fast as it started she has to
absorb<00:02:28.360> all<00:02:28.570> of<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.810> energy<00:02:29.140> through<00:02:29.650> her

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
absorb all of that energy through her

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.760 
absorb all of that energy through her
body<00:02:29.980> when<00:02:30.490> landing<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:31.090> stick<00:02:31.390> it<00:02:31.540> all<00:02:31.840> the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
body when landing to stick it all the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.890 
body when landing to stick it all the
motion<00:02:33.130> energy<00:02:33.280> she<00:02:33.700> has<00:02:33.880> now<00:02:34.150> needs<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.720> be

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
motion energy she has now needs to be

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.750 
motion energy she has now needs to be
absorbed<00:02:35.290> through<00:02:35.500> her<00:02:35.740> body<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.250> into<00:02:36.670> the

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
absorbed through her body and into the

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.540 
absorbed through her body and into the
floor<00:02:37.170> well<00:02:38.170> Kara<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:38.770> feel<00:02:39.100> like<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.370> got<00:02:39.520> a

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
floor well Kara I feel like I got a

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.710 
floor well Kara I feel like I got a
little<00:02:39.730> more<00:02:40.060> understanding<00:02:40.660> about

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
little more understanding about

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.500 
little more understanding about
gymnastics
