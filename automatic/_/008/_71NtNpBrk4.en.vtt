00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.310
 today we will see how 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.139
 to obtain a border at once aesthetic 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:12.269
 and elastic on ribs 1 1 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.940
 so here I cut the thread to a length 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.090
 about 1 m and I'm going to put on 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.369
 a big needle allen 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.800
 we start on a knitted stitch at 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.590
 the place so to start I pass 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.140
 the eil from right to left in the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.559
 first but then we'll do a 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:37.710
 little choreography in five times 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.930
 pass the eil in the space between 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.930
 two stitches from back to front 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.000
 then we passed him in the 2nd my 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:56.640
 from front to back and left to 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.160
 right then we go into the first my 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:07.260
 from left to right and we drag 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:08.870
 this flaw of the ego we pass 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.270
 the right eye 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.210
 in the 2nd stitch this time it's a 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.770
 knitted mesh at the place then of 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.980
 again from right to left in the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.980
 first mesh and we dragged it 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:50.570
 6 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:53.210
 1 2 3 dragged 4.5 and we made 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:10.160
 slip we loose the stitches so to 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:12.399
 three and five years 1 2 3 Swiss and the 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.399
 stitch 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.580
 4 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.650
 5 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:37.140
 we continue 1 2 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:03:16.640
 three high schools mesh frames 5 and 5 years 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:47.840
 also does it target the mesh 1 2 3 bis the 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:56.260
 mesh 4.5 and slip a lease 1 2 3 on 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:56.260
 glide 4 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:14.240
 5 and we slide a we always start 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:25.000
 as we have a mesh place for them 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:25.000
 swamp and it's an honor 3,4 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:48.689
 5 here is the joy mamaÃ¯ place I start 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:57.810
 with one two three I 'm going to slip the 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:05:03.360
 mesh place frames 5 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:05.400
 I slide the mesh at sea when 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.409
 I advise you it's all to put 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:11.099
 before this video when you 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:13.110
 will have to do this type of borders and 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:20.849
 you realize the movements in 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:23.460
 watching the movie is after a 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:36.589
 some time it will become completely 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:36.589
 automatic and 5 1 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:44.889
 3 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:06:13.320
 4 5 and that's what it gives 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:17.600
 now there's more to it 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.600
 knitting and see you soon
