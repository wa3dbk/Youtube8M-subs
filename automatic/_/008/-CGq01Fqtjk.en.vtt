in the cabin I think that there is
something<00:04:56.060> potentially<00:04:57.050> very<00:04:57.380> therapeutic

00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 
something potentially very therapeutic

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:00.820

about<00:04:58.669> the<00:04:58.880> idea<00:04:59.180> of<00:04:59.450> looking<00:05:00.200> back<00:05:00.530> at<00:05:00.710> your

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
about the idea of looking back at your

teenage years and addressing yourself
there<00:05:05.180> and<00:05:05.510> I<00:05:06.080> think<00:05:06.260> it<00:05:06.350> can<00:05:06.470> give<00:05:06.620> you<00:05:06.710> a<00:05:06.740> sort
