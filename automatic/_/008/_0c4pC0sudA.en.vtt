00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.400
 Let's start with the skin and shelter a 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.900
 long-term basis I think that 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.110
 It 's a better time to choose products 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:38.050
 that last longer on the skin because no people 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.730
 its so that it's always good if the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.820
 product has a little resistance 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.440
 biggest collective ever fundamental now 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.510
 to apply in this information 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.340
 triangle for me to improve a little more 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.230
 and other pimples or 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.230
 Marquinhos you have to meet 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.920
 I like it and I know everything with the compact powder 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:10.810
 to take the shine leave the skin well 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:13.470
 dry and to finish the skin apply 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.470
 the pink blush 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.390
 Now we go to the best part to do. 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.040
 the cheeks of the face 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.640
 has no mystery is only you use 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.470
 a well-pigmented white zoom and making 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.780
 full-size polka dots of sizes 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.870
 varied and beyond the face was also 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.340
 my neck in neck and arms you 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.530
 You want to make a whole arm okay? 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.530
 but I made sound and a part 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.060
 I start drawing a few drops on my 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.120
 eye 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.190
 you can make a two three you 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.130
 to prefer another side not to be the same as me 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.930
 I only did one routine only without being 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.660
 close to the eye and then I tried 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.610
 the eyeliner beautiful and I did 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.110
 contour also eyeliner can be made 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.850
 of lapse I think he is more 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.850
 accurate and easier to do 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.500
 and I apply many layers of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.510
 mascara at this time we can abuse 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.220
 put a lot more of staying with the 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.990
 huge eyelashes when put if to discuss 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.860
 that but I always prefer abuse 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.620
 Even mascara 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.860
 apply a red lipstick matic lasts well 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.860
 in the mouth 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:41.040
 and I became a black habit in a house 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.040
 in copying that they have much with little 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.890
 talking really makes a 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.569
 line of my outline only on one side and 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.680
 also contour my face 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.269
 now we're going with a part one 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.980
 I think it's one of the 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.599
 more complicated you can do if 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.610
 you want if you will not do it 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.650
 you can not do is write a new one 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.299
 ugly guess it's all about you can 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.620
 choose a piece you want is just 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.540
 You have to remember that you write 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.879
 for others law then it is as if you 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.040
 I was writing the opposite is a 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.379
 bit complicated but at the moment that 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.360
 You understand, rest easy and then 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.760
 that I outlined the chick in with 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.620
 yellow and outside with red for 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.299
 highlight well or you can use some 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.549
 another you prefer just that I think 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:26.970
 these colors closely match the theme of 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.970
 make up 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.800
 after getting around again only 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.380
 this time with eyeliner because it is 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.340
 more white and more looking good 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.340
 just know 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.980
 they saw people have no security 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.090
 that people looking looks super 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.030
 Complicated only if you have 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.490
 patience and time you can do and 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.170
 It's very fun, expect lots of 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.120
