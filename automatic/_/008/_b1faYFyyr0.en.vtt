and enthusiasm but it isn't really that
it's<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.390> experience<00:02:21.710> I'm<00:02:22.710> no<00:02:22.950> more

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220

that younger less experienced drivers
don't<00:02:27.900> see<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:29.150> that's<00:02:30.150> how<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.750> still<00:02:31.050> win

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260
