00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.310
 friends and sports chain with the report 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.360
 of what happens with the Pablo case 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.280
 Aguilar spoke at a conference 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.650
 sports elector press juan ignacio 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.849
 palau and also doctor hector enciso 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.129
 Well the most important explanation 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:13.990
 of the doctor about the case of the 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.179
 Paraguayan defender so he is explained 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.439
 that since the player reached the 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:20.349
 institution did the exams 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.330
 relevant in the details of what 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.279
 has pablo aguilar what are the 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.779
 platelets so the process that's going to 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.599
 take the player when he returns here to 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:32.710
 the city fortunately for him not 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:38.550
 your health is at risk, much less 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.550
 your life in a soccer game does not have 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.230
 his performance his statistics so what 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:48.390
 can corroborate and the hematologist that what 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.329
 is seeing there that I just think is the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.690
 first time what he sees it 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.489
 he told him that he did not 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.469
 he did not recommend it for him it was not 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.379
 advisable to follow us that already 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.850
 we have a year here and have been with him 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.690
 since one year and we've seen the 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.310
 evolution and how the still behaves with 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.130
 those levels that we find from 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.259
 platelets that is not in the levels 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.000
 optimal or from a normal person but with 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.100
 the clinical manifestations or is 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.259
 asymptomatic that's why the decision to 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.080
 us in our case to allow you 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.940
 play them I do not know I have maybe 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.340
 because it is recent the hematologist who 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:31.670
 just see there in paraguay 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.740
 It's probably because of that no no no 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.630
 risk for not risking them and 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.539
 Doctor Enciso also knows details 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.550
 rodrigo goodbye how this was evaluated 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.960
 finally how to do that process already 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.170
 when he up and finally after 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.280
 a slow tour that paraguay 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.960
 A count of 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.390
 platelets let's go with the 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.060
 hematologist he is a blood bank a 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.799
 hematology unit where where are we going 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.600
 the hematologist takes the sample 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.780
 directly there 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.670
 and we see the amount of platelets that 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.490
 find saber a double check is done 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.590
 and sometimes what you do is adjust the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.009
 dose of the medication with which you are 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.650
 right now it's with medicine tablets and 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.319
 Sometimes the dose is increased in 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.739
 If we do not have the number of 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.060
 platelets that we see fit for the 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.739
 to have physical activity on 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.750
 Ultimate definitive treatment 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.570
 instance will be a 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.600
 a splenectomy in many cases 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.360
 they solve this type of diseases like this 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.680
 removing doing is a situation in the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.110
 which we reiterate the club that is 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.240
 prepared to face Veracruz with or 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.670
 without air at the end of the day not like that 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.580
 both the sports director and the 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.440
 doctor said they are going to wait for Pablo 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.209
 have contemplated let's wait because 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.530
 the reaction of the tests is 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.140
 they will do when he arrives today at the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.300
 city ​​and then wait nothing else this is 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.980
 the result that the premise does not change 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.420
 for queens you have to beat 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.020
 veracruz rodrigo hit bananas for 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.020
 protein chain
