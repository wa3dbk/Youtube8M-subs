the rubidium here it is is that it well
it<00:01:09.400> might<00:01:09.520> not<00:01:09.550> look<00:01:09.910> like<00:01:09.970> much<00:01:10.210> Richard<00:01:10.840> but

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
it might not look like much Richard but

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.840 
it might not look like much Richard but
it's<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.170> highly<00:01:11.560> reactive<00:01:11.710> metal<00:01:12.310> it's<00:01:12.550> sealed

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:17.619 
right so what's gonna happen when you

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.140 
right so what's gonna happen when you
drop<00:01:17.800> that<00:01:17.950> in<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.130> water<00:01:18.160> well<00:01:18.729> imagine<00:01:18.940> if

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
drop that in the water well imagine if

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.760 
drop that in the water well imagine if
you<00:01:19.300> will<00:01:19.420> letting<00:01:19.840> off<00:01:19.930> a<00:01:19.960> hand<00:01:20.229> grenade<00:01:20.410> in<00:01:20.710> a

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
you will letting off a hand grenade in a

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.609 
you will letting off a hand grenade in a
bathtub<00:01:21.010> right<00:01:21.790> oh<00:01:21.820> I'm<00:01:22.180> off<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:22.750> that<00:01:23.020> okay

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
bathtub right oh I'm off and that okay

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.160 
bathtub right oh I'm off and that okay
good<00:01:23.920> luck

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.800 

okay<00:01:29.170> tickle<00:01:29.610> drop<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.759> rubidium<00:01:31.090> in<00:01:31.509> the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
okay tickle drop the rubidium in the

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.770 
okay tickle drop the rubidium in the
water<00:01:32.520> stand<00:01:33.520> back<00:01:33.729> or<00:01:34.119> this<00:01:34.210> one's<00:01:34.509> gonna<00:01:34.690> be

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
water stand back or this one's gonna be

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.080 
water stand back or this one's gonna be
bad<00:01:35.050> two<00:01:35.740> grams<00:01:36.040> of<00:01:36.280> rubidium<00:01:36.580> will<00:01:36.940> only

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
bad two grams of rubidium will only

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.210 
bad two grams of rubidium will only
react<00:01:37.540> when<00:01:37.810> our<00:01:37.930> specially<00:01:38.410> designed<00:01:38.440> freyal

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
react when our specially designed freyal

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.460 
react when our specially designed freyal
dissolves<00:01:40.000> in<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.180> water<00:01:40.270> which<00:01:41.020> gives<00:01:41.229> John

dissolves in the water which gives John

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.320 
dissolves in the water which gives John
a<00:01:41.500> few<00:01:41.800> crucial<00:01:42.100> seconds<00:01:42.640> to<00:01:42.820> get<00:01:42.970> into<00:01:43.210> our

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
a few crucial seconds to get into our

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:59.770 
a few crucial seconds to get into our
safety<00:01:43.810> zone

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.660 

oh<00:02:00.780> that<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.890> more<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.369> it

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
oh that is more like it

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.719 
oh that is more like it
only<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:03.000> Brainiac<00:02:03.539> do<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:03.899> that<00:02:04.049> kind<00:02:04.350> of

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
only on Brainiac do you get that kind of

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.219 
only on Brainiac do you get that kind of
science<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.149> believe<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.810> go<00:02:06.990> one

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
science but I believe we can go one

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.020 
science but I believe we can go one
better<00:02:07.439> there<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.740> one<00:02:07.950> more<00:02:08.129> alkali<00:02:08.610> metal<00:02:08.940> we

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
better there is one more alkali metal we

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.240 
better there is one more alkali metal we
can<00:02:09.209> leave<00:02:09.479> any<00:02:09.599> rooms<00:02:09.989> yes<00:02:10.440> or<00:02:10.590> should<00:02:10.709> cesium

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
can leave any rooms yes or should cesium

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.710 
can leave any rooms yes or should cesium

the emperor of alkali metals

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.420 
the emperor of alkali metals
particularly<00:02:13.170> nasty<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.830> go<00:02:13.980> up<00:02:14.069> at<00:02:14.190> any<00:02:14.340> time

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
particularly nasty to go up at any time

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.630 
particularly nasty to go up at any time
and<00:02:15.239> that's<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.629> oh<00:02:15.780> yes<00:02:16.470> yeah<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:17.129> like<00:02:17.459> it

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
and that's it oh yes yeah I like it

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.610 
and that's it oh yes yeah I like it
already<00:02:17.760> now<00:02:18.090> what's<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.420> going<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:18.989> when

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
already now what's that going to do when
