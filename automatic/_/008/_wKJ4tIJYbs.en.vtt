00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.880

 personalization about the originator any 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.009

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:57.270
 picture you go to the folder where you have 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:01:02.960

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.030
 stretch well so it was like 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.040
 they are all over the screen here and so I was still 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.630
 brad death considerations every 10 seconds 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.020

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.780
 windows that 18 picture after each will 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 passed well with a margin of 30 seconds and I 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.720
 passed by the way I'm afraid 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.229

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.439

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.960
 a lot of mistakes she will just switched . 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:49.770
 this one more and then immediately again this 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:53.579
 so plan to make up nothing at all 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.430
 complicated and here you have a desktop with 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.170
 rabbit images in general nothing 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.360
