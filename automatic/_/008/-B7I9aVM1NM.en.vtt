you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.930> start<00:01:01.200> with<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.750> base<00:01:14.750> sharp<00:01:15.750> C

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
you can start with the base sharp C

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:28.120 
you can start with the base sharp C
database

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.550 

and<00:01:29.149> really<00:01:30.149> that<00:01:30.810> third<00:01:31.049> core<00:01:31.320> should<00:01:31.500> be

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
and really that third core should be

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.300 
and really that third core should be
indeed<00:01:31.979> G<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.939> B<00:01:33.000> flat<00:01:33.509> G<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:34.289> the<00:01:34.409> base<00:01:34.619> okay

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
indeed G and B flat G in the base okay

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:47.270 
indeed G and B flat G in the base okay
so<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:36.000> making<00:01:43.310> G<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.149> base<00:01:45.360> okay<00:01:46.280> then

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
so this making G in the base okay then

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:55.110 
so this making G in the base okay then
walk<00:01:47.670> up
