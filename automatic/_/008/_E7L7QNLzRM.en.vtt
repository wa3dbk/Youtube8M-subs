know we actually know quite a lot
already<00:00:12.599> as<00:00:13.230> usual<00:00:13.620> we've<00:00:13.740> seen<00:00:13.950> quite<00:00:14.250> a

already as usual we've seen quite a

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.540 
already as usual we've seen quite a
bunch<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.790> leaked<00:00:15.780> specs<00:00:16.350> we've<00:00:17.310> seen<00:00:17.490> some

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
bunch of leaked specs we've seen some

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.340 
bunch of leaked specs we've seen some
benchmarks<00:00:18.210> we've<00:00:18.390> got<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.660> usual<00:00:18.810> Chatty

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
benchmarks we've got the usual Chatty

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.920 
benchmarks we've got the usual Chatty
Cathy<00:00:19.740> executives<00:00:20.400> sort<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.119> dropping<00:00:21.449> bits

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
Cathy executives sort of dropping bits

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.200 
Cathy executives sort of dropping bits
and<00:00:22.199> pieces<00:00:22.650> here<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:22.890> there<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.910> let's<00:00:24.090> take

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
and pieces here and there so let's take

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.400 
and pieces here and there so let's take
you<00:00:24.300> through<00:00:24.480> what<00:00:24.600> we<00:00:24.720> think<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.019> know<00:00:25.050> what

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
you through what we think we know what

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.470 
you through what we think we know what
we<00:00:25.529> think<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.250> know<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.550> certain<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.970> what

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
we think we know for certain and what

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.240 
we think we know for certain and what
we're<00:00:27.599> kind<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.810> hoping<00:00:27.900> we'll<00:00:28.230> see<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.619> this

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
we're kind of hoping we'll see in this

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.160 
we're kind of hoping we'll see in this
year's<00:00:29.429> nine<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.240> first<00:00:30.960> things<00:00:31.109> first

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
year's nine so first things first

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.590 
year's nine so first things first
display<00:00:31.769> we<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.759> traditionally<00:00:33.390> seen<00:00:33.540> a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
display we have traditionally seen a

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.950 
display we have traditionally seen a
point<00:00:33.899> two<00:00:34.079> inch<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:35.010> an<00:00:35.100> increase<00:00:35.340> every<00:00:35.670> year

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
point two inch of an increase every year

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.920 
point two inch of an increase every year
the<00:00:36.960> existing<00:00:37.649> note<00:00:37.800> 3<00:00:38.040> has<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.420> 5.7<00:00:39.420> inch<00:00:39.510> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
the existing note 3 has a 5.7 inch so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.770 
the existing note 3 has a 5.7 inch so
maybe<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.980> 59<00:00:41.520> but<00:00:42.000> keep<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.390> mind<00:00:42.420> we're

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
maybe a 59 but keep in mind we're

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
maybe a 59 but keep in mind we're
expecting<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> curved<00:00:43.770> OLED<00:00:44.340> display

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
expecting to see a curved OLED display

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.790 
expecting to see a curved OLED display
which<00:00:45.510> will<00:00:45.660> wrap<00:00:45.840> around<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> edges<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
which will wrap around the edges of the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560 
which will wrap around the edges of the
display<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.280> we'll<00:00:47.610> actually<00:00:47.760> be<00:00:47.969> able<00:00:48.239> to

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
display so we'll actually be able to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.690 
display so we'll actually be able to
read<00:00:48.780> notifications<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.890> interact<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
read notifications and interact with the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.939 
read notifications and interact with the
with<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> interface<00:00:51.629> through<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.649> edges<00:00:52.920> of

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
with the interface through the edges of

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.260 
with the interface through the edges of
the<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> phone<00:00:53.789> which<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.149> pretty

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
the of the phone which is pretty

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.090 
the of the phone which is pretty
exciting<00:00:54.449> stuff<00:00:54.780> so<00:00:55.140> perhaps<00:00:55.320> we'll<00:00:55.620> stick

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
exciting stuff so perhaps we'll stick

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.670 
exciting stuff so perhaps we'll stick
with<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.309> 5.7<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.360> front<00:00:57.600> maybe<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.530> will

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
with a 5.7 on the front maybe we will

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.130 
with a 5.7 on the front maybe we will
see<00:00:58.739> two<00:00:59.160> two<00:00:59.600> versions<00:01:00.600> you'll<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> flat

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
see two two versions you'll see a flat

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.779 
see two two versions you'll see a flat
version<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> curve<00:01:02.370> version

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
version and one with the curve version

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.320 
version and one with the curve version
for<00:01:02.969> more<00:01:03.120> niche<00:01:03.300> markets<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:05.330> resolution

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
for more niche markets the resolution

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.910 
for more niche markets the resolution
will<00:01:06.810> be<00:01:06.930> pretty<00:01:07.140> decent<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.799> be

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
will be pretty decent is going to be

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.460 
will be pretty decent is going to be
quad<00:01:08.520> HD<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.970> same<00:01:09.119> we've<00:01:09.270> seen<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.900> LG<00:01:10.290> g3

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
quad HD the same we've seen in the LG g3

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.039 
quad HD the same we've seen in the LG g3
and<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> Oppo<00:01:11.280> find<00:01:11.460> 7<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.689> will<00:01:12.780> put<00:01:12.960> it

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
and the Oppo find 7 so that will put it

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.469 
and the Oppo find 7 so that will put it
with<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> pixel<00:01:13.500> density<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.890> 515<00:01:14.880> which<00:01:15.240> is

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
with a pixel density of 515 which is

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.359 
with a pixel density of 515 which is
pretty<00:01:15.930> good<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.470> you've<00:01:16.740> no<00:01:16.920> problems<00:01:17.280> there

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
pretty good so you've no problems there

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.660 
pretty good so you've no problems there
as<00:01:18.210> usual<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> same<00:01:19.170> pitch<00:01:19.590> blacks<00:01:19.920> lots

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
as usual get the same pitch blacks lots

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.370 
as usual get the same pitch blacks lots
of<00:01:20.790> saturation<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.540> high<00:01:21.720> contrast<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.259> we

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
of saturation and high contrast that we

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380 
of saturation and high contrast that we
always<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.770> from<00:01:22.979> Samsung<00:01:23.430> displays<00:01:23.790> as<00:01:24.030> full

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
always get from Samsung displays as full

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.690 
always get from Samsung displays as full
hardware<00:01:24.810> well<00:01:25.110> there<00:01:25.350> will<00:01:25.530> as<00:01:25.830> usual<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.460> two

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
hardware well there will as usual be two

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.310 
hardware well there will as usual be two
versions<00:01:27.090> there<00:01:27.240> will<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> Exynos<00:01:28.110> based

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
versions there will be the Exynos based

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.740 
versions there will be the Exynos based
version<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:28.950> an<00:01:29.250> octa-core<00:01:29.670> set<00:01:30.210> up<00:01:30.329> then

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
version with an octa-core set up then

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.840 
version with an octa-core set up then
there'll<00:01:30.960> be<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.049> quad-core<00:01:31.409> snapdragon<00:01:32.250> set

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
there'll be a quad-core snapdragon set

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.280 
there'll be a quad-core snapdragon set
up<00:01:32.970> which<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.600> year<00:01:33.810> will<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.079> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
up which this year will be the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.560 
up which this year will be the
Snapdragon<00:01:34.829> 805<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.850> far<00:01:36.030> we've<00:01:36.180> seen<00:01:36.210> some

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
Snapdragon 805 so far we've seen some

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.810 
Snapdragon 805 so far we've seen some
benchmarks<00:01:37.170> leaked<00:01:37.380> where<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.340> excellence

devices from the end of last year and

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.240 
devices from the end of last year and
earlier<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.810> year<00:02:00.869> you'll<00:02:01.770> get<00:02:01.920> twenty

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
earlier this year you'll get twenty

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.130 
earlier this year you'll get twenty
percent<00:02:02.460> less<00:02:02.700> power<00:02:02.909> consumption<00:02:03.390> but<00:02:03.719> forty

percent less power consumption but forty

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.840 
percent less power consumption but forty
percent<00:02:04.469> better<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.130> processor

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
percent better in a processor

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.310 
percent better in a processor
performance<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.600> that's<00:02:06.810> pretty<00:02:07.020> exciting

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
performance so that's pretty exciting

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.350 
performance so that's pretty exciting
the<00:02:08.190> Snapdragon<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:08.729> also<00:02:08.940> come<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the Snapdragon will also come with the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.170 
the Snapdragon will also come with the

to<00:02:12.329> be<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.719> first<00:02:12.750> commercially<00:02:13.590> available

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
to be the first commercially available

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.819 
to be the first commercially available
dynamic<00:02:14.640> hardware<00:02:15.090> tessellation<00:02:15.900> capable

dynamic hardware tessellation capable
graphics<00:02:17.700> processor<00:02:18.180> which<00:02:18.569> basically<00:02:18.900> means

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:19.109 
graphics processor which basically means

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:21.259 
graphics processor which basically means
you'll<00:02:19.290> get<00:02:19.409> a<00:02:19.469> lot<00:02:20.040> more<00:02:20.099> detail<00:02:20.640> with<00:02:20.969> less

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
you'll get a lot more detail with less

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.089 
you'll get a lot more detail with less
power<00:02:21.510> consumption<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.260> less<00:02:22.500> memory<00:02:22.829> so

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
power consumption and less memory so

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.539 
power consumption and less memory so
that's<00:02:23.459> something<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.909> look<00:02:24.000> out<00:02:24.209> for<00:02:24.269> as<00:02:24.659> well

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
that's something to look out for as well

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.589 
that's something to look out for as well
further<00:02:26.549> on<00:02:26.579> the<00:02:26.730> hardware<00:02:26.939> front<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.359> will

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
further on the hardware front we will

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.360

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
have definitely three gigabytes of RAM

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.970 
have definitely three gigabytes of RAM
maybe<00:02:29.760> even<00:02:29.849> four<00:02:30.239> we<00:02:30.810> will<00:02:31.049> of<00:02:31.379> course<00:02:31.469> have<00:02:31.739> a

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
maybe even four we will of course have a

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.970 
maybe even four we will of course have a

better finger scanner will we see the

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.619 
better finger scanner will we see the

we still get the heart rate monitor on
the<00:04:05.400> back<00:04:05.549> probably<00:04:06.239> I<00:04:06.269> think<00:04:06.419> wearable

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
the back probably I think wearable

now as we saw with the galaxy s5 we had

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.539 
now as we saw with the galaxy s5 we had
the<00:04:12.989> fantastic<00:04:13.590> ultra<00:04:13.859> power<00:04:14.069> saving<00:04:14.189> mode

but<00:04:46.080> Samsung<00:04:46.470> has<00:04:46.620> been<00:04:46.800> changing<00:04:47.160> it<00:04:47.280> up<00:04:47.340> with

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
but Samsung has been changing it up with

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.190 
but Samsung has been changing it up with
every<00:04:48.000> device<00:04:48.270> they've<00:04:48.570> sort<00:04:48.810> of<00:04:48.870> release<00:04:49.050> it

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.270 
doubt we'll see a major change of the
overall<00:04:55.020> design<00:04:55.440> but<00:04:55.740> we<00:04:55.830> may<00:04:55.980> will<00:04:56.160> see

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
overall design but we may will see

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.410 
overall design but we may will see
something<00:04:56.580> a<00:04:56.670> little<00:04:56.790> bit<00:04:56.940> different<00:04:57.270> on<00:04:57.330> the

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
something a little bit different on the

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.820 
something a little bit different on the
back<00:04:57.600> my<00:04:57.840> hope<00:04:58.020> is<00:04:58.050> we<00:04:58.290> see<00:04:58.440> something<00:04:58.680> like

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
back my hope is we see something like

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.790 
back my hope is we see something like
the<00:04:59.070> g3<00:04:59.550> sort<00:04:59.940> of<00:05:00.000> plastic<00:05:00.840> metallic<00:05:01.350> thing<00:05:01.680> on

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
the g3 sort of plastic metallic thing on

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.750 
the g3 sort of plastic metallic thing on
the<00:05:01.890> back<00:05:02.010> which<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.340> really<00:05:02.520> great<00:05:02.700> for

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
the back which is really great for

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.700 
the back which is really great for
fingerprints<00:05:03.330> and<00:05:03.390> also<00:05:04.080> quite<00:05:04.320> comfortable

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
fingerprints and also quite comfortable

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.980 
fingerprints and also quite comfortable
and<00:05:04.950> great<00:05:05.430> for<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.790> larger<00:05:06.180> screen<00:05:06.630> device

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
and great for a larger screen device

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.800 
and great for a larger screen device
that's<00:05:07.290> going<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.590> fit<00:05:07.710> nicely<00:05:08.070> in<00:05:08.370> your<00:05:08.430> hand

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
that's going to fit nicely in your hand

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.000 
that's going to fit nicely in your hand
maybe<00:05:09.810> we'll<00:05:10.050> see<00:05:10.260> something<00:05:10.470> that<00:05:10.680> tries<00:05:10.980> to

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
maybe we'll see something that tries to

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.770 
maybe we'll see something that tries to
bridge<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.460> gap<00:05:11.490> between<00:05:11.730> the<00:05:11.970> galaxy<00:05:12.360> s<00:05:12.510> and

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
bridge the gap between the galaxy s and

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.160 
bridge the gap between the galaxy s and
the<00:05:13.170> upcoming<00:05:13.680> Galaxy<00:05:14.100> f<00:05:14.400> series<00:05:14.730> and<00:05:15.170> highly

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
the upcoming Galaxy f series and highly

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.050 
the upcoming Galaxy f series and highly
unlikely<00:05:16.260> that<00:05:16.560> we'll<00:05:16.740> see<00:05:16.980> a<00:05:17.220> all<00:05:17.610> metal

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
unlikely that we'll see a all metal

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.580 
unlikely that we'll see a all metal
device<00:05:18.450> obviously<00:05:18.630> considering<00:05:19.290> the<00:05:19.410> size

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
device obviously considering the size

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:21.530 
device obviously considering the size
that<00:05:19.890> would<00:05:20.010> make<00:05:20.220> it<00:05:20.400> so<00:05:20.430> heavy<00:05:20.880> it<00:05:21.120> will<00:05:21.270> sink

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
that would make it so heavy it will sink

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.660 
that would make it so heavy it will sink
you<00:05:21.600> who<00:05:22.560> knows<00:05:22.740> maybe<00:05:22.980> we'll<00:05:23.160> see<00:05:23.310> some<00:05:23.490> water

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
you who knows maybe we'll see some water

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.610 
you who knows maybe we'll see some water
resistance<00:05:24.150> as<00:05:24.300> well<00:05:24.450> but<00:05:24.810> we'll<00:05:25.470> have<00:05:25.560> to

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
resistance as well but we'll have to

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.440 
resistance as well but we'll have to
wait<00:05:25.830> and<00:05:25.890> see<00:05:26.070> arm<00:05:26.430> September<00:05:27.030> forth<00:05:27.240> until

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 
wait and see arm September forth until

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.150 
wait and see arm September forth until
