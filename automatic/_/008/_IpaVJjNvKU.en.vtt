00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.040
 Types of Bearings There are Bearings 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.559
 of contact 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.050
 Bearings High with Ball Thinkers 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.510
 and career bowling ball bearings 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.720
 cylindrical rollers or jump with thinkers 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.570
 with two tapered roller rows the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.000
 Thrust needle to the ball 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.189
 bearings for protection of a bearing 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.189
 for you to know a roll 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:44.920
 both axel of good sphere or not 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:49.660
 22 are ball bearings the axial 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:52.390
 single school and double school them 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.910
 high axial loads but 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.400
 can be subjected to radial loads 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.950
 so that the spheres are sent in the 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.010
 tracks of these bearings is firmly 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.229
 I need a minimum initial charge but a 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.080
 large load bearing 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.460
 official high axial bearing 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 roller compensator 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.060
 as it has the inclined rollers supports 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.970
 the axial loads and still supports 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.890
 Considerable radial loads on the track 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.590
 ball ring of that 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.200
 allows for angular alignment 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.660
 compensating for possible misalignments or 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.880
 of the pyramidal axis 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.050
 that you should take in the assembly of 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.850
 bearings 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.979
 When are we going to set up a bearing? 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.340
 need to take, among others, the following 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.229
 care is to check the dimensions 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.630
 to know if the measures of the club axis 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.539
 it is correct to use the lubricant 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.850
 recommended by the manufacturer to remove 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.160
 burrs is also important as well as 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.229
 wash and lubricate the bearing when 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.840
 in the case of reuse 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.000
 another recommendation that the staff makes is 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.670
 do not use tow in cleaning operations 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.750
 and working in a suitable environment without 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.750
 can humidity
