got this off it's the stuff I use all
the<00:02:22.599> time<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.349> it's<00:02:23.890> holy<00:02:24.250> Smith<00:02:24.760> while

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
the time and it's holy Smith while

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.119 
the time and it's holy Smith while
you're<00:02:25.299> pregnant<00:02:25.540> anyway<00:02:26.080> so<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.799> was<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:26.980> good

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129 
you're pregnant anyway so it was a good

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.850 
you're pregnant anyway so it was a good
thing<00:02:27.810> so<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:28.870> didn't<00:02:29.200> do<00:02:29.379> anything

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
thing so I didn't do anything

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.820 
thing so I didn't do anything
um<00:02:30.129> I<00:02:31.440> think<00:02:32.440> because<00:02:33.010> my<00:02:33.040> hair<00:02:33.430> was<00:02:34.830> my

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
um I think because my hair was my

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.130 
um I think because my hair was my
natural<00:02:36.250> hair<00:02:36.400> color<00:02:36.459> was<00:02:36.760> dirty<00:02:37.090> blonde<00:02:37.450> and

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
natural hair color was dirty blonde and

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.270 
natural hair color was dirty blonde and
I<00:02:38.230> haven't<00:02:38.500> dyed<00:02:38.709> it

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
I haven't dyed it

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.770 
I haven't dyed it
I<00:02:39.310> didn't<00:02:39.730> diet<00:02:39.940> since<00:02:40.239> before<00:02:40.450> I<00:02:40.660> got

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
I didn't diet since before I got

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.180 
I didn't diet since before I got
pregnant<00:02:41.019> just<00:02:42.060> because<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.269> was<00:02:43.420> a<00:02:43.450> little

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
pregnant just because I was a little

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.630 
pregnant just because I was a little
theory<00:02:45.190> on<00:02:45.579> if<00:02:46.209> it's<00:02:46.450> safe<00:02:46.690> or<00:02:46.720> not

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
theory on if it's safe or not

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.420 
theory on if it's safe or not
and<00:02:48.640> so<00:02:49.569> I<00:02:49.599> dyed<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.380> it's<00:02:50.739> not<00:02:50.890> like<00:02:51.130> it's

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
and so I dyed it so it's not like it's

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.559 
and so I dyed it so it's not like it's
dark<00:02:51.640> as<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:52.030> wanted<00:02:52.329> it<00:02:52.540> to<00:02:52.690> be<00:02:53.519> is<00:02:54.519> so<00:02:54.879> light<00:02:55.329> a

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
dark as I wanted it to be is so light a

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.630 
dark as I wanted it to be is so light a
little<00:02:55.900> bit<00:02:56.019> underneath<00:02:56.319> and<00:02:56.709> stuff<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.579> I'm

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640
