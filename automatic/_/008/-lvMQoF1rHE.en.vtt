as<00:01:58.939> well<00:01:59.939> why<00:02:00.210> playing<00:02:00.509> in<00:02:01.250> 60fps<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.880> I

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
as well why playing in 60fps and I

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.179 
as well why playing in 60fps and I
managed<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.509> get<00:02:03.630> 100<00:02:04.049> FPS<00:02:04.439> but<00:02:04.860> when<00:02:05.100> you

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
managed to get 100 FPS but when you

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.850 
managed to get 100 FPS but when you
record<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.899> obviously<00:02:06.899> shrinks<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.469> down<00:02:07.680> to

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
record it obviously shrinks it down to

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.949 
record it obviously shrinks it down to
the<00:02:07.950> vsync<00:02:08.340> anyway<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.119> what<00:02:09.300> you<00:02:09.450> recording
