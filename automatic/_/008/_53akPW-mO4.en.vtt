three full ring speakers there's a 10 a

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:17.600 
three full ring speakers there's a 10 a
12<00:00:14.730> which<00:00:15.120> I<00:00:15.240> have<00:00:15.419> here<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:15.960> 15<00:00:16.610> there

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
12 which I have here and the 15 there

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.490 
12 which I have here and the 15 there
are<00:00:17.700> 0<00:00:17.730> 800<00:00:18.360> watts<00:00:18.509> they<00:00:18.960> all<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.230> the<00:00:19.320> same

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
are 0 800 watts they all have the same

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.049 
are 0 800 watts they all have the same
features<00:00:19.980> except<00:00:20.369> for<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.610> size<00:00:20.849> of<00:00:20.970> the

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:21.059 
features except for the size of the

00:00:21.059 --> 00:00:22.909 
features except for the size of the
woofer<00:00:21.300> obviously<00:00:21.809> but<00:00:22.410> what<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.559> want<00:00:22.770> to<00:00:22.829> talk

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:22.919 
woofer obviously but what I want to talk

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.460 
woofer obviously but what I want to talk
about<00:00:22.950> is<00:00:23.340> first<00:00:23.849> the<00:00:23.970> high<00:00:24.149> frequency<00:00:24.630> end<00:00:25.259> of

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
about is first the high frequency end of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.700 
about is first the high frequency end of
it<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.800> lot<00:00:26.610> of<00:00:26.640> people<00:00:26.790> think<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.380> driver

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
it a lot of people think that the driver

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.499 
it a lot of people think that the driver
and<00:00:28.919> the<00:00:28.980> horn<00:00:29.309> are<00:00:29.489> the<00:00:29.579> same<00:00:29.820> thing<00:00:30.149> and

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
and the horn are the same thing and

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.430 
and the horn are the same thing and
they're<00:00:30.750> not<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.739> horn<00:00:33.079> really<00:00:34.079> makes<00:00:34.320> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
they're not and the horn really makes a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.040 
they're not and the horn really makes a
difference<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:35.070> driver<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.850> here<00:00:36.329> being<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
difference the driver in here being the

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.210 
difference the driver in here being the
14<00:00:37.500> XT<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.820> very<00:00:39.150> large<00:00:39.420> diaphragm<00:00:40.220> it's

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.220 
14 XT is a very large diaphragm it's

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.890 
14 XT is a very large diaphragm it's
about<00:00:41.370> twice<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.850> size<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.510> most<00:00:42.630> of<00:00:42.810> our

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900 
about twice the size of most of our

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.540 
about twice the size of most of our
competitors<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.740> then<00:00:44.040> larger<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
competitors and then larger the

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.220 
competitors and then larger the
diaphragm<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.150> lower<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.450> frequency<00:00:45.630> it<00:00:46.079> can

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
diaphragm the lower in frequency it can

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.410 
diaphragm the lower in frequency it can
go<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.040> it<00:00:47.160> can<00:00:47.310> match<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.850> in<00:00:48.060> the<00:00:48.180> mid-range

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
go so it can match up in the mid-range

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.200 
go so it can match up in the mid-range
section<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> 12<00:00:49.530> do<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.640> smooth

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
section of the 12 do you really smooth

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.350 
section of the 12 do you really smooth
mid-range<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.140> high-end<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:53.040> this

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
mid-range and high-end and this

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.700 
mid-range and high-end and this
absolutely<00:00:54.360> does<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.590> more

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
absolutely does it but it's more

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.410 
absolutely does it but it's more
important<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.610> horn<00:00:56.850> here<00:00:57.060> is<00:00:57.149> called<00:00:57.360> our

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
important is the horn here is called our

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.580 
important is the horn here is called our
quadratic<00:00:58.079> waveguide<00:00:58.800> horn<00:00:59.160> big<00:00:59.760> words

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
quadratic waveguide horn big words

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.020 
quadratic waveguide horn big words
essentially<00:01:01.590> every<00:01:01.890> horn<00:01:02.190> has<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.880> we<00:01:02.910> call

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
essentially every horn has what we call

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.530 
essentially every horn has what we call
distortion<00:01:03.780> fluctuation<00:01:04.769> when<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:06.149> the<00:01:06.329> air

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
distortion fluctuation when you the air

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.379 
distortion fluctuation when you the air
comes<00:01:06.810> out<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.110> horn<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.829> it<00:01:08.369> hits<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> sides

00:01:09.379 --> 00:01:09.389 
comes out of horn the it hits the sides

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:10.969 
comes out of horn the it hits the sides
and<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.810> does<00:01:10.079> this<00:01:10.289> in<00:01:10.530> turn<00:01:10.679> causes

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and it does this in turn causes

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.700 
and it does this in turn causes
turbulence<00:01:11.460> which<00:01:11.880> we<00:01:11.999> call<00:01:12.179> distortion<00:01:12.749> you

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
turbulence which we call distortion you

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.529 
turbulence which we call distortion you
ever<00:01:13.859> walk<00:01:14.130> up<00:01:14.399> towards<00:01:14.639> a<00:01:14.819> speaker<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
ever walk up towards a speaker and

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.239 
ever walk up towards a speaker and
within<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:16.020> foot<00:01:16.289> or<00:01:16.409> two<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:16.619> gets<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.889> lot

00:01:17.239 --> 00:01:17.249 
within a foot or two it gets a lot

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:19.520 
within a foot or two it gets a lot
louder<00:01:17.579> you're<00:01:18.479> in<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.780> distortion<00:01:19.289> zone

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
louder you're in the distortion zone

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.559 
louder you're in the distortion zone
that's<00:01:19.950> what<00:01:20.159> happens<00:01:20.609> you're<00:01:20.759> not<00:01:20.969> it's<00:01:21.450> not

00:01:21.559 --> 00:01:21.569 
that's what happens you're not it's not

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:22.999 
that's what happens you're not it's not
loud<00:01:21.899> or<00:01:22.109> but<00:01:22.229> distortion<00:01:22.709> gives<00:01:22.889> you<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
loud or but distortion gives you the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.120 
loud or but distortion gives you the
perception<00:01:23.579> of<00:01:23.700> loudness<00:01:24.770> this<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:26.039> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
perception of loudness this with the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.330 
perception of loudness this with the
quadratic<00:01:26.609> wave<00:01:26.759> horn<00:01:27.119> doesn't<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:28.079> that<00:01:28.350> so

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
quadratic wave horn doesn't have that so

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.309 
quadratic wave horn doesn't have that so
whether<00:01:29.549> you're<00:01:29.789> 50<00:01:30.270> feet<00:01:30.450> away<00:01:30.600> or<00:01:30.780> five<00:01:31.049> for

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319 
whether you're 50 feet away or five for

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:32.809 
whether you're 50 feet away or five for
your<00:01:31.409> way<00:01:31.560> you'll<00:01:31.740> never<00:01:31.979> get<00:01:32.219> ear<00:01:32.459> fatigue

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
your way you'll never get ear fatigue

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:35.330 
your way you'll never get ear fatigue
that's<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.779> important<00:01:34.259> thing<00:01:34.319> if<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.310> ever

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that's the important thing if you ever

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.550 
that's the important thing if you ever
listen<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.969> speaker<00:01:36.299> listen<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.350> more<00:01:37.499> than

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
listen to a speaker listen for more than

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.800 
listen to a speaker listen for more than
45<00:01:37.829> seconds<00:01:38.520> listen<00:01:38.819> to<00:01:38.909> speak<00:01:39.090> for<00:01:39.270> 10<00:01:39.420> or<00:01:39.450> 15

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
45 seconds listen to speak for 10 or 15

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.969 
45 seconds listen to speak for 10 or 15
minutes<00:01:39.959> to<00:01:40.109> see<00:01:40.229> our<00:01:40.350> ear<00:01:40.499> feels<00:01:40.799> because

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
minutes to see our ear feels because

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.399 
minutes to see our ear feels because
that's<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.340> real<00:01:41.490> test<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.929> I<00:01:43.200> think

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
that's the real test of it so I think

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.499 
that's the real test of it so I think
this<00:01:43.770> makes<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.219> superior<00:01:44.639> the<00:01:44.939> low<00:01:45.119> end<00:01:45.359> in

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
this makes it superior the low end in

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.269 
this makes it superior the low end in
these<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:45.810> great<00:01:46.229> if<00:01:46.679> you<00:01:46.889> if<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.189> ever

00:01:47.269 --> 00:01:47.279 
these was great if you if you ever

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:49.690 
these was great if you if you ever

and<00:02:04.919> I<00:02:05.340> have<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.789> bad<00:02:05.969> back<00:02:06.179> so<00:02:06.240> if<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.139> can<00:02:07.349> do<00:02:07.439> it

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
and I have a bad back so if I can do it

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.469 
and I have a bad back so if I can do it
you<00:02:07.979> can<00:02:08.009> do<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.340> okay<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:08.759> we're<00:02:09.149> looking<00:02:09.240> at

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
you can do it okay so we're looking at

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.199 
you can do it okay so we're looking at
the<00:02:09.599> back<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.990> pv<00:02:10.349> XP<00:02:10.830> speakers<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
the back of the pv XP speakers and the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.640 
the back of the pv XP speakers and the
one<00:02:12.390> thing<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.660> think<00:02:12.900> you'll<00:02:13.019> notice<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.500> makes

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
one thing I think you'll notice it makes

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.839 
one thing I think you'll notice it makes
a<00:02:13.739> little<00:02:13.860> difference<00:02:14.370> thing<00:02:14.579> called

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
a little difference thing called

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.650 
a little difference thing called
expansion<00:02:15.599> slot<00:02:16.129> we<00:02:17.129> actually<00:02:17.340> make<00:02:17.879> a<00:02:18.120> three

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
expansion slot we actually make a three

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.270 
expansion slot we actually make a three
channel<00:02:18.840> mixer<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.740> put<00:02:19.890> into<00:02:20.040> here

a 9 band graphic EQ and a 3-band
parametric<00:02:24.030> eq<00:02:24.360> use<00:02:24.510> take<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.870> out<00:02:25.110> there's

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
parametric eq use take this out there's

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.240 
parametric eq use take this out there's
a<00:02:26.040> plug<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.550> pop<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.210> in<00:02:27.360> put<00:02:27.960> it<00:02:27.990> in<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:28.470> now

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
a plug you pop it in put it in and now

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.940 
a plug you pop it in put it in and now
you<00:02:29.700> can<00:02:29.850> have<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.000> 3<00:02:30.330> channel<00:02:30.720> mixer<00:02:31.200> added<00:02:31.830> to

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
you can have a 3 channel mixer added to

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.870 
you can have a 3 channel mixer added to
it<00:02:32.010> because<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.220> one<00:02:32.370> thing<00:02:32.400> people<00:02:32.760> always

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
it because the one thing people always

it because the one thing people always
say<00:02:33.150> is<00:02:33.300> can<00:02:33.690> I<00:02:33.750> get<00:02:33.810> more<00:02:34.110> than<00:02:34.290> just<00:02:34.350> one

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
say is can I get more than just one

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.250 
say is can I get more than just one
thing<00:02:34.890> in<00:02:35.070> here<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.490> can<00:02:35.610> plug<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.850> mic<00:02:36.180> in

them together so if you need to hook
them<00:02:47.790> up<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:47.910> other<00:02:48.150> ones<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.290> rest<00:02:49.470> is

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
them up to other ones and the rest is

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.080 
them up to other ones and the rest is
very<00:02:49.740> simple<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.160> have<00:02:50.250> your<00:02:50.430> cable<00:02:50.790> here<00:02:50.940> and

very simple you have your cable here and
your<00:02:51.180> power<00:02:51.330> on<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.840> off<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.200> there's<00:02:52.320> your

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
your power on and off and there's your

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.090 
your power on and off and there's your
breaker<00:02:52.710> so<00:02:53.600> with<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.690> expansion<00:02:54.960> slot<00:02:55.530> this

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
breaker so with the expansion slot this

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.530 
breaker so with the expansion slot this
can<00:02:56.310> have<00:02:56.460> a<00:02:56.490> three<00:02:56.730> channel<00:02:57.030> mixer<00:02:57.180> in<00:02:57.420> it

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
can have a three channel mixer in it

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.750 
can have a three channel mixer in it
nine<00:02:57.870> band<00:02:58.080> EQ<00:02:58.440> or<00:02:58.470> three<00:02:58.860> band<00:02:59.070> parametric<00:02:59.640> if

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
nine band EQ or three band parametric if

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.220 
nine band EQ or three band parametric if
you<00:02:59.850> really<00:03:00.150> want<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.390> like<00:03:00.630> tweak<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.080> system
