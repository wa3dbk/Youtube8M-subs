00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 satisfied I seem to have passed the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.600
 round a changed game 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.740
 blatantly after the expulsion of three 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.110
 teddy bears china 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.040
 no the game started well for them 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.200
 yes yes no no 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.209
 I appreciate that the samp really plays 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.520
 well and also having changed so many 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:20.680
 players play well so congratulations 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.810
 to the left as it is doing is 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.610
 become a great coach a good one 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.649
 maestro I say no no no then it is clear that 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.869
 with the extra man it was easier 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:34.090
 on the one hand it is more difficult than the other 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.309
 because clearly the spaces are are 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.020
 but the approach we have diminished 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.809
 had a good dribble that was 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.820
 we had a lot of improvement though 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.440
 is what we have to do that of 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.480
 hold the ball until it is found 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.790
 right solution and therefore for this 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.250
 we will improve news I said 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.480
 with such small spaces or by a 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.980
 corner kick from a native shovel 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.110
 or through a great game 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.180
 quick to ask ahead is arrived 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.310
 that option have able players 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.620
 to play like that take you to 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.740
 unblock situations where it is otherwise 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:11.530
 difficult to find safe gates because 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:14.049
 but if we have, we would have been in a hurry 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.180
 to play or perhaps other canvases played 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.770
 it was even more difficult instead we have 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.390
 dribbled well 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.960
 maybe we need to improve speed 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.969
 but then you find the imbata made me 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.240
 the goal is hardly a penalty 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.619
 other occasions that I was wrong 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.130
 so those things were things 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.319
 right done alberto nagaja for the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.759
 mister if I have a question for the coach 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.610
 tonight the inter has pulled towards the 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.860
 leads to 20 times is all fruit of the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.380
 numerical superiority or there was at sea 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.600
 an indication of his that has arrived for 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.179
 look for the shot towards the part several times 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.509
 of romero 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:55.179
 me and the first time in the sense that the 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.239
 first time i see what i would like 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.239
 to see 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.380
 the high team approach to the game 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.910
 ball owner without fear and is 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.520
 what we should get to do 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.300
 I don't think it's that simple to do it 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.650
 so quickly it will still take time 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.840
 But that's what they have to get to do 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.670
 hi roby this is what rai asks 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.290
 therefore to the team a good acam of 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.520
 also seen the disqualifications on Sunday 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.040
