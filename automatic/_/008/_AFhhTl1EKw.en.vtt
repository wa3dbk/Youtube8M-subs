how this runs alright so I'm good
everything<00:00:37.140> was<00:00:37.290> running<00:00:37.440> pretty<00:00:38.160> well<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:39.000> was

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
everything was running pretty well I was

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.310 
everything was running pretty well I was
getting<00:00:39.960> about<00:00:40.290> 50<00:00:40.860> frames<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:42.200> change<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
getting about 50 frames I change the

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.819 
getting about 50 frames I change the
textures<00:00:43.770> too<00:00:44.120> high<00:00:45.140> so<00:00:46.140> now<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.320> textures

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
textures too high so now the textures

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.709 
textures too high so now the textures
are<00:00:47.100> practical<00:00:47.610> textures<00:00:47.850> are<00:00:47.969> maxed<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.510> as

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
are practical textures are maxed out as

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.209 
are practical textures are maxed out as
you<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.989> see<00:00:49.140> ticket<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:49.649> grass<00:00:49.920> over

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
you can see ticket up this grass over

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.189 
you can see ticket up this grass over
here<00:00:50.390> it<00:00:51.390> looks<00:00:51.539> pretty<00:00:51.629> pretty<00:00:52.350> detailed

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
here it looks pretty pretty detailed

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.779 
here it looks pretty pretty detailed
let's<00:00:55.199> go<00:00:55.379> ahead<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.219> how<00:00:56.250> much<00:00:56.550> more

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
let's go ahead and see how much more

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.330 
let's go ahead and see how much more
graphics<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.329> can<00:00:57.510> bump<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.930> up<00:00:58.280> it's<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
graphics we can bump this up it's a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.910 
graphics we can bump this up it's a
fantastic<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.440> definitely<00:01:01.590> trying

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
fantastic in here so definitely trying

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.010 
fantastic in here so definitely trying
to<00:01:01.980> cool<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> system<00:01:03.470> but<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.589> doesn't<00:01:05.180> -<00:01:09.020> ok

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
to cool the system but it doesn't - ok

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.320 
to cool the system but it doesn't - ok
so<00:01:10.080> with<00:01:10.470> everything<00:01:10.770> pretty<00:01:11.369> much<00:01:11.640> maxed<00:01:11.970> out

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
so with everything pretty much maxed out

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.030 
so with everything pretty much maxed out
except<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.020> ssao<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:16.380> resolution

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
except for the ssao and the resolution

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.999 
except for the ssao and the resolution
as<00:01:17.280> well<00:01:17.310> as<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.790> drop<00:01:18.000> ik<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:19.409> game<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
as well as I just drop ik the game is

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.789 
as well as I just drop ik the game is
running<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:20.520> about<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.880> decent<00:01:21.600> 30<00:01:21.900> fps

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
running out about a decent 30 fps

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.640 
running out about a decent 30 fps
which<00:01:23.400> isn't<00:01:23.610> bad<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.270> mean<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.409> pretty

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
which isn't bad I mean this is pretty

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.249 
which isn't bad I mean this is pretty
much<00:01:25.770> playable<00:01:26.340> I've<00:01:26.670> played<00:01:27.060> mmo's<00:01:27.570> but<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
much playable I've played mmo's but it

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.460 
much playable I've played mmo's but it
goes<00:01:28.439> online<00:01:28.619> with<00:01:29.100> like<00:01:29.310> 20<00:01:30.030> fps<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.810> when

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
goes online with like 20 fps and when

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.170 
goes online with like 20 fps and when
you<00:01:31.530> join<00:01:31.710> cities<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.369> tons<00:01:32.670> of<00:01:33.000> people

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
you join cities to have tons of people

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.200 
you join cities to have tons of people
it's<00:01:33.540> really<00:01:34.439> not<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.650> surprising<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.610> have

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
it's really not that surprising to have

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.480 
it's really not that surprising to have
your<00:01:36.360> frame<00:01:36.630> rates<00:01:36.840> drop<00:01:37.110> pretty<00:01:37.380> low<00:01:37.560> but<00:01:38.310> I

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
your frame rates drop pretty low but I

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.859 
your frame rates drop pretty low but I
can<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.180> tell<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.360> right<00:01:39.450> now<00:01:39.509> that<00:01:39.630> you

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
run pretty well right now I'm running

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.639 
run pretty well right now I'm running
everything<00:01:50.640> pretty<00:01:50.939> much<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.149> ultra<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.810> it's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
everything pretty much on ultra and it's

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.100 
everything pretty much on ultra and it's
it's<00:01:53.490> pretty<00:01:53.880> good<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.270> mean<00:01:54.600> I'm<00:01:54.750> not<00:01:54.930> really

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it's pretty good I mean I'm not really

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.920 
it's pretty good I mean I'm not really
dropping<00:01:55.590> below<00:01:55.770> 30<00:01:56.219> which<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.000> definitely

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
dropping below 30 which is definitely

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.690
