00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
written that could be considered

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.360 
written that could be considered
slightly<00:01:00.390> slanderous<00:01:01.110> in<00:01:01.380> terms<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.860> new<00:01:02.130> way

slightly slanderous in terms of new way

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.910 
slightly slanderous in terms of new way
that<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.880> characters<00:01:03.300> portrayed<00:01:03.930> people<00:01:04.739> who

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
that the characters portrayed people who

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.620 
that the characters portrayed people who
actually<00:01:05.249> belong<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.119> publishing

getting more into the groove of writing
a<00:01:27.929> mystery<00:01:28.259> novel<00:01:28.619> I'm<00:01:28.829> not<00:01:28.979> sure<00:01:29.219> if<00:01:29.460> it's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
a mystery novel I'm not sure if it's

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.459

mystery in general for this one is a lot
more<00:02:09.720> interesting<00:02:10.140> than<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> first<00:02:10.590> one<00:02:10.769> was

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
more interesting than the first one was

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.210 
more interesting than the first one was
and<00:02:11.340> just<00:02:11.519> seeing<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.239> story<00:02:12.510> I'm<00:02:12.750> full

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
and just seeing the story I'm full

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.370 
and just seeing the story I'm full
I<00:02:13.280> was<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:14.060> lot<00:02:14.270> more<00:02:14.300> intrigued<00:02:14.870> by<00:02:15.050> what<00:02:15.290> was

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380

going<00:02:15.650> on<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:16.190> I<00:02:16.730> found<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.420> the<00:02:17.720> ending<00:02:18.230> was

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
going on and I found that the ending was

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.380 
going on and I found that the ending was
more<00:02:18.920> surprising<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.820> me<00:02:19.940> than<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.180> first

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
more surprising to me than the first

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.870 
more surprising to me than the first
book<00:02:20.540> was<00:02:20.780> when<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.470> mystery<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.460> solved<00:02:22.790> at

book was when the mystery is solved at
the<00:02:22.940> end<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.330> first<00:02:23.540> book<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:24.050> wasn't

the end of the first book I wasn't
necessarily<00:02:25.240> surprised<00:02:26.240> by<00:02:26.480> that<00:02:26.660> ending

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:26.960 
necessarily surprised by that ending

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.990 
necessarily surprised by that ending
like<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:27.140> didn't<00:02:27.470> necessarily<00:02:27.620> guess<00:02:28.160> who<00:02:28.430> was

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
like I didn't necessarily guess who was

is<00:03:02.510> a<00:03:02.540> much<00:03:02.810> stronger<00:03:03.200> mystery<00:03:03.740> novel<00:03:04.040> and<00:03:04.220> I

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
is a much stronger mystery novel and I

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.400 
is a much stronger mystery novel and I
can<00:03:04.459> definitely<00:03:04.670> see<00:03:05.150> development<00:03:06.050> and

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
can definitely see development and

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.590 
can definitely see development and
growth<00:03:06.620> in<00:03:07.040> rawlings<00:03:07.610> writing<00:03:08.030> in<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:08.360> book

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
growth in rawlings writing in this book

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.660 
growth in rawlings writing in this book
and<00:03:08.840> that's<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.830> really<00:03:10.100> interesting<00:03:10.130> thing<00:03:10.520> to

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
and that's a really interesting thing to

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.130 
and that's a really interesting thing to
say<00:03:10.940> especially<00:03:11.120> because<00:03:11.450> she<00:03:11.720> has<00:03:11.870> such<00:03:12.110> a

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
say especially because she has such a

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.590 
say especially because she has such a
popular<00:03:12.610> series<00:03:13.610> out<00:03:13.790> but<00:03:14.150> I<00:03:14.180> think<00:03:14.270> in<00:03:14.570> terms

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
popular series out but I think in terms

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.810 
popular series out but I think in terms
of<00:03:14.959> mysteries<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.590> can<00:03:15.709> see<00:03:16.010> her<00:03:16.490> growing

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
of mysteries you can see her growing

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.640 
of mysteries you can see her growing
quite<00:03:17.239> a<00:03:17.269> lot<00:03:17.570> with<00:03:17.780> this<00:03:17.989> book<00:03:18.260> is<00:03:18.290> this

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
quite a lot with this book is this

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.470 
quite a lot with this book is this
necessarily<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:19.310> best<00:03:19.459> mystery<00:03:20.060> novel<00:03:20.390> I've

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480

books<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.310> publishing<00:04:30.610> and<00:04:30.850> things<00:04:31.030> like

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
books and publishing and things like

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.560 
books and publishing and things like
that<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.660> don't<00:04:32.320> mind<00:04:32.590> that<00:04:32.950> side<00:04:33.400> of<00:04:33.790> the<00:04:34.360> world

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
that I don't mind that side of the world

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.480 
that I don't mind that side of the world
being<00:04:34.840> exposed<00:04:35.380> but<00:04:35.680> I<00:04:35.710> don't<00:04:35.950> know<00:04:36.070> if<00:04:36.250> this

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
being exposed but I don't know if this

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.879 
being exposed but I don't know if this
would<00:04:36.910> necessarily<00:04:37.090> be<00:04:37.600> appealing<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.560> people

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
would necessarily be appealing to people

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.800 
would necessarily be appealing to people
who<00:04:39.010> aren't<00:04:39.220> so<00:04:39.400> into<00:04:40.090> the<00:04:40.300> publishing<00:04:40.570> world

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
who aren't so into the publishing world

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.870 
who aren't so into the publishing world
I<00:04:41.080> can<00:04:41.200> very<00:04:41.470> easily<00:04:41.740> see<00:04:42.220> people<00:04:42.610> being<00:04:42.760> very

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
I can very easily see people being very

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.730 
I can very easily see people being very
confused<00:04:43.480> by<00:04:43.690> the<00:04:43.750> number<00:04:44.230> of<00:04:44.260> characters

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
confused by the number of characters

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.980 
confused by the number of characters
that<00:04:44.770> are<00:04:44.980> in<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.639> novel<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.510> considered

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
that are in the novel and considered

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.350 
that are in the novel and considered
suspects<00:04:47.560> because<00:04:47.680> they<00:04:48.040> just<00:04:48.520> have<00:04:48.700> various

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
suspects because they just have various

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.760 
suspects because they just have various
chaps<00:04:49.660> throughout<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:50.230> publishing<00:04:50.530> industry

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
chaps throughout the publishing industry

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.950 
chaps throughout the publishing industry
and<00:04:51.310> so<00:04:51.940> I<00:04:52.270> could<00:04:52.450> see<00:04:52.630> people<00:04:52.810> getting

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
and so I could see people getting

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.990 
and so I could see people getting
confused<00:04:53.800> by<00:04:54.040> all<00:04:54.340> of<00:04:54.520> these<00:04:54.639> different

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
confused by all of these different

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.700 
confused by all of these different
characters<00:04:55.389> and<00:04:55.419> so<00:04:55.990> that<00:04:56.139> is<00:04:56.320> definitely<00:04:56.470> the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
characters and so that is definitely the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.960 
characters and so that is definitely the
reason<00:04:57.040> why<00:04:57.130> I<00:04:57.160> didn't<00:04:57.400> quite<00:04:57.550> give<00:04:57.760> this<00:04:57.910> a

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
reason why I didn't quite give this a

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.210 
reason why I didn't quite give this a
four<00:04:58.270> star<00:04:58.570> rating<00:04:58.750> but<00:04:59.229> again<00:04:59.470> still<00:04:59.680> a<00:04:59.860> very

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
four star rating but again still a very

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.860 
four star rating but again still a very
positive<00:05:00.760> experience<00:05:01.270> and<00:05:01.450> definitely<00:05:01.660> a

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
positive experience and definitely a

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.510 
positive experience and definitely a
much<00:05:02.139> better<00:05:02.440> experience<00:05:03.010> than<00:05:03.070> I<00:05:03.160> had<00:05:03.400> with

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
much better experience than I had with

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.920 
much better experience than I had with
the<00:05:03.639> who's<00:05:03.940> calling<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.389> know<00:05:04.570> that<00:05:04.750> was

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
the who's calling you know that was

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.990 
the who's calling you know that was
relatively<00:05:05.590> positive<00:05:05.740> as<00:05:06.130> well<00:05:06.370> so<00:05:06.729> if<00:05:06.880> you

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
relatively positive as well so if you

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.400 
relatively positive as well so if you
like<00:05:07.210> mystery<00:05:07.540> novels<00:05:07.900> I<00:05:08.050> definitely

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
like mystery novels I definitely

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.290 
like mystery novels I definitely
recommend<00:05:08.830> this<00:05:08.919> book<00:05:09.220> if<00:05:09.880> you're<00:05:10.030> someone
