00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:07.919
 hello to you Artem in this video I 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.840
 tell you about one of the best 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.000
 third-party keyboard webstore under 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.070
 name flexi keyboard like you 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.450
 sure remember in with 8 appeared 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.960
 great opportunity to replace 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.189
 standard keyboard on iphone and ipad 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.080
 application developers are also former 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.150
 makers of cydia keyboard tweaks 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.250
 immediately rushed to write new programs 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.470
 after a certain period of time 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.080
 you can safely see what they have achieved 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.969
 webstar creators and what we can 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.710
 get from a third-party keyboard on 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.570
 currently flexi keyboard seems to me 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.030
 one of the best alternatives for 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.129
 standard buttons on your device when 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.170
 help of this application enthusiasts 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.969
 repeatedly installed all possible 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.129
 typing speed records 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.559
 let's see together what is good 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.059
 of vocabulary for 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.039
 So the first thing you can do application 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.079
 is to choose one of the preset 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.460
 themes authors suggest 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.079
 several options that may 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.020
 perfectly match the theme 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.059
 your device with the color of its case or 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.220
 just a cover there are several options 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.619
 design buttons that are purchased 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.060
 using built-in shopping creators 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.920
 constantly add new topics 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.200
 interface so bored us not 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.760
 have to see for example what it costs 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.890
 theme chameleon which changes color 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.200
 keyboard depending on the background 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.240
 applications the next advantage is flexi 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.040
 keyboard is built-in extensions 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.150
 just imagine that already 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.970
 keyboard began to acquire 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.500
 functional extensions for example you 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.450
 can add a keyboard with gif 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.270
 animations that are so popular today and 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.070
 quickly insert the smiley you want or 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.090
 the picture that will be displayed on 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.310
 onscreen keyboard 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.799
 another useful extension allows 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.270
 quickly switch the keyboard to more 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.579
 narrow option which is convenient for 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.890
 use on iphone 6 and 6 plus 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.840
 as you have already noticed the extension will be 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.640
 display top keyboard row 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.590
 if you have more installed 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.320
 extensions you can switch between 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.420
 two lateral svayp graphic 3 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.219
 extensions allow you to change the shade 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.350
 which will be displayed when you click 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.390
 on the keys for those who use flexi 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.120
 the first time it will be useful extension with 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.460
 hint 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.590
 well, at the end of the 3 most useful to my 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.810
 expansion look the first of them 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.490
 adds a digital number to the standard 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.800
 keyboard so you can quickly 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.560
 enter letters and numbers without switching 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.610
 between keyboards the second extension is 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.320
 Hotkeys 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.270
 with it, you can quickly enter 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:24.610
 either text or insert 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.260
 certain character each shortcut and its 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.900
 the icon can be configured in the parameters 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.790
 this extension and the third most useful 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.190
 keyboard padding allows 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.350
 quickly move the cursor with the wipe across 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.300
 space after installing this add-on 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.370
 to move the cursor through the text 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.590
 you need to hold your finger on the keys 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.660
 space then move it to the right 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.270
 or left the cursor will be 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.740
 move in the appropriate direction 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.990
 as you can see this keyboard is not only 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.390
 replaces the standard buttons in with but 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.760
 contains several workings shown 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.370
 us in fikah from sitting separate section 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.920
 application settings allows you to change 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.690
 keyboard size as well as display or 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.090
 hide the bottom panel with a space and 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.620
 additional keys by the way the bottom 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.660
 panel you can hide at any time 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.090
 deal in svayp two fingers down a 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.220
 making a reverse gesture up you her 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.810
 display and again however hide 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.150
 bottom panel with a space I don’t 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.220
 I recommend first we lose 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.959
 the ability to move the cursor to the right 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.209
 or left with one of 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.770
 additions and secondly we will not be able 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.050
 quickly switch languages ​​in this 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.940
 keyboard to change language 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.770
 need to make a short swipe 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.950
 right or left by the same key 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.510
 gap in flexi keyboard sidebar you 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.760
 can log in to the cloud 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.040
 storage this function is necessary for 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.650
 quick exchange of application parameters 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.330
 on different devices and special section 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.850
 dictionary you can make words 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.040
 exceptions or abbreviations to 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.230
 so that the program does not fix them 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.610
 section with peculiar achievements in 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.560
 which the authors of the program will be 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.930
 encourage us to use this 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.430
 keyboard of course there are language 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.480
 parameters in which we should 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.390
 add or delete 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.769
 necessary and unnecessary languages ​​for us as you can see 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.610
 flexi already supports great 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.620
 the number of the most common languages 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.180
 in the block with parameters are 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.630
 standard for this kind of applications 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.770
 options you can enable or disable 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.690
 automatic capitalization 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.940
 letters at the beginning of a paragraph or new 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.549
 applications can also include or 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.320
 disable quick delete 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.720
 auto correct sounds when 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.850
 keystrokes as well as sounds when 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.560
 deleting words a special option may 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.120
 enable voice duplication 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.710
 words or characters entered 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.780
 special switch allows 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.510
 activate side keys about which i 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.160
 I'll tell you later, but in the section magic loaf 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.050
 you can select the destination for the button 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.330
 which will be displayed to the left of 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.700
 spaces on it can be hung quickly and 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.400
 space entry switching 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.630
 smiley keyboard hiding 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.820
 virtual keyboard 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.620
 enable or disable automatic 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.570
 corrections as well as the possibility 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.240
 switch between other keyboards 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.770
 You can also change the order of these options. 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.960
 they will all be available on hold 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.310
 keys 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.620
 adapt to work flexi keyboard 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.690
 rather simply stubbornly placed on 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.120
 automatic correction and control 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:10.620
 Swipe all inaccuracies derived 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.870
 In words, the program will correct 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.060
 automatic but for quick transition 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.430
 you can use side gestures 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.560
 right or left so swipe left erases 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.320
 last entered word swipe right 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.360

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.860
 substitution options relevant 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.830
 words for replacement and substitution will be 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.360
 appear right on the keyboard itself 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.280
 finally worth mentioning the side 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.070
 the keys that are included in the parameters 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.740
 they will be visible when working in landscape 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.010
 mode to the disadvantages of flexi include 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.510
 Is that the lack of input with wipe 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:52.110
