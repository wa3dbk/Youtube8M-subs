00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
for other projects as well I ran out of

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.880 
for other projects as well I ran out of
steel<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.840> had<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> use<00:00:46.110> some<00:00:46.140> half<00:00:46.680> inch

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
steel so I had to use some half inch

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.990 
steel so I had to use some half inch
conduit<00:00:47.309> that<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.180> had<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.600> stock<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.590> my<00:00:49.649> garage

conduit that I had in stock in my garage

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.830 
conduit that I had in stock in my garage
for<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.180> hitch

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
for the hitch

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.279 
for the hitch
now<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> actual<00:00:53.190> hitch<00:00:53.989> interface<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
now the actual hitch interface to the

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.229 
now the actual hitch interface to the
bicycle<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.980> nothing<00:00:56.550> more<00:00:56.670> than<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.879> couple<00:00:57.090> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
bicycle is nothing more than a couple of

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.959 
bicycle is nothing more than a couple of
caster<00:00:57.629> wheels<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.500> we've<00:00:58.850> bolted<00:00:59.850> together

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
caster wheels that we've bolted together

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.350 
caster wheels that we've bolted together
and<00:01:00.420> well<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> welded<00:01:01.980> one<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:05.060> knurled<00:01:06.060> nut

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
and well I welded one of the knurled nut

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.330 
and well I welded one of the knurled nut
to<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.650> can<00:01:07.740> go<00:01:07.830> underneath<00:01:08.100> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
to it so it can go underneath the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.789 
to it so it can go underneath the
quick-release<00:01:08.810> right<00:01:09.810> here<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.740> to

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
quick-release right here all I have to

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.100 
quick-release right here all I have to
do<00:01:10.920> is<00:01:11.010> take<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> quick-release<00:01:11.490> off<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.360> put

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
do is take the quick-release off and put

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.020 
do is take the quick-release off and put
it<00:01:13.200> underneath<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.710> put<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:13.979> back<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.520> put

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it underneath it put it back on and put

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.580 
it underneath it put it back on and put
it<00:01:15.119> back<00:01:15.210> together<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.600> because<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.200> neural

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it back together and because it's neural

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.920 
it back together and because it's neural
input<00:01:16.830> slip<00:01:17.340> while<00:01:17.520> you're<00:01:17.640> riding<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.119> Gary's

going to go around and show us the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.749 
going to go around and show us the
demonstration<00:01:21.560> how<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.740> turns<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.369> follows

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
demonstration how it turns and follows

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.380 
demonstration how it turns and follows
the<00:01:23.880> bicycle<00:01:25.280> now<00:01:26.280> you'll<00:01:26.430> notice<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the bicycle now you'll notice it is a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.210 
the bicycle now you'll notice it is a
little<00:01:27.540> bit<00:01:27.869> offset<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.350> left<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.890> did<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
little bit offset to the left I did that

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.929 
little bit offset to the left I did that
on<00:01:29.250> purpose

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
on purpose

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.969 
on purpose
so<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.329> when<00:01:30.780> Derrick<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.229> riding<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.740> we're

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
so that when Derrick is riding and we're

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.060 
so that when Derrick is riding and we're
in<00:01:32.070> anybody's<00:01:32.610> riding<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.689> bike<00:01:34.590> sticks<00:01:34.920> out

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
in anybody's riding the bike sticks out

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.620 
in anybody's riding the bike sticks out
or<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> trailer<00:01:35.790> sticks<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.299> little<00:01:36.360> more

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
or the trailer sticks out a little more

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.210 
or the trailer sticks out a little more
so<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.259> traffic<00:01:37.650> will<00:01:37.770> be<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.920> little<00:01:38.070> more

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
so that traffic will be a little more

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.100 
so that traffic will be a little more
afraid<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.210> hopefully<00:01:39.450> give<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
afraid of it and hopefully give the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.590 
afraid of it and hopefully give the
rider<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.380> wider<00:01:40.619> berth<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.150> passes<00:01:42.509> our

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
rider a wider berth and a passes our

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.280 
blue suburban and he's going to take a
left<00:01:45.570> turn<00:01:45.780> here<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.290> come<00:01:46.829> back<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.189> me<00:01:48.290> and

left turn here and come back to me and
you<00:01:49.350> can<00:01:49.530> see<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> trailer<00:01:50.399> follows

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
you can see that the trailer follows

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.870 
you can see that the trailer follows
with<00:01:51.030> absolutely<00:01:51.509> no<00:01:51.659> problem<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.880> although

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
with absolutely no problem and although

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.270 
with absolutely no problem and although
the<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.869> turning<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> right<00:01:55.740> is<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> little

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the the turning to the right is a little

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.300 
the the turning to the right is a little
bit<00:01:56.460> limited<00:01:57.290> it's<00:01:58.290> by<00:01:58.439> no<00:01:58.469> means<00:01:58.649> hindered

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
bit limited it's by no means hindered

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.080 
bit limited it's by no means hindered
and<00:01:59.689> it<00:02:00.689> does<00:02:01.619> as<00:02:01.770> good<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:02.159> any<00:02:02.520> trailer<00:02:02.909> can

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and it does as good as any trailer can

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.740 
and it does as good as any trailer can
possibly<00:02:03.390> do

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
possibly do

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.750 
possibly do
here<00:02:04.960> it<00:02:05.050> goes<00:02:05.170> for<00:02:05.350> another<00:02:05.470> turn<00:02:05.800> again<00:02:06.670> you

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
here it goes for another turn again you

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.370 
here it goes for another turn again you
see<00:02:06.910> the<00:02:07.000> trailer<00:02:07.270> has<00:02:07.390> obviously<00:02:07.630> no<00:02:07.840> problem

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
much to build on top of it we'll be

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.400 
much to build on top of it we'll be
going<00:02:22.260> pressboard
