next<00:00:13.559> to<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.799> previous<00:00:14.429> one<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:16.490> I'll<00:00:17.490> quickly

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
next to a previous one so I'll quickly

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:30.390 
next to a previous one so I'll quickly
make<00:00:18.090> her<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.449> not<00:00:20.810> ready<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:22.050> move<00:00:22.170> up

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.370 

this<00:00:30.970> is<00:00:31.119> showing<00:00:31.359> you<00:00:31.539> how<00:00:31.689> to<00:00:31.720> make<00:00:31.990> a<00:00:32.020> button

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
this is showing you how to make a button

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.790 
this is showing you how to make a button
not<00:00:32.529> in<00:00:32.710> real<00:00:32.890> time<00:00:33.309> not<00:00:33.880> not<00:00:34.239> a<00:00:34.270> slow<00:00:34.690> one<00:00:34.900> make

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
not in real time not not a slow one make

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.350 
not in real time not not a slow one make
sure<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:36.100> knot<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:36.670> tilted<00:00:37.090> to<00:00:37.239> the<00:00:37.270> right

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
sure the knot is tilted to the right

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.630 
sure the knot is tilted to the right
before<00:00:37.809> you<00:00:38.140> tighten<00:00:38.620> it

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.700 

you<00:00:43.180> can<00:00:43.390> see<00:00:43.570> the<00:00:43.690> loops<00:00:43.930> around<00:00:44.290> the<00:00:44.410> large

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
you can see the loops around the large

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.810 
you can see the loops around the large
so<00:00:45.160> they<00:00:45.340> have<00:00:45.520> to<00:00:45.700> be<00:00:45.850> pulled<00:00:46.660> through<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
so they have to be pulled through to

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.610 
so they have to be pulled through to
smooth<00:00:49.030> out<00:00:49.239> or<00:00:49.450> not

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
smooth out or not

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.590 
smooth out or not
it's<00:00:52.220> a<00:00:52.340> good<00:00:52.490> opportunity<00:00:52.760> while<00:00:53.450> you're

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
it's a good opportunity while you're

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.290 
it's a good opportunity while you're
pulling<00:00:53.840> through<00:00:54.200> the<00:00:54.230> court<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:55.670> untwist<00:00:55.970> it

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
pulling through the court to untwist it

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.340 
pulling through the court to untwist it
at<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:56.510> same<00:00:56.720> time<00:00:56.780> to<00:00:57.590> make<00:00:57.740> not<00:00:57.980> smooth

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.200 

and<00:01:02.890> we<00:01:03.040> want<00:01:03.220> to<00:01:03.280> move<00:01:03.490> it<00:01:03.670> next<00:01:03.850> to<00:01:04.120> the

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
and we want to move it next to the

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.000 
and we want to move it next to the
previous<00:01:04.449> note<00:01:07.230> so<00:01:08.230> we<00:01:08.260> want<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.650> get<00:01:08.770> rid<00:01:08.950> of

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
previous note so we want to get rid of

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.170 
previous note so we want to get rid of
this<00:01:09.250> lot<00:01:09.910> of<00:01:10.030> discord<00:01:10.840> in<00:01:11.260> between<00:01:11.940> give<00:01:12.940> it<00:01:13.060> a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
this lot of discord in between give it a

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
this lot of discord in between give it a
tweak<00:01:13.980> see<00:01:14.980> where<00:01:15.160> it<00:01:15.280> goes<00:01:15.490> in<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.910> knot<00:01:16.200> once

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
tweak see where it goes in the knot once

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.160 
tweak see where it goes in the knot once
you've<00:01:17.380> her<00:01:17.530> painted<00:01:17.980> it<00:01:18.810> pull<00:01:19.810> all<00:01:19.960> this

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
you've her painted it pull all this

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.660 
you've her painted it pull all this
excess<00:01:20.620> cord<00:01:21.010> through<00:01:23.010> now<00:01:24.010> you<00:01:24.070> have<00:01:24.310> a<00:01:24.340> large

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
excess cord through now you have a large

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.390 
excess cord through now you have a large
loop<00:01:25.060> turn<00:01:25.540> it<00:01:25.660> over<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.260> pull<00:01:26.979> this<00:01:27.160> loop

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:27.400 
loop turn it over and pull this loop

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.920 
loop turn it over and pull this loop
through

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.960 

you<00:01:32.470> see<00:01:32.680> how<00:01:32.890> I'm<00:01:33.010> on<00:01:33.130> twisting<00:01:33.640> it<00:01:33.760> at<00:01:33.880> the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
you see how I'm on twisting it at the

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:44.060 
you see how I'm on twisting it at the
same<00:01:34.180> time

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.010 

this<00:01:44.610> loop<00:01:44.850> has<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.120> be<00:01:45.270> pulled<00:01:45.600> through<00:01:45.720> eight

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
this loop has to be pulled through eight

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.230 
this loop has to be pulled through eight
times<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.710> there<00:01:46.920> are<00:01:47.130> eight<00:01:47.280> segments<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.150> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
times as there are eight segments to the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.280 
times as there are eight segments to the
button<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> mountain

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.470 

you<00:01:56.830> notice<00:01:57.190> I'm<00:01:57.370> always<00:01:57.580> turning<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.300> not

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
you notice I'm always turning the not

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.300 
you notice I'm always turning the not
away<00:01:58.840> from<00:01:59.170> me<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.560> pulling<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.040> cord

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
away from me and pulling the cord

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.810 
away from me and pulling the cord
towards<00:02:01.150> me<00:02:01.590> it's<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.740> routine<00:02:03.160> that's<00:02:03.460> worth

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
towards me it's a routine that's worth

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.390 
towards me it's a routine that's worth
learning<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:04.660> that<00:02:04.690> you<00:02:04.960> don't<00:02:05.200> pull<00:02:05.740> the<00:02:05.890> cord

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
learning so that you don't pull the cord

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.840 
learning so that you don't pull the cord
backwards<00:02:07.030> and<00:02:07.180> forwards<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:08.369> keep<00:02:09.369> doing<00:02:09.640> the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
backwards and forwards to keep doing the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.089 
backwards and forwards to keep doing the
same<00:02:09.880> direction<00:02:10.479> this<00:02:10.899> way

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.399 

it's<00:02:15.640> not<00:02:15.849> quite<00:02:16.030> as<00:02:16.329> close<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:16.959> previous

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
it's not quite as close to the previous

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:19.440 
it's not quite as close to the previous
note<00:02:17.650> as<00:02:17.799> I<00:02:17.950> would<00:02:18.129> like<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:19.060> has<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.420> be

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
note as I would like so this has to be

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.790 
note as I would like so this has to be
repeated

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.920 

this<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.550> quite<00:02:23.820> normal<00:02:24.450> it's<00:02:24.630> quite

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
this is quite normal it's quite

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.070 
this is quite normal it's quite
difficult<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.500> make<00:02:25.800> them<00:02:25.980> not<00:02:26.130> very<00:02:26.810> close<00:02:27.810> to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
difficult to make them not very close to

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:42.430 
difficult to make them not very close to
the<00:02:28.200> first<00:02:28.440> one

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.470 

once<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.130> get<00:02:43.280> used<00:02:43.460> to<00:02:43.670> making<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:44.150> knot<00:02:44.300> you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
once you get used to making the knot you

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.839 
once you get used to making the knot you
can<00:02:44.660> do<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:44.930> quite<00:02:45.140> quickly

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:49.849 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.899 

we<00:02:50.390> are<00:02:50.659> that's<00:02:50.870> finished<00:02:51.349> each<00:02:52.310> side<00:02:52.700> is

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
we are that's finished each side is

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.479 
we are that's finished each side is
equal<00:02:53.329> and<00:02:53.629> the<00:02:53.810> next<00:02:54.109> step<00:02:54.349> now<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.950> do<00:02:55.459> a

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
equal and the next step now is to do a

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.179 
equal and the next step now is to do a
sliding<00:02:55.999> but<00:02:56.180> not<00:02:56.540> or<00:02:57.109> to<00:02:57.469> sliding<00:02:57.980> back

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
sliding but not or to sliding back

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.599 
sliding but not or to sliding back
minutes<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.730> finish<00:02:58.909> the<00:02:59.180> necklace
