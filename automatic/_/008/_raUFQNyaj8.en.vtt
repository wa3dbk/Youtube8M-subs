exciting<00:02:01.530> for<00:02:01.920> me<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.640> now<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.479> was<00:02:03.630> time<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:04.320> had

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
exciting for me so now it was time I had

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.770 
exciting for me so now it was time I had
tested<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.009> waters<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.460> had<00:02:05.610> seen<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.299> there

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
tested the waters I had seen that there

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.660 
tested the waters I had seen that there
was<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> product<00:02:07.469> people<00:02:07.619> were<00:02:07.890> interested<00:02:08.069> I

was a product people were interested I

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.760 
was a product people were interested I
was<00:02:09.000> getting<00:02:09.300> great<00:02:09.509> feedback<00:02:09.539> but<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> needed

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
was getting great feedback but I needed

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.450 
was getting great feedback but I needed
to<00:02:10.860> actually<00:02:11.009> make

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
to actually make

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.610 
to actually make
money<00:02:11.610> at<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.540> went<00:02:12.930> ahead<00:02:13.020> raised<00:02:13.440> my

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
money at it so I went ahead raised my

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.400 
money at it so I went ahead raised my
prices<00:02:13.860> and<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.670> brought<00:02:14.910> them<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.750> four

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
prices and I brought them up to four

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.160 
prices and I brought them up to four
hundred<00:02:16.590> dollars<00:02:16.800> on<00:02:17.690> 200<00:02:18.690> for<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.810> session

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
hundred dollars on 200 for the session

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.540 
hundred dollars on 200 for the session
and<00:02:19.350> 200<00:02:19.830> for<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.100> disc<00:02:21.110> this<00:02:22.110> happened

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
and 200 for the disc this happened

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.310 
and 200 for the disc this happened
probably<00:02:23.550> within<00:02:23.730> four<00:02:24.180> months<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.690> changing

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
probably within four months of changing

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.230 
probably within four months of changing
of<00:02:25.740> starting<00:02:26.190> my<00:02:26.280> pricing<00:02:26.700> at<00:02:26.820> the<00:02:27.060> one

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
of starting my pricing at the one

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.710 
of starting my pricing at the one
hundred<00:02:27.570> dollar<00:02:27.720> range<00:02:28.580> I'm<00:02:29.580> sad<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.270> say<00:02:30.300> that

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
hundred dollar range I'm sad to say that

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.190 
hundred dollar range I'm sad to say that
I<00:02:30.870> didn't<00:02:31.170> actually<00:02:31.340> calculate<00:02:32.750> why<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:33.780> wanted

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
I didn't actually calculate why I wanted

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.590 
I didn't actually calculate why I wanted
to<00:02:34.290> charge<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:35.010> honestly<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.940> picked

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
to charge this I honestly just picked

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.320 
to charge this I honestly just picked
these<00:02:36.750> numbers<00:02:37.170> because<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:38.400> photographer<00:02:39.300> I

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
these numbers because a photographer I

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.650 
these numbers because a photographer I
knew<00:02:39.690> who<00:02:40.110> had<00:02:40.380> since<00:02:40.680> moved<00:02:40.890> out<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.340> my<00:02:42.330> state

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
knew who had since moved out of my state

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.070 
knew who had since moved out of my state
that's<00:02:43.320> what<00:02:43.470> she<00:02:43.500> had<00:02:43.770> charged<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.670> I<00:02:45.090> used

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
that's what she had charged and I used

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.600 
that's what she had charged and I used
to<00:02:46.260> kind<00:02:46.380> of<00:02:46.530> bounce<00:02:46.680> ideas<00:02:46.890> off<00:02:47.250> her<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.580> I

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
to kind of bounce ideas off her and I

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.650 
to kind of bounce ideas off her and I
thought<00:02:47.760> well<00:02:47.910> if<00:02:48.060> that's<00:02:48.240> what<00:02:48.360> she<00:02:48.510> did

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
thought well if that's what she did

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.870 
thought well if that's what she did
that's<00:02:48.840> what<00:02:48.960> I'll<00:02:49.080> do<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.560> and<00:02:50.430> I<00:02:50.490> just<00:02:50.670> kind

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
that's what I'll do and and I just kind

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.720 
that's what I'll do and and I just kind
of<00:02:50.910> went<00:02:51.030> with<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:52.650> real<00:02:52.920> problem<00:02:52.950> with

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
of went with it the real problem with

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.500 
of went with it the real problem with
not<00:02:54.180> um<00:02:55.160> planning<00:02:56.160> your<00:02:56.190> pricing<00:02:56.730> properly<00:02:57.300> is

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
not um planning your pricing properly is

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.660 
not um planning your pricing properly is
that<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.770> don't<00:02:58.890> know<00:02:59.040> why<00:02:59.190> they<00:02:59.370> came<00:02:59.520> up

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
that you don't know why they came up

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.130 
that you don't know why they came up
with<00:02:59.790> their<00:02:59.880> numbers<00:03:00.210> and<00:03:00.390> maybe<00:03:00.780> they<00:03:01.020> don't

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
with their numbers and maybe they don't

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.180 
with their numbers and maybe they don't
even<00:03:01.410> know<00:03:01.500> why<00:03:01.620> they<00:03:01.770> came<00:03:01.890> up<00:03:01.950> with<00:03:02.070> our

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
even know why they came up with our

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.500 
even know why they came up with our
numbers<00:03:02.460> so<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:02.640> have<00:03:02.880> no<00:03:03.030> idea<00:03:03.210> if<00:03:03.420> that's

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
numbers so you have no idea if that's

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.470 
numbers so you have no idea if that's
going<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.780> make<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.050> profitable<00:03:04.560> so<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.760> did

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
going to make you profitable so I did

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.170 
going to make you profitable so I did
things<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.750> wrong<00:03:06.960> way<00:03:07.020> and<00:03:07.820> pick<00:03:08.820> numbers

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
things the wrong way and pick numbers

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.390 
things the wrong way and pick numbers
out<00:03:09.300> of<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.480> sky<00:03:09.720> charged<00:03:10.410> those<00:03:10.770> numbers<00:03:11.220> and

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
out of the sky charged those numbers and

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.440 
out of the sky charged those numbers and
I<00:03:12.950> just<00:03:13.950> realized<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.580> that's<00:03:14.850> just<00:03:15.150> not
