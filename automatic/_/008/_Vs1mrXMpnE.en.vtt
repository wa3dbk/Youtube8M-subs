reason<00:01:37.200> why<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.320> don't<00:01:37.439> like<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.740> question<00:01:37.890> is

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
reason why I don't like this question is

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.760 
reason why I don't like this question is
because<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:39.329> course<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.290> course<00:01:40.350> you'd<00:01:40.680> be

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
because of course of course you'd be

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.260 
because of course of course you'd be
able<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.070> fluid<00:01:41.400> he's<00:01:41.610> never<00:01:41.939> done<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
able to be fluid he's never done a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.580 
able to be fluid he's never done a
sprawl<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.630> his<00:01:42.720> life<00:01:42.899> he<00:01:43.079> doesn't<00:01:43.170> even<00:01:43.409> know

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
sprawl in his life he doesn't even know

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770 
sprawl in his life he doesn't even know
what<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.770> full<00:01:43.979> guard<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:44.939> that's<00:01:45.630> like

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
what a full guard is so that's like

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.450 
what a full guard is so that's like
saying<00:01:45.990> that's<00:01:46.290> like<00:01:46.350> Michael<00:01:47.100> Jordan

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
saying that's like Michael Jordan

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.370

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
calling out Wayne Gretzky and saying I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.719 
calling out Wayne Gretzky and saying I
would<00:01:49.619> beat<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> basketball<00:01:50.430> match<00:01:50.549> of

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
would beat you in a basketball match of

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.249 
would beat you in a basketball match of
course<00:01:51.030> because<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.509> train<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.869> you've

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
course because you train that you've

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.389 
course because you train that you've
been<00:01:52.350> training<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.710> your<00:01:52.829> whole<00:01:52.950> life<00:01:53.159> maybe

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
been training that your whole life maybe

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.760 
been training that your whole life maybe
you<00:01:54.030> know<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:54.299> Floyd<00:01:54.540> decided<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.380> do<00:01:55.500> mixed

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
you know if Floyd decided to do mixed

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.109 
you know if Floyd decided to do mixed
martial<00:01:56.100> arts<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.399> grappling<00:01:56.700> instead<00:01:57.030> of

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
martial arts and grappling instead of

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.969 
martial arts and grappling instead of
boxing<00:01:57.479> then<00:01:57.600> maybe<00:01:57.750> he<00:01:57.930> would<00:01:57.960> be<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.500> good<00:01:58.860> as

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
boxing then maybe he would be as good as
