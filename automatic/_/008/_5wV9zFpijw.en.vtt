they have cabbage they have a radish
chili<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.319> I<00:02:30.380> think<00:02:30.650> it's<00:02:30.769> just<00:02:30.980> flat<00:02:31.370> with

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
chili and I think it's just flat with

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.820 
chili and I think it's just flat with
some<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:32.599> think<00:02:32.840> it's<00:02:32.959> peppercorn<00:02:33.410> so<00:02:33.560> when<00:02:33.709> we

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
some I think it's peppercorn so when we

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.710 
some I think it's peppercorn so when we
were<00:02:33.950> in<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.130> back<00:02:34.310> we<00:02:34.489> saw<00:02:34.700> how<00:02:34.910> I<00:02:35.299> mean<00:02:35.599> they

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
were in the back we saw how I mean they

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.990 
were in the back we saw how I mean they
just<00:02:35.750> blanch<00:02:36.170> these<00:02:36.799> items<00:02:37.220> that's<00:02:37.760> where<00:02:37.910> the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
just blanch these items that's where the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.270 
just blanch these items that's where the
name<00:02:38.150> came<00:02:38.329> quick<00:02:38.840> they<00:02:39.320> call<00:02:39.560> that<00:02:39.769> explosion

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
name came quick they call that explosion

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.030 
name came quick they call that explosion
oh<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.959> then<00:02:42.079> we<00:02:42.170> have<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.380> sauce<00:02:42.590> that<00:02:42.829> I

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
oh and then we have the sauce that I

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.750 
oh and then we have the sauce that I
guess<00:02:43.400> where<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:45.440> sauce<00:02:45.739> that<00:02:45.980> lends<00:02:46.400> it

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
guess where it's the sauce that lends it

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.000 
guess where it's the sauce that lends it
the<00:02:47.299> completes<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.870> deal<00:02:48.109> on<00:02:48.320> its<00:02:48.530> own<00:02:48.769> I
