00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.900 
very well I haven't had any issues
whatsoever<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.440> does<00:03:30.650> have<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.130> hotspot<00:03:31.640> hack

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
whatsoever it does have the hotspot hack

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.750 
whatsoever it does have the hotspot hack
so<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:32.810> can<00:03:33.470> use<00:03:33.739> the<00:03:33.980> stock<00:03:34.250> hotspot

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
so you can use the stock hotspot

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.849 
so you can use the stock hotspot
application<00:03:35.510> if<00:03:35.810> I<00:03:35.930> can<00:03:36.109> find<00:03:36.319> it<00:03:36.560> i<00:03:36.680> don't

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
application if I can find it i don't

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.490 
application if I can find it i don't
know<00:03:36.920> why<00:03:37.100> i'm<00:03:37.250> not<00:03:37.310> seeing<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:38.290> it<00:03:39.290> should<00:03:39.470> be

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
know why i'm not seeing it it should be

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.750 
know why i'm not seeing it it should be

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
nice if that is working it he reduced

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.490 
nice if that is working it he reduced
the<00:03:50.299> auto<00:03:50.480> brightness<00:03:50.720> range<00:03:51.139> for<00:03:51.350> better

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
the auto brightness range for better

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.050 
the auto brightness range for better
battery<00:03:51.859> life<00:03:51.920> which<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:52.250> great<00:03:52.579> especially

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.770 
animation is there but you'll remember
on<00:05:04.310> gingerbread<00:05:04.700> base<00:05:05.000> ramsey<00:05:05.390> it<00:05:05.450> was<00:05:05.570> kind

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
on gingerbread base ramsey it was kind

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.150 
on gingerbread base ramsey it was kind
of<00:05:05.810> goofy<00:05:06.230> would<00:05:06.530> make<00:05:06.740> some<00:05:06.950> weird

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
of goofy would make some weird

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.490 
of goofy would make some weird
animations<00:05:07.730> but<00:05:07.880> on<00:05:08.150> but<00:05:08.810> now<00:05:08.930> with<00:05:08.990> ice<00:05:09.290> cream

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500

animations but on but now with ice cream
sandwich<00:05:09.830> it<00:05:09.950> seems<00:05:10.220> like<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.460> modification

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
sandwich it seems like the modification

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.940 
sandwich it seems like the modification
can<00:05:11.210> be<00:05:11.330> made<00:05:11.510> where<00:05:11.750> it<00:05:11.810> looks<00:05:11.990> fluent<00:05:12.740> and

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
can be made where it looks fluent and

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.180 
can be made where it looks fluent and
very<00:05:13.880> nice<00:05:14.180> so<00:05:14.540> you'll<00:05:15.110> see<00:05:15.320> CRT<00:05:15.800> screen<00:05:16.040> off

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
very nice so you'll see CRT screen off

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.940 
very nice so you'll see CRT screen off
animation<00:05:16.760> is<00:05:16.970> actually<00:05:17.420> very<00:05:17.450> nice<00:05:17.950> which

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:18.950

life I mean overall very smooth
definitely<00:06:06.890> around<00:06:07.070> you're<00:06:07.190> going<00:06:07.310> to<00:06:07.370> want

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
definitely around you're going to want

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.520 
definitely around you're going to want
to<00:06:07.520> check<00:06:07.730> out<00:06:07.910> hopefully<00:06:08.810> and<00:06:09.290> it<00:06:09.350> does<00:06:09.500> a

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
to check out hopefully and it does a

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:11.530 
to check out hopefully and it does a
clockwork<00:06:09.950> mod<00:06:10.100> I<00:06:10.310> don't<00:06:10.790> believe<00:06:11.300> there's

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.540 
clockwork mod I don't believe there's

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.659 
clockwork mod I don't believe there's
any<00:06:11.690> issues<00:06:11.990> with<00:06:12.140> flashing<00:06:12.560> a<00:06:12.650> theme<00:06:12.950> just

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:13.669 
any issues with flashing a theme just

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:14.860 
any issues with flashing a theme just
don't<00:06:13.790> flash<00:06:14.030> any<00:06:14.210> rounds<00:06:14.570> with<00:06:14.690> the

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
don't flash any rounds with the

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.230 
don't flash any rounds with the
integrated<00:06:15.700> clockworkmod<00:06:16.700> for<00:06:16.940> now<00:06:17.060> I

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
integrated clockworkmod for now I

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.730 
integrated clockworkmod for now I
believe<00:06:17.930> it<00:06:18.140> should<00:06:18.169> get<00:06:18.350> better<00:06:18.470> once

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
believe it should get better once

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:20.890 
believe it should get better once

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.970 
for battery tweaks I believe once it
hits<00:06:44.540> eighty-four<00:06:45.080> percent<00:06:45.230> it<00:06:45.620> goes<00:06:45.740> down<00:06:45.920> to

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
hits eighty-four percent it goes down to

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.160 
hits eighty-four percent it goes down to
clock<00:06:46.790> speed<00:06:47.030> at<00:06:47.120> 1<00:06:47.270> gigahertz<00:06:47.600> and<00:06:47.900> then<00:06:47.990> once

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.170 
clock speed at 1 gigahertz and then once

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.720 
clock speed at 1 gigahertz and then once
it's<00:06:48.350> at<00:06:48.470> thirty-five<00:06:49.040> percent<00:06:49.220> it<00:06:49.460> goes<00:06:49.580> down

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:49.730 
it's at thirty-five percent it goes down

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.670 
it's at thirty-five percent it goes down
to<00:06:49.790> 800<00:06:50.030> megahertz<00:06:50.510> which<00:06:50.900> doesn't<00:06:51.530> really

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 
to 800 megahertz which doesn't really

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.010 
to 800 megahertz which doesn't really
hinder<00:06:52.310> the<00:06:52.580> speed<00:06:52.880> very<00:06:53.180> much<00:06:53.390> it<00:06:53.630> although

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
hinder the speed very much it although

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.020 
hinder the speed very much it although
it<00:06:54.140> does<00:06:54.320> increase<00:06:54.830> battery<00:06:55.100> life<00:06:55.280> a<00:06:55.490> lot<00:06:55.730> so

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.030 
it does increase battery life a lot so

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.460 
it does increase battery life a lot so
which<00:06:56.180> I<00:06:56.300> like<00:06:56.540> a<00:06:56.570> lot<00:06:56.690> because<00:06:57.080> when<00:06:57.230> I'm<00:06:57.320> down

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:57.470 
which I like a lot because when I'm down

00:06:57.470 --> 00:06:58.570 
which I like a lot because when I'm down
to<00:06:57.620> thirty<00:06:57.830> five<00:06:58.010> percent<00:06:58.040> I'm<00:06:58.400> definitely

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580 
to thirty five percent I'm definitely

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.920 
to thirty five percent I'm definitely
gonna<00:06:58.820> want<00:06:58.940> to<00:06:59.060> try<00:06:59.210> and<00:06:59.330> save<00:06:59.540> battery<00:06:59.870> as

00:06:59.920 --> 00:06:59.930 
gonna want to try and save battery as

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.380 
gonna want to try and save battery as
much<00:07:00.080> as<00:07:00.230> I<00:07:00.290> can<00:07:00.350> and<00:07:00.830> underclocking<00:07:01.760> helps<00:07:02.240> a

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:02.390 
much as I can and underclocking helps a

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.570 
much as I can and underclocking helps a
lot<00:07:02.690> to<00:07:03.080> help<00:07:03.200> save<00:07:03.440> battery<00:07:03.800> so<00:07:04.070> that's

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
lot to help save battery so that's

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.380 
lot to help save battery so that's
really<00:07:05.000> nice<00:07:05.180> other<00:07:06.080> things<00:07:06.410> of<00:07:06.800> course<00:07:07.390> your
