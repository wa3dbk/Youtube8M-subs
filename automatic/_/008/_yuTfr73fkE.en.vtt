today's video I'm going to show you how
to<00:00:06.839> convert<00:00:07.230> your<00:00:07.680> USB<00:00:08.010> flash<00:00:08.189> drive<00:00:08.880> from<00:00:09.719> the

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
to convert your USB flash drive from the

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.670 
to convert your USB flash drive from the
fat32<00:00:10.769> file<00:00:11.460> system<00:00:11.809> to<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:13.280> NTFS<00:00:14.280> file<00:00:14.940> system

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
fat32 file system to a NTFS file system

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.830 
fat32 file system to a NTFS file system
now<00:00:16.680> if<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.100> ever<00:00:17.310> tried<00:00:17.760> copying<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.539> file

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
now if you ever tried copying a file

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.460 
now if you ever tried copying a file
larger<00:00:19.380> than<00:00:19.560> four<00:00:19.920> gigabytes<00:00:21.050> to<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> USB

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
larger than four gigabytes to a USB

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.050 
larger than four gigabytes to a USB
flash<00:00:23.010> drive<00:00:23.430> in<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.449> fat32<00:00:25.260> format<00:00:26.039> such<00:00:26.910> as

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
flash drive in the fat32 format such as

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.810 
flash drive in the fat32 format such as
a<00:00:27.090> movie<00:00:27.449> file<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.650> know<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.099> you<00:00:29.310> get<00:00:29.550> an

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
a movie file you know that you get an

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.069 
a movie file you know that you get an
error<00:00:30.060> message<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.619> not<00:00:31.949> possible

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
error message and that it's not possible

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.080 
error message and that it's not possible
so<00:00:34.079> if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.290> want<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.530> transfer<00:00:35.010> files<00:00:35.309> larger

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
so if you want to transfer files larger

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.560 
so if you want to transfer files larger
than<00:00:36.540> four<00:00:36.870> gigabytes<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.190> USB<00:00:38.640> flash<00:00:39.180> drive

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
than four gigabytes to a USB flash drive

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.420 
than four gigabytes to a USB flash drive
you<00:00:40.350> must<00:00:40.739> convert<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.790> file<00:00:42.000> system<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:43.170> NTFS

from the USB flash drive to the Mac now

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.380 
from the USB flash drive to the Mac now
with<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> Windows<00:01:09.750> PC<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.770> course<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:12.060> will<00:01:12.270> be

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
with a Windows PC of course you will be

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.920 
with a Windows PC of course you will be
able<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.810> read<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.350> write<00:01:13.380> no<00:01:14.250> problem<00:01:14.930> now

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
able to read and write no problem now

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.530 
able to read and write no problem now
there<00:01:16.680> are<00:01:16.799> two<00:01:17.130> ways<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.520> accomplish<00:01:18.119> this

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
there are two ways to accomplish this

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.160 
there are two ways to accomplish this
task<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:19.439> conversion<00:01:20.360> there<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> quick<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
task of conversion there is a quick and

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.469 
task of conversion there is a quick and
easy<00:01:22.409> way<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.799> simply<00:01:23.520> using<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> Windows

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
easy way of simply using the Windows

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.770 
easy way of simply using the Windows
interface<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.680> there<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> fancier<00:01:27.540> way

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
interface and there is the fancier way

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.499 
interface and there is the fancier way
of<00:01:27.960> using<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.439> command<00:01:28.829> prompt<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.549> this

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
of using the command prompt in this

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.210 
of using the command prompt in this
video<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.799> will<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.850> easy<00:01:33.060> way<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:34.220> let's

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
video we will use the easy way so let's

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.170 
video we will use the easy way so let's
start<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.579> process

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
start the process

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.350 
start the process
I<00:01:36.210> already<00:01:37.189> connected<00:01:38.189> my<00:01:38.340> USB<00:01:38.790> flash<00:01:39.060> drive

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
I already connected my USB flash drive

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.399 
I already connected my USB flash drive
to<00:01:39.630> my<00:01:39.750> computer<00:01:40.259> so<00:01:41.159> let's<00:01:41.490> go<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> start<00:01:42.409> my

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
to my computer so let's go to start my

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.670 
to my computer so let's go to start my
computer<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:44.450> here's<00:01:45.450> my<00:01:45.659> remote<00:01:46.020> removable

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
computer and here's my remote removable

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.039 
computer and here's my remote removable
flash<00:01:46.920> drive<00:01:47.250> if<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.180> right-click<00:01:48.420> on<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.899> and

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
flash drive if you right-click on it and

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.440 
flash drive if you right-click on it and
click<00:01:49.140> properties<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:50.549> will<00:01:50.670> see<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.270> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
click properties you will see that the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.880 
click properties you will see that the
file<00:01:51.659> system<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:53.119> fat32

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
file system is fat32

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.480 
file system is fat32
so<00:01:55.890> how<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.250> convert<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:57.090> an<00:01:57.270> TFS<00:01:58.490> very

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
so how do we convert this to an TFS very

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.100 
so how do we convert this to an TFS very
easy<00:01:59.759> just<00:02:00.570> right-click<00:02:01.079> on<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.500> drive<00:02:01.829> and

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
easy just right-click on this drive and

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.520 
easy just right-click on this drive and
choose<00:02:04.110> format

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
choose format

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.430 
choose format
and<00:02:08.330> then<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.110> filesystem<00:02:10.970> just<00:02:11.970> pick

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
and then it the filesystem just pick

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.160 
and then it the filesystem just pick
NTFS<00:02:13.879> you<00:02:14.879> do<00:02:15.030> not<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.569> play<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:15.959> any

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
NTFS you do not have to play with any

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.250 
NTFS you do not have to play with any
other<00:02:16.379> options<00:02:16.920> if<00:02:17.599> you<00:02:18.599> want<00:02:18.629> this<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.140> be
