00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
out of the cutting so that's your next

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.660 
out of the cutting so that's your next
step<00:04:05.260> now<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.500> you<00:04:06.680> have<00:04:06.709> your<00:04:06.950> three<00:04:07.459> little

pieces cut out this is the tiny tree so
I've<00:04:11.389> put<00:04:11.720> a<00:04:11.750> glue<00:04:12.139> dot<00:04:12.170> on<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.920> bottom<00:04:13.670> of<00:04:13.819> the

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
I've put a glue dot on the bottom of the

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.800 
I've put a glue dot on the bottom of the
tiny<00:04:14.329> tree<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.139> I<00:04:15.829> am<00:04:16.010> going<00:04:16.400> to<00:04:16.789> stick<00:04:17.510> it

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
tiny tree and I am going to stick it

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.000 
tiny tree and I am going to stick it
right<00:04:17.959> on<00:04:18.530> top<00:04:19.100> like<00:04:19.789> that<00:04:20.150> and<00:04:20.479> the<00:04:21.470> larger

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
right on top like that and the larger

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.219 
right on top like that and the larger
tree<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:22.340> have<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.789> couple<00:04:23.210> of<00:04:23.330> glue<00:04:23.570> dots<00:04:23.840> on<00:04:24.200> it

00:04:24.219 --> 00:04:24.229 
tree I have a couple of glue dots on it

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:27.190 
tree I have a couple of glue dots on it
so<00:04:24.740> it's<00:04:24.979> going<00:04:25.400> to<00:04:25.520> go<00:04:25.880> on<00:04:25.990> like

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
so it's going to go on like

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.880 
so it's going to go on like
that<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.830> the<00:04:28.760> house<00:04:29.090> also<00:04:29.750> has<00:04:30.140> some<00:04:30.650> glue

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:30.890 
that and the house also has some glue

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.450 
that and the house also has some glue
dots<00:04:31.130> on<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.640> bottom<00:04:32.060> so<00:04:32.810> I'm<00:04:33.080> going<00:04:33.560> to<00:04:34.040> stick

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
dots on the bottom so I'm going to stick

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.700 
dots on the bottom so I'm going to stick
it<00:04:34.760> right<00:04:35.290> like<00:04:36.290> that<00:04:36.820> so<00:04:37.820> now<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.120> have<00:04:38.360> your

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
it right like that so now you have your

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.320 
it right like that so now you have your
your<00:04:39.710> three<00:04:40.400> pieces<00:04:41.770> joined<00:04:42.770> on<00:04:43.040> so<00:04:43.880> your<00:04:44.150> next

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
your three pieces joined on so your next

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.720 
your three pieces joined on so your next
step<00:04:44.540> would<00:04:44.960> be<00:04:45.020> to<00:04:45.170> take<00:04:45.530> your<00:04:45.830> glaze<00:04:46.130> pins

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:46.730 
step would be to take your glaze pins

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.570 
step would be to take your glaze pins
and<00:04:47.180> you<00:04:47.230> might<00:04:48.230> put<00:04:48.500> a<00:04:48.530> little<00:04:48.740> bit<00:04:48.980> of<00:04:49.040> green

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
and you might put a little bit of green

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.750 
and you might put a little bit of green
on<00:04:49.910> these<00:04:50.210> trees<00:04:50.750> and<00:04:51.200> this<00:04:52.070> tree<00:04:52.490> in<00:04:52.610> the

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
end i use my red to color the bow in the

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.290 
end i use my red to color the bow in the
wreath<00:05:06.110> so<00:05:06.830> that<00:05:07.040> will<00:05:07.250> be<00:05:07.400> your<00:05:07.610> next<00:05:08.060> steps

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
wreath so that will be your next steps

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.540 
wreath so that will be your next steps
now<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.360> coloring<00:05:11.960> is<00:05:12.110> done<00:05:12.500> so<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.520> next

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
now the coloring is done so the next

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.940 
now the coloring is done so the next
step<00:05:13.970> will<00:05:14.390> be<00:05:14.420> to<00:05:14.600> use<00:05:15.050> your<00:05:15.560> three

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:15.950 
step will be to use your three

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.810 
step will be to use your three
dimensional<00:05:16.670> glue<00:05:17.510> which<00:05:17.840> is<00:05:18.050> white<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:18.820> I

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:19.820 
dimensional glue which is white and I

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.540 
dimensional glue which is white and I
won't<00:05:20.180> demonstrate<00:05:20.420> it<00:05:21.080> here<00:05:21.440> but<00:05:21.710> I<00:05:21.890> put

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:22.550 
won't demonstrate it here but I put

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.050 
won't demonstrate it here but I put
right<00:05:22.910> over<00:05:23.390> top<00:05:23.630> of<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:24.290> roofs<00:05:25.280> here<00:05:25.940> and

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
right over top of the roofs here and

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.080 
right over top of the roofs here and
white<00:05:26.300> up<00:05:26.570> here<00:05:26.990> on<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.290> roof<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:27.940> some<00:05:28.940> on

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
white up here on the roof and some on

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.510 
white up here on the roof and some on
the<00:05:29.270> steps<00:05:29.690> and<00:05:30.110> I<00:05:30.410> put<00:05:30.680> some<00:05:30.980> more<00:05:31.160> on<00:05:31.220> the

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
the steps and I put some more on the

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.660 
the steps and I put some more on the
Christmas<00:05:32.090> trees<00:05:32.480> and<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:33.680> put<00:05:33.980> little<00:05:34.190> piles

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
Christmas trees and I put little piles

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.170 
Christmas trees and I put little piles
of<00:05:35.180> white<00:05:35.990> representing<00:05:36.920> snow<00:05:37.340> banks<00:05:37.730> because

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
of white representing snow banks because

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.770 
of white representing snow banks because
this<00:05:38.480> white<00:05:38.810> really<00:05:39.710> represents<00:05:40.430> the<00:05:40.610> snow<00:05:40.970> so

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
this white really represents the snow so

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.780 
this white really represents the snow so
you<00:05:42.230> do<00:05:42.470> that<00:05:42.650> next<00:05:42.980> with<00:05:43.340> your<00:05:43.370> three

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
you do that next with your three

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.530 
you do that next with your three
dimensional<00:05:44.450> growth<00:05:44.690> so<00:05:45.020> now<00:05:45.260> I've<00:05:45.530> added<00:05:45.860> the

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
dimensional growth so now I've added the

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.120 
dimensional growth so now I've added the
three-dimensional<00:05:47.540> white<00:05:48.290> glue<00:05:48.830> to

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
three-dimensional white glue to

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.260 
three-dimensional white glue to
represent<00:05:49.790> the<00:05:50.000> snow<00:05:50.360> so<00:05:51.350> the<00:05:51.650> next<00:05:52.190> move<00:05:52.880> is

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
represent the snow so the next move is

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.620 
represent the snow so the next move is
to<00:05:53.330> take<00:05:53.900> your<00:05:54.290> two<00:05:54.730> colors<00:05:55.730> of<00:05:55.970> glitter<00:05:56.120> glue

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:56.630 
to take your two colors of glitter glue

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.140 
to take your two colors of glitter glue
dymond<00:05:57.260> in<00:05:57.410> blue<00:05:57.740> and<00:05:58.010> just<00:05:58.580> make<00:05:58.970> little

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
dymond in blue and just make little

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.990 
dymond in blue and just make little
dance<00:05:59.660> all<00:06:00.110> over<00:06:00.140> the<00:06:00.530> card<00:06:00.920> with<00:06:01.310> with

dance all over the card with with

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.260 
dance all over the card with with
diamond<00:06:02.630> and<00:06:02.900> blue<00:06:03.410> glitter<00:06:04.100> that<00:06:04.460> represents

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
diamond and blue glitter that represents

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.160
