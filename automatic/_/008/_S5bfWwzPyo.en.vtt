00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:16.139
 undervalued exercise among beginners 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.680
 as many of us don't understand before 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.529
 end don't understand how powerful and for 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.960

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.450
 what does it exist 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.480

 exists in this world and since i don't 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.760
 I understand why it is still an exercise I 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.469
 refused him and for many long years 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.930
 I did not use it for years 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.059
 the training programs passed the time and 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.640
 I still wanted to study this 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.460
 exercise and study for what it is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.610

 share i with my students pullover 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.940
 applied back training the same video 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.760
 that same mr olympia 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.490
 jay catler pullover applied for 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.590
 workout lose weight then you can 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.840
 ask all the same for what to 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.659
 This exercise for what muscle 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.290
 as a group it is intended as all of 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.150
 we are used to that particular exercise 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.670
 responsible for a specific muscle group 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.070
 we know that with the bench press we 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.990
 used to train your large muscles 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.240
 although in this exercise also 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.950
 are involved 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.170
 small muscle experiences and shadows like the front 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.920
 delta triceps and even in some 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.619
 cases 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.750
 back like exercise barbell in 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.850
 slope by which we also 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.549
 accustomed to 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:47.670
 train your back muscles beyond that 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.299
 in this exercise involved 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:55.560
 also small muscle groups such 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:58.170
 like rear deltas and biceps but pullover 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.899
 exercises are ambiguous and for many of us 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.970
 the anode to the end is misunderstood but to 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.119
 apply this exercise on 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.119
 specific muscle groups like the back 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.940
 or groups this exercise pullover 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.209
 performed with some nuances this 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.250
 perhaps the only exercise 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.830
 bodybuilding through which in equal 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.280
 least we can isolated almost 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.239
 isolated train like your back muscles 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.090
 so muscles and circles 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:31.080
 So let's go, I'll show you how I understood 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:34.650
 how to use a pullover in training 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.870
 whether it's circles or back workouts so 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.680
 this pullover on umbrellas for training 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.680
 back muscles 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.300
 this is my very frame if we show 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.980
 will show 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:55.230
 on the technical side, itâ€™s about 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:58.200
 Looks like we are raising the antenna hands hands 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.540
 elbows are a bit bent at us for 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:09.180
 Convenience to elbows not after 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.850
 what the antenna boil the bottom and for 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.320
 back training 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:17.610
 dumbbell find where we do not bring 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:22.140
 about new share after which again 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:27.890
 so try 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.890
 flexed back muscles 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.860
 the main exercise is this technique 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.920
 working on the front part so 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.920
 our broadest namely cog muscles 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:51.530
 do not run no longer than the maximum about 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:54.530
 pull back and fasten our back half 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.530
 the broadest 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.680
 number of repetitions in 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.250
 it is in general 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:12.950
 at your discretion on the sensations this 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.950
 maybe from 8 and 20 and 21 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.980
 so this is pollo versante games for 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:29.420
 chest muscle training 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:31.660
 quietly show very well of course with 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.360
 some nuances 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:38.030
 still because to elbows 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.910
 such anzhi is a little bent and by the way 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.680
 notice right away that at all amplitudes 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:52.270
 movements in the elbow fold the elbows husky and 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:57.080
 me and so workers giants 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.960
 then get away to the ore parallel and in this part 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.050
 the top will have it artificially 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.870
 for example on a spacious abbreviated 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.590
 option lower stretch chest 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.740
 muscle then again 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.590
 explosive movement we bring up to or 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:20.030
 other we strain large muscles 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:22.120
 maximize and drop check it out already 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:27.610
 other sensations 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.610
 difference from the first version of the pullover 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:46.110
 they need to say 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.110
 perfectly spend invested 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:01.890
 number of repetitions at discretion 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:04.590
 where the projectile pick Pick up a 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.780
 make you prayer a penalty or execute 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:10.680
 technically 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:14.340
 so your outfit doesn't take the whites back 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:20.160
 it is great created by dust on your head 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:23.790
 the fact that the light that's how to do 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.040
 the conclusion is that the pullover is an exercise 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:27.840
 universal 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.390
 with which you can take as 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.800
 back front of the new part 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:37.940
 the jagged powerful arm muscles as well 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:42.330
 pullover perfectly great stretch 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.250
 muscles and in parallel you observe with 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.129
 all dope 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:51.599
 your boobs so to speak 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:54.289
 why not their pain 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:58.289
 frantic and with this contraction you 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:58.769
 movement continues down the reduced 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.469
 think 

00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:02.300
 muscle plus stretching is indescribable 

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:06.019

 this exercise is already on purpose 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:16.800
 as if to train released back or 

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:18.439
 hands that is redemption know something is caught 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.409
 didn't draw it 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:24.119
 using some nuances you'll 

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:27.689
