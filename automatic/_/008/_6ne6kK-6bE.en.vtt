the<00:01:17.340> conditions<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.180> Sunday's<00:01:18.540> race<00:01:18.810> seemed

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the conditions for Sunday's race seemed

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.530 
the conditions for Sunday's race seemed
perfect<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.549> supposed<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> be<00:01:20.909> cool<00:01:21.150> again

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
perfect it's supposed to be cool again

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.210 
perfect it's supposed to be cool again
so<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> think<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.229> won't<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:22.740> slick<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
so I think it won't be as slick as it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.530 
so I think it won't be as slick as it
normally<00:01:23.310> normally<00:01:23.850> gets<00:01:24.000> very<00:01:24.119> hot<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
normally normally gets very hot and

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
normally normally gets very hot and
windy<00:01:24.659> here<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:25.200> it's<00:01:25.680> cool<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.100> windy<00:01:26.280> that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
windy here but it's cool and windy that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
windy here but it's cool and windy that
helps<00:01:26.820> cause<00:01:26.970> cars<00:01:27.180> make<00:01:27.330> more<00:01:27.479> downforce<00:01:27.840> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
helps cause cars make more downforce and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.020 
helps cause cars make more downforce and
cold<00:01:28.170> air<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.590> should<00:01:28.740> be<00:01:28.829> okay<00:01:29.070> no<00:01:29.610> one<00:01:29.820> could

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
