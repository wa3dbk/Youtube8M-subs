requirement from this trick is to
actually<00:00:31.529> know<00:00:31.859> how<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.610> backflip

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
actually know how to do that backflip

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.690 
actually know how to do that backflip
and<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:34.079> lot<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.380> things<00:00:34.559> we're<00:00:35.040> gonna<00:00:35.280> see

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and a lot of things we're gonna see

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.299 
and a lot of things we're gonna see
directly<00:00:36.540> into<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> following<00:00:37.410> steps<00:00:37.710> so

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
directly into the following steps so

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.459 
directly into the following steps so
let's<00:00:38.640> go<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> our<00:00:39.120> first<00:00:39.420> step<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.020> correct

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
let's go to our first step the correct

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.250 
let's go to our first step the correct
takeoff<00:00:41.040> for<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.820> element<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.989> correct

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
takeoff for this element the correct

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.709 
takeoff for this element the correct
take<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.860> seventy<00:00:44.399> percent<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.940> success<00:00:45.239> of

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
take up is seventy percent of success of

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.369 
take up is seventy percent of success of
this<00:00:45.960> element<00:00:46.410> so<00:00:47.329> in<00:00:48.329> order<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.690> proceed<00:00:49.110> I

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
this element so in order to proceed I

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.889 
this element so in order to proceed I
would<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.610> find<00:00:51.090> some<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.840> of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
would like you to find some kind of

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.510 
would like you to find some kind of
obstacle<00:00:52.079> that<00:00:52.620> looks<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.160> one<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
obstacle that looks like this one that

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.180 
obstacle that looks like this one that
has<00:00:53.760> straight<00:00:54.449> edge<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.110> that<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.860> gonna<00:00:56.010> be

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
has straight edge and that it's gonna be

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.520 
has straight edge and that it's gonna be
comfortable<00:00:56.699> for<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.210> with<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> grip<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.350> your

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
comfortable for you with a grip for your

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.490 
comfortable for you with a grip for your
arms<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.730> we're<00:01:00.300> gonna<00:01:00.420> start<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:01.230> simply

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
arms so we're gonna start with simply

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.490 
arms so we're gonna start with simply
positioning<00:01:02.010> ourselves<00:01:02.510> on<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.899> edge<00:01:04.110> of

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
positioning ourselves on the edge of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.370 
positioning ourselves on the edge of
this<00:01:04.650> obstacles<00:01:05.159> with<00:01:05.820> our<00:01:06.030> thumbs<00:01:06.420> going

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
this obstacles with our thumbs going

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.609 
this obstacles with our thumbs going
directly<00:01:08.010> vertical<00:01:09.170> pointing<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.409> ground

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
directly vertical pointing to the ground

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.570 
directly vertical pointing to the ground
so<00:01:11.400> starting<00:01:12.090> from<00:01:12.210> here<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:13.200> must<00:01:13.380> not<00:01:13.710> go<00:01:13.979> too

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
so starting from here we must not go too

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.510 
so starting from here we must not go too
much<00:01:14.610> forward<00:01:15.240> too<00:01:15.990> much<00:01:16.020> backwards<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:17.310> must

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
much forward too much backwards we must

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.749 
much forward too much backwards we must
stay<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.479> our<00:01:18.570> arms<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:20.640> will

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
stay on to our arms and then we will

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.420 
stay on to our arms and then we will
start<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.810> get<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.259> little<00:01:22.650> bit<00:01:22.890> forward<00:01:23.159> I

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
start to get a little bit forward I

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.080 
start to get a little bit forward I
would<00:01:23.520> say<00:01:23.850> 45<00:01:24.840> degrees<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.770> we're<00:01:26.520> keeping

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
would say 45 degrees so we're keeping

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.270 
would say 45 degrees so we're keeping
ourselves<00:01:27.560> vertically<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.710> then<00:01:29.100> we're

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
ourselves vertically and then we're

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.749 
ourselves vertically and then we're
going<00:01:29.869> to<00:01:30.869> lay<00:01:31.610> on<00:01:32.610> our<00:01:32.670> hips<00:01:33.180> over<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
going to lay on our hips over here and

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.100 
going to lay on our hips over here and
starting<00:01:35.759> from<00:01:35.909> here<00:01:36.150> we're<00:01:36.720> going<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.990> go

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
starting from here we're going to go

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.700 
starting from here we're going to go
into<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> 45<00:01:38.189> degrees<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:40.290> will<00:01:40.439> try<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
into the 45 degrees and we will try to

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.609 
into the 45 degrees and we will try to
keep<00:01:41.070> our<00:01:41.250> legs<00:01:41.400> not<00:01:42.299> straight<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.470> will

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
keep our legs not straight but we will

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.700 
keep our legs not straight but we will
start<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.040> bend<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.640> order<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.350> push<00:01:46.350> after

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
start to bend it in order to push after

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.670 
start to bend it in order to push after
to<00:01:47.610> make<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.790> flip<00:01:48.030> so

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
to make a flip so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.770 
to make a flip so
we're<00:01:50.680> hanging<00:01:50.890> in<00:01:51.159> this<00:01:51.250> position<00:01:51.780> then

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
we're hanging in this position then

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.469 
we're hanging in this position then
we're<00:01:52.960> going<00:01:53.200> 45<00:01:53.530> degrees<00:01:54.009> our<00:01:55.000> legs<00:01:55.329> are

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
we're going 45 degrees our legs are

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:57.749 
we're going 45 degrees our legs are
going<00:01:55.719> backwards<00:01:56.020> and<00:01:56.409> starting<00:01:57.310> from<00:01:57.460> here

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
going backwards and starting from here

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.700 
going backwards and starting from here
we're<00:01:58.360> good<00:01:58.509> to<00:01:58.750> go<00:01:58.780> for<00:01:59.110> its<00:01:59.229> sake

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
we're good to go for its sake

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.960 
we're good to go for its sake
so<00:02:00.009> one<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.820> take<00:02:01.899> I<00:02:05.130> hope<00:02:06.130> this<00:02:06.340> part<00:02:06.579> is<00:02:06.759> not

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
so one to take I hope this part is not

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.089 
so one to take I hope this part is not
really<00:02:07.329> hard<00:02:07.509> for<00:02:07.689> you<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:07.990> therefore<00:02:08.709> I

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
really hard for you and therefore I

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.809 
really hard for you and therefore I
would<00:02:09.160> like<00:02:09.280> to<00:02:09.640> talk<00:02:10.119> about<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.599> mistakes<00:02:10.959> so

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
would like to talk about the mistakes so

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.949 
would like to talk about the mistakes so
number<00:02:12.819> one<00:02:13.030> mistake<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.420> people<00:02:13.690> usually

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
number one mistake that people usually

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.170 
number one mistake that people usually
do<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.470> that<00:02:14.739> they're<00:02:15.069> going<00:02:15.310> really<00:02:15.940> really

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
do is that they're going really really

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.150 
do is that they're going really really
far<00:02:16.330> away<00:02:16.450> from<00:02:16.690> jobs<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.290> they're<00:02:17.980> going

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
far away from jobs so they're going

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.839 
far away from jobs so they're going
forward<00:02:18.640> normally<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.300> after<00:02:19.959> that<00:02:20.849> they're

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
forward normally and after that they're

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.690 
forward normally and after that they're
just<00:02:22.120> pushing<00:02:22.900> themselves<00:02:23.049> away<00:02:23.739> from<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
just pushing themselves away from the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.729 
just pushing themselves away from the
edge<00:02:24.849> this<00:02:25.630> is<00:02:25.690> not<00:02:25.900> really<00:02:26.170> correcting<00:02:26.620> me

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
edge this is not really correcting me

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.550 
edge this is not really correcting me
there<00:02:27.340> you<00:02:27.610> must<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.900> must<00:02:28.930> find<00:02:29.349> a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
there you must have you must find a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.820 
there you must have you must find a
balance<00:02:30.220> into<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.700> thing<00:02:30.940> so<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:32.560> must<00:02:32.739> not

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
balance into this thing so you must not

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.180 
balance into this thing so you must not
go<00:02:33.010> really<00:02:33.459> far<00:02:33.610> away<00:02:33.730> but<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.480> also<00:02:35.190> don't

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
go really far away but you also don't

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.880 
go really far away but you also don't
want<00:02:36.340> to<00:02:36.640> stay<00:02:37.330> over<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.930> obstacle<00:02:38.319> because

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
want to stay over the obstacle because

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.789 
want to stay over the obstacle because
otherwise<00:02:39.340> you<00:02:39.970> can<00:02:40.180> really<00:02:40.450> hit<00:02:41.380> your<00:02:41.590> legs

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
otherwise you can really hit your legs

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.309 
otherwise you can really hit your legs
while<00:02:42.489> rotating<00:02:42.730> the<00:02:43.630> edge<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:45.390> this<00:02:46.390> is<00:02:46.569> our

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
while rotating the edge and this is our

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.770 
while rotating the edge and this is our
second<00:02:47.980> most<00:02:48.069> popular<00:02:48.430> mistake<00:02:48.790> in<00:02:49.299> order<00:02:49.599> to

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
second most popular mistake in order to

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:50.520 
second most popular mistake in order to
avoid<00:02:50.110> that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
avoid that

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.759 
avoid that
don't<00:02:51.160> keep<00:02:51.310> your<00:02:51.459> arms<00:02:52.349> vertically<00:02:53.349> all<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
don't keep your arms vertically all the

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.809 
don't keep your arms vertically all the
time<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.489> must<00:02:54.670> go<00:02:54.880> I<00:02:55.150> would<00:02:55.900> say<00:02:56.819> sixty

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
time you must go I would say sixty

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.140 
time you must go I would say sixty
degrees<00:02:58.180> so<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:59.380> angle<00:02:59.739> let<00:03:00.310> us<00:03:00.340> change<00:03:00.880> from

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
degrees so the angle let us change from

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.150 
degrees so the angle let us change from
this<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:02.590> this<00:03:02.739> and<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.930> same<00:03:05.170> at<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:06.040> same

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
this to this and in the same at the same

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.210 
this to this and in the same at the same
time<00:03:06.400> you<00:03:06.910> must<00:03:07.120> not<00:03:07.359> lose<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:08.319> height<00:03:08.560> of

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
time you must not lose the height of

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.710 
time you must not lose the height of
your<00:03:09.370> spinning<00:03:09.819> so<00:03:10.359> we're<00:03:11.139> gonna<00:03:11.319> go<00:03:11.500> here

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
your spinning so we're gonna go here

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.330 
your spinning so we're gonna go here
45<00:03:14.720> degrees<00:03:15.280> cube<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:16.819> here<00:03:17.980> this<00:03:18.980> will<00:03:19.160> give

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
45 degrees cube and here this will give

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.970 
45 degrees cube and here this will give
us<00:03:19.459> enough<00:03:20.209> speed<00:03:20.630> in<00:03:21.140> order<00:03:21.470> to<00:03:21.620> start<00:03:21.860> our

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
us enough speed in order to start our

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.460 
us enough speed in order to start our
rotation<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:22.640> enough<00:03:23.360> hate<00:03:23.630> in<00:03:23.660> order<00:03:24.200> to

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
rotation and enough hate in order to

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.640 
rotation and enough hate in order to
perform<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.160> move<00:03:25.310> and<00:03:25.610> to<00:03:26.600> get<00:03:26.780> more<00:03:27.290> into

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
perform the move and to get more into

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.480 
perform the move and to get more into
details<00:03:28.010> let's<00:03:28.490> see<00:03:28.640> this<00:03:28.760> in<00:03:28.970> slow<00:03:29.390> motion

how to take up correctly we're gonna get

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.820 
how to take up correctly we're gonna get
into<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.269> same<00:03:59.480> position<00:03:59.630> is<00:04:00.320> diving<00:04:00.620> from

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
into the same position is diving from

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.220 
into the same position is diving from
here<00:04:01.100> we<00:04:01.550> just<00:04:01.760> need<00:04:01.910> to<00:04:02.030> do<00:04:02.180> a<00:04:02.209> monkey<00:04:02.750> on<00:04:02.900> the

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
here we just need to do a monkey on the

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.470 
here we just need to do a monkey on the
block<00:04:03.410> like<00:04:03.590> this

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.320 

so<00:04:07.230> because<00:04:08.069> of<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.310> exercise<00:04:08.910> you<00:04:09.300> will

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
so because of this exercise you will

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.839 
so because of this exercise you will
actually<00:04:09.750> understand<00:04:10.230> how<00:04:10.440> to<00:04:10.769> swing<00:04:11.280> with

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
actually understand how to swing with

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.069 
actually understand how to swing with
your<00:04:11.879> legs<00:04:12.239> and<00:04:12.540> how<00:04:13.349> to<00:04:14.239> work<00:04:15.239> with<00:04:15.629> your<00:04:15.750> arms

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
your legs and how to work with your arms

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.099 
your legs and how to work with your arms
correctly<00:04:16.500> so<00:04:16.950> once<00:04:17.130> again<00:04:17.750> our<00:04:18.750> thumbs

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
correctly so once again our thumbs

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.520 
correctly so once again our thumbs
pointing<00:04:19.680> down<00:04:19.859> over<00:04:20.459> here<00:04:20.609> and<00:04:21.109> now<00:04:22.109> from

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
pointing down over here and now from

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.260 
pointing down over here and now from
this<00:04:22.680> we're<00:04:23.160> going<00:04:23.370> into<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.639> 45<00:04:24.000> degrees

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
this we're going into the 45 degrees

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.050 
this we're going into the 45 degrees
decision<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:24.870> trying<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:25.770> do<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.430> monkey<00:04:26.790> on

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
decision and trying to do the monkey on

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.370 
decision and trying to do the monkey on
the<00:04:27.240> top<00:04:27.450> so<00:04:32.060> this<00:04:33.060> one<00:04:33.300> is<00:04:33.419> pretty<00:04:33.570> simple<00:04:33.720> to

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
the top so this one is pretty simple to

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.870 
the top so this one is pretty simple to
get<00:04:34.470> useful<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:35.130> when<00:04:35.790> we're<00:04:36.680> good<00:04:37.680> with<00:04:38.639> the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
get useful and when we're good with the

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.450 
get useful and when we're good with the
taking<00:04:39.630> off<00:04:39.750> we<00:04:40.229> can<00:04:40.380> proceed<00:04:40.680> directly<00:04:41.130> to

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
taking off we can proceed directly to

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.030 
taking off we can proceed directly to
making<00:04:41.910> a<00:04:42.060> cast<00:04:42.360> away<00:04:42.600> the<00:04:43.260> best<00:04:43.440> way<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:43.860> all

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040

timing<00:04:46.740> goose<00:04:46.950> we<00:04:47.520> need<00:04:47.700> to<00:04:47.940> learn<00:04:48.389> how<00:04:48.630> to

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
timing goose we need to learn how to

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.159 
timing goose we need to learn how to
make<00:04:49.139> a<00:04:49.490> actual<00:04:50.490> cast<00:04:51.060> away<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.510> then<00:04:51.900> we

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
make a actual cast away and then we

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:53.450 
make a actual cast away and then we
needs<00:04:52.350> to<00:04:52.470> make<00:04:52.650> a<00:04:52.830> backfist

dimensions remember that during the
take-off<00:06:00.540> your<00:06:00.990> arms<00:06:01.380> must<00:06:01.860> be<00:06:01.980> straight<00:06:02.310> all

take-off your arms must be straight all
the<00:06:02.790> time

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:03.480 
the time

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.840 
the time
you<00:06:03.870> can<00:06:04.050> bend<00:06:04.230> them<00:06:04.490> when<00:06:05.490> you're<00:06:05.640> going

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
you can bend them when you're going

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.000 
you can bend them when you're going
forward<00:06:06.240> just<00:06:06.840> in<00:06:06.990> order<00:06:07.110> to<00:06:07.290> make<00:06:07.530> it<00:06:07.650> easier

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:08.010 
forward just in order to make it easier

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.940 
forward just in order to make it easier
for<00:06:08.040> you<00:06:08.280> just<00:06:09.030> take<00:06:09.390> away<00:06:09.600> from<00:06:09.840> them<00:06:09.990> so<00:06:10.200> when

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
for you just take away from them so when

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.140 
for you just take away from them so when
you're<00:06:11.070> going<00:06:11.190> forward<00:06:11.460> you<00:06:11.670> can<00:06:11.850> bend<00:06:12.030> your

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
you're going forward you can bend your

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:16.070 
you're going forward you can bend your
arms<00:06:12.390> up<00:06:12.690> here<00:06:13.670> you<00:06:14.670> must<00:06:14.910> keep<00:06:15.600> them<00:06:15.750> straight

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
arms up here you must keep them straight

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.310 
arms up here you must keep them straight
and<00:06:16.610> another<00:06:17.610> thing<00:06:17.880> is<00:06:18.120> that<00:06:18.390> it's<00:06:18.960> not<00:06:19.110> a<00:06:19.140> big

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 
and another thing is that it's not a big

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.020 
and another thing is that it's not a big
deal<00:06:19.530> when<00:06:19.890> you're<00:06:20.040> going<00:06:20.340> really<00:06:20.670> far<00:06:20.910> away

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
deal when you're going really far away

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.030 
deal when you're going really far away
from<00:06:21.330> the<00:06:21.450> obstacle<00:06:21.690> because<00:06:22.320> in<00:06:22.500> this<00:06:22.740> case

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
from the obstacle because in this case

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.970 
from the obstacle because in this case
you<00:06:23.280> will<00:06:23.490> just<00:06:23.700> land<00:06:23.940> on<00:06:24.290> for<00:06:25.290> your<00:06:25.440> parts<00:06:25.800> of

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:25.980 
you will just land on for your parts of

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:28.430 
you will just land on for your parts of
the<00:06:26.100> body<00:06:26.280> but<00:06:27.090> the<00:06:27.360> scary<00:06:27.660> thing<00:06:27.870> is<00:06:28.020> when

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
the body but the scary thing is when

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.860 
the body but the scary thing is when
you're<00:06:28.560> actually<00:06:28.770> rotating<00:06:29.430> over<00:06:30.180> this<00:06:30.660> edge

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
you're actually rotating over this edge

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.980 
you're actually rotating over this edge
in<00:06:31.170> this<00:06:31.590> case<00:06:31.860> you<00:06:32.280> can<00:06:32.490> hit<00:06:32.640> the<00:06:32.820> edge<00:06:33.000> with

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:33.990 
in this case you can hit the edge with

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.100 
in this case you can hit the edge with
your<00:06:34.260> legs<00:06:34.920> either<00:06:35.550> with<00:06:35.910> your<00:06:36.090> head<00:06:36.330> and<00:06:36.570> it's

your legs either with your head and it's

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.630 
your legs either with your head and it's
not<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.500> result<00:06:37.800> that<00:06:37.890> you<00:06:38.010> want<00:06:38.190> to<00:06:38.370> get<00:06:38.490> from

this trick in order to avoid this we

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.310 
this trick in order to avoid this we
must<00:06:41.400> remember<00:06:41.640> the<00:06:41.820> following<00:06:42.270> rule<00:06:42.480> when

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:43.320 
must remember the following rule when

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.090 
must remember the following rule when
you're<00:06:43.440> taking<00:06:43.980> up<00:06:44.130> you<00:06:45.030> must<00:06:45.240> see<00:06:46.050> your<00:06:46.710> arms

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
and see them from the 90 degrees so

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:53.900 
and see them from the 90 degrees so
virtually<00:06:50.550> directly<00:06:51.120> or<00:06:51.360> even<00:06:52.370> more<00:06:53.370> further
