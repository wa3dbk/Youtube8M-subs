while<00:00:12.860> I<00:00:12.889> have<00:00:13.160> a<00:00:13.190> batch<00:00:13.460> of<00:00:13.700> water

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
while I have a batch of water

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.850 
while I have a batch of water
disinfecting<00:00:14.809> in<00:00:14.900> the<00:00:14.990> Sun<00:00:15.230> we're<00:00:15.500> gonna<00:00:15.589> take

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:15.860 
disinfecting in the Sun we're gonna take

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.410 
disinfecting in the Sun we're gonna take
a<00:00:15.889> look<00:00:16.129> at<00:00:16.250> what<00:00:16.430> happens<00:00:16.790> if<00:00:16.910> you<00:00:17.000> get<00:00:17.120> muddy

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:17.420 
a look at what happens if you get muddy

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.080 
a look at what happens if you get muddy
water<00:00:17.740> the<00:00:18.740> water<00:00:18.980> has<00:00:19.220> to<00:00:19.369> be<00:00:19.490> cleared<00:00:19.850> enough

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.090 
water the water has to be cleared enough

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.420 
water the water has to be cleared enough
for<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:20.869> sun's<00:00:21.140> rays<00:00:21.410> to<00:00:21.439> penetrate<00:00:22.160> all<00:00:22.400> the

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430 
for the sun's rays to penetrate all the

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.640 
for the sun's rays to penetrate all the
way<00:00:22.550> to<00:00:22.670> the<00:00:22.910> bottom<00:00:23.269> of<00:00:23.390> the<00:00:23.840> container<00:00:24.140> to

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
way to the bottom of the container to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.640 
way to the bottom of the container to
kill<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:24.949> pathogens<00:00:25.390> inside<00:00:26.390> so<00:00:27.199> if<00:00:27.470> your

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
kill the pathogens inside so if your

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.750 
kill the pathogens inside so if your
water<00:00:27.830> is<00:00:28.039> too<00:00:28.189> cloudy

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
water is too cloudy

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.880 
water is too cloudy
it<00:00:29.119> won't<00:00:29.390> work<00:00:29.480> right<00:00:30.080> using<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.560> sodus

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
it won't work right using the sodus

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.910 
it won't work right using the sodus
method<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.119> let's<00:00:32.570> get<00:00:32.720> some<00:00:32.900> muddy<00:00:33.080> water<00:00:33.350> set

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
method so let's get some muddy water set

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.830 
method so let's get some muddy water set
up<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.130> simple<00:00:34.370> filter<00:00:34.850> and<00:00:35.060> hopefully<00:00:35.750> the

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
up a simple filter and hopefully the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.180 
up a simple filter and hopefully the
water<00:00:35.990> will<00:00:36.230> come<00:00:36.380> out<00:00:36.530> clear<00:00:36.770> enough<00:00:36.980> to

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
water will come out clear enough to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:01:03.660 
water will come out clear enough to
disinfect<00:00:38.030> using<00:00:38.780> sodas

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.880 

I'm<00:01:04.269> deliberately<00:01:04.869> gonna<00:01:05.140> agitate<00:01:05.379> this

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
I'm deliberately gonna agitate this

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.210 
I'm deliberately gonna agitate this
water<00:01:06.189> a<00:01:06.310> little<00:01:06.490> bit<00:01:06.670> try<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.030> get<00:01:07.240> some<00:01:07.450> mud

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
water a little bit try to get some mud

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.770 
water a little bit try to get some mud
all<00:01:09.220> right<00:01:09.340> this<00:01:09.549> water<00:01:09.850> is<00:01:10.060> definitely<00:01:10.299> too

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
all right this water is definitely too

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.690 
all right this water is definitely too
cloudy<00:01:11.140> so<00:01:11.650> we're<00:01:11.860> gonna<00:01:11.950> filter<00:01:12.340> this<00:01:12.460> and

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
cloudy so we're gonna filter this and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.940 
cloudy so we're gonna filter this and
hopefully<00:01:12.850> it'll<00:01:13.149> come<00:01:13.330> out<00:01:13.360> clear<00:01:13.720> enough<00:01:13.960> to

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
hopefully it'll come out clear enough to

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.910 
hopefully it'll come out clear enough to
disinfect<00:01:15.430> using<00:01:15.820> sodas<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.590> let's<00:01:17.770> go<00:01:17.890> back

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
disinfect using sodas so let's go back

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.450 
disinfect using sodas so let's go back
to<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.340> bamboo<00:01:18.700> grove<00:01:18.729> and<00:01:19.270> make<00:01:20.049> a<00:01:20.080> filter

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
to the bamboo grove and make a filter

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.219 
to the bamboo grove and make a filter
the<00:01:21.460> first<00:01:21.700> thing<00:01:21.880> I<00:01:21.970> can<00:01:22.030> do<00:01:22.330> is<00:01:22.539> just<00:01:22.600> let<00:01:23.080> the

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
the first thing I can do is just let the

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.820 
the first thing I can do is just let the
sediment<00:01:23.710> settle<00:01:24.310> in<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.210> jar<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.630> then

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
sediment settle in the jar and then

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.560 
sediment settle in the jar and then
decant<00:01:26.830> the<00:01:27.189> cleanest<00:01:27.580> water<00:01:27.820> I<00:01:27.880> can<00:01:28.180> into<00:01:28.479> the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
decant the cleanest water I can into the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.429 
decant the cleanest water I can into the
filter<00:01:28.899> so<00:01:29.500> I'm<00:01:29.590> just<00:01:29.710> gonna<00:01:29.830> set<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:30.909> down<00:01:30.939> and

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
filter so I'm just gonna set it down and

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.260 
filter so I'm just gonna set it down and
let<00:01:32.439> it<00:01:32.470> stay<00:01:32.770> still<00:01:33.100> while<00:01:33.759> I<00:01:33.789> work<00:01:34.030> on<00:01:34.119> the

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
let it stay still while I work on the

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.740 
let it stay still while I work on the
filter

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
filter

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.960 
filter
I<00:01:34.780> took<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.439> longest<00:01:35.679> largest<00:01:36.520> section<00:01:36.880> of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
I took the longest largest section of

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.410 
I took the longest largest section of
bamboo<00:01:37.330> I<00:01:37.360> could<00:01:37.630> find<00:01:37.899> and<00:01:38.909> cut<00:01:39.909> off<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.240> top

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
bamboo I could find and cut off the top

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.559 
bamboo I could find and cut off the top
but<00:01:41.350> left<00:01:41.590> the<00:01:42.250> joint<00:01:42.580> in<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.090> bottom<00:01:43.420> and

00:01:43.559 --> 00:01:43.569 
but left the joint in the bottom and

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.330 
but left the joint in the bottom and
then<00:01:43.810> cut<00:01:44.020> a<00:01:44.049> hole<00:01:44.229> in<00:01:44.409> it<00:01:44.530> so<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.890> water<00:01:45.100> can

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
then cut a hole in it so the water can

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.859 
then cut a hole in it so the water can
drip<00:01:45.549> through<00:01:46.289> what<00:01:47.289> I'm<00:01:47.380> gonna<00:01:47.470> do<00:01:47.710> is<00:01:48.869> put

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
drip through what I'm gonna do is put

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.770 
drip through what I'm gonna do is put
some<00:01:50.020> charcoal<00:01:50.530> in<00:01:50.880> this<00:01:51.880> short<00:01:52.270> sleeve<00:01:52.509> and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
some charcoal in this short sleeve and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.460 
some charcoal in this short sleeve and
then<00:01:53.020> stuff<00:01:53.860> it<00:01:54.009> inside<00:01:54.130> this<00:01:54.490> pole<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.990> first

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
then stuff it inside this pole but first

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.590 
then stuff it inside this pole but first
I'm<00:01:56.679> gonna<00:01:56.770> take<00:01:57.039> these<00:01:57.190> chunks<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.179> charcoal

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
I'm gonna take these chunks of charcoal

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.809 
I'm gonna take these chunks of charcoal
I<00:01:58.899> showed<00:01:59.679> you<00:01:59.799> how<00:01:59.920> to<00:01:59.979> make<00:02:00.190> in<00:02:00.340> a<00:02:00.429> previous

00:02:00.809 --> 00:02:00.819 
I showed you how to make in a previous

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:04.499 
I showed you how to make in a previous
episode<00:02:01.569> and<00:02:02.970> I'm<00:02:03.970> going<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.179> put<00:02:04.270> them<00:02:04.360> in<00:02:04.450> the

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
episode and I'm going to put them in the

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.230 
episode and I'm going to put them in the
sleeve<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:05.020> then<00:02:05.319> pound<00:02:06.310> it<00:02:06.490> I'm<00:02:07.030> going<00:02:07.179> to

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
sleeve and then pound it I'm going to

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:18.300 
sleeve and then pound it I'm going to
tie<00:02:07.390> off<00:02:07.569> one<00:02:07.810> end<00:02:08.019> of<00:02:08.109> the<00:02:08.229> sleeve

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.100 

this<00:02:19.310> is<00:02:19.430> just<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:19.760> can<00:02:19.850> withdraw<00:02:20.180> the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
this is just so I can withdraw the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.630 
this is just so I can withdraw the
filter<00:02:21.470> out<00:02:21.709> of<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.890> pipe<00:02:22.160> when<00:02:22.370> I'm<00:02:22.490> done

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
filter out of the pipe when I'm done

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.020 
filter out of the pipe when I'm done
it's<00:02:25.640> probably<00:02:26.090> enough<00:02:30.670> when<00:02:31.670> I<00:02:31.760> start

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
it's probably enough when I start

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.890 
it's probably enough when I start
getting<00:02:32.180> dust<00:02:32.569> coming<00:02:32.870> out<00:02:33.050> of<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.290> cloth<00:02:33.560> I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
getting dust coming out of the cloth I

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.470 
getting dust coming out of the cloth I
know<00:02:35.900> I've<00:02:36.200> got<00:02:36.350> some<00:02:36.380> powder<00:02:36.770> in<00:02:36.950> there<00:02:37.480> it's

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
know I've got some powder in there it's

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:47.910 
know I've got some powder in there it's
easiest<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:39.110> do<00:02:39.319> it<00:02:39.440> upside<00:02:39.620> down

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.130 

it's<00:02:48.920> tricky<00:02:49.250> getting<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.850> there<00:02:50.030> but<00:02:50.270> you

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
it's tricky getting it in there but you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.340 
it's tricky getting it in there but you
just<00:02:51.320> try<00:02:51.500> different<00:02:51.740> techniques<00:02:53.350> be

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
just try different techniques be

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:03.850 
just try different techniques be
persistent<00:02:55.030> whoops<00:03:00.700> okay<00:03:02.500> finally<00:03:03.500> got<00:03:03.650> it<00:03:03.770> in

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
persistent whoops okay finally got it in

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.840 
persistent whoops okay finally got it in
there<00:03:04.720> now<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.750> want<00:03:05.990> to<00:03:06.020> set<00:03:06.260> up<00:03:06.290> my<00:03:06.500> jar<00:03:06.850> to

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
there now I want to set up my jar to

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.180 
there now I want to set up my jar to
collect<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.240> water<00:03:08.270> so<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.440> need<00:03:09.740> something<00:03:10.070> to

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
collect the water so I need something to

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.180 
collect the water so I need something to
support<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:11.020> pipe<00:03:12.020> and<00:03:12.709> something<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.070> keep

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
support the pipe and something to keep

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:30.300 
support the pipe and something to keep
the<00:03:13.370> bottle<00:03:13.670> from<00:03:13.790> turning<00:03:14.150> over

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.650 

you<00:03:31.310> can<00:03:31.460> see<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.880> water<00:03:32.120> has<00:03:32.330> cleared

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
you can see the water has cleared

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.570 
you can see the water has cleared
already<00:03:33.080> some<00:03:34.810> carefully<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:37.130> is<00:03:37.250> gonna<00:03:37.370> go

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
already some carefully this is gonna go

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.320 
already some carefully this is gonna go
pretty<00:03:37.880> slow<00:03:38.180> especially<00:03:39.140> at<00:03:39.530> first<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:41.120> takes

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
pretty slow especially at first it takes

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.530 
pretty slow especially at first it takes
a<00:03:41.480> while<00:03:41.660> for<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:42.050> filter<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:42.500> get<00:03:42.620> saturated

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.260 

it's<00:03:47.540> a<00:03:47.630> slow<00:03:47.840> process<00:03:48.050> you<00:03:48.530> have<00:03:48.680> to<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:50.150> know

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
it's a slow process you have to you know

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.590 
it's a slow process you have to you know
you<00:03:50.360> just<00:03:50.660> have<00:03:50.810> to<00:03:50.990> be<00:03:51.680> patient<00:03:52.480> keep<00:03:53.480> the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
you just have to be patient keep the

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.620 
you just have to be patient keep the
water<00:03:53.780> topped<00:03:54.080> off<00:03:54.290> in<00:03:54.770> the<00:03:54.950> pipe<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:55.630> get

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
water topped off in the pipe and get

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.360 
water topped off in the pipe and get
busy<00:03:56.930> doing<00:03:57.080> something<00:03:57.500> else<00:03:57.590> one<00:03:58.130> way<00:03:58.310> to

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
busy doing something else one way to

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.280 
busy doing something else one way to
improve<00:03:58.550> the<00:03:58.910> system<00:03:59.120> I<00:03:59.390> think<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.810> to<00:04:02.290> figure

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
improve the system I think is to figure

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.950 
improve the system I think is to figure
out<00:04:03.440> some<00:04:03.710> way<00:04:03.830> to<00:04:03.860> have<00:04:04.100> a<00:04:04.130> looser<00:04:04.960> filter

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:05.960 
out some way to have a looser filter

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.280 
out some way to have a looser filter
inside<00:04:06.490> if<00:04:07.490> the<00:04:07.580> filter<00:04:08.060> is<00:04:08.090> looser<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:09.080> water

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
inside if the filter is looser the water

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.480 
inside if the filter is looser the water
will<00:04:09.560> go<00:04:10.430> through<00:04:10.460> better<00:04:10.880> but<00:04:11.690> still<00:04:11.960> get

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
will go through better but still get

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.520 
will go through better but still get
sediments<00:04:13.490> out<00:04:13.640> caught<00:04:14.090> in<00:04:14.300> the<00:04:14.420> fabric<00:04:14.600> the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
sediments out caught in the fabric the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.440 
sediments out caught in the fabric the
sodus<00:04:15.860> method<00:04:16.220> doesn't<00:04:16.610> alter<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:17.000> flavor<00:04:17.330> of

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
sodus method doesn't alter the flavor of

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.810 
sodus method doesn't alter the flavor of
the<00:04:17.630> water<00:04:17.840> it'll<00:04:18.410> be<00:04:18.530> disinfected<00:04:19.130> but<00:04:19.610> it's

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
the water it'll be disinfected but it's

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.690 
the water it'll be disinfected but it's
still<00:04:20.030> gonna<00:04:20.209> taste<00:04:20.450> like<00:04:20.570> pond<00:04:20.870> water<00:04:21.250> so<00:04:22.250> the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
still gonna taste like pond water so the

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.430 
still gonna taste like pond water so the
charcoal<00:04:23.120> is<00:04:23.510> gonna<00:04:23.720> help<00:04:23.930> with<00:04:23.960> that

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
charcoal is gonna help with that

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.190 
charcoal is gonna help with that
cameraman<00:04:25.250> suggested<00:04:26.000> this<00:04:26.210> idea<00:04:26.450> so<00:04:26.990> we're

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.200 
cameraman suggested this idea so we're

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.690 
cameraman suggested this idea so we're
gonna<00:04:27.290> give<00:04:27.530> it<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.680> shot<00:04:27.950> I<00:04:28.160> think<00:04:28.250> it's<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.580> good

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
gonna give it a shot I think it's a good

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.320 
gonna give it a shot I think it's a good
idea<00:04:28.850> when<00:04:29.480> he<00:04:29.600> suggested<00:04:30.170> was<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:31.300> make<00:04:32.300> a

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
idea when he suggested was to make a

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.300 
idea when he suggested was to make a
plug<00:04:32.780> of<00:04:32.960> cloth<00:04:33.260> in<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.560> bottom<00:04:36.040> put<00:04:37.040> a<00:04:37.100> bunch

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
plug of cloth in the bottom put a bunch

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.060 
plug of cloth in the bottom put a bunch
of<00:04:37.430> charcoal<00:04:37.910> in<00:04:38.060> there<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.480> then<00:04:39.410> put

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
of charcoal in there and then put

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.950 
of charcoal in there and then put
another<00:04:40.100> plug<00:04:40.550> of<00:04:40.700> cloth<00:04:40.970> on<00:04:41.210> top<00:04:41.450> to<00:04:41.660> keep<00:04:41.810> the

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
another plug of cloth on top to keep the

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:54.200 
another plug of cloth on top to keep the
charcoal<00:04:42.350> from<00:04:42.440> floating

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.700 

this<00:04:55.210> is<00:04:55.360> the<00:04:55.510> charcoal<00:04:55.930> left<00:04:56.170> over<00:04:56.500> that<00:04:56.530> I

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
this is the charcoal left over that I

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:07.740 
this is the charcoal left over that I
pounded<00:04:57.100> yesterday

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.820 

this<00:05:08.750> one<00:05:08.900> hadn't<00:05:09.139> even<00:05:09.229> started<00:05:09.410> dripping

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
this one hadn't even started dripping

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.800 
this one hadn't even started dripping
yet<00:05:10.160> it's<00:05:10.970> been<00:05:11.150> ten<00:05:11.389> minutes<00:05:12.070> so<00:05:13.660> let's<00:05:14.660> try

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
yet it's been ten minutes so let's try

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.900 
yet it's been ten minutes so let's try
this<00:05:14.870> one<00:05:17.800> okay<00:05:18.800> the<00:05:18.919> first<00:05:19.160> water<00:05:19.520> that<00:05:19.729> comes

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
this one okay the first water that comes

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.790 
this one okay the first water that comes
out<00:05:20.180> is<00:05:20.479> gonna<00:05:20.630> have<00:05:20.870> a<00:05:20.900> lot<00:05:21.110> of<00:05:21.139> charcoal<00:05:21.590> I'm

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
out is gonna have a lot of charcoal I'm

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.469 
out is gonna have a lot of charcoal I'm
hoping<00:05:22.130> that'll<00:05:22.340> clear<00:05:22.669> up<00:05:22.699> you<00:05:23.240> know<00:05:23.360> the

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
hoping that'll clear up you know the

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.810 
hoping that'll clear up you know the
charcoal<00:05:23.930> itself<00:05:24.350> is<00:05:24.740> harmless<00:05:25.190> you<00:05:25.639> can

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
charcoal itself is harmless you can

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.659 
charcoal itself is harmless you can
actually<00:05:25.970> eat<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.419> stuff<00:05:26.690> so<00:05:27.340> that<00:05:28.340> doesn't

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
actually eat the stuff so that doesn't

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.189 
actually eat the stuff so that doesn't
bother<00:05:28.789> me<00:05:29.000> but<00:05:29.449> if<00:05:29.690> we're<00:05:29.870> trying<00:05:29.990> to<00:05:30.110> make

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
bother me but if we're trying to make

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.010 
bother me but if we're trying to make
the<00:05:30.380> water<00:05:30.560> clear<00:05:30.830> so<00:05:31.070> we<00:05:31.190> can<00:05:31.370> make<00:05:31.520> it

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.020 
the water clear so we can make it

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.140 
the water clear so we can make it
suitable<00:05:33.020> for<00:05:33.199> solar<00:05:34.039> disinfection<00:05:34.310> then

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
suitable for solar disinfection then

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.270 
suitable for solar disinfection then
gonna<00:05:36.020> have<00:05:36.139> to<00:05:36.229> get<00:05:36.350> that<00:05:36.470> charcoal<00:05:36.830> out<00:05:37.010> I

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
gonna have to get that charcoal out I

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.010 
gonna have to get that charcoal out I
probably<00:05:37.580> run<00:05:37.850> it<00:05:37.940> through<00:05:38.120> a<00:05:38.210> second<00:05:38.600> time

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
probably run it through a second time

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.200 
probably run it through a second time
it's<00:05:39.500> definitely<00:05:39.889> running<00:05:40.100> faster<00:05:40.729> well<00:05:41.060> this

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
it's definitely running faster well this

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.740 
it's definitely running faster well this
water<00:05:41.419> is<00:05:41.570> definitely<00:05:42.020> too<00:05:42.229> dark<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:44.600> be

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
water is definitely too dark to be

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.460 
water is definitely too dark to be
disinfected<00:05:45.320> by<00:05:45.770> solar<00:05:46.190> disinfection

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
disinfected by solar disinfection

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.629 
disinfected by solar disinfection
because<00:05:48.470> the<00:05:48.650> light<00:05:48.800> won't<00:05:49.010> penetrate<00:05:49.310> the

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
because the light won't penetrate the

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:52.689 
because the light won't penetrate the
water<00:05:50.169> to<00:05:51.169> kill<00:05:51.350> the<00:05:51.470> pathogens<00:05:51.650> inside<00:05:52.340> so

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
water to kill the pathogens inside so

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.860 
water to kill the pathogens inside so
want<00:05:53.630> to<00:05:53.690> discard<00:05:54.020> this<00:05:54.289> and<00:05:55.510> hopefully<00:05:56.510> the

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
want to discard this and hopefully the

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:01.200 
want to discard this and hopefully the
powdered<00:05:57.650> charcoal<00:05:58.039> has<00:05:58.220> been<00:05:58.400> rinsed<00:05:58.699> out

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:01.210 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.610 

and<00:06:02.210> I'll<00:06:02.330> run<00:06:02.509> some<00:06:02.720> more<00:06:02.780> water<00:06:03.080> through<00:06:03.410> and

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:03.620 
and I'll run some more water through and

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.969 
and I'll run some more water through and
see<00:06:03.979> if<00:06:04.070> it<00:06:04.190> comes<00:06:04.310> out<00:06:04.490> clear<00:06:04.759> enough<00:06:05.979> that

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:06.979 
see if it comes out clear enough that

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:12.040 
see if it comes out clear enough that
looks<00:06:07.190> a<00:06:07.310> lot<00:06:07.580> clearer<00:06:10.360> I'm<00:06:11.360> gonna<00:06:11.510> stop<00:06:11.840> this

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
looks a lot clearer I'm gonna stop this

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.589 
looks a lot clearer I'm gonna stop this
for<00:06:12.289> now<00:06:12.410> so<00:06:12.680> we<00:06:12.800> can<00:06:12.949> compare<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.490> two

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
for now so we can compare the two

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.909 
for now so we can compare the two
there's<00:06:14.599> a<00:06:14.690> little<00:06:14.990> charcoal<00:06:15.380> powder<00:06:15.590> and<00:06:15.860> the

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 
there's a little charcoal powder and the

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:18.640 
there's a little charcoal powder and the
one<00:06:16.070> that<00:06:16.220> I<00:06:16.360> filtered<00:06:17.360> but<00:06:18.169> it's<00:06:18.349> a<00:06:18.440> lot

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 
one that I filtered but it's a lot

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.070 
one that I filtered but it's a lot
clearer<00:06:19.000> than<00:06:20.000> the<00:06:20.419> water<00:06:20.630> that<00:06:20.780> came

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
clearer than the water that came

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:28.820 
clearer than the water that came
straight<00:06:21.380> out<00:06:21.440> of<00:06:21.590> the<00:06:21.740> pond

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.650 

obviously<00:06:29.910> the<00:06:30.910> one<00:06:31.090> that's<00:06:31.240> been<00:06:31.390> filtered

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
obviously the one that's been filtered

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.110 
obviously the one that's been filtered
is<00:06:31.900> clear<00:06:32.140> enough<00:06:33.930> this<00:06:34.930> pond<00:06:35.830> water<00:06:36.130> is<00:06:36.820> way

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
is clear enough this pond water is way

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.820 
is clear enough this pond water is way
too<00:06:37.180> cloudy<00:06:37.570> it's<00:06:37.960> not<00:06:38.110> gonna<00:06:38.200> work<00:06:38.410> for<00:06:38.650> solar

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830 
too cloudy it's not gonna work for solar

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.460 
too cloudy it's not gonna work for solar
disinfection<00:06:39.100> so<00:06:40.000> this<00:06:40.510> filter<00:06:40.780> system<00:06:41.200> works

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
disinfection so this filter system works

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.530 
disinfection so this filter system works
you<00:06:41.740> can<00:06:42.160> filter<00:06:42.400> muddy<00:06:42.730> water<00:06:42.970> through<00:06:43.300> a

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
you can filter muddy water through a

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.270 
you can filter muddy water through a
makeshift<00:06:44.170> filter<00:06:44.650> like<00:06:44.980> the<00:06:45.100> one<00:06:45.250> I

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
makeshift filter like the one I

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.160 
makeshift filter like the one I
demonstrated<00:06:45.850> and<00:06:46.180> then<00:06:46.630> get<00:06:46.810> water<00:06:47.020> that's

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.170 
demonstrated and then get water that's

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.270 
demonstrated and then get water that's
clear<00:06:47.440> enough<00:06:47.680> for<00:06:47.830> solar<00:06:48.040> disinfection

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
clear enough for solar disinfection

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.030 
clear enough for solar disinfection
later<00:06:48.880> I<00:06:49.150> want<00:06:50.110> to<00:06:50.170> put<00:06:50.290> that<00:06:50.410> in<00:06:50.560> a<00:06:50.620> bottle<00:06:50.920> now

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
later I want to put that in a bottle now

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.450 
later I want to put that in a bottle now
and<00:06:51.340> set<00:06:51.790> it<00:06:51.910> out<00:06:52.000> in<00:06:52.030> the<00:06:52.240> Sun
