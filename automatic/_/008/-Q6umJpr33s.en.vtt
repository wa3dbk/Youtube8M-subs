yeah<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:29.120> think<00:01:29.240> this<00:01:29.510> is<00:01:29.570> one<00:01:30.050> main<00:01:30.290> line<00:01:39.280> now

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
yeah I think this is one main line now

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.970 
yeah I think this is one main line now
maybe<00:01:40.850> Bishop<00:01:41.210> f4<00:01:41.690> looks<00:01:42.590> like<00:01:43.250> a<00:01:43.280> normal<00:01:43.580> move

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
maybe Bishop f4 looks like a normal move

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.190 
maybe Bishop f4 looks like a normal move
yeah<00:01:45.980> in<00:01:46.100> general<00:01:46.520> on<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.060> idea<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.480> black<00:01:47.990> in

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
yeah in general on the idea of black in

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.610 
yeah in general on the idea of black in
this<00:01:48.350> line<00:01:48.650> is<00:01:48.920> too<00:01:49.450> yeah<00:01:50.450> playing<00:01:50.930> a<00:01:51.140> sort<00:01:51.500> of

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
this line is too yeah playing a sort of

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.460 
this line is too yeah playing a sort of
hyper<00:01:51.920> modern<00:01:52.250> way<00:01:52.630> using<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.870> bishops

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
hyper modern way using the bishops

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.940 
hyper modern way using the bishops
before<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.400> g6<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.630> g6<00:01:57.020> bishop<00:01:57.380> often<00:01:57.740> comes

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
to h5 fall so I'm using those pieces to

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.830 
to h5 fall so I'm using those pieces to
to<00:02:02.330> pressurize<00:02:03.190> white<00:02:04.190> center<00:02:04.760> and<00:02:05.119> here<00:02:05.390> even

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
to pressurize white center and here even

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.040 
to pressurize white center and here even
