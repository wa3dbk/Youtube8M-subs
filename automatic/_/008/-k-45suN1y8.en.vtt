00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 in this design lab 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.940
 designers come with their own sketches 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.700
 after 5 days get ready 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.889
 product samples with them detailed 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.780
 production technology in Europe for 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.929
 such a kit will have to pay in 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.660
 an average of 1,800 euros here about 8 times 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.970
 cheaper maiden rush today judging by 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.090
 surveys clothes with such a label are ready 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.470
 buy 65 percent of Russians and in this 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.630
 innovation center easy 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.820
 industry for designers built 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.070
 the shortest way from sketch to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.530
 counter from this principle work 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.120
 beginner couturier in Europe in similar 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.700
 laboratories collects the best 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.780
 designers and technologists they sketch 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.270
 create patterns 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.700
 or more simply, the patterns are then sewn 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.730
 sample and connections so you can see 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:53.020
 all the flaws and then the present 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.210
 dress in five I get 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.040
 model of your dress is such a tenge for 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.860
 in finished form in fabric and 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:04.690
 technical documentation set 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.360
 printed and electronic media with 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.740
 which I can already go to any 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.420
 enterprise where will fulfill my order 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.119
 in the mass last such laboratories 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.100
 outsourcing is primarily beneficial 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.810
 small and medium business according to 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.939
 experts today have domestic 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.799
 goods have a chance to occupy a niche between 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.439
 expensive European segment and 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.869
 consumer goods from Asia in their favor played 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.789
 the fall of the ruble goods from China loses 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.619
 not only in quality but also in prices 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:32.820
 but for now, provided it is ordered 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.460
 small party 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.679
 Chinese salary which was 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.899
 right in the early 90s was there 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.509
 400 dollars already average Chinese 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.780
 salary has reached 400 dollars therefore 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.610
 as soon as late last year 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.020
 there was a devaluation of the ruble there too 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.130
 This here is not very cheap Chinese 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.470
 products 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.630
 she just went up twice already 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.759
 Now in the innovation center there is a whole 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.350
 package of services including the development of new 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.360
 types of fabrics examination 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.490
 but as the Ministry of Industry promises by the end 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.560
 he will have new features 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.750
 here the designer will be able to including 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.880
 give business advice find partners in 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.709
 banks until the share of domestic 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.840
 manufacturers come in different 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.940
 estimated a quarter of the market but already in 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.190
 the twentieth year the goal is to increase 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.769
 her up to forty percent will help and 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.380
 state support is already working 0 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.630
 customs duty and no vat on you 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.160
 equipment that has no analogues in 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.590
 Russia besides now 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.510
 reset import duties on individual 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.570
 types of raw materials dyes and chemical 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.790
 footwear materials in 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.290
 some parts and our cost 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.630
 goods is getting 15-20 percent 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.130
 lower than the cost of goods overseas 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.200
 component large batches immediately yet 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.910
 more profitable to produce abroad more often in 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.049
 countries of southeast asia if it is masses 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.250
 market but in terms of logistics 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.750
 currency risk payment of customs 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.160
 payments small batch live days 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.319
 become produce here it is very 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.459
 okay so far weak points of domestic 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.859
 light industry 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.959
 this including fittings and raw materials to 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.489
 For example, cotton is grown in 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.980
 countries of the former USSR 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.350
 however, the Ministry of Industry and Trade says no goal 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.359
 completely replace imports last year 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.120
 retail market volume increased to 3 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.730
 trillion rubles and in 2020 can 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.260
 prove to be another trillion more and if 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.239
 domestic production share 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.680
 grow to forty percent 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.599
 then it will be about pain 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.939
 morning trillion rubles maria kudryavtseva
