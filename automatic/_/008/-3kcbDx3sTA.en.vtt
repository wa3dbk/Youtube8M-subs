00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.849 
able to create using a digital prop and
background<00:00:17.369> set<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:19.080> problem<00:00:19.560> with<00:00:19.710> it

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
background set but the problem with it

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.730 
background set but the problem with it
is<00:00:19.890> it's<00:00:20.250> given<00:00:20.580> me<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.850> most<00:00:21.029> problems<00:00:21.930> with

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
is it's given me the most problems with

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.429 
is it's given me the most problems with
my<00:00:22.949> ebay<00:00:23.340> customers<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.390> reason<00:00:24.840> why<00:00:25.080> is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
my ebay customers and the reason why is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.920 
my ebay customers and the reason why is
because<00:00:25.849> we<00:00:26.849> basically<00:00:27.029> put<00:00:27.390> this<00:00:27.689> out<00:00:27.900> there

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
because we basically put this out there

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.900 
because we basically put this out there
on<00:00:28.140> ebay<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:29.189> lot<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.429> people<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.789> are

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910

looking<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.420> real<00:00:30.689> props<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.560> backgrounds

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
looking for real props and backgrounds

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.310 
looking for real props and backgrounds
will<00:00:32.610> find<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.149> all<00:00:33.600> right<00:00:33.809> and<00:00:33.989> that's<00:00:34.079> why

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
will find this all right and that's why

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.350 
will find this all right and that's why
it's<00:00:34.469> very<00:00:34.680> important<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.610> put<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.120> in

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
it's very important that I put this in

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.440 
it's very important that I put this in
here<00:00:36.540> in<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.750> description<00:00:37.230> Photoshop

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
here in the description Photoshop

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.450 
here in the description Photoshop
digital<00:00:39.450> okay<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.559> then<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.890> way<00:00:41.040> they<00:00:41.430> know

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
digital okay and then that way they know

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.090 
digital okay and then that way they know
it's<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> Photoshop<00:00:42.450> file<00:00:43.140> i<00:00:43.440> would<00:00:43.590> hope<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
it's a Photoshop file i would hope and

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250 
it's a Photoshop file i would hope and
then<00:00:44.399> would<00:00:44.670> entrench<00:00:44.969> bowl<00:00:45.239> photo<00:00:45.629> prop<00:00:46.020> and

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
then would entrench bowl photo prop and

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.729 
then would entrench bowl photo prop and
then<00:00:46.500> three<00:00:47.070> digital<00:00:48.170> backgrounds<00:00:49.170> all<00:00:49.559> right

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
then three digital backgrounds all right

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.930 
then three digital backgrounds all right
so<00:00:49.950> i<00:00:49.980> would<00:00:50.190> think<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.520> would<00:00:50.789> be<00:00:50.910> good

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
so i would think that would be good

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.310 
so i would think that would be good
right<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.539> i<00:00:51.570> always<00:00:51.840> take<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.289> step

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
right but i always take it a step

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.799 
right but i always take it a step
further<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.160> then<00:00:53.910> what<00:00:54.090> i<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.420> i<00:00:54.570> also

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
further and then what i do is i also

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.010 
further and then what i do is i also
include<00:00:55.410> pictures<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.399> show<00:00:56.820> how<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.690> image

00:06:44.649 --> 00:06:47.069 
this and the proof that this stuff can
work<00:06:44.949> and<00:06:45.219> that<00:06:45.429> it<00:06:45.549> looks<00:06:45.579> so<00:06:45.909> real<00:06:46.389> is<00:06:46.689> that<00:06:47.049> I

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:47.079 
work and that it looks so real is that I

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:49.499 
work and that it looks so real is that I
put<00:06:47.409> this<00:06:47.559> up<00:06:47.799> on<00:06:47.919> ebay<00:06:48.369> and<00:06:48.639> I<00:06:48.879> had<00:06:49.059> people

00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:49.509 
put this up on ebay and I had people

00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:52.079 
put this up on ebay and I had people
like<00:06:49.689> I<00:06:49.839> said<00:06:50.139> it's<00:06:50.619> actually<00:06:51.069> bad<00:06:51.609> for<00:06:51.669> me

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:52.089 
like I said it's actually bad for me

00:06:52.089 --> 00:06:54.599 
like I said it's actually bad for me
because<00:06:52.299> ebay<00:06:52.929> you<00:06:53.199> know<00:06:53.289> they<00:06:53.559> go<00:06:53.709> by<00:06:53.889> score

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:54.609 
because ebay you know they go by score

00:06:54.609 --> 00:06:56.249 
because ebay you know they go by score
and<00:06:54.819> all<00:06:54.879> that<00:06:55.089> stuff<00:06:55.239> you<00:06:55.389> know<00:06:55.539> you<00:06:55.659> start<00:06:56.169> to

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:56.259 
and all that stuff you know you start to

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.979 
and all that stuff you know you start to
get<00:06:56.439> a<00:06:56.469> few<00:06:56.739> neutral<00:06:57.279> or<00:06:57.549> negative<00:06:57.989> feedbacks

00:06:58.979 --> 00:06:58.989 
get a few neutral or negative feedbacks

00:06:58.989 --> 00:07:01.739 
get a few neutral or negative feedbacks
that<00:06:59.769> can<00:07:00.279> kind<00:07:00.489> of<00:07:00.549> hurt<00:07:00.729> you<00:07:00.879> so<00:07:01.389> that's<00:07:01.629> why

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:01.749 
that can kind of hurt you so that's why

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:03.659 
that can kind of hurt you so that's why
I<00:07:01.779> might<00:07:02.169> have<00:07:02.349> to<00:07:02.469> temporarily<00:07:03.129> pull<00:07:03.519> this

00:07:03.659 --> 00:07:03.669 
I might have to temporarily pull this

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:05.309 
I might have to temporarily pull this
down<00:07:03.909> until<00:07:04.269> I<00:07:04.299> get<00:07:04.509> it<00:07:04.599> worked<00:07:04.809> out<00:07:04.989> because

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 
down until I get it worked out because

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.769 
down until I get it worked out because
it<00:07:05.619> can<00:07:05.739> take<00:07:05.859> my<00:07:06.039> score<00:07:06.339> down<00:07:06.539> but<00:07:07.539> like<00:07:07.659> I

00:07:07.769 --> 00:07:07.779 
it can take my score down but like I

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:09.119
