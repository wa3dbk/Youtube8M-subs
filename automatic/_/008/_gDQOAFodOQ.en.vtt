and that's looks like the brake lights
on<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:19.590> not<00:00:19.760> let's<00:00:20.760> get<00:00:21.240> some<00:00:21.420> blinker

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
on but it's not let's get some blinker

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:34.610 
on but it's not let's get some blinker
action<00:00:22.109> going<00:00:22.380> here<00:00:32.780> and<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.140> left<00:00:34.350> turn

action going here and see the left turn
there<00:00:38.390> get<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> radiance<00:00:39.899> bar<00:00:40.469> there<00:00:48.800> get<00:00:49.800> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
there get the radiance bar there get the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.490 
there get the radiance bar there get the
flashes<00:00:50.370> going<00:00:50.399> there<00:00:53.870> yeah<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:54.899> didn't<00:00:55.379> turn

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:37.969 
get a little break action going here see
that<00:01:27.490> is<00:01:27.670> really<00:01:27.700> bright<00:01:28.420> now

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.890 

yeah<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.790> course<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.180> did<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.450> front<00:01:39.570> -

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
yeah and of course I did the front -

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.330 
yeah and of course I did the front -
they're<00:01:40.259> pretty<00:01:40.439> bright<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> went<00:01:41.100> ahead<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.070 
they're pretty bright I went ahead and
shut<00:01:41.490> those<00:01:41.700> driving<00:01:42.270> lights<00:01:42.479> off<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.750> you

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
shut those driving lights off so you

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.340 
shut those driving lights off so you
could<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.369> wouldn't<00:01:44.610> blind<00:01:44.880> him<00:01:45.170> not<00:01:46.170> too

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
could so it wouldn't blind him not too

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.010 
could so it wouldn't blind him not too
bad<00:01:46.530> for<00:01:46.770> LEDs<00:01:47.659> anyway<00:01:50.600> that's<00:01:51.600> where<00:01:51.869> I'm

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.330 
bad for LEDs anyway that's where I'm
started<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:52.680> I'm<00:01:52.740> gonna<00:01:52.890> put<00:01:53.100> some<00:01:53.250> more
