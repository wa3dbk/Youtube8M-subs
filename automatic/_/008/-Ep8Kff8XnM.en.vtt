hole<00:00:28.230> in<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.500> base<00:00:28.650> they<00:00:29.130> slide<00:00:29.460> around<00:00:29.490> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
hole in the base they slide around the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.479 
hole in the base they slide around the
spine<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:31.380> clamp<00:00:31.650> spine<00:00:32.099> back

whatever you want to call it the bar and
I've<00:00:35.370> found<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.420> these<00:00:37.200> are<00:00:37.380> all<00:00:37.469> carpeting

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
I've found that these are all carpeting

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.940 
I've found that these are all carpeting
fence<00:00:38.190> clamps<00:00:38.610> will<00:00:39.120> slide<00:00:39.559> into<00:00:40.559> there

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
fence clamps will slide into there

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.760 
fence clamps will slide into there
nicely<00:00:41.790> now<00:00:42.480> you're<00:00:43.079> saying<00:00:43.260> yeah<00:00:43.530> good<00:00:43.739> on

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that's pretty cool okay so I've now got

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.030 
that's pretty cool okay so I've now got
a<00:01:47.240> clamping<00:01:48.240> system<00:01:48.470> that's<00:01:49.470> gonna<00:01:49.680> hold<00:01:49.830> on

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
a clamping system that's gonna hold on

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.130 
a clamping system that's gonna hold on
really<00:01:50.220> well<00:01:50.540> so<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:53.270> can<00:01:54.270> slide<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.750> along<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
really well so I can slide this along to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.029 
really well so I can slide this along to
any<00:01:55.289> point<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.740> wanted<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.850> drop<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.240> in

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
any point that I wanted to drop that in

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:02.300 
any point that I wanted to drop that in
bring<00:01:59.039> that<00:01:59.160> up<00:01:59.280> tight<00:01:59.520> there<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:01.220> look<00:02:02.220> at

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
bring that up tight there and look at

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.580 
bring that up tight there and look at
that<00:02:03.020> okay

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
that okay

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.310 
that okay
it's<00:02:05.100> got<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> hold<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.820> top<00:02:06.660> and<00:02:06.690> bottom<00:02:07.020> now

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
it's got a hold of it top and bottom now

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.930 
it's got a hold of it top and bottom now
what<00:02:07.500> did<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.619> say<00:02:07.800> before<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:08.160> said<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.640> even

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
what did I say before I said I can even

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.609 
what did I say before I said I can even
clamp<00:02:09.270> underneath<00:02:09.600> here<00:02:09.899> which<00:02:10.380> is<00:02:10.500> pretty

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
clamp underneath here which is pretty

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.320 
clamp underneath here which is pretty
amazing

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
amazing

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.220 
amazing
there<00:02:12.330> we<00:02:12.420> go<00:02:12.600> slide<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.140> into<00:02:13.290> there<00:02:15.230> type

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
there we go slide that into there type

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.330 
there we go slide that into there type
them<00:02:16.380> up<00:02:17.630> not<00:02:18.630> going<00:02:18.810> anywhere

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
them up not going anywhere

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.550 
them up not going anywhere

for you guys in America and be much
shorter<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.950> would<00:03:05.130> have<00:03:05.250> grabbed<00:03:05.430> it

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
shorter and I would have grabbed it

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.370 
shorter and I would have grabbed it
there<00:03:05.790> or<00:03:05.970> I<00:03:06.030> can<00:03:06.329> take<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.720> fence<00:03:06.930> clamp<00:03:07.200> off

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
there or I can take the fence clamp off

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.560 
there or I can take the fence clamp off
from<00:03:07.769> down<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.100> end<00:03:08.280> there<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.730> bring<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.450> up

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
from down the end there and bring it up

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.100 
from down the end there and bring it up
to<00:03:09.690> this<00:03:09.780> point<00:03:09.870> here<00:03:10.320> now<00:03:10.400> let's<00:03:11.400> do<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:12.110> the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
to this point here now let's do it the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.390 
to this point here now let's do it the
reason<00:03:13.380> I'm<00:03:13.470> doing<00:03:13.500> that<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.920> because<00:03:14.070> there

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
reason I'm doing that is because there

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:28.750 
reason I'm doing that is because there
could<00:03:14.459> be<00:03:14.549> a<00:03:14.640> wobble<00:03:14.910> there<00:03:15.030> I'll<00:03:15.450> fix<00:03:15.989> that

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.160 

tighten<00:03:29.760> him<00:03:29.850> up<00:03:29.910> how<00:03:30.750> cool<00:03:31.020> is<00:03:31.140> that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
tighten him up how cool is that

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.790 
tighten him up how cool is that
brilliant<00:03:32.300> let's<00:03:33.300> give<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.510> a<00:03:33.630> try<00:03:33.810> let's<00:03:34.650> give

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
brilliant let's give it a try let's give

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.490 
brilliant let's give it a try let's give
it<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.920> try<00:03:35.070> with<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.360> sander<00:03:37.050> now<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.290> last

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
it a try with the sander now the last

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.850 
it a try with the sander now the last
time<00:03:37.800> I<00:03:38.010> had<00:03:38.250> got<00:03:38.460> this<00:03:38.580> down<00:03:38.850> -<00:03:39.180> I<00:03:39.590> think<00:03:40.590> I'd

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
time I had got this down - I think I'd

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.830 
time I had got this down - I think I'd
sanded<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.310> down<00:03:41.370> to<00:03:41.670> 120<00:03:42.150> I've<00:03:42.240> got<00:03:42.360> some<00:03:42.510> 180

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
sanded it down to 120 I've got some 180

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.440 
sanded it down to 120 I've got some 180
grit<00:03:43.050> in<00:03:43.170> there<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.710> I've<00:03:44.130> got<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.670> blue<00:03:45.150> head

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
grit in there and I've got the blue head

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.610 
grit in there and I've got the blue head
in<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:46.200> little<00:03:46.650> Festool<00:03:47.240> ETS<00:03:48.240> 5<00:03:48.600> because<00:03:49.470> the

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
in the little Festool ETS 5 because the

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.800 
in the little Festool ETS 5 because the
blue<00:03:49.770> head<00:03:50.010> won't<00:03:50.460> let<00:03:50.850> any<00:03:51.060> roll<00:03:51.240> happen<00:03:51.630> it's

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
blue head won't let any roll happen it's

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.840 
blue head won't let any roll happen it's
a<00:03:51.870> dead<00:03:52.050> flat<00:03:52.230> situation<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:52.950> also<00:03:53.730> I've<00:03:53.820> got

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
a dead flat situation and also I've got

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.120 
a dead flat situation and also I've got
it<00:03:54.120> hooked<00:03:54.240> up<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:54.750> my<00:03:55.020> overhead<00:03:55.530> dust<00:03:55.770> system

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
it hooked up to my overhead dust system

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.420 
it hooked up to my overhead dust system
I<00:03:56.390> did<00:03:57.390> have<00:03:57.600> it<00:03:57.720> hooked<00:03:57.840> up<00:03:58.050> to<00:03:58.110> a<00:03:58.560> bag<00:03:59.130> on<00:03:59.340> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
I did have it hooked up to a bag on the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.850 
I did have it hooked up to a bag on the
end<00:03:59.460> and<00:03:59.900> whilst<00:04:00.900> that's<00:04:01.110> how<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.350> was<00:04:01.650> just

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
end and whilst that's how I was just

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.170 
end and whilst that's how I was just
basically<00:04:02.010> showing<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.610> portability<00:04:02.970> of

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
basically showing the portability of

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.900 
basically showing the portability of
that<00:04:03.450> bag<00:04:03.950> it's<00:04:04.950> always<00:04:05.400> better<00:04:05.610> with<00:04:05.850> the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
that bag it's always better with the

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:24.240 
that bag it's always better with the
dust<00:04:06.090> extractor<00:04:06.480> so<00:04:06.930> let's<00:04:07.140> give<00:04:07.260> it<00:04:07.290> a<00:04:07.380> try

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.050 

okay

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.700 

then<00:04:28.600> off

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.460 

what<00:04:32.710> obeys<00:04:33.160> my<00:04:33.370> every<00:04:33.400> command<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:35.050> how<00:04:35.200> good

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
what obeys my every command and how good

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.190 
what obeys my every command and how good
it<00:04:35.530> is<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:36.070> hailed<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:36.790> perfectly<00:04:37.240> I<00:04:37.480> wasn't

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
it is that hailed it perfectly I wasn't

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.840
