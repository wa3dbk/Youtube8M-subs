natural<00:01:41.220> expansion<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.820> tank<00:01:42.479> play<00:01:42.720> can

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
natural expansion and tank play can

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.359 
natural expansion and tank play can
become<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.409> important<00:01:43.770> there<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.070> well<00:01:44.250> as

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
become really important there as well as

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.740 
become really important there as well as
both<00:01:44.640> players<00:01:44.909> try<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> control<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.720> area

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
both players try to control that area

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.780 
both players try to control that area
because<00:01:46.409> if<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.979> get<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.130> couple<00:01:47.310> of<00:01:47.430> tanks<00:01:47.670> up

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
because if you get a couple of tanks up

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.219 
because if you get a couple of tanks up
there<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.180> some<00:01:48.540> anti-air<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.140> can

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
there and some anti-air you can

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.620 
there and some anti-air you can
effectively<00:01:49.649> stop<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.729> other<00:01:51.149> player<00:01:51.420> from

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
effectively stop the other player from

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.090 
effectively stop the other player from
mining<00:01:52.200> from<00:01:52.350> their<00:01:52.470> natural<00:01:52.649> which<00:01:52.950> would

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
mining from their natural which would

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.609 
mining from their natural which would
set<00:01:53.280> them<00:01:53.399> back<00:01:53.640> highly<00:01:54.360> while<00:01:55.229> both<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.470> these

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
set them back highly while both of these

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.230 
set them back highly while both of these

reason why you do that is because if you

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.920 
reason why you do that is because if you
do<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.790> correctly<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.269> you<00:03:15.480> mind<00:03:15.690> gas

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
do it correctly and you mind gas

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.630 
do it correctly and you mind gas
immediately<00:03:16.650> after<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.220> refinery<00:03:17.579> is

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
immediately after the refinery is

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.460 
immediately after the refinery is
complete<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.660> moment<00:03:18.959> your<00:03:19.110> barracks<00:03:19.380> is

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
complete the moment your barracks is

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.930 
complete the moment your barracks is
complete<00:03:19.829> you'll<00:03:19.950> have<00:03:20.100> enough<00:03:20.370> resources<00:03:20.790> to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
complete you'll have enough resources to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.030 
complete you'll have enough resources to
build<00:03:21.120> your<00:03:21.329> first<00:03:21.510> Factory<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:22.709> it's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
build your first Factory so it's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.860 
build your first Factory so it's
basically<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.640> way<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.820> get<00:03:24.060> tech<00:03:24.360> up<00:03:24.600> the

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
basically the way you get tech up the

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.930 
basically the way you get tech up the
fastest<00:03:25.350> as<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> Terran<00:03:25.829> player<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.760> want

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
fastest as a Terran player and you want

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.789 
fastest as a Terran player and you want
to<00:03:27.000> do<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.269> against<00:03:28.260> Terran<00:03:28.560> players

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
to do that against Terran players

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.770 
to do that against Terran players
especially<00:03:29.340> but<00:03:29.459> an<00:03:29.670> Olfa<00:03:30.060> often<00:03:30.420> against

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780

star<00:04:45.000> ports<00:04:45.360> so<00:04:45.450> he's<00:04:45.600> going<00:04:45.750> one<00:04:45.990> factory<00:04:46.380> in

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
star ports so he's going one factory in

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.320 
star ports so he's going one factory in
to<00:04:46.620> start<00:04:46.800> port<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.280> this<00:04:47.820> is<00:04:47.940> also<00:04:48.150> a

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
to start port and this is also a

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.820 
to start port and this is also a
certainly<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:48.840> variation<00:04:49.380> that's<00:04:49.560> quite

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
certainly a variation that's quite

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.160 
certainly a variation that's quite
common<00:04:50.280> with<00:04:50.700> with<00:04:51.330> Terran<00:04:51.660> players<00:04:51.900> although

common with with Terran players although

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:53.570 
common with with Terran players although
it's<00:04:52.290> not<00:04:52.440> as<00:04:52.620> standard<00:04:53.010> as<00:04:53.130> going<00:04:53.400> for

it's not as standard as going for

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
three factories nada will be a little

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:59.660 
three factories nada will be a little
bit<00:04:58.530> behind<00:04:58.770> in<00:04:58.920> his<00:04:59.070> factory<00:04:59.370> units<00:04:59.580> of

bit behind in his factory units of

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.550 
bit behind in his factory units of
course<00:04:59.850> but<00:05:00.030> he<00:05:00.420> will<00:05:00.750> get<00:05:00.960> some<00:05:01.140> rates<00:05:01.350> out<00:05:01.530> I

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
course but he will get some rates out I

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.080 
course but he will get some rates out I
believe<00:05:01.710> he<00:05:02.340> could<00:05:02.490> be<00:05:02.580> going<00:05:02.670> for<00:05:02.790> a<00:05:02.910> vulture

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
believe he could be going for a vulture

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.850 
believe he could be going for a vulture
drop<00:05:03.390> but<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.750> more<00:05:04.050> likely<00:05:04.320> case<00:05:04.500> is<00:05:04.680> going

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
drop but the more likely case is going

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.980 
drop but the more likely case is going
for<00:05:05.070> rates<00:05:05.280> and<00:05:05.550> for<00:05:06.150> some<00:05:06.300> harassment<00:05:06.810> early

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
for rates and for some harassment early

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.420 
for rates and for some harassment early
on<00:05:07.140> and<00:05:07.410> this<00:05:07.530> might<00:05:07.740> play<00:05:07.920> into<00:05:08.130> his<00:05:08.220> hands

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
on and this might play into his hands

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.340 
on and this might play into his hands
here<00:05:08.630> play<00:05:09.630> right<00:05:09.810> into<00:05:09.930> his<00:05:10.110> hands<00:05:10.260> because

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
here play right into his hands because

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.320 
here play right into his hands because
boxer<00:05:10.830> is<00:05:11.010> looking<00:05:11.670> like<00:05:11.790> he's<00:05:11.850> going<00:05:12.150> for<00:05:12.270> a

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
boxer is looking like he's going for a

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.940 
boxer is looking like he's going for a
double<00:05:12.450> expand<00:05:12.900> here<00:05:13.110> that's<00:05:13.350> my<00:05:13.470> guess<00:05:13.740> right

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:13.950 
double expand here that's my guess right

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.350 
double expand here that's my guess right
now<00:05:13.980> it<00:05:14.160> might<00:05:14.280> be<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.430> little<00:05:14.550> of<00:05:14.700> a<00:05:14.790> bit<00:05:15.210> of<00:05:15.300> a

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
now it might be a little of a bit of a

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.120 
now it might be a little of a bit of a
preliminary<00:05:15.660> guess<00:05:16.050> but<00:05:16.350> there's<00:05:16.860> no<00:05:17.010> other

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
preliminary guess but there's no other

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.740 
preliminary guess but there's no other
reason<00:05:17.430> why<00:05:17.520> boxer<00:05:17.910> would<00:05:18.030> be<00:05:18.150> creating<00:05:18.570> his

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
reason why boxer would be creating his

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.110 
reason why boxer would be creating his
uh<00:05:19.010> constructing<00:05:20.010> his<00:05:20.130> command<00:05:20.460> center<00:05:20.790> at

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
uh constructing his command center at

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.030 
uh constructing his command center at
that<00:05:21.300> awkward<00:05:21.510> position<00:05:22.170> to<00:05:22.290> the<00:05:22.410> to<00:05:22.860> the

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
that awkward position to the to the

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.380 
that awkward position to the to the
right<00:05:23.250> there<00:05:23.490> if<00:05:23.640> he<00:05:23.700> wasn't<00:05:24.180> thinking<00:05:24.240> about

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
right there if he wasn't thinking about

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.030 
right there if he wasn't thinking about
floating<00:05:24.720> into<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.050> mineral<00:05:25.260> only<00:05:25.500> and<00:05:25.830> hence

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
floating into the mineral only and hence

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.920 
floating into the mineral only and hence
getting<00:05:26.790> another<00:05:27.000> expansion<00:05:27.330> and<00:05:27.750> his

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
getting another expansion and his

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.510 
getting another expansion and his
natural<00:05:28.380> this<00:05:28.650> is<00:05:28.710> gonna<00:05:28.860> be<00:05:28.950> really<00:05:29.160> risky

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
natural this is gonna be really risky

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.650 
natural this is gonna be really risky
for<00:05:29.670> boxer<00:05:29.970> though<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:30.150> don't<00:05:30.360> see<00:05:30.510> any

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
for boxer though I don't see any

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.480 
for boxer though I don't see any
additional<00:05:30.900> factories<00:05:31.500> or<00:05:31.620> tech<00:05:31.800> so<00:05:32.190> I<00:05:32.220> have

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
additional factories or tech so I have

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:33.650 
additional factories or tech so I have
to<00:05:32.640> assume<00:05:32.730> he's<00:05:33.000> me<00:05:33.150> going<00:05:33.390> for<00:05:33.510> a<00:05:33.540> double

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 
to assume he's me going for a double

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.540 
to assume he's me going for a double
expand<00:05:34.110> and<00:05:34.320> I<00:05:34.680> have<00:05:34.770> to<00:05:34.860> say<00:05:34.980> a<00:05:35.010> double<00:05:35.220> expand

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
expand and I have to say a double expand

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.970 
expand and I have to say a double expand
is<00:05:35.730> really<00:05:36.180> risky<00:05:36.330> against<00:05:36.810> a<00:05:36.930> fast<00:05:37.470> tech<00:05:37.740> here

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:37.980 
is really risky against a fast tech here

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:40.640 
is really risky against a fast tech here
especially<00:05:38.790> we're<00:05:39.600> not<00:05:39.810> as<00:05:39.960> going<00:05:40.200> forward<00:05:40.560> a

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
especially we're not as going forward a

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
especially we're not as going forward a
fast<00:05:40.890> rate<00:05:41.220> tag

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:41.670 
fast rate tag

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.400 
fast rate tag
I<00:05:41.700> think<00:05:42.000> boxer<00:05:42.300> is<00:05:42.360> just<00:05:42.540> to<00:05:42.600> me<00:05:42.720> big<00:05:43.080> trouble

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
I think boxer is just to me big trouble

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:45.470 
I think boxer is just to me big trouble
so<00:05:43.620> far<00:05:43.830> working<00:05:44.190> off<00:05:44.280> of<00:05:44.430> one<00:05:44.580> factory<00:05:45.000> with<00:05:45.450> a

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
so far working off of one factory with a

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.780 
so far working off of one factory with a
machine<00:05:45.810> shop<00:05:46.040> really<00:05:47.040> not<00:05:47.250> getting<00:05:47.430> a<00:05:47.520> second

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:47.790 
machine shop really not getting a second

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.450 
machine shop really not getting a second
factory<00:05:48.120> down<00:05:48.300> so<00:05:48.680> really<00:05:49.680> I<00:05:49.830> feel<00:05:50.280> like

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
factory down so really I feel like

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.950 
factory down so really I feel like
Nonna's<00:05:50.850> can<00:05:50.970> have<00:05:51.090> an<00:05:51.150> advantage<00:05:51.330> here<00:05:51.540> if<00:05:51.870> he

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
Nonna's can have an advantage here if he

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.190 
Nonna's can have an advantage here if he
plays<00:05:52.169> it<00:05:52.320> off<00:05:52.440> well<00:05:52.680> and<00:05:53.900> right<00:05:54.900> now<00:05:55.020> we're

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:55.200 
plays it off well and right now we're

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.030 
plays it off well and right now we're
seeing<00:05:55.380> not<00:05:55.830> up<00:05:56.010> moving<00:05:56.730> out<00:05:56.850> with<00:05:57.030> his<00:05:57.210> um<00:05:57.510> his

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
seeing not up moving out with his um his

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.680 
seeing not up moving out with his um his
two<00:05:59.040> Marines<00:05:59.370> and<00:05:59.610> a<00:05:59.700> tank<00:05:59.880> here<00:06:00.120> and<00:06:00.300> he's

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
two Marines and a tank here and he's

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.600 
two Marines and a tank here and he's
gonna<00:06:00.840> set<00:06:01.050> down<00:06:01.169> his<00:06:01.380> command<00:06:01.710> center<00:06:02.010> boxing

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
gonna set down his command center boxing

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:03.980 
gonna set down his command center boxing
meanwhile<00:06:02.880> I<00:06:02.910> was<00:06:02.970> committed<00:06:03.330> to<00:06:03.360> a<00:06:03.450> lot<00:06:03.870> of

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
meanwhile I was committed to a lot of

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.720 
meanwhile I was committed to a lot of
vultures<00:06:04.169> and<00:06:04.560> now<00:06:04.919> he's<00:06:05.100> building<00:06:05.280> a<00:06:05.460> second

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
vultures and now he's building a second

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.240 
vultures and now he's building a second
expansion<00:06:06.180> at<00:06:06.720> his<00:06:07.050> natural<00:06:07.230> expansion<00:06:07.680> now<00:06:08.220> I

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250 
expansion at his natural expansion now I

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:09.440 
expansion at his natural expansion now I

Ultra mines here so
rocks<00:06:41.070> are<00:06:41.220> actually<00:06:41.310> incorrectly

rocks are actually incorrectly

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.820 
rocks are actually incorrectly
calculating<00:06:42.540> what<00:06:42.660> what<00:06:43.110> nada<00:06:43.290> was<00:06:43.470> gonna<00:06:43.590> do

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
calculating what what nada was gonna do

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.980 
calculating what what nada was gonna do
if<00:06:44.010> Nana<00:06:44.460> was<00:06:44.670> going<00:06:44.820> for<00:06:45.000> a<00:06:45.030> tank<00:06:45.480> build<00:06:45.720> here

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:45.990 
if Nana was going for a tank build here

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:48.260 
if Nana was going for a tank build here
at<00:06:46.080> an<00:06:46.170> early<00:06:46.530> tank<00:06:46.770> push<00:06:47.070> boxers<00:06:47.880> build<00:06:48.090> would

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
at an early tank push boxers build would

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.150 
at an early tank push boxers build would
have<00:06:48.360> been<00:06:48.450> quite<00:06:48.720> good<00:06:48.750> because<00:06:49.260> his<00:06:49.620> vulture

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
have been quite good because his vulture

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.410 
have been quite good because his vulture
Minds<00:06:50.370> would<00:06:50.550> have<00:06:50.640> prevented<00:06:50.910> the<00:06:51.120> tanks

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:51.420 
Minds would have prevented the tanks

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.670 
Minds would have prevented the tanks
from<00:06:51.480> getting<00:06:51.780> down<00:06:51.900> here<00:06:52.110> but<00:06:52.440> now<00:06:52.560> it<00:06:52.620> has

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
from getting down here but now it has

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.200 
from getting down here but now it has
done<00:06:53.010> the<00:06:53.130> opposite<00:06:53.520> not<00:06:53.700> has<00:06:53.820> gone<00:06:53.970> for<00:06:54.150> a

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.210 
done the opposite not has gone for a

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.910 
done the opposite not has gone for a
fast<00:06:54.450> air<00:06:54.690> build<00:06:55.020> here<00:06:55.200> I<00:06:55.350> think<00:06:55.710> this<00:06:55.770> is

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920 
fast air build here I think this is

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.920 
fast air build here I think this is
gonna<00:06:56.070> play<00:06:56.220> right<00:06:56.460> into<00:06:56.640> basically<00:06:57.390> play

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
gonna play right into basically play

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.780 
gonna play right into basically play
into<00:06:58.230> not<00:06:58.380> as<00:06:58.500> a<00:06:58.530> Vantage<00:06:58.920> er<00:06:59.070> cuz<00:06:59.430> he<00:06:59.520> hidden

00:06:59.780 --> 00:06:59.790 
into not as a Vantage er cuz he hidden

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:01.550 
into not as a Vantage er cuz he hidden
he<00:07:00.330> will<00:07:00.510> be<00:07:00.600> able<00:07:00.690> to<00:07:00.810> harass<00:07:00.990> quite<00:07:01.320> well

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
he will be able to harass quite well

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.350 
he will be able to harass quite well
against<00:07:02.160> boxer<00:07:02.550> not<00:07:02.760> is<00:07:02.850> now<00:07:02.970> moving<00:07:03.180> out

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
against boxer not is now moving out

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.730 
against boxer not is now moving out
after<00:07:03.630> the<00:07:03.720> second<00:07:04.020> rate<00:07:04.110> this<00:07:04.230> done<00:07:04.380> I<00:07:04.560> don't

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
after the second rate this done I don't

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.920 
after the second rate this done I don't
see<00:07:05.130> any<00:07:05.280> anti-air<00:07:05.700> inside<00:07:06.090> a<00:07:06.120> boxer<00:07:06.480> space<00:07:06.690> so

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:06.930 
see any anti-air inside a boxer space so

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.900 
see any anti-air inside a boxer space so
far<00:07:07.170> I<00:07:07.470> don't<00:07:07.770> even<00:07:07.830> see<00:07:08.040> an<00:07:08.100> armory<00:07:08.460> and<00:07:08.670> I

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
far I don't even see an armory and I

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.400 
far I don't even see an armory and I
actually<00:07:09.060> don't<00:07:09.270> even<00:07:09.480> see<00:07:09.600> a<00:07:09.630> second<00:07:10.020> factory

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.410 
actually don't even see a second factory

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.380 
actually don't even see a second factory
so<00:07:10.920> boxer<00:07:11.640> could<00:07:11.790> be<00:07:11.880> in<00:07:11.970> really<00:07:12.210> big<00:07:12.330> trouble

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:12.390 
so boxer could be in really big trouble

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.600 
so boxer could be in really big trouble
here<00:07:12.870> and<00:07:13.200> of<00:07:13.290> course<00:07:13.500> the<00:07:13.620> cloaking<00:07:14.250> is<00:07:14.340> gonna

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
here and of course the cloaking is gonna

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.670 
here and of course the cloaking is gonna
be<00:07:14.700> up<00:07:14.880> so<00:07:15.120> he's<00:07:15.840> gonna<00:07:15.960> be<00:07:16.050> further<00:07:16.320> trouble

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 
be up so he's gonna be further trouble

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.110 
be up so he's gonna be further trouble
once<00:07:16.860> these<00:07:17.010> rates<00:07:17.280> get<00:07:17.490> cloaked<00:07:17.790> and<00:07:17.970> looks

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.120 
once these rates get cloaked and looks

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.580 
once these rates get cloaked and looks
like<00:07:18.180> boxer<00:07:18.540> is<00:07:18.660> gonna<00:07:18.900> finish<00:07:19.110> his<00:07:19.290> armor

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:19.590 
like boxer is gonna finish his armor

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.960 
like boxer is gonna finish his armor
here<00:07:19.830> but<00:07:20.190> he's<00:07:20.280> still<00:07:20.460> working<00:07:20.730> off<00:07:20.820> with

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:20.970 
here but he's still working off with

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.390 
here but he's still working off with
just<00:07:21.150> one<00:07:21.270> factory<00:07:21.690> here<00:07:22.130> because<00:07:23.130> he<00:07:23.280> has

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
just one factory here because he has

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.500 
just one factory here because he has
saved<00:07:23.670> the<00:07:23.760> minerals<00:07:24.090> for<00:07:24.240> a<00:07:24.270> second

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:24.510 
saved the minerals for a second

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.270 
saved the minerals for a second
expansion<00:07:24.750> and<00:07:25.140> now<00:07:25.350> boxer<00:07:25.710> has<00:07:25.890> spotted<00:07:26.130> the

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 
expansion and now boxer has spotted the

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.710 
expansion and now boxer has spotted the
two<00:07:26.430> rates<00:07:26.670> coming<00:07:26.910> in<00:07:27.060> here<00:07:27.270> they're<00:07:27.630> gonna

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:27.720 
two rates coming in here they're gonna

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.000 
two rates coming in here they're gonna
pick<00:07:27.900> off<00:07:27.990> the<00:07:28.110> two<00:07:28.260> marines<00:07:28.560> quite<00:07:28.800> easily
