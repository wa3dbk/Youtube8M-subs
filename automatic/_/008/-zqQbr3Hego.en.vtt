the<00:03:15.720> turtle<00:03:15.959> beaches<00:03:18.049> well<00:03:19.049> this<00:03:19.200> was<00:03:19.380> my

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
the turtle beaches well this was my

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.140 
the turtle beaches well this was my
think<00:03:19.829> this<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.040> like<00:03:20.160> my<00:03:20.280> second<00:03:20.700> game<00:03:20.850> using

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
think this is like my second game using

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
them so i'll still again used to it but

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.780 
them so i'll still again used to it but
since<00:03:23.549> then<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.959> i<00:03:25.380> use<00:03:26.070> ninja<00:03:26.519> with<00:03:26.670> my
