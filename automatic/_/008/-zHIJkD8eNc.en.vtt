would be my guess and then the third

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.120 
would be my guess and then the third
thing<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.549> intelligence<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
questions you ask him because what you

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.969 
questions you ask him because what you

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
have now you need to take advantage of a

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.139 
have now you need to take advantage of a
wealth<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.579> knowledge<00:01:59.820> in<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.409> head<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.880> take

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
wealth of knowledge in that head so take

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.359 
wealth of knowledge in that head so take
advantage<00:02:03.180> of<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.409> brings<00:02:04.829> me<00:02:05.040> I

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
advantage of that so that brings me I

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.869 
advantage of that so that brings me I
often<00:02:05.640> get<00:02:05.880> asked<00:02:06.180> well<00:02:06.619> Kevin<00:02:07.619> what<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.550> it
