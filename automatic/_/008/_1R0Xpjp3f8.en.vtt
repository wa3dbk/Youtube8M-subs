putting your filter it has a few
purposes<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.920> will<00:00:14.240> remove<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.509> tenants<00:00:16.080> from

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260

the<00:00:16.379> water<00:00:16.560> it's<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.699> what<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.539> polisher<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:20.039> what

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the water it's a what a polisher so what

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.550 
the water it's a what a polisher so what
it<00:00:20.340> does<00:00:20.910> for<00:00:21.180> your<00:00:21.300> tank<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.810> that<00:00:22.050> it<00:00:22.320> will

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
it does for your tank is that it will

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.529 
it does for your tank is that it will
give<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.890> an<00:00:23.010> appearance<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.880> crystal-clear

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
give it an appearance of a crystal-clear

water<00:00:24.930> by<00:00:25.590> removing<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.609> tenants<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.140> that

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
water by removing the tenants so that

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.279 
water by removing the tenants so that
you<00:00:28.500> don't<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:29.010> the<00:00:29.369> cup<00:00:30.210> of<00:00:30.359> tea<00:00:30.539> look<00:00:30.840> in

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
you don't get the cup of tea look in

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.530 
you don't get the cup of tea look in
your<00:00:31.500> tank<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.669> removes<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.239> brown

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
your tank it just removes that brown

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.400 
your tank it just removes that brown
stain<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.980> other<00:00:35.130> thing<00:00:35.430> that<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.850> does<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
stain the other thing that it does is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.010 
stain the other thing that it does is
removes<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.770> nitrous<00:00:38.550> waste<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
removes the nitrous waste so when it

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.220 
removes the nitrous waste so when it
captures<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.500> nitrous<00:00:41.309> waste<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:42.570> prevents

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
captures the nitrous waste it prevents

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.240 
captures the nitrous waste it prevents
the<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:44.219> turning<00:00:44.700> into<00:00:45.050> ammonia<00:00:46.050> nitrate<00:00:46.950> and

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
the it turning into ammonia nitrate and

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.950 
the it turning into ammonia nitrate and
nitrite<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:49.700> ammonia<00:00:50.700> nitrate<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.449> nitrite

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
nitrite the ammonia nitrate and nitrite

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080 
nitrite the ammonia nitrate and nitrite
isn't<00:00:52.559> really<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.250> best<00:00:53.460> thing<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.969> can

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
isn't really the best thing that you can

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.020 
isn't really the best thing that you can
have<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.300> your<00:00:54.420> tank<00:00:55.100> what<00:00:56.100> will<00:00:56.250> actually<00:00:56.399> do

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
have in your tank what will actually do

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.319 
have in your tank what will actually do
is<00:00:57.300> ammonia<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:59.010> toxic<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.730> high<00:00:59.910> levels

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
is ammonia can be toxic in high levels

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.229 
is ammonia can be toxic in high levels
what<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> also<00:01:01.620> does<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.550> means<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.149> you

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
what it also does is it means that you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.090 
what it also does is it means that you
can<00:01:03.390> do<00:01:03.539> one<00:01:03.750> or<00:01:03.780> two<00:01:03.899> things<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.589> can<00:01:04.949> either

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
can do one or two things you can either

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.179 
can do one or two things you can either
have<00:01:05.549> more<00:01:06.090> fish<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> tank<00:01:06.659> or

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
have more fish in the tank or

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.010 
have more fish in the tank or
alternatively<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.549> other<00:01:08.700> thing<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.810> it

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
alternatively the other thing is that it

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.789 
alternatively the other thing is that it
reduces<00:01:10.830> our<00:01:11.040> need<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> do<00:01:11.790> water<00:01:12.390> changes<00:01:12.799> so

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
reduces our need to do water changes so

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
reduces our need to do water changes so
the<00:01:13.920> good<00:01:14.070> thing<00:01:14.250> about<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
the good thing about it is that if you

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.560 
the good thing about it is that if you
don't<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.590> an<00:01:16.680> overly<00:01:17.040> stocked<00:01:17.340> fish<00:01:18.270> tank

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
don't have an overly stocked fish tank

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.350 
don't have an overly stocked fish tank
then<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.710> option<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.400> where<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.030> don't<00:01:21.240> have

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
then the option of where you don't have

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.080 
then the option of where you don't have
to<00:01:21.479> do<00:01:21.630> water<00:01:21.869> changes<00:01:22.049> as<00:01:22.799> often<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.759> still

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
to do water changes as often and still

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.510 
to do water changes as often and still
have<00:01:24.299> crystal-clear<00:01:24.960> water<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:26.189> great

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
have crystal-clear water and a great

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.569 
have crystal-clear water and a great
environment<00:01:26.850> for<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.479> fish<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:27.689> living<00:01:28.579> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
environment for the fish to living the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.850 
environment for the fish to living the
there<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.390> three<00:01:30.689> different<00:01:31.079> sizes<00:01:31.290> there's

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
there is three different sizes there's

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.749 
there is three different sizes there's
the<00:01:32.600> 350<00:01:33.600> ml<00:01:34.700> 600<00:01:35.700> ml<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.180> 2<00:01:36.570> liters<00:01:37.759> basically

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the 350 ml 600 ml and 2 liters basically

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.929 
the 350 ml 600 ml and 2 liters basically
all<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.060> do<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:40.159> put<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.460> resin<00:01:42.240> into<00:01:42.899> a

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
all you do is put the resin into a

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.139 
all you do is put the resin into a
filter<00:01:44.939> bag<00:01:45.210> now<00:01:46.200> these<00:01:46.590> bags<00:01:46.979> we<00:01:47.399> supply<00:01:47.790> one

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
filter bag now these bags we supply one

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.069 
filter bag now these bags we supply one
with<00:01:48.329> each<00:01:48.509> item<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:50.119> as<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.299> can<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.689> there

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
with each item and as you can see there

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.340 
with each item and as you can see there
it<00:01:53.040> allows<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:54.119> water<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.479> penetrate<00:01:54.630> through

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
it allows the water to penetrate through

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.580 
it allows the water to penetrate through
and<00:01:55.939> allows<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.299> micropore<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.079> do<00:01:58.200> its<00:01:58.350> job

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and allows the micropore to do its job

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.560 
and allows the micropore to do its job
as<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.820> see<00:02:00.060> like<00:02:01.430> 350<00:02:02.430> mils<00:02:02.850> will<00:02:03.270> easily

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
as you can see like 350 mils will easily

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.850 
as you can see like 350 mils will easily
fit<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.229> bag<00:02:05.960> same<00:02:06.960> six<00:02:07.380> hundred<00:02:07.680> mils

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
fit in the bag same six hundred mils

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.270 
fit in the bag same six hundred mils
will<00:02:08.190> easily<00:02:08.399> fit<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> bag<00:02:09.619> for<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.830> two

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
will easily fit in the bag for the two

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.490 
will easily fit in the bag for the two
leaders<00:02:11.550> probably<00:02:12.180> suggest<00:02:12.569> getting<00:02:12.750> two

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
leaders probably suggest getting two

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.550 
leaders probably suggest getting two
maybe<00:02:14.100> three<00:02:14.490> bags<00:02:16.520> obviously<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:18.480> empty<00:02:18.960> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
maybe three bags obviously you empty the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.330 
maybe three bags obviously you empty the

what's<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.420> container<00:02:21.570> into<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.380> resin

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
what's in the container into the resin

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.160 
what's in the container into the resin
bag<00:02:23.450> it's<00:02:24.450> very<00:02:24.810> simple<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.470> use<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:26.040> it<00:02:26.850> is

with bleach and then you basically pop

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.640 
with bleach and then you basically pop
it<00:03:11.430> back<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.790> for<00:03:12.120> use<00:03:12.480> again<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.260> takes<00:03:13.470> about

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
it back in for use again it takes about

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.150

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
put it in a canister it's a good idea to

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.750 
put it in a canister it's a good idea to
get<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.350> little<00:03:19.530> bit<00:03:19.739> more<00:03:19.950> so<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.310> way<00:03:20.580> you

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
get a little bit more so that way you

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.759 
get a little bit more so that way you
can<00:03:20.880> cycle<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.420> and<00:03:21.660> what<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:21.780> mean<00:03:21.989> by<00:03:22.050> cycle

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
can cycle it and what I mean by cycle

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.060 
can cycle it and what I mean by cycle
you<00:03:23.400> have<00:03:23.640> one<00:03:23.820> lot<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.239> or<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.110> where<00:03:25.260> it<00:03:25.380> gets

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you have one lot in or and where it gets

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.580 
you have one lot in or and where it gets
used<00:03:26.400> up<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.970> needs<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.330> be<00:03:27.420> recharged<00:03:28.200> you

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
used up and needs to be recharged you

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.430 
used up and needs to be recharged you
can<00:03:28.739> remove<00:03:29.100> one<00:03:29.489> put<00:03:30.330> in<00:03:30.450> the<00:03:30.570> next<00:03:30.750> one<00:03:30.900> and

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
can remove one put in the next one and

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.370 
can remove one put in the next one and
continue<00:03:32.340> on<00:03:32.519> so<00:03:33.120> rather<00:03:33.330> than<00:03:33.540> having<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:34.050> re

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
continue on so rather than having to re

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.530 
continue on so rather than having to re
open<00:03:34.709> up<00:03:34.860> your<00:03:35.040> canister<00:03:35.340> 24<00:03:36.060> hours<00:03:36.239> later

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
open up your canister 24 hours later

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.960
