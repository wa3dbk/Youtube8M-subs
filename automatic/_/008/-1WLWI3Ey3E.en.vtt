see<00:02:24.550> the<00:02:24.670> other<00:02:24.820> set<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.150> feet<00:02:25.360> so<00:02:25.630> it<00:02:25.690> will

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
see the other set of feet so it will

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.750 
see the other set of feet so it will
become<00:02:26.050> collapsed<00:02:27.040> when<00:02:27.130> it's<00:02:27.310> in<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.460> flying

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
become collapsed when it's in a flying

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.990 
become collapsed when it's in a flying
pose<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:29.710> get<00:02:29.890> secondary<00:02:30.370> joints<00:02:30.820> for<00:02:30.940> the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
pose you get secondary joints for the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.580 
pose you get secondary joints for the
elbows<00:02:31.420> if<00:02:31.660> you<00:02:31.750> want<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:31.960> use<00:02:32.050> those<00:02:32.290> you<00:02:32.320> can

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
elbows if you want to use those you can

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.050 
elbows if you want to use those you can
have<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.740> double<00:02:32.830> jointed<00:02:33.220> elbow<00:02:33.550> it's<00:02:33.970> a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
have a double jointed elbow it's a

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.980 
have a double jointed elbow it's a
little<00:02:34.360> more<00:02:34.480> poseable<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:37.480> have<00:02:37.630> extra

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
little more poseable you have extra

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.600 
little more poseable you have extra
joints<00:02:38.380> for<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.710> display<00:02:39.070> stands<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.580> can

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
joints for the display stands you can

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.700 
joints for the display stands you can
get<00:02:39.760> even<00:02:39.850> more<00:02:39.970> poses<00:02:40.300> out<00:02:40.570> of<00:02:40.690> it<00:02:40.810> and<00:02:41.560> have

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
get even more poses out of it and have

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.380 
get even more poses out of it and have
it<00:02:41.740> connecting<00:02:42.220> in<00:02:42.340> different<00:02:42.670> places

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.630 

you<00:02:46.390> get<00:02:46.600> two<00:02:46.960> swords<00:02:47.470> one<00:02:47.770> that<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.430> meant<00:02:48.610> to

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
you get two swords one that is meant to

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.220 
you get two swords one that is meant to
go<00:02:48.790> forward<00:02:49.180> one<00:02:49.570> that<00:02:49.750> is<00:02:49.840> meant<00:02:49.990> to<00:02:50.050> go

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
go forward one that is meant to go

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.030 
go forward one that is meant to go
backward<00:02:52.020> so<00:02:53.020> the<00:02:53.200> sword<00:02:53.410> does<00:02:53.530> not<00:02:53.650> swivel

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
backward so the sword does not swivel

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.150 
backward so the sword does not swivel
around<00:02:54.310> that<00:02:54.460> it<00:02:54.610> gives<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.850> two<00:02:55.090> shorts<00:02:56.160> you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
around that it gives you two shorts you

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.090 
around that it gives you two shorts you
get<00:02:57.280> another<00:02:57.690> angle<00:02:58.690> pose<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.440> attaches<00:02:59.950> onto

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
get another angle pose it attaches onto

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
get another angle pose it attaches onto
the<00:03:00.310> base<00:03:00.660> you<00:03:01.660> get<00:03:01.840> this<00:03:02.140> thrust<00:03:02.560> or<00:03:02.830> push<00:03:03.130> so

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
the base you get this thrust or push so

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.700 
the base you get this thrust or push so
you<00:03:04.210> can<00:03:04.330> act<00:03:04.450> like<00:03:04.480> it's<00:03:04.720> the<00:03:05.080> Jo<00:03:05.410> T<00:03:05.590> is

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:05.710 
you can act like it's the Jo T is

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.130 
you can act like it's the Jo T is
pushing<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.430> wind<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:09.330> get<00:03:10.330> extra<00:03:10.660> hands

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
pushing to the wind you get extra hands

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.440 
pushing to the wind you get extra hands
this<00:03:11.770> one<00:03:11.950> has<00:03:12.100> a<00:03:12.130> particular<00:03:12.340> plug<00:03:12.970> in<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.270> so

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
this one has a particular plug in it so

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.270 
this one has a particular plug in it so
it<00:03:13.540> can<00:03:13.720> hang<00:03:13.930> onto<00:03:14.080> the<00:03:15.690> box<00:03:16.690> or<00:03:16.960> shield<00:03:19.260> and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
it can hang onto the box or shield and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.710 
it can hang onto the box or shield and
when<00:03:21.280> all<00:03:21.400> said<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.820> done<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:22.210> get<00:03:22.360> four<00:03:22.690> sets

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
when all said and done you get four sets

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.040 
when all said and done you get four sets
of<00:03:23.140> hands<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:24.210> also<00:03:25.210> get<00:03:25.360> this<00:03:25.510> ring<00:03:25.810> which

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
of hands you also get this ring which

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.110 
of hands you also get this ring which
will<00:03:26.230> attach<00:03:26.470> onto<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:26.920> base<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.460> the<00:03:27.880> video

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
will attach onto the base and the video

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.610 
will attach onto the base and the video
game<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.480> has<00:03:28.600> a<00:03:28.630> ring<00:03:28.990> around<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.410> at<00:03:29.500> all

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
game it has a ring around it at all

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.530 
game it has a ring around it at all
times<00:03:29.950> that<00:03:30.550> points<00:03:30.970> in<00:03:31.030> the<00:03:31.090> direction<00:03:31.210> of

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
times that points in the direction of

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.580 
times that points in the direction of
the<00:03:31.660> enemy<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:34.030> in<00:03:34.150> fact<00:03:34.330> it<00:03:34.630> even<00:03:34.660> says<00:03:35.020> enemy

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
the enemy and in fact it even says enemy

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.780 
the enemy and in fact it even says enemy
on<00:03:35.740> it<00:03:35.890> so<00:03:36.010> you<00:03:36.100> can<00:03:36.130> always<00:03:36.370> tell<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.550> enemy

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
on it so you can always tell the enemy

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.640 
on it so you can always tell the enemy
is<00:03:37.060> which<00:03:37.300> is<00:03:37.450> kind<00:03:37.570> of<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.780> nice<00:03:38.020> little<00:03:38.170> detail

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
is which is kind of a nice little detail

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.980 
is which is kind of a nice little detail
effect<00:03:39.160> I<00:03:39.400> also<00:03:40.240> like<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.570> fact<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:40.810> it's

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
effect I also like the fact that it's

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.070 
effect I also like the fact that it's
both<00:03:41.140> clear<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.860> orange<00:03:42.250> you<00:03:42.810> can<00:03:43.810> see<00:03:43.930> there

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
both clear and orange you can see there

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.830 
both clear and orange you can see there
are<00:03:44.170> three<00:03:44.470> holes<00:03:44.770> on<00:03:45.540> different<00:03:46.540> sides<00:03:46.720> of

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
are three holes on different sides of

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.920 
are three holes on different sides of
the<00:03:46.960> Ring<00:03:48.030> those<00:03:49.030> are<00:03:49.180> used<00:03:49.270> to<00:03:49.420> attach<00:03:49.660> these

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
the Ring those are used to attach these

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.550 
the Ring those are used to attach these
the<00:03:50.920> bits<00:03:51.250> that<00:03:51.430> come<00:03:51.580> off<00:03:51.730> the<00:03:51.760> Jehu<00:03:52.060> t<00:03:52.180> itself

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
the bits that come off the Jehu t itself

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.720 
the bits that come off the Jehu t itself
float<00:03:53.560> around<00:03:53.680> it<00:03:53.980> in<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.100> second<00:03:54.430> half<00:03:54.580> of

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
float around it in the second half of

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.780 
float around it in the second half of
zone<00:03:54.970> of<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.120> enders<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.420> second<00:03:55.720> runner<00:03:55.870> and

zone of the enders the second runner and

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.340 
zone of the enders the second runner and
you<00:03:57.790> can<00:03:57.910> floating<00:03:58.330> around<00:03:58.390> like<00:03:58.600> that<00:03:58.780> the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
you can floating around like that the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.530 
you can floating around like that the
thrust<00:03:59.860> that<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:00.610> showed<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.910> early<00:04:01.120> also

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
thrust that I showed you early also

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:07.320 
thrust that I showed you early also
attaches<00:04:02.170> onto<00:04:02.410> that<00:04:02.500> ring<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:06.610> as<00:04:07.030> the<00:04:07.180> ring

attaches onto that ring and as the ring

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.820 
attaches onto that ring and as the ring
sets<00:04:07.600> they're<00:04:07.780> kind<00:04:08.290> two<00:04:08.440> hampers

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
sets they're kind two hampers

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.140 
sets they're kind two hampers
poseability<00:04:09.280> a<00:04:09.490> little<00:04:09.730> because<00:04:09.880> it's<00:04:10.000> not

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
poseability a little because it's not

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.970 
poseability a little because it's not
quite<00:04:10.300> as<00:04:10.450> big<00:04:10.690> as<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:10.959> should<00:04:11.140> be<00:04:11.290> but<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:11.830> can

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
quite as big as it should be but you can

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.790 
quite as big as it should be but you can
work<00:04:12.130> around<00:04:12.250> it<00:04:12.520> it's<00:04:12.670> not<00:04:12.760> that<00:04:12.940> bad<00:04:13.180> just

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
work around it it's not that bad just

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.410 
work around it it's not that bad just
takes<00:04:14.800> a<00:04:14.860> little<00:04:14.950> fiddling<00:04:15.880> with<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.209> get<00:04:16.330> it

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
takes a little fiddling with to get it

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.080 
takes a little fiddling with to get it
just<00:04:16.690> right

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.450 

and<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:22.260> base<00:04:22.470> has<00:04:22.710> no<00:04:22.889> problems<00:04:23.280> whatsoever

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460
