stain a high quality stain so we did
that<00:02:25.470> very<00:02:25.530> first<00:02:26.070> because<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.610> floor<00:02:26.850> is

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that very first because the floor is

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.270 
that very first because the floor is
going<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.240> have<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> lot<00:02:28.350> of<00:02:28.380> wear<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.710> tear<00:02:29.040> on

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
going to have a lot of wear and tear on

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.630 
going to have a lot of wear and tear on

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
three-quarter inch ac plywood which is

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.640 
three-quarter inch ac plywood which is
kind<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.400> expensive<00:02:36.060> but<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:37.080> sure<00:02:37.230> makes<00:02:37.260> a

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
kind of expensive but it sure makes a

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.710 
kind of expensive but it sure makes a
nice<00:02:39.050> material<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.260> work<00:02:40.410> with<00:02:40.470> for<00:02:41.720> making

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720

puncture<00:03:14.910> real<00:03:15.270> easy<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.530> went<00:03:16.739> ahead<00:03:16.800> and

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
puncture real easy so I went ahead and

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.100 
puncture real easy so I went ahead and
coped<00:03:19.380> some<00:03:20.190> two<00:03:20.370> befores<00:03:20.820> on<00:03:21.120> on<00:03:21.420> the<00:03:21.810> flat

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
like that to make it so the two Forge

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.880 
like that to make it so the two Forge
would<00:03:27.090> mount<00:03:27.270> to<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.630> front<00:03:27.959> bars<00:03:28.410> of<00:03:28.770> the

you'll see right here you can tell how I

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.440 
you'll see right here you can tell how I
routed<00:04:42.590> in<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:43.250> side<00:04:43.490> panel<00:04:43.820> for<00:04:44.270> all<00:04:44.330> the

shelves<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:44.990> fit<00:04:45.170> into<00:04:46.180> so<00:04:47.180> they'd<00:04:47.360> slide<00:04:47.720> into

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
shelves to fit into so they'd slide into

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.380 
shelves to fit into so they'd slide into
the<00:04:48.230> holes<00:04:48.380> real<00:04:48.650> nice<00:04:48.940> and<00:04:49.940> glued<00:04:50.210> everything

with adhesive and then on these little

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.390 
with adhesive and then on these little
stops<00:04:54.920> what<00:04:55.730> I<00:04:55.760> did<00:04:56.030> is<00:04:56.270> just<00:04:56.300> used<00:04:57.100> once<00:04:58.100> again

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
then I just got my round over bit Thome

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.600 
then I just got my round over bit Thome
router<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:08.510> just<00:05:08.660> ease<00:05:08.870> that<00:05:09.140> edge<00:05:09.350> off<00:05:09.680> that

doesn't<00:06:13.850> fall<00:06:14.120> off<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:14.419> shelf<00:06:14.600> besides<00:06:15.200> to

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
doesn't fall off the shelf besides to

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.560 
doesn't fall off the shelf besides to
stop<00:06:15.680> but<00:06:17.229> anyway<00:06:18.229> and<00:06:18.740> then<00:06:19.160> last<00:06:19.430> thing<00:06:19.610> is

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
stop but anyway and then last thing is

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:23.600 
stop but anyway and then last thing is
right<00:06:20.930> here

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:27.180 

just<00:06:24.610> used<00:06:24.910> it<00:06:25.900> made<00:06:26.170> the<00:06:26.320> full<00:06:26.500> slot<00:06:26.830> for<00:06:27.100> my

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
just used it made the full slot for my

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.930 
just used it made the full slot for my
table-saw<00:06:27.610> table<00:06:28.240> to<00:06:28.330> slide<00:06:28.570> into<00:06:29.370> and<00:06:30.370> then

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
table-saw table to slide into and then

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.370 
table-saw table to slide into and then
right<00:06:31.570> here<00:06:31.900> we'll<00:06:32.110> put<00:06:32.320> lights<00:06:33.010> all<00:06:33.220> blades

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 
right here we'll put lights all blades

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.540 
right here we'll put lights all blades
framing<00:06:35.380> square<00:06:35.500> different<00:06:36.130> things<00:06:36.340> on<00:06:36.520> that

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
framing square different things on that

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.450 
framing square different things on that
panel<00:06:36.940> and<00:06:37.290> so<00:06:38.290> I<00:06:38.320> think<00:06:38.500> it<00:06:38.800> will<00:06:38.890> work<00:06:39.280> out

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:39.460 
panel and so I think it will work out

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.890 
panel and so I think it will work out
pretty<00:06:39.730> good<00:06:40.350> the<00:06:41.350> distance<00:06:41.860> between<00:06:42.900> the

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
pretty good the distance between the

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.830 
pretty good the distance between the
back<00:06:44.140> of<00:06:44.350> the<00:06:44.410> trailer<00:06:44.860> and<00:06:44.890> right<00:06:45.220> here<00:06:45.670> is<00:06:46.210> 16

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
back of the trailer and right here is 16

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.990 
back of the trailer and right here is 16
inches<00:06:47.260> so<00:06:48.010> I<00:06:48.040> just<00:06:48.280> ripped<00:06:48.520> these<00:06:48.670> sheets

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.000 
inches so I just ripped these sheets

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.200 
inches so I just ripped these sheets
down<00:06:49.240> to<00:06:49.420> 16<00:06:49.840> inches<00:06:50.260> and<00:06:50.500> then<00:06:51.400> about<00:06:51.700> a<00:06:51.760> 12

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:52.210 
down to 16 inches and then about a 12

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.810 
down to 16 inches and then about a 12
you<00:06:52.660> know<00:06:52.690> 14<00:06:53.350> 12<00:06:54.190> 8<00:06:55.920> layout<00:06:56.920> on<00:06:57.310> these<00:06:57.490> shelves

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:57.820 
you know 14 12 8 layout on these shelves

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.910 
you know 14 12 8 layout on these shelves
so<00:06:58.540> and<00:06:59.370> same<00:07:00.370> thing<00:07:00.400> over<00:07:00.820> here<00:07:01.500> 16<00:07:02.500> inches
