 Hello, good afternoon, we are here 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:04.400
 Cesar Franco interpreter 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.400
 of digimon themes for team 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:11.480
 After stopping in vigo very happy, I am very happy more than I 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.609
 it grew more than anything 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:13.859
 Vicar expresses 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.400
 it's good how good we are here 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.060
 It's nice that we go out Eskimos 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.339
 which was made in the month of July 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:21.699
 the benefit of two weeks 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.930
 that was the first in Latin America and that at this moment is support 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:25.710
 in a situation 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.449
 something difficult 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.009
 tell me sir caesar 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.089
 as a company interacting with this scene with their fans with their people 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.130
 efe good I had an act in an artistic career leaves from 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.850
 7 years old 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 see me I've always liked this I liked to sing 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.510
 I studied studied studied this when I changed the voice that I carry my 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.160
 family that was never going to sing again 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.460
 First, he studied interpretation in the process of composition with protection 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.460
 rubin 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.860
 I fought a lot 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.720
 and because of the envy of many times all the doors were closed 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.830
 I'm not going to dedicate the interviews to that I want to understand and talks 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.800
 interviews to the good 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.890
 the good thing was that 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.060
 Up there 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.310
 they realized that I was looking with all my heart to bring something to the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.560
 people 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.890
 gave me the opportunity to sing the helmsman I feel that I am nobody 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.110
 actor or singer of dubbing 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.920
 with the external 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.280
 My name is Magana leader, he is a dubbing actor 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.690
 to make peace with the 1 as the 3 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.110
 and after a while I realize that this song and that tit songs 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.110
 they have not transcended beyond what I came to think 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.400
 in the minds there the hearts 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.860
 and in the souls 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.320
 also the people that I am most interested in 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.320
 in exchange for all that you have given to the temple 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.049
 well they paid me 3 thousand pesos 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.980
 Hahaha 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.960
 all passengers asprocan gatera paid madrid 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.320
 the artist 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.190
 this 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.690
 I am going to tell you 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.420
 I think that this song records these songs with two actions 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.279
 and they are not even full songs opening backgrounds 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.279
 remained 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.189
 laboriously 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.819
 the most important thing that has happened to me in life 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.230
 I did not realize until five months ago the initial report said 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.209
 he even said that he thought of putting 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.879
 the salary cut the amount of things and people so there are people who have 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:40.810
 been inspired by the creams have people who already play guitar because they 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.040
 he learned the billboard shit and the and the lyrics of diego buonanotte that so much 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.419
 people who make up 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:50.509
 Many people have told me that they became otaku because of me 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.859
 one month later start 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.959

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.959
 highlight 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.269
 he did not clarify what he warned I think it is the most wonderful thing that has happened to me 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.549
 because with a why those songs were destined to many people to leave it 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.509
 roger repression in syria 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:16.179

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.129

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.099
 as seen in the euro in euros that will be three years to the future 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.739

 to vilar way better than I have to sing it 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:41.209

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.339

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.510
 and to serve God in what remains of my life is difficult 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.210
 that everything I do all the things where again forever true 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:55.880

00:03:57.779 --> 00:04:00.639
 in everything you've done has served for what 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.369
 the touluse as a person is stricter more entertaining more cheerful 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:07.180
 on the one hand 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.899
 I believe that 

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:11.629
 I think 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.439
 what is happening now 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.109
 emit the socket really I have not dropped the twenty that do not read I have not 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.199
 analyzed as is 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.159
 is making me enjoy 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:24.759
 the gift 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.759
 is that God gave me to have sung the grass 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.550
 but I'm just enjoying with 

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.639
 because it is the dream of every artist 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.360
 I'm not interested in winning 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.229

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.069

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.069
