 Welcome, people. Welcome to the channel. 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.370
 you know right 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:43.460
 in this video to introduce you all 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:45.980
 on animal Anib anime means 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.629
 animation is any animation the drawing 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.579
 produced with characteristics 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.730
 own eyes with large eyes 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.040
 and simplified anime traits is a 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.129
 animation originally from japan but not 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.140
 restricted only in the region, the word 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.079
 I have different meanings for 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.670
 Japanese and Westerners to the 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.740
 japanese anime is all that is 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.800
 be it foreign or national 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.590
 for the West the word refers to 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.660
 to cartoon coming from japan 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.119
 the origin of the word is controversial 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.340
 can see from the English word animation 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.490
 which means animation or the word 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.950
 annie mec meaning "animated" 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.899
 contrary to what many think anime 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.539
 It is not a genre plus a bath and in Japan 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.820
 produce animated films with 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.729

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.060
 possible and imaginable comedy terror 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.159
 drama science fiction and many others 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.470
 a good part of the animals have their 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.810
 japanese comic book version 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.579
 manga anime stand out 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.369
 mainly by their eyes usually 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.619
 very large and very well defined 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.390
 also round or full of 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.969
 brightness is often with colors 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.360
 so that they can 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.579
 give more emotions to the characters 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.790
 the animals can be in the series format 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.590
 for television films with roe animes 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.540
 of the hat are displayed in prime time 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.759
 and in the course of time the great 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.610
 Western design companies want 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.200
 copy some traces of this brand now 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.630

 united at the end of World War II 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.440
 many Japanese artists have had 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.640
 contact with Western culture 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.780
 influenced by the pop culture of 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.340
 U.S 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.170
 early career designers 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.890

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.550

 animated series in japan among them 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.180

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.890
 expedited to be the first with great 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.910
 international projection in the 1950s 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.370
 influenced by the media that came from 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.990
 various artists and studios 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.970
 started to develop 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.040
 animation and experimental 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.220
 soon after January 1st of 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.380
 1963 was launched the astro boy based on 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.420
 manga of osamu tezuka already with the aesthetics 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.720
 of character big eyes and hair 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.850
 espetados coming from the printed version astro 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.550
 boy turned out to be the propellant of 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.720
 biggest animation industry in the world 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.210
 conquering the public of the 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.700
 United States currently in Brazil 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.100
 many others the famous remission thus 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.940
 like the knights of the zodiac death note 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.340
 dragon ball pokémon julio rachou naruto 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.000
 have not seen and fumé tone rangers 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.920
 also a blink both base and blush 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.020
 draw and among many other animals 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.330
 also the animals present 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.209
 quite different characteristics as 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.700
 an art direction agile framings 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.310
 daring and approach of varied subjects 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.220
 like science fiction adventure terror 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.470
 infantile and romance is quite common 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.390
 even in children's productions find 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.130
 adult mood situations 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.110
 there is also in big Japanese animation 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.640
 presence of humorous characters 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.520
 even though some have a connotation 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.430
 their characteristics are homosexual. 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.130
 a reflection of Japanese culture where there is 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.340
 distinction between homosexuals and 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.290
 heterosexual but outside this context 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.150
 like the West these actions also 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.109
 turn out to be often wrong 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.330
 interpreted 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.550
 leading in many cases to censorship and 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.020
 adaptation of characters also in 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.419
 many productions can confer 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.090
 exaggerated characterizations and signs 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.770
 visible and feelings like the drop of 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.290
 water that appears on the side of the 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.419
 character representing embarrassment 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.900
 sudden decrease in character 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.960
 represents 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.639
 shame or fear stylized nerves 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.080
 teeth or horns appearing 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.380
 suddenly in the characters 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.090
 represent anger an evil grandparents 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.930
 is also a very important element in the 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.910
 character 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.190
 they are selected according to the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.310
 personality of the voices characters 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:02.250
 very powerful infantile incidents 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.770
 harmonious I am cavernous are part of the 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.199
 universe of any anime the dubbers 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:10.020
 they are the targets of the admiration of many 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.130
 fans as would be the anime with regard to 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.780
 other media 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.760
 the most normal is that when the manga 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.039
 achieves considerable sales success 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.410
 in japan it is turned into anime 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.919
 and if it has also been successful it is 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:24.630
 produced and distributed to other countries 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.850
 possibly various products 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.800
 related to it begin to be 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.470
 produced as video game games 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.380
 dolls and magazines however there are cases 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.150
 in which order is reversed as gospel 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.430
 whose mandate was produced after the 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.530
 success of the series on television and 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.449
 conquest pokémon which was a games to 

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.389
 from which they were produced from 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:48.240
 anime and manga on September 1, 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:50.639
 1994 and his zodiac knights in the 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.370
 country forever changing the landscape of 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.889
 Japanese pop culture around here thanks to 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:57.720
 resounding success of seia and the others 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.479
 several animals began to pop 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.250
 by TV channels magazine stores 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.680
 toys or any media that 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:06.599
 able to make some good 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.860
 top of the Japanese drawings 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.830
 It is true that it was not the first 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:11.669
 Japanese success that he posted here on tv 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.010
 Brazilian 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:15.680
 but it is also easy to see that thanks 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.199
 to the success of the Zodiac Knights 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.970
 we can see other names that also 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:24.120
 have captivated generations of fans around here 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.550
 river shows in wolf and thinks are 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.830

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.169
 animals with growing success 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.880
 The world has 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.430
 community of fans who have become 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:37.770
 known with the taco the very term is 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:40.229
 because in Japan the 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.449
 entry has pejorative connotation 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.849
 many of the anime viewers do not 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.349
 consider taco preferring to escape from the 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:48.240
 controversial label 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:50.340
