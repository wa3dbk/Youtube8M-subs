00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
mesenteric lymphadenitis that have

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.359 
mesenteric lymphadenitis that have
included<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.500> little<00:01:04.739> bit<00:01:04.830> more<00:01:05.040> on<00:01:05.159> here

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
included a little bit more on here

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.620 
included a little bit more on here
because<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:05.640> not<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.000> talk<00:01:06.210> about<00:01:06.360> it

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
because I'm not going to talk about it

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.960 
because I'm not going to talk about it
anywhere<00:01:06.930> else<00:01:07.310> but<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:09.560> it's<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.609 

swelling<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.240> lymph<00:01:15.570> nodes<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
swelling of lymph nodes in in the

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.700 
swelling of lymph nodes in in the
mesentery<00:01:17.100> around<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.110> intestines<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
mesentery around the intestines and it

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.390 
mesentery around the intestines and it
often<00:01:19.950> is<00:01:22.189> right-sided

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
often is right-sided

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.039 
often is right-sided
because<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.850> lot<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.270> those<00:01:24.390> lymph<00:01:24.689> nodes<00:01:24.869> are

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
because a lot of those lymph nodes are

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.039 
because a lot of those lymph nodes are
on<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.320> right<00:01:25.500> side<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:27.119> presents

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
on the right side and so it presents

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.020 
on the right side and so it presents
almost<00:01:28.439> identically<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.340> fact<00:01:30.710> around<00:01:31.710> 16%<00:01:32.220> of

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
almost identically in fact around 16% of

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.480 
almost identically in fact around 16% of
children<00:01:33.990> presenting<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.829> probable

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
children presenting with probable

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.510 
children presenting with probable
appendicitis<00:01:36.450> end<00:01:36.930> up<00:01:37.409> having<00:01:37.829> mesenteric

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
appendicitis end up having mesenteric

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.510 
appendicitis end up having mesenteric
lymphadenitis<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> good<00:01:41.220> thing<00:01:41.400> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
lymphadenitis so this is a good thing to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.719 
lymphadenitis so this is a good thing to
have<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:42.150> high<00:01:42.960> index<00:01:43.350> of<00:01:43.530> suspicion<00:01:43.640> for<00:01:44.640> it

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
have a high index of suspicion for it

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.420 
have a high index of suspicion for it
it's<00:01:45.299> caused<00:01:45.540> by<00:01:45.689> infection<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.680> most<00:01:47.130> cases

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
it's caused by infection in most cases

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.010 
it's caused by infection in most cases
usually<00:01:47.790> viral<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.070> also<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:51.420> result<00:01:51.780> of

release<00:03:01.210> which<00:03:02.080> is<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.710> good<00:03:03.190> indication<00:03:03.610> of

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
release which is a good indication of

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.460 
release which is a good indication of
peritonitis<00:03:05.370> rose<00:03:06.370> swing<00:03:06.730> sign<00:03:07.120> is<00:03:07.470> is

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
peritonitis rose swing sign is is

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.850 
peritonitis rose swing sign is is
actually<00:03:09.130> when<00:03:09.850> you<00:03:10.000> push<00:03:10.240> on<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.870> other<00:03:11.470> side

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
actually when you push on the other side

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.670 
actually when you push on the other side
of<00:03:12.160> the<00:03:12.310> abdomen<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:13.300> hurts<00:03:13.960> on<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.320> right

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
of the abdomen it hurts on the right

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.890 
of the abdomen it hurts on the right
side<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:17.280> another<00:03:18.280> sign<00:03:18.610> is<00:03:18.850> obturator<00:03:19.390> sign

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
side so another sign is obturator sign

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.550 
side so another sign is obturator sign
and<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.430> sign<00:03:21.880> those<00:03:22.510> are<00:03:22.780> both<00:03:22.959> tests<00:03:23.470> that

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
and so a sign those are both tests that

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.550 
and so a sign those are both tests that
you<00:03:23.680> can<00:03:23.890> do<00:03:25.110> to<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:28.030> see<00:03:28.959> if<00:03:29.050> you<00:03:29.140> can<00:03:29.290> elicit

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
you can do to to see if you can elicit

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.770 
you can do to to see if you can elicit
pain<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.280> those<00:03:30.700> are<00:03:30.850> good<00:03:31.030> indications<00:03:31.450> that

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
pain and those are good indications that

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.260 
pain and those are good indications that
you<00:03:32.200> have<00:03:32.410> appendicitis<00:03:33.340> they<00:03:33.970> also<00:03:34.209> can<00:03:34.750> have

the<00:05:27.050> symptoms<00:05:27.530> are<00:05:27.680> not<00:05:27.710> severe<00:05:28.400> you<00:05:29.030> may<00:05:29.650> hold

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
the symptoms are not severe you may hold

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.700 
the symptoms are not severe you may hold
off<00:05:30.860> on<00:05:31.130> on<00:05:31.460> surgery<00:05:32.090> but<00:05:32.840> most<00:05:33.140> these<00:05:33.350> people

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
off on on surgery but most these people

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.860 
off on on surgery but most these people
need<00:05:33.920> to<00:05:34.100> need<00:05:34.490> to<00:05:34.580> go<00:05:34.730> to<00:05:34.760> surgery<00:05:35.330> so<00:05:35.540> we<00:05:35.660> can

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
need to need to go to surgery so we can

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:43.240 
need to need to go to surgery so we can
prevent<00:05:37.120> rupture<00:05:38.120> and<00:05:39.910> the<00:05:42.220> infection<00:05:43.220> that

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
prevent rupture and the infection that

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:48.630 
prevent rupture and the infection that
comes<00:05:43.610> after<00:05:43.940> that<00:05:44.740> so<00:05:45.740> you<00:05:46.250> can<00:05:46.460> do<00:05:46.840> an<00:05:47.840> open

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:48.640 
comes after that so you can do an open

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.240 
comes after that so you can do an open
up<00:05:49.640> and<00:05:50.060> appendectomy<00:05:50.780> you<00:05:51.710> can<00:05:51.860> also<00:05:52.010> do

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
up and appendectomy you can also do

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.240 
up and appendectomy you can also do
laparoscopic<00:05:53.120> appendectomy<00:05:53.890> so<00:05:54.890> with<00:05:55.130> the

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
laparoscopic appendectomy so with the

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.760 
laparoscopic appendectomy so with the
laparoscopic<00:05:55.690> most<00:05:56.690> people<00:05:57.080> are<00:05:57.260> gonna<00:05:57.410> put

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
laparoscopic most people are gonna put

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.580 
laparoscopic most people are gonna put
in<00:05:57.950> a<00:05:58.100> trocar<00:05:58.580> just<00:05:58.910> below<00:05:59.240> the<00:05:59.390> navel<00:05:59.600> and<00:06:00.700> and

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
in a trocar just below the navel and and

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.980 
in a trocar just below the navel and and
what<00:06:03.970> some<00:06:04.970> would<00:06:05.060> say<00:06:05.240> it'd<00:06:05.360> be<00:06:05.540> the<00:06:05.960> most

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
what some would say it'd be the most

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.400 
what some would say it'd be the most
aesthetic<00:06:06.830> way<00:06:07.690> aesthetically<00:06:08.690> pleasing<00:06:08.810> way
