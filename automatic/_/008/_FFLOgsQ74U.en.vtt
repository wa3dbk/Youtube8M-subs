00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 to 10 friends come joy well what 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.650
 you comment on this occasion we are going to 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.350
 talk about the bowling 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.870
 practice in a bowling alley unlike 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.559
 other sports this was not born in a 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.230
 gym was invented by an expert in 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.840
 matter but they started to play 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.550
 in churches to attract more people to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.710
 these places because they do not accompany me to 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.100
 learn more about bowling here in 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.890
 come the joy you can not see 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.600
 It might seem like a very friendly sport 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.000
 fact it can be, but based 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.300
 of a lot of practice and concentration are 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.670
 the bowls best known in Mexico as 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.050
 bowling though this is the place where 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.210
 the activity is practiced 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.129
 say those who know that this sport is 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.079
 very complicated the first step 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.969
 it's just to get some good 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.500
 shoes some special shoes for not 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.300
 mistreat the track where it is going to 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 of course I play and I 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.500
 lists so we share 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.700
 the necessary artifacts are only the 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.920
 beginning there is no doubt that practice 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.530
 to the teacher although sometimes if we 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.080
 we go back to the past the sport of 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.580
 bowling can become chilling 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.860
 and one of the basic tools for 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.050
 power of course playing bowling is nothing 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.840
 more and nothing less than the bowling ball 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.270
 This can be made of resin 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.160
 plastic before it's rubber one in 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.500
 even more ancient times was made of 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.470
 human flesh can come despite 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.630
 between 4 to 7 kilos and of course what 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.360
 important in this sport is to tear down 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.600
 the largest number of pines in a single 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.600
 threw 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.080
 almost the skittles were invented by a 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.940
 group of people who worried about 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.830
 that people did not go to mass they created a 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.290
 game that would attract the faithful to the 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.600
 churches and that at first glance it seems 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.790
 simple which did not work for the 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.850
 objective but if it lasts until our 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.330
 times this sport began to 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.610
 popularize from the year of 1952 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.950
 when it began to automate the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.620
 arrangement of the wines to make the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.000
 faster sport more agile and like 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:19.130
 most fun consequence of surprising 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.780
 to simplify the rules of the bonds 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.460
 I tell you that the only thing you have to 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.020
 to do is to knock down as much 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.150
 them in the least amount of shots 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.880
 possible making the most of your turn 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.160
 if you manage to throw the 10 pines at the same 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.320
 time the score is much higher 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.170
 the bowling pins weigh 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.330
 approximately half kilo each 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.560
 the intention is to knock down every move 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.930
 niell of them accommodated 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.390
 strategically at the end of each lane 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.300
 Made of polished wood and measuring 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.280
 approximately 18 meters long as well 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.280
 that the game is not easy 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.560
 In short, a sport suitable for all types of 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.670
 people recommended for that of that 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.620
 stress that we miss so much 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.110
 say those who know that this is one of 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.330
 the most complicated sports are in fact 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.040
 has translated more than 250 manuals in 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.709
 different languages to be able to carry 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.750
 out the best shots me from my point 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.520
 of sight and the best I could I invite you to 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.080
 that you practice from the capital 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.120
 mexicana I am we want to create you and that 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.120
 always come the joy come
