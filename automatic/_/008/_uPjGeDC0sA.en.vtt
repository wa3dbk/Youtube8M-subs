00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.859
 hello today we will see which of 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.349
 here is such a photo 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.759
 firms and private it is ultraviolet 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.560
 single phase gel 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:21.660
 natural dry it polymerized 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:25.890
 moisture three minutes he's self-leveling 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.830
 nail extensions and modeling 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.579
 also it does not require filing and 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.410
 topcoat application 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.129
 this gel it with a sticky layer 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.040
 that is, it is necessary after application 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:46.110
 last layer wipe special 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:48.300
 a means that the legs are ridiculous so let's see 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.899
 what is he up to us 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.649
 tank 15 milliliters 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:59.149
 here he has already begun can be seen yes and here he is 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.149
 pure such a rose 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.250
 transparent same plum slightly 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.049
 watery on principle for the most 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.979
 leveling or this consistency 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:20.180
 normal is quite volatile here 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:22.860
 it can be seen that it will be removed enough 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:31.950
 Now let's see how it falls on 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:37.950
 apply nail prepared on 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:44.310
 rink here need to watch so that the gel does not 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:47.490
 came in from the cuticle did not leak inflicted 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.240
 and you can see here you can even here you are a little bit 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:55.729
 here's a finger to turn and see already how 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.729
 he runs down himself 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:03.890
 here is such a nice gel 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:10.039
 principle long enough 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:13.970
 he keeps on rolling back such a gear principle 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:18.020
 normal and by the way it can be inexpensive 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:23.209
 say one of the cheapest or but 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:25.490
 not bad in use in practice and in 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.090
 more than once I used as it were very 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.090
 happy
