00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.440
 Y 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.539
 once again in a new result of 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.580
 tripling our coins that is today 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.470
 finalizes the series definitively but 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.730
 As you can see, the result is tripled 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.439
 in my currencies are covered with 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.910
 hospitalizations because the processes 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.559
 I want to make a little game and that you 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.360
 imagine while you see in the last 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:33.219
 consumables that sold that you imagine 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.930
 How many coins could I get to 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:36.579
 remove if I actually tripled my 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.840
 coins many of you I you 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:39.100
 sharing on twitter in you 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.420
 equipment that you have made and are the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.010
 very big benefits that you have 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.410
 taken away that many of you 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.300
 they come as I said if he got 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.070
 tripling our coins I got 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.780
 that you win is quite a benefit 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.219
 got that or if you have many 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.109
 equipment and your equipments some with 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.940
 more others with less I'm very sorry for 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.859
 people who have not been able to invest 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.059
 immense amount because we have done it to 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.069
 last minute as soon as we left totis 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.120
 I started the series but the next time 

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:03.429
 kick the fools I'll start now 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.950
 telling us a week before and be able to 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.690
 two weeks before and so be able to 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.580
 try to save as much as possible 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.409
 for the toffees and as you well know 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.810
 I have already invested one million 1,000,000 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.030
 just a million coins and the truth 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.409
 that it has cost me a lot to spend 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.240
 then we have sold them 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.340
 to the next week when more 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.840
 the prices now are actually a lot 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.759
 higher the price of the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.930
 consumables has gone up a lot already 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.399
 better yes I've lost enough 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.200
 coins but tell me with what you removed 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.970
 so it's time to remove those 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.649
 integrations and see how much I could 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.649
 remove and how much has been my benefit 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.370
 There you have kids, I have three 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.020
 million 158 thousand coins the truth that 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.020
 investing a million and I've taken off 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.150
 three million 106 a very high amount 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.650
 I know that I could take away much more if I 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.479
 I would have saved all my consumables and 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.890
 emotion this week to sell them but I counted 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.150
 the millionth I was satisfied I knew that 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.100
 more or less was going to reach the 3 million 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.360
 foot in three million two hundred would be 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.040
 there more or less the offers that not what 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.350
 would sell and from here and tell you that 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.760
 I'm really very very happy with 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.350
 the benefits to a Basque I have some 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.880
 Consumable for selling I also want 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.500
 tell you that I am very happy and that 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.300
 you share all many teams with me 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.100
 on twitter, it makes me happy because 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.390
 really my purpose was that that you 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.070
 They could do your teams the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.900
 competitive teams and that you can 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.910
 wipe out the leagues and really for 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.070
 me this series finishes satisfactorily 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.870
 very very well and at least I'm glad 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.400
 to have fulfilled what I have promised 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.080
 and so now let's move on to the part 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.700
 where are you going to see the equipment that I will use 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.080
 for julie thanks 23 million I'm going to 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.670
 mount my team the team that I 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.530
 I wanted to be able to compete against this 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.720
 people like muscle like almost like these 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.459
 uncles all with their equipment so for 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.630
 we are going to play and we will use 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.970
 the following alignment as you are 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.320
 watching the 433 enter for 64 one of my 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.540
 favorite alignments of all this 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.860
 fifa we will be putting players 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.480
 stop us a lot that we are going to do 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.769
 an oscar wilde later if you want to see them 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.780
 later in my channel you will see it 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.480
 because I'm going to play in this action that 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.739
 use but if you want to know something of 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.180
 any player in particular can you say 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.980
 the comments and if there are many people that 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.840
 wants to know about them I put them on 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.939
 I go back up or I have many goals 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.950
 with this with this team and we could 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.900
 ride are not squat bouiller or something or 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.310
 some change I do not know but for now 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.450
 serving that we have the goalkeeper still 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.250
 one of the ones I like the most in this 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.450
 game in the doormen a little weird it 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.920
 they make us many sung so it gives me 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.120
 a little bit like having just 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.409
 I will have it for rapport the 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.989
 laterals are the best of the game with 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:18.730
 difference dani alves and jordi something for 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.769
 they are awesome and then the 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.030
 midfielders we have xavi and iniesta the 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.859
 best pair of power since this 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.909
 game is based a lot on the pass and unveil 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:26.230
 you see that I put learning in the sum 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.209
 left there you will have the pse with the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.470
 Forum is the player the 87's 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.090
 left end pedrito what happens 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.319
 right now he did not give me money and what 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.900
 we have the primary one machine and 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:36.489
 also neymar of mf or is it so that 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.989
 come to goal and how do you have 5 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.250
 skills to become a writer of 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.750
 area and you have already seen the first 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.569
 star of this team sergio ramos- 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.730
 totti is an animated really has 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:48.489
 some attributes that are bestial 86 of 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.930
 dribble 79 pace 68 has a 92 of 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.959
 91 pass defense 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.760
 94 head I'm left with 87 pace 92 of 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.409
 defense and 94 head since they are the 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.329
 attributes that stand out in a defense 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.650
 and this is awesome and a 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.209
 statistics that really yes that 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.319
 reflects in the field here you see that I have 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.849
 two parties but now actually 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.530
 I have many more and I do not usually sign 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.120
 all letters or anything of this simply 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.859
 at this point what I would do was 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.689
 sign for it to be normal to call yes but 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.519
 I bring it for you to show you 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.379
 that yes you can sign totti but 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:16.000
 simply opening envelopes but if 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.229
 we try you can get everything is like 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.970
 if we said yes like the one that you will see 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.220
 continuation that we are going to have here to 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.900
 thiago silva all 94 on average also 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.539
 makes a spectacular couple with sergio 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.449
 ramos and its attributes are rhythm 87 79 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:31.270
 dribble 68 throw 95 pass defense 81 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.710
 and 91 head another awesome tip 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.509
 600 thousand coins you can get 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.340
 currently and I simply bring them 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:38.139
 so you can see what I say 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.699
 that you do not need to open on whether to open 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.050
 about whether to open envelopes spend from 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.580
 our coins to touch us 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.229
 players like others but in the end 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.150
 after trade 'we can not reach 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.070
 them much easier without scratching on the 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.320
 head if you do not touch anything we're going to 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.240
 be saying often that in loss of 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.320
 coins that I do not know I do not know how much 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.760
 that I always do the same thing always 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.200
 trade or when this time of 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.150
 players and then the 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.560
 at this height, it would be normal for 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.000
 call yes but I really wanted to bring 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.530
 these two players so you can see that 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.910
 yes you can sign and I just for 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.470
 last we have to put our forward 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.000
 center that I think everyone will imagine 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.070
 you know what is here you have it I read 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.180
 messi a player that yes that is true 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.220
 that costs one million five hundred thousand 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.270
 coins and that much is said about him has 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.610
 92 pace 97 regato 89 throw 44 defense 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.470
 84 pass and 69 head yes that's true 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.170
 that is spoken of him in plan that if it is not 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.970
 good if it's not worth what it costs if it's 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:26.410
 better neymar than him to me is a game that 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:27.760
 it really fulfills me that he is a player 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.200
 that yes it is true that if we are going to 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.880
 playing the center chito is the worst player 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.380
 for it since it is not going to finish any 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.790
 head type whoever the defense 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.470
 because they always jump over him 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.900
 but if you play the unmarks with the 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.550
 l1 triangle and those things like that happens the 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.230
 egg and so they go great since it is a 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.790
 game that stands out a lot and me 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:43.960
 personally, as you know, I already had 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.850
 I thought of signing it, it's a game that 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.260
 like and I wanted to have it on my computer and 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.580
 traveled to google although it is bad though 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.140
 be good and go down with him because it's leo 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.150
 messi simply and then later 

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:54.100
 you'll see the third one to see this team 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.720
 complete but so far this is the 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.250
 team that will use the aaiún and also 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.540
 watching leo messi and he gives me the example 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.100
 perfect for you too because 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.930
 I had one million five hundred thousand coins 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.070
 just to sign him but instead of 

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.800
 sign it, I can hold my tits 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:07.390
 and keep me the million and a half for 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.980
 top and you have just seen that in the end 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.060
 I get leo messi plus all these 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.920
 games that I have around that are 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.410
 very good and that's what I tell you 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.460
 that you can do it not at the level of leo 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:16.690
 Messi but of our players 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.850
 imagine you want lewandowski 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.140
 It costs 55 thousand coins 

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:21.670
 I would not recommend it if you go to 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.770
 get to zero since after you do not have 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.020
 back and yes it is true that if 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.160
 use those 55 thousand coins to treat 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.960
 four types of players surely 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.120
 you take out much more would dry raising this 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.350

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.340

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.290

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.490
