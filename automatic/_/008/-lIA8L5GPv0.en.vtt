you to interact with those contacts you
can<00:03:32.040> also<00:03:32.190> have<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.549> manual<00:03:32.880> setup<00:03:33.239> with<00:03:33.630> this

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
can also have a manual setup with this

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.259 
can also have a manual setup with this
sort<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.049> slightly<00:03:34.230> different<00:03:34.680> layout<00:03:35.100> but<00:03:36.000> in

sort of slightly different layout but in

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.750 
sort of slightly different layout but in
a<00:03:36.420> way<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.870> kind<00:03:37.170> of<00:03:37.290> defeats<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:37.709> point<00:03:38.519> of

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
a way that kind of defeats the point of

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.440 
a way that kind of defeats the point of
the<00:03:39.739> set<00:03:40.739> up<00:03:40.920> we<00:03:41.010> got<00:03:41.190> there<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.420> other

one is this running app that sort of

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.729 
one is this running app that sort of
comes<00:03:47.790> built<00:03:48.209> in<00:03:48.480> as<00:03:48.720> standard<00:03:49.260> so<00:03:49.440> it's<00:03:49.590> got

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
comes built in as standard so it's got
