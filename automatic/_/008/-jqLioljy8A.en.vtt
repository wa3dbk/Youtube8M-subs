00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
simple I just use um this flake food

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.979 
simple I just use um this flake food
right<00:02:09.780> here

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
right here

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.649 
right here
almost<00:02:11.650> knocked<00:02:11.769> it<00:02:11.890> over<00:02:11.980> this<00:02:12.879> play<00:02:13.390> coud

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.679 
little brine shrimp eggs hatch I mean
even<00:02:26.950> before<00:02:27.040> they<00:02:27.310> hatch<00:02:27.489> they<00:02:28.030> become<00:02:28.329> food

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
even before they hatch they become food

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
rocks and I live there and make little

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.869 
rocks and I live there and make little
homes<00:02:37.750> so<00:02:38.530> that's<00:02:39.099> how<00:02:39.189> you<00:02:39.250> feed<00:02:39.489> them<00:02:39.639> and

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:39.879 
homes so that's how you feed them and

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:42.770 
homes so that's how you feed them and
like<00:02:40.629> I<00:02:40.659> said<00:02:40.870> no<00:02:40.959> filtration<00:02:41.500> heater<00:02:42.219> and<00:02:42.549> you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
like I said no filtration heater and you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.970 
like I said no filtration heater and you
pretty<00:02:43.780> much<00:02:43.959> want<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.349> to<00:02:44.439> be<00:02:44.530> the<00:02:44.620> opposite

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
pretty much want it to be the opposite

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.379 
pretty much want it to be the opposite

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
support this many pods it's because you

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.699 
support this many pods it's because you

it's<00:03:02.680> best<00:03:02.980> to<00:03:03.069> have<00:03:03.159> a<00:03:03.310> little<00:03:04.269> pod<00:03:04.540> tank<00:03:05.079> like

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:05.919 
it's best to have a little pod tank like

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:08.099 
it's best to have a little pod tank like
this<00:03:06.129> one<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.549> since<00:03:07.269> my<00:03:07.419> refugium<00:03:07.870> is<00:03:07.989> the

a cup of that dump it in my refugium to

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.259 
a cup of that dump it in my refugium to

substrate I moved around and I do that

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.039 
substrate I moved around and I do that
about<00:03:21.489> once<00:03:21.609> a<00:03:21.909> week<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.359> feeds<00:03:22.569> all<00:03:22.810> my

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
my sister imp once every so often just

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.629 
my sister imp once every so often just
in<00:03:29.290> case<00:03:29.470> not<00:03:29.709> enough<00:03:29.949> of<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.129> pods<00:03:30.340> are<00:03:30.519> going

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
in case not enough of the pods are going

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.550

up<00:03:30.699> to<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.819> main<00:03:30.970> tank<00:03:31.150> but<00:03:31.449> they<00:03:32.019> love<00:03:32.530> it

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
up to the main tank but they love it

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.830 
up to the main tank but they love it
because<00:03:33.159> it's<00:03:33.280> live<00:03:33.489> food<00:03:33.760> they<00:03:34.030> can<00:03:34.180> wait<00:03:34.629> for

crawling<00:03:42.519> out<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.729> rocks<00:03:42.939> it's<00:03:43.629> like<00:03:43.750> a

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
crawling out the rocks it's like a

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.009 
crawling out the rocks it's like a
feeding<00:03:44.290> frenzy<00:03:44.549> so<00:03:45.549> all<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:46.180> need<00:03:46.299> is<00:03:46.509> same
