Rubik's<00:00:13.640> Cube<00:00:13.970> is<00:00:14.180> but<00:00:19.300> are<00:00:20.300> you<00:00:20.690> fed<00:00:21.020> up<00:00:21.050> with

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
Rubik's Cube is but are you fed up with

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.390 
Rubik's Cube is but are you fed up with
your<00:00:21.410> Rubik's<00:00:21.980> Cube<00:00:22.280> um<00:00:23.440> no<00:00:24.440> not<00:00:24.920> really

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
your Rubik's Cube um no not really

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.930 
your Rubik's Cube um no not really
of<00:00:25.550> course<00:00:25.970> you<00:00:26.300> are<00:00:27.080> what<00:00:27.470> it's<00:00:28.220> practically

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
of course you are what it's practically

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.570 
of course you are what it's practically
impossible<00:00:29.150> to<00:00:29.810> keep<00:00:30.109> it<00:00:30.260> solved<00:00:30.830> well<00:00:31.279> I

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
impossible to keep it solved well I

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.490 
impossible to keep it solved well I
think<00:00:31.910> it's<00:00:32.149> scrambled<00:00:32.539> all<00:00:32.870> I<00:00:32.960> have<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:33.230> do<00:00:33.350> is

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
think it's scrambled all I have to do is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.500 
think it's scrambled all I have to do is
solve<00:00:33.710> it<00:00:33.860> it<00:00:33.980> only<00:00:34.100> takes<00:00:34.399> me<00:00:34.640> like<00:00:34.820> a<00:00:35.060> minute

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
solve it it only takes me like a minute

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.870 
solve it it only takes me like a minute
but<00:00:36.170> what<00:00:36.380> if<00:00:36.530> you<00:00:36.649> can't<00:00:36.950> solve<00:00:37.370> a<00:00:37.550> Rubik's

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:37.880 
but what if you can't solve a Rubik's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.060 
but what if you can't solve a Rubik's
Cube<00:00:38.000> if<00:00:38.780> someone<00:00:39.200> can't<00:00:39.410> solve<00:00:39.680> it<00:00:39.800> they<00:00:39.920> can

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
Cube if someone can't solve it they can

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.280 
Cube if someone can't solve it they can
just<00:00:40.250> take<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:41.239> apart<00:00:41.329> and<00:00:41.660> reassemble<00:00:42.170> it

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
just take it apart and reassemble it

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.860 
just take it apart and reassemble it

well<00:00:45.800> of<00:00:45.950> course<00:00:46.010> they<00:00:46.579> could<00:00:46.910> go<00:00:47.809> cube<00:00:48.170> will

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
well of course they could go cube will

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.650 
well of course they could go cube will
