could use other mods as well while using
this<00:02:34.860> mod<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:36.269> might<00:02:36.450> conflict<00:02:36.780> with<00:02:37.019> the

we can get this to work I'm making so

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.340 
we can get this to work I'm making so
many<00:02:50.579> mistakes<00:02:50.850> definitely<00:02:51.810> can't<00:02:52.019> do<00:02:52.170> that

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.460 

that<00:04:00.610> is<00:04:00.760> going<00:04:01.000> hold<00:04:01.270> us<00:04:01.450> on<00:04:01.630> much<00:04:01.840> longer<00:04:02.080> we

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
that is going hold us on much longer we

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.220 
that is going hold us on much longer we
need<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.830> to<00:04:02.980> pass<00:04:03.160> it

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.440 

now<00:04:06.830> there<00:04:07.010> is<00:04:07.129> another<00:04:07.370> problem<00:04:08.120> with<00:04:08.300> this

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
now there is another problem with this

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.309 
now there is another problem with this
mod<00:04:08.750> is<00:04:08.780> that<00:04:09.610> there's<00:04:10.610> DRS<00:04:11.150> when<00:04:11.810> it<00:04:11.930> comes<00:04:12.110> to

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
mod is that there's DRS when it comes to

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.120 
mod is that there's DRS when it comes to
longer<00:04:12.709> races<00:04:12.890> for<00:04:13.879> some<00:04:14.060> reason<00:04:14.860> so<00:04:15.860> i<00:04:15.890> don't

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
longer races for some reason so i don't

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:17.650 
longer races for some reason so i don't
know<00:04:16.190> if<00:04:16.310> it's<00:04:16.459> possible<00:04:16.639> to<00:04:17.000> disable<00:04:17.329> the

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
know if it's possible to disable the

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.199 
know if it's possible to disable the
feature<00:04:17.810> or<00:04:18.139> not<00:04:18.489> let's<00:04:19.489> control<00:04:19.760> force<00:04:20.060> in

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209

wet<00:04:20.359> races<00:04:21.040> don't<00:04:22.040> have<00:04:22.160> the<00:04:22.280> arrest<00:04:22.550> anyway

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
wet races don't have the arrest anyway

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.090 
wet races don't have the arrest anyway
but<00:04:24.380> it's<00:04:24.530> um<00:04:24.880> it's<00:04:25.880> a<00:04:26.090> shame<00:04:26.300> because<00:04:26.479> I<00:04:27.100> think

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
but it's um it's a shame because I think

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.850 
but it's um it's a shame because I think
that's<00:04:28.340> what<00:04:28.460> ruins<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:30.290> mod<00:04:30.500> for<00:04:30.770> me

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
that's what ruins the mod for me

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.409 
that's what ruins the mod for me
manually<00:04:33.860> they<00:04:34.040> will<00:04:34.220> improve<00:04:34.610> for<00:04:34.910> sure
