00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:06.340
 since generations people use the 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.440
 wind to get away is it for sailing 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.580
 on the water or to fly in the 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:16.930
 There is plenty of air wind 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.850
 But you can do the coastal stream out of the wind 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.100
 difficult to save in times of 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.109
 scarce energy resources a problem 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.390
 audi presents with its power to gas 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.340
 concept a solution and set up 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.800
 climate-friendly driving with a car 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.800
 Combination of CO2 and wind energy 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.329
 this unique concept explains tom 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.670
 kristensen 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.420
 he has nine times the 24 hours of le 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.190
 mans won 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.430
 The dane has racing history 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.680
 written as audi 2012 with two r8s 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.629
 zeni tron quattro place one and two 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.190
 and so did hybrid technology 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.440
 successful also with this 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.750
 long-distance classic also established 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.850
 In 2013 audi triumphed again 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.480
 and Christians are celebrating his ninth 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.480
 total victory 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.230
 Munich 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.610
 We are here in the forest in Lower Saxony 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.510
 Here Audi builds the world's first 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.750
 industrial plant generation of 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:24.340
 synthetic methane from excess stream 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.340
 power to gas is the name of the technology 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.350
 that are colliding that we need 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.860
 arises on this biogas plant and 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.520
 Materials for this are waste from the 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.520
 Agriculture 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.830
 this part of the facility is called armin laundry 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.810
 here comes the carbon dioxide to the will 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.460
 cleaned and dried and is with it 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.900
 ready for the next step 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.900
 Production of e gas 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.960
 before we see where the colo de are 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.270
 ends up but we clarify one first 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.210
 other question what actually happens 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.350
 the green electricity from the wind turbines there 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.350
 here to use 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.830
 we are here at the electrolysis 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.640
 Here, hydrogen is produced like that 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.440
 we see here the ingenious this 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.760
 small attempt of the physics 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.800
 lessons or so with the hair dryer 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.700
 simulate how to activate north sea wind 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.069
 the windmill 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.280
 The current then flows through these two 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:33.470
 electrodes and now water is in 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.470
 split hydrogen and oxygen 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.570
 that's the electrolysis thing here 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.010
 Bubbles that is hydrogen 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.010
 we need for the next steps 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.510
 The decisive step is in 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.700
 this part of the plant instead of the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.310
 metallization the two basic substances 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.020
 So hydrogen and carbon dioxide 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.400
 react with the help of a catalyst 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.530
 to ran with 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.530
 So are natural gas 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.290
 Here, the e gas in the gas network 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.900
 fed 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.230
 that's a huge one 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.230
 Storage capacity available 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.709
 and whenever the wind is right 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:30.800
 whistling and electricity in abundance arises 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.800
 then the whole system will be purchased 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.560
 The power grids are then relieved of that 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.190
 just an important advantage of the audi e-gas 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.190
 project 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.940
 and the most beautiful with the a3 e-tron 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.019
 we have sun and wind the tank with it 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.019
 drive we stick yield 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.890
 audi goes into things more sustainable 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.890
 move on one step further 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.810
 If you buy an a3 e-tron you can 100 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.549
 drive climate neutral 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.799
 the consumption of the car becomes the 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.919
 tank card registered and audi replaced 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.239
 the gas used by gas gives it 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.850
 There are three types of movement in the future 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:25.430
 with wind power sailing on the water 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.490
 sailing in the air and audi e-tron 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.910
 drive power to gas an innovation of 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.910
 audi
