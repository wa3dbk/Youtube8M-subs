00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.799
 hi how are you all i am mÃ³nica 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.260
 macaque and here we are back another 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.990
 time with this same look but we continue 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:16.180
 with the delicious dinner recipes that 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.250
 I did with all my friends here I'm going to 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.530
 present a delicious mole soufflÃ© 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.450
 a very simple recipe with which 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:25.030
 they can get out of the box very fast 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.860
 let's start with this tutorial 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.960
 put to boil your pieces of chicken and 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.540
 season them to your liking with onion salt 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.390
 pepper and spices that you want 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.280
 After sowing has put your chicken 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.570
 little pieces to be able 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.750
 spread well for all our 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.390
 refractory I recommend you then choose 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.700
 a cheese that you like and that is easy to 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.770
 gratinar I chose the manchego and I'm 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.870
 scratching about half a kilo in another 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.440
 dish does not matter if I have spare what I can 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.840
 save also a half onion itches 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.690
 in small pieces that is the amount 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.739
 that you choose as you like 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.960
 later it happens to remove the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.670
 edges to your white bread since we want 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.220
 that only the center of our 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.680
 space now in a refractory we are going to 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.860
 accommodate a layer of bread a layer of 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.290
 chicken onions and cheese and on top 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.020
 we will bathe with sauce so we will do it three 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.970
 times so put your the amount that 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.320
 be proportional to distribute 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.780
 well all ingredients 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.820
 around the refractory and do not stay 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.460
 thicker layers are thinner and the 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.970
 sauce reach to soak all the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.970
 capita 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.979
 I decided to cut the pieces of bread from 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.869
 way that will ride better with the shape 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.090
 of my refractory for this way 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.820
 take advantage of the greatest amount of bread and 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.810
 that you do not waste so much product you 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.810
 you can do the same 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.840
 I'm a cheese fan so they can 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.270
 notice that I put pretty thick layers of 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.920
 cheese since I really like the taste 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.130
 and the consistency that they give to me their 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.130
 play 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.080
 You can use up to two types of cheese 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.060
 that will give a special flavor 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.370
 the amount of onion that you put 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.960
 It varies if you like it or not and if your 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.180
 guests like the taste of 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.420
 onions to me if I like the seasoning that 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.420
 you give me 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.770
 you do not have to soak this layer 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.990
 simply that you fall in a way 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.530
 uniform to all the refractory is 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.530
 perfect 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.950
 after applying the second layer of 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.200
 chicken to the last layer of bread and in the 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.230
 that we're just going to apply the bread 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.540
 the sauce and on top the cheese to grill 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.950
 we're not going to close with chicken anymore it's like 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.519
 the top of our country our 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.519
 souffle 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.060
 two 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.420
 this last layer we will bathe it very well 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.980
 with all our sauce we no longer have to 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.530
 leave no guardian so 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.599
 we remove very well all our 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:54.400
 refractory to permeate it 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:54.400
 while it is heating up in the oven 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.069
 this time I decided to prepare it with 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.250
 mole sauce since we are in the month 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.950
 patriotic for mexico of September but 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.349
 You can also use this recipe with 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:13.660
 different sauces later I will make them 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.120
 a video where two or teach them 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.720
 three sauces that you can use with this 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.720
 same recipe 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.210
 to heat your saucer so that it 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.550
 gratin the cheese and be warm 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.580
 uniformly about 20 minutes in the 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.919
 oven before dinner 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.210
 Well I hope you liked it so much 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.500
 how all my friends liked that 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.330
