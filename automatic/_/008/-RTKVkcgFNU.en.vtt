00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 one of the great confusion in relation to 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.340
 union in marketing is undoubtedly its 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.660
 competition with traditional research 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.030
 quantitative and qualitative 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.780
 I also hope to clarify for clients 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.850
 advertising agencies and mainly 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.070
 research institutes like this new 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.830
 scientific research black dynamics 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.970
 for this we need to keep in mind four 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.390
 magic questions because what and who 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.390
 as 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.000
 Let's start with why this one 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.250
 questioning represents the researches 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.530
 quantitative and qualitative 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.440
 the maximum that the customer can express 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.699
 in these surveys is why your 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.190
 behavior 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.480
 in this sphere lies the conscious in the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.960
 consumer who represents 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.990
 definitely validated by science 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.520
 between 5 and 15 percent of our 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.890
 decisions 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.170
 finally after questioning the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.690
 volunteer of a research justifies the 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.180
 your opinion consciously 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.180
 Good, there's the problem when you do not 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.430
 we know something for the brain is much more 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.600
 easy to come up with a response than to talk 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.880
 I do not know 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.640
 or I am doubtful without counting the 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.680
 people who lie to adapt to the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.950
 search context 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.619
 Now let's know what this 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.360
 questioning represents what happens 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.840
 with the volunteer after an experience 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.150
 whether it is auditory visual or 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.300
 synesthetic is what the neuromarketing 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:58.100
 makes you discover what happens to the 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.440
 biology of volunteers 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.740
 the variation of the waves of Egypt and its 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.510
 dynamic skin temperature change 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.630
 of heart rate 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.060
 I found out for what the volunteer looks at 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.940
 a visual stimulus for flec in a 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.150
 resonance in a brain area is this 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:20.980
 do not expect neuromarketing and its 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.170
 Tools falling down the why at what? 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.769
 happened to our customers looking the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.440
 which accounts for between 85 and 95 percent 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.500
 decisions and we are talking about 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.120
 obviously from our unconscious 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.549
 neuromarketing measures biology of 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.610
 consumer is the same situation as a 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.650
 doctor must first ask the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.280
 exams to see what's happening 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.180
 with your body and then 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.239
 a conclusion 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.239
 well this is the critical point 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.580
 several doctors facing the same examination may 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.769
 reach conclusions and treatments 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.230
 totally different 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.819
 the questioning who represents in the 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.849
 essence 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.480
 Who are you, what is your basal biology? 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.680
 finally its genetic code 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.159
 behaviors and characteristics in 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.620
 data from our genetic inheritance 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:18.069
 demonstrates our most animal being 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.959
 primitive and the arrangement of genes 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.129
 access to the genetic data of 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.159
 consumers 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:27.790
 Like or do not like is the next step of 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:30.639
 market research boy 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.409
 now it got ugly if a doctor 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:39.099
 that all medical and understands ok and 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:42.310
 may have different conclusion as 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.699
 research manager the analyst of 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.000
 neuromarketing can reach the conclusion 

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:47.889
 correct 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.480
 there are a lot of people who work with 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:52.199
 neuromarketing that is formed in 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.900
 engineering marketing manager 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:58.510
 technology and even mechanics 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:02.739
 are areas that are not specific to 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:07.299
 biology medicine calm old shit now 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:08.949
 comes the explanation of the question as how 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.949
 interpret survey data 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:14.290
 quantitative and qualitative 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:17.139
 and unconscious neuromarketing 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.440
 the answer is simple and fantastic 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.000
 through multidisciplinary knowledge 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.159
 involving professionals with minds 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.680
 experienced bright 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:29.430
 segments such as market research 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.080
 marketing technology manager 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.860
 communication and so on 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.949
 against 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.800
 the interpretation of why and why 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.289
 still be the responsibility of the 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.949
 people managers 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.289
 this way how to do always will be 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:50.259
 at least for now in the hands of 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.050
 market strategists where 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.419
 mistakes are part of the game after all 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.210
 We are human accounts. 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.250
 this is the dynamics of the market where 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.460
 we can create strategies for companies 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.500
 where unpredictability is still always 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.300
 will be the main factor 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.029
 traditional research and 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.289
 neuromarketing only decrease the chance 

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:13.779
 of error 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.449
 Finally, it is important to take into 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:18.259
 consideration 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:21.110
 there is no view of the iceberg 95% of 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:24.169
 researches currently carried out are the 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.710
 traditional quantitative and qualitative 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.509
 which requires on average 5 to 15 percent of 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.819
 our decision-making process 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.699
 but only five percent of 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:37.370
 market research budgets are 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:40.699
 aimed at neuromarketing where 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.729
 between 85 and 95 percent of the 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:46.339
 our paradoxical decision-making in the 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.949
 minimum when the market finds a 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:51.139
 balance in research investments 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:53.659
 traditional and neuromarketing with 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.389
 sure we will get more results 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.499
 animators in relation to research and their 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.020
 efficiency 

00:05:57.499 --> 00:06:01.789
 now there is a fight between research 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.159
 and neuromarketing research 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:06.979
 between the advertising agency and 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:10.460
 institutes of research in the works 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.870
 because there is an entire market unexplored 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.759
 asking for help 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.759
 Thank you and see you next time
