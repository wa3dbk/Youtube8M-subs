00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 A dart is a sewing method that squeezes a cloth to form a three-dimensional cloth Left with darts Right without darts You can make three-dimensional clothes in line with your body 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Make a hole in the corner of the pattern dart in advance 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 Copy the mark from the hole to the fabric below 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
 Fold vertically at the center of the dart 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
 Pull out the upper and lower threads. Thread passes under the presser foot. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
 Sew parallel to the first 1-2 stitches. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 The corner turns up while holding the needle stuck 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 Finish one to two stitches parallel to the crease

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 Darts sewn, the end. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Reasons to sew the end of the dart in parallel first and last 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
