00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 
destination you cancel it and you will

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.100 
destination you cancel it and you will
be<00:03:04.790> granted<00:03:04.970> super<00:03:05.420> speed<00:03:05.630> however<00:03:05.989> this

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
be granted super speed however this

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.310 
be granted super speed however this
doesn't<00:03:06.380> work<00:03:06.650> all<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:08.120> time<00:03:08.150> so<00:03:08.870> you<00:03:08.930> have<00:03:09.140> to

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
doesn't work all the time so you have to

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.800 
doesn't work all the time so you have to
keep<00:03:09.590> doing<00:03:09.920> this<00:03:10.040> repeatedly<00:03:10.549> until<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.660> get

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
keep doing this repeatedly until you get

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.160 
keep doing this repeatedly until you get
super<00:03:12.170> speed<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:13.330> this<00:03:14.330> actually<00:03:14.510> might<00:03:14.900> take

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.170 
super speed so this actually might take

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:25.199 
super speed so this actually might take
a<00:03:15.200> while<00:03:15.500> um<00:03:20.709> ah<00:03:21.970> it's<00:03:22.970> got<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.150> bit<00:03:23.299> of<00:03:23.360> a<00:03:23.420> cold

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
keep doing it for it to work some kind

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.130 
keep doing it for it to work some kind
repeating<00:03:32.480> itself<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:34.570> now<00:03:35.570> however
