it's<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> 2002<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.649> 2014<00:01:44.460> right<00:01:44.790> now<00:01:44.939> so

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
it's a 2002 and it's 2014 right now so

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.039 
it's a 2002 and it's 2014 right now so
that's<00:01:45.270> twelve<00:01:45.600> years<00:01:45.780> old<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.720> it's<00:01:48.869> just

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
that's twelve years old and so it's just

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.539 
that's twelve years old and so it's just
got<00:01:49.200> some<00:01:49.350> normal<00:01:49.680> kind<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.920> wear<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.250> tear<00:01:50.369> on

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
got some normal kind of wear and tear on

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.039 
got some normal kind of wear and tear on
it<00:01:50.670> got<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.909> little<00:01:51.119> scratch<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.780> little

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
it got a little scratch here a little

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.649 
it got a little scratch here a little
scuff<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:53.790> wheels<00:01:54.000> are<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.360> little

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
scuff there the wheels are a little

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.899 
scuff there the wheels are a little
dingy<00:01:54.960> could<00:01:55.350> be<00:01:55.439> hit<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:55.740> an<00:01:55.860> SOS<00:01:56.159> pad<00:01:56.549> to

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
dingy could be hit with an SOS pad to

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.330 
dingy could be hit with an SOS pad to
get<00:01:57.450> them<00:01:57.540> clean<00:01:58.049> back<00:01:58.259> up<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:58.710> with<00:01:58.829> such<00:01:59.070> big

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
get them clean back up and with such big

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.219 
get them clean back up and with such big
fenders<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.540> be<00:02:00.630> kind<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.840> tough<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
fenders it can be kind of tough to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.889 
fenders it can be kind of tough to
detail<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:02.280> wheels<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.820> bike<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.360> that's

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
detail the wheels on the bike so that's

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.499 
detail the wheels on the bike so that's
one<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.170> those<00:02:04.259> things<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.649> gets<00:02:04.829> left

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
one of those things that gets left

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.719 
one of those things that gets left
undone<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:06.750> people<00:02:07.110> detail<00:02:07.979> these<00:02:08.190> bikes<00:02:08.429> a

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
undone when people detail these bikes a

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.710 
undone when people detail these bikes a
couple<00:02:09.300> of<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.509> minor<00:02:09.629> scuffs<00:02:10.140> here

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.480 

there<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.260> one<00:02:13.470> that's<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.860> main<00:02:14.070> scratch

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
there is one that's the main scratch

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.390 
there is one that's the main scratch
right<00:02:14.670> there<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:15.380> that's<00:02:16.380> probably<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:17.010> couple

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
right there and that's probably a couple

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.480 
right there and that's probably a couple
of<00:02:17.550> millimeters<00:02:18.000> deep<00:02:19.130> maybe<00:02:20.130> like<00:02:20.340> two

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
of millimeters deep maybe like two

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.540 
of millimeters deep maybe like two
millimeters<00:02:20.940> deep<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.740> put<00:02:22.740> brand-new<00:02:23.340> white

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
millimeters deep I put brand-new white

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.610 
millimeters deep I put brand-new white
walls<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.120> they<00:02:24.270> probably<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.900> about<00:02:25.020> 200

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
walls on it they probably have about 200

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.690 
walls on it they probably have about 200
miles<00:02:25.770> on<00:02:26.040> them<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:27.770> they<00:02:28.770> ride<00:02:29.040> awesome<00:02:29.580> in

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
miles on them so they ride awesome in

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.100 
miles on them so they ride awesome in
fact<00:02:29.910> if<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.150> get<00:02:30.330> really<00:02:30.450> close<00:02:30.690> you<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.900> see

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
fact if I get really close you can see

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.870 
fact if I get really close you can see
they<00:02:31.230> still<00:02:31.470> have<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.710> little<00:02:31.920> they<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
they still have the little they have the

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.560 
they still have the little they have the
little<00:02:33.120> niblet<00:02:33.510> things<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:34.050> there<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:36.390> there's

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
little niblet things on there so there's

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.840 
little niblet things on there so there's
a<00:02:36.660> brand-spankin'-new<00:02:37.050> so<00:02:38.010> they're<00:02:38.340> probably

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
a brand-spankin'-new so they're probably

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.150 
a brand-spankin'-new so they're probably
good<00:02:39.120> for<00:02:39.240> about<00:02:39.330> 15,000<00:02:40.200> miles<00:02:40.640> this<00:02:41.640> bike

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
good for about 15,000 miles this bike

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.630 
good for about 15,000 miles this bike
just<00:02:44.160> cranks<00:02:44.490> right<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:47.100> cranks<00:02:47.520> when

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
just cranks right up and it cranks when

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.980 
just cranks right up and it cranks when
you<00:02:47.730> push<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.030> start<00:02:48.270> button<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.720> not<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
you push the start button and not the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:03:02.809 
you push the start button and not the
horn<00:02:49.580> but<00:02:50.580> now<00:02:50.730> you<00:02:50.790> know<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.120> horn<00:02:51.270> works

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
the bits part of the iconic look at this

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:54.390 
the bits part of the iconic look at this
bike<00:03:50.319> so<00:03:51.069> I<00:03:51.430> think<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:53.260> bike<00:03:53.950> is<00:03:54.040> completely

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
bike so I think this bike is completely

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.250 
bike so I think this bike is completely
ready<00:03:54.579> to<00:03:54.670> go<00:03:54.760> I<00:03:54.790> would<00:03:55.030> go<00:03:55.060> on<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.450> extremely

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
ready to go I would go on a extremely

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.440 
ready to go I would go on a extremely
long<00:03:56.530> road<00:03:56.769> trip<00:03:57.010> on<00:03:57.099> this<00:03:57.280> bike<00:03:57.489> right<00:03:58.239> now

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
long road trip on this bike right now

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.910 
long road trip on this bike right now
without<00:03:58.720> even<00:03:58.840> thinking<00:03:59.290> about<00:03:59.379> it<00:03:59.560> it's<00:03:59.799> been

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
without even thinking about it it's been

without even thinking about it it's been
serviced<00:04:01.950> it's<00:04:02.950> been<00:04:03.310> serviced<00:04:04.000> with<00:04:04.180> mobile

one<00:04:04.720> synthetic<00:04:05.590> oil<00:04:05.739> I<00:04:05.949> would<00:04:06.010> go<00:04:06.190> back<00:04:06.370> with

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:06.579 
one synthetic oil I would go back with

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.879 
one synthetic oil I would go back with
synthetic<00:04:06.940> oil<00:04:07.150> I've<00:04:07.510> only<00:04:07.959> put<00:04:08.199> premium<00:04:08.470> gas

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
synthetic oil I've only put premium gas

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:09.990 
synthetic oil I've only put premium gas
in<00:04:09.190> it

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
in it

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.119 
in it
I<00:04:10.030> recommend<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:11.019> new<00:04:11.169> owners<00:04:11.560> does<00:04:11.769> the<00:04:11.889> same

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
I recommend the new owners does the same

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.460 
I recommend the new owners does the same
it's<00:04:12.459> a<00:04:12.609> for<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.120> tank<00:04:13.359> of<00:04:13.480> gas<00:04:13.510> you<00:04:14.199> know<00:04:14.319> it's

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
it's a for a tank of gas you know it's

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.800 
it's a for a tank of gas you know it's
not<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.650> same<00:04:14.799> as<00:04:14.949> your<00:04:15.099> suburban<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:16.299> you

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
not the same as your suburban so you

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.210 
not the same as your suburban so you
know<00:04:16.959> it's<00:04:17.169> like<00:04:17.320> it<00:04:17.530> only<00:04:17.650> costs<00:04:18.039> like<00:04:18.190> a

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
know it's like it only costs like a

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.189 
know it's like it only costs like a
dollar<00:04:18.579> more<00:04:19.000> to<00:04:19.209> put<00:04:19.389> premium<00:04:19.810> in<00:04:19.930> it<00:04:20.049> and

00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 
dollar more to put premium in it and

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.539 
dollar more to put premium in it and
it's<00:04:20.349> going<00:04:20.409> to<00:04:20.500> make<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.769> bike<00:04:20.949> run<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.400> much

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
it's going to make the bike run so much

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.550 
it's going to make the bike run so much
better<00:04:21.849> so<00:04:22.570> I<00:04:22.599> really<00:04:22.930> try<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.110> take<00:04:23.320> care<00:04:23.500> of

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
better so I really try and take care of

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.170 
better so I really try and take care of
my<00:04:23.650> stuff<00:04:23.710> I<00:04:24.099> keep<00:04:24.280> it<00:04:24.400> in<00:04:24.490> the<00:04:24.550> garage<00:04:24.669> at<00:04:25.060> all

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
my stuff I keep it in the garage at all

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.570 
my stuff I keep it in the garage at all
times<00:04:25.479> there's<00:04:26.380> no<00:04:26.530> rust<00:04:26.800> on<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.130> bike<00:04:27.310> really

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
times there's no rust on the bike really

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.000 
times there's no rust on the bike really
anywhere<00:04:28.139> like<00:04:29.139> I<00:04:29.260> said<00:04:29.320> aside<00:04:29.710> from<00:04:29.860> the

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
anywhere like I said aside from the

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.500 
anywhere like I said aside from the
wheels<00:04:30.190> just<00:04:30.310> needing<00:04:30.699> a<00:04:30.760> good<00:04:31.030> detailing

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
wheels just needing a good detailing

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.360 
wheels just needing a good detailing
those<00:04:32.139> are<00:04:32.289> the<00:04:32.380> only<00:04:32.470> spots<00:04:32.800> we<00:04:32.949> see<00:04:33.130> some<00:04:33.340> a

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
those are the only spots we see some a

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.040 
those are the only spots we see some a
little<00:04:33.699> bit<00:04:33.789> of<00:04:33.880> pitting<00:04:34.090> other<00:04:34.750> than<00:04:34.900> that

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
little bit of pitting other than that

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.450 
little bit of pitting other than that
there<00:04:35.229> is<00:04:35.260> no<00:04:35.560> rust<00:04:35.740> on<00:04:35.860> the<00:04:35.979> bike<00:04:36.130> at<00:04:36.310> all<00:04:36.400> it

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
there is no rust on the bike at all it

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.500 
there is no rust on the bike at all it
looks<00:04:36.639> like<00:04:36.760> it's<00:04:36.909> always<00:04:37.150> been<00:04:37.270> kept

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
looks like it's always been kept

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
looks like it's always been kept
endorsed<00:04:38.159> it<00:04:39.159> runs<00:04:39.400> perfect<00:04:39.909> I<00:04:40.349> kind<00:04:41.349> of<00:04:41.380> hate

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
endorsed it runs perfect I kind of hate

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.839 
endorsed it runs perfect I kind of hate
to<00:04:41.560> see<00:04:41.770> it<00:04:41.800> go<00:04:41.919> I<00:04:42.039> was<00:04:42.280> almost<00:04:42.430> tempted<00:04:42.699> to

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:42.849 
to see it go I was almost tempted to

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:44.550 
to see it go I was almost tempted to
just<00:04:43.030> keep<00:04:43.240> them<00:04:43.360> both<00:04:43.510> and<00:04:43.840> have<00:04:44.110> one<00:04:44.349> with<00:04:44.380> a

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
just keep them both and have one with a

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.020 
just keep them both and have one with a
single<00:04:44.770> seat<00:04:45.039> all<00:04:45.220> stripped<00:04:45.550> down<00:04:45.610> have<00:04:45.940> the

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
single seat all stripped down have the

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.360 
single seat all stripped down have the
other<00:04:46.150> one<00:04:46.270> all<00:04:46.389> dressed<00:04:46.690> out<00:04:46.930> but<00:04:47.260> I<00:04:47.470> can't

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
other one all dressed out but I can't

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.339 
other one all dressed out but I can't
afford<00:04:48.460> that<00:04:48.729> so<00:04:49.060> these<00:04:49.840> bikes<00:04:50.050> are<00:04:50.169> getting

00:04:50.339 --> 00:04:50.349 
afford that so these bikes are getting

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:51.960 
afford that so these bikes are getting
harder<00:04:50.590> to<00:04:50.620> find<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:51.220> it's<00:04:51.490> kind<00:04:51.729> of<00:04:51.789> weird

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
harder to find and it's kind of weird

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.490 
harder to find and it's kind of weird
but<00:04:52.180> they're<00:04:52.419> really<00:04:52.630> holding<00:04:52.990> their<00:04:53.110> value

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
but they're really holding their value

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.680 
but they're really holding their value
and<00:04:53.770> in<00:04:53.979> fact<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:54.370> feel<00:04:54.580> like<00:04:54.820> I've<00:04:55.300> seen<00:04:55.539> them

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
and in fact I feel like I've seen them

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.469 
and in fact I feel like I've seen them
almost<00:04:55.840> at<00:04:56.590> least<00:04:56.860> stabilizing<00:04:57.820> value<00:04:58.120> if<00:04:58.300> not

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
almost at least stabilizing value if not

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.390 
almost at least stabilizing value if not
even<00:04:58.599> maybe<00:04:58.930> starting<00:04:59.500> to<00:04:59.590> go<00:04:59.710> back<00:04:59.979> up<00:05:00.250> in

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
even maybe starting to go back up in

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.679 
even maybe starting to go back up in
value<00:05:00.610> just<00:05:00.880> a<00:05:00.970> hair

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:01.689 
value just a hair

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:03.059 
value just a hair
because<00:05:01.869> it's<00:05:02.139> just<00:05:02.379> a<00:05:02.499> really<00:05:02.830> affordable

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:03.069 
because it's just a really affordable

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.850 
because it's just a really affordable
way<00:05:03.429> to<00:05:03.459> get<00:05:03.759> into<00:05:04.089> what<00:05:04.779> everybody<00:05:05.139> riding

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
way to get into what everybody riding

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.850 
way to get into what everybody riding
around<00:05:06.069> town<00:05:06.219> thinks<00:05:06.819> is<00:05:06.939> in<00:05:07.119> Indiana<00:05:07.479> and<00:05:07.860> if

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:08.860 
around town thinks is in Indiana and if

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.229 
around town thinks is in Indiana and if
you<00:05:09.009> bought<00:05:09.159> a<00:05:09.219> bike<00:05:09.459> like<00:05:09.669> this<00:05:09.699> and<00:05:10.059> it<00:05:10.119> was

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:10.239 
you bought a bike like this and it was

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:12.659 
you bought a bike like this and it was
an<00:05:10.329> Indian<00:05:10.569> it<00:05:10.719> would<00:05:10.809> cost<00:05:10.959> you<00:05:11.219> $17,000<00:05:12.219> so

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669 
an Indian it would cost you $17,000 so

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.449 
an Indian it would cost you $17,000 so
for<00:05:13.509> a<00:05:13.539> third<00:05:13.809> of<00:05:13.959> the<00:05:14.049> price<00:05:14.259> and<00:05:14.589> you've<00:05:15.309> got

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:15.459 
for a third of the price and you've got

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:17.399 
for a third of the price and you've got
the<00:05:15.549> reliability<00:05:16.269> of<00:05:16.299> a<00:05:16.509> kawasaki<00:05:16.989> and<00:05:17.259> you

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:17.409 
the reliability of a kawasaki and you

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.219 
the reliability of a kawasaki and you
just<00:05:17.649> can't<00:05:17.919> beat<00:05:18.189> it
