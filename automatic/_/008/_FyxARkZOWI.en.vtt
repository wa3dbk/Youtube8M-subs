what's going through your head to be

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.270 
what's going through your head to be
honest<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:43.620> although<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.980> sounded

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
honest I think although it sounded

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.560 
honest I think although it sounded
strange<00:00:44.520> thing<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.760> say<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.030> think<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.329> having

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
strange thing to say I think that having

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.150 
strange thing to say I think that having
that<00:00:45.660> bit<00:00:45.899> of<00:00:46.020> pressure<00:00:46.230> before<00:00:46.440> from<00:00:46.800> Toyota

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
that bit of pressure before from Toyota

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
that bit of pressure before from Toyota
justified<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> pace<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.450> they<00:00:48.629> said<00:00:48.809> no

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
justified the pace you know they said no

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.569 
justified the pace you know they said no
we<00:00:49.079> can't<00:00:49.289> hang<00:00:49.440> around<00:00:49.469> a<00:00:49.890> drivers<00:00:50.430> much

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
we can't hang around a drivers much

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.010 
we can't hang around a drivers much
happier<00:00:50.969> when<00:00:51.059> he's<00:00:51.210> actually<00:00:51.329> got<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.750> get<00:00:51.870> on

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
happier when he's actually got to get on

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.290 
happier when he's actually got to get on
now<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.739> almost<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.219> all<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.789> can<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.149> is

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
now it's almost like all we can do is

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.299 
now it's almost like all we can do is
lose<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.680> much<00:00:55.860> more<00:00:56.070> difficult

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
lose this so it's a much more difficult

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.950 
lose this so it's a much more difficult
situation<00:00:57.090> here<00:00:57.210> we<00:00:57.270> don't<00:00:57.420> worry<00:00:57.750> where

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
situation here we don't worry where

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
but it is that's interesting that'll

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.660

managed to pick up the fact that there

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.930 
managed to pick up the fact that there
was<00:01:26.110> something<00:01:26.830> thrown<00:01:27.250> in<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.490> air<00:01:27.640> when<00:01:27.850> the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
was something thrown in the air when the

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.270 
was something thrown in the air when the
BMW<00:01:28.660> went<00:01:29.410> through<00:01:29.620> that<00:01:29.770> section<00:01:30.010> of<00:01:30.190> the

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
BMW went through that section of the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.740 
BMW went through that section of the
circuit<00:01:30.490> now<00:01:30.730> whether<00:01:30.940> it<00:01:31.060> flew<00:01:31.270> off<00:01:31.300> the<00:01:31.420> car

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
circuit now whether it flew off the car

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.600 
circuit now whether it flew off the car
whether<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.110> was<00:01:32.290> a<00:01:32.320> bit<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.590> debris<00:01:32.830> see<00:01:33.220> we're

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
whether it was a bit of debris see we're

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.370 
whether it was a bit of debris see we're
back<00:01:33.730> to<00:01:33.880> this<00:01:34.000> degree<00:01:34.360> it<00:01:34.420> was<00:01:34.750> just<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:35.080> look

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
back to this degree it was just a look

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.110 
back to this degree it was just a look
like<00:01:35.500> a<00:01:35.560> little<00:01:35.800> piece<00:01:35.950> of<00:01:36.070> carbon<00:01:36.280> fiber<00:01:36.670> may

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
like a little piece of carbon fiber may

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.300

well<00:01:37.300> mother's<00:01:37.630> been<00:01:37.780> off<00:01:37.900> with<00:01:38.170> BMW<00:01:38.770> but<00:01:39.190> it

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
well mother's been off with BMW but it

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.920 
well mother's been off with BMW but it
may<00:01:39.400> have<00:01:39.520> been<00:01:39.640> sitting<00:01:39.910> out<00:01:40.150> there<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:40.660> think

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
may have been sitting out there I think

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.050 
may have been sitting out there I think
you<00:01:41.230> can<00:01:41.440> blame<00:01:41.860> this<00:01:42.130> BMW<00:01:42.460> for<00:01:42.850> everything

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
you can blame this BMW for everything

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.580 
you can blame this BMW for everything

him that's in his mind I'm sure it

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.250 
him that's in his mind I'm sure it
wasn't<00:01:46.030> but<00:01:46.240> he's<00:01:46.570> going<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.840> be<00:01:46.900> thinking

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
wasn't but he's going to be thinking

wasn't but he's going to be thinking
this<00:01:47.410> car<00:01:47.770> he's<00:01:48.010> been<00:01:48.190> sent<00:01:48.460> out<00:01:48.610> here

Thomas Fisher's BMW and I also feel
that's<00:02:12.340> not<00:02:12.520> right<00:02:12.760> because<00:02:12.820> I<00:02:13.150> think<00:02:13.209> that

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
that's not right because I think that

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.990 
that's not right because I think that
Thomas<00:02:14.350> should<00:02:14.380> realize<00:02:15.010> at<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.370> position

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
Thomas should realize at that position

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000 
Thomas should realize at that position
he<00:02:16.300> had<00:02:16.390> already<00:02:16.570> created<00:02:17.020> enough<00:02:17.440> problems<00:02:17.890> I

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
he had already created enough problems I

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.280 
he had already created enough problems I
would<00:02:18.220> have<00:02:18.310> said<00:02:18.519> that<00:02:18.810> my<00:02:19.810> own<00:02:19.959> view<00:02:20.170> would

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
would have said that my own view would

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.440 
would have said that my own view would
be<00:02:20.440> let<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.160> Toyota<00:02:21.580> past<00:02:21.820> get<00:02:22.090> on<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:22.330> know

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
be let that Toyota past get on you know

be let that Toyota past get on you know
let<00:02:22.660> him<00:02:22.720> go<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:22.900> with<00:02:23.110> his<00:02:23.200> race<00:02:23.410> Kenna<00:02:24.130> Yama's

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
let him go on with his race Kenna Yama's

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.100 
let him go on with his race Kenna Yama's
really<00:02:24.700> taking<00:02:24.940> it<00:02:25.000> easy<00:02:25.120> here<00:02:25.420> look<00:02:25.840> it's<00:02:26.019> not

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
really taking it easy here look it's not

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.680 
really taking it easy here look it's not
even<00:02:26.260> on<00:02:26.470> full<00:02:26.680> throttle<00:02:26.709> that's<00:02:27.670> true<00:02:27.970> so

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
even on full throttle that's true so

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.810 
even on full throttle that's true so
whether<00:02:29.380> that's<00:02:29.590> because<00:02:30.010> he's<00:02:30.280> deciding<00:02:30.730> to

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
whether that's because he's deciding to

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.009 
whether that's because he's deciding to
come<00:02:31.000> in<00:02:31.150> whether<00:02:31.330> there's<00:02:31.510> a<00:02:31.600> problem<00:02:31.900> with

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
come in whether there's a problem with

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.080 
come in whether there's a problem with
the<00:02:32.080> car<00:02:32.290> whether<00:02:32.590> he's<00:02:32.739> just<00:02:32.980> deciding<00:02:33.489> I'm

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
the car whether he's just deciding I'm

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.970 
the car whether he's just deciding I'm
not<00:02:34.360> gonna<00:02:34.510> chase<00:02:35.110> after<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.590> guy<00:02:35.769> at<00:02:35.920> the

not gonna chase after this guy at the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.440 
not gonna chase after this guy at the
moment<00:02:36.250> I<00:02:36.280> just<00:02:36.430> want<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.640> bit<00:02:36.880> of<00:02:36.940> clean<00:02:37.209> air

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450

moment I just want a bit of clean air
last<00:02:37.930> lap<00:02:38.230> was<00:02:38.410> only<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:38.680> 359<00:02:39.489> so<00:02:39.700> really<00:02:39.970> quite

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
last lap was only a 359 so really quite

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.509 
last lap was only a 359 so really quite
slow<00:02:40.690> and<00:02:41.290> perhaps<00:02:41.500> he's<00:02:41.830> feeling<00:02:42.280> some

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
slow and perhaps he's feeling some

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.500 
slow and perhaps he's feeling some
uncomfortable<00:02:43.739> vibrations<00:02:44.739> from<00:02:45.459> the<00:02:46.030> car<00:02:46.239> as

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
uncomfortable vibrations from the car as

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.509 
uncomfortable vibrations from the car as
a<00:02:46.540> result<00:02:46.959> of<00:02:47.170> that<00:02:47.650> puncture<00:02:48.100> earlier<00:02:48.400> on

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
a result of that puncture earlier on

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.970 
a result of that puncture earlier on
it's<00:02:48.670> different
