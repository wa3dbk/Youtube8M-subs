00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.910 
actually all old board games are fun but
this<00:02:43.930> one<00:02:44.080> was<00:02:44.170> just<00:02:44.230> in<00:02:44.440> such<00:02:44.650> great<00:02:44.890> shape

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
this one was just in such great shape

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.600 
this one was just in such great shape
for<00:02:45.430> $2<00:02:46.060> so<00:02:46.840> I<00:02:46.900> had<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.170> get<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.500> and<00:02:47.890> my

but<00:06:25.300> also<00:06:25.509> cool<00:06:25.959> find<00:06:26.259> is<00:06:26.529> I<00:06:26.949> found<00:06:27.129> this<00:06:27.399> chick

00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:27.999 
but also cool find is I found this chick

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:34.369 
but also cool find is I found this chick
lighter<00:06:29.189> see<00:06:30.189> you<00:06:30.909> push<00:06:31.179> here<00:06:31.559> opens<00:06:32.559> up<00:06:32.939> a

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
lighter see you push here opens up a

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:36.209 
lighter see you push here opens up a
bunch<00:06:35.379> of<00:06:35.439> serial<00:06:35.709> numbers<00:06:35.949> you<00:06:36.009> probably

00:06:36.209 --> 00:06:36.219 
bunch of serial numbers you probably

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:38.999 
bunch of serial numbers you probably
can't<00:06:36.399> read<00:06:36.550> on<00:06:36.639> the<00:06:36.699> bottom<00:06:37.589> so<00:06:38.589> here's<00:06:38.860> the

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009 
can't read on the bottom so here's the

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:42.569 
can't read on the bottom so here's the
bottom<00:06:39.249> of<00:06:39.490> the<00:06:39.579> lighter<00:06:41.039> it<00:06:42.039> seems<00:06:42.249> to<00:06:42.369> be<00:06:42.490> in

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:42.579 
bottom of the lighter it seems to be in

00:06:42.579 --> 00:06:43.030 
bottom of the lighter it seems to be in
really<00:06:42.729> good

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:43.040 
really good

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.040 
really good
shape<00:06:43.280> I<00:06:43.580> figured<00:06:44.180> it'd<00:06:44.300> be<00:06:44.450> worth<00:06:44.660> something

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
shape I figured it'd be worth something

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.290 
shape I figured it'd be worth something
I<00:06:45.110> only<00:06:45.230> got<00:06:45.380> it<00:06:45.500> for<00:06:45.620> a<00:06:45.680> dollar

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
I only got it for a dollar

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.800 
I only got it for a dollar
unfortunately<00:06:47.300> it's<00:06:47.420> nothing<00:06:47.660> for<00:06:47.780> like

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
unfortunately it's nothing for like

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.170 
unfortunately it's nothing for like
maybe<00:06:48.530> if<00:06:49.010> I'm<00:06:49.220> lucky<00:06:49.400> I'll<00:06:49.580> get<00:06:49.730> like<00:06:49.850> six

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:50.180 
maybe if I'm lucky I'll get like six

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.880 
maybe if I'm lucky I'll get like six
dollars<00:06:50.360> for<00:06:50.870> it<00:06:51.020> so<00:06:51.730> kind<00:06:52.730> of<00:06:52.970> a<00:06:53.030> fail<00:06:53.300> but

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:53.890 
dollars for it so kind of a fail but

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.040 
dollars for it so kind of a fail but
still<00:06:54.890> was<00:06:55.400> cool<00:06:55.700> fine<00:06:56.060> I<00:06:56.360> thought<00:06:56.810> it'd<00:06:56.930> be

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
still was cool fine I thought it'd be

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
still was cool fine I thought it'd be
worth<00:06:57.410> something<00:06:57.770> but<00:06:57.890> it's<00:06:58.610> not<00:06:58.880> is<00:06:59.750> a<00:07:00.110> pin<00:07:00.650> I

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070 
worth something but it's not is a pin I

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.260 
worth something but it's not is a pin I
just<00:07:01.700> found<00:07:01.850> this<00:07:02.060> in<00:07:02.270> a<00:07:02.330> bunch<00:07:02.450> of<00:07:02.630> pin<00:07:03.380> stuff

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
just found this in a bunch of pin stuff

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.370 
just found this in a bunch of pin stuff
they<00:07:05.270> had<00:07:05.390> a<00:07:05.420> bunch<00:07:05.630> of<00:07:05.810> random<00:07:06.110> stuff<00:07:06.320> like

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
they had a bunch of random stuff like

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:07.930 
they had a bunch of random stuff like
this<00:07:06.560> they<00:07:06.710> were<00:07:06.770> asking<00:07:06.980> like<00:07:07.070> a<00:07:07.190> dollar<00:07:07.550> each

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:07.940 
this they were asking like a dollar each

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.370 
this they were asking like a dollar each
for<00:07:08.210> the<00:07:08.300> stuff<00:07:08.540> and<00:07:08.660> I<00:07:08.750> thought<00:07:08.900> that<00:07:09.050> was<00:07:09.140> way

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:09.380 
for the stuff and I thought that was way

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.120 
for the stuff and I thought that was way
too<00:07:09.410> much<00:07:09.590> but<00:07:10.580> I<00:07:10.940> liked<00:07:11.600> this<00:07:11.870> one<00:07:12.110> because<00:07:12.320> I

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
too much but I liked this one because I

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:15.460 
too much but I liked this one because I
could<00:07:13.670> read<00:07:13.880> the<00:07:14.060> tiny<00:07:14.390> little<00:07:14.720> numbers<00:07:15.140> you

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:15.470 
could read the tiny little numbers you

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.840 
could read the tiny little numbers you
probably<00:07:16.070> cannot<00:07:16.640> see<00:07:16.700> at<00:07:17.030> all<00:07:17.210> on<00:07:17.840> there<00:07:18.850> but

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:19.850 
probably cannot see at all on there but

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:27.940 
probably cannot see at all on there but
it<00:07:20.090> says<00:07:20.300> 1<00:07:22.270> 2012<00:07:23.350> kgf<00:07:24.610> which<00:07:25.900> means<00:07:26.900> it<00:07:27.200> is<00:07:27.230> 12

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:27.950 
it says 1 2012 kgf which means it is 12

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.760 
it says 1 2012 kgf which means it is 12
karat<00:07:28.250> gold<00:07:28.640> filled<00:07:29.200> which<00:07:30.200> is<00:07:30.350> not<00:07:30.470> great

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:30.770 
karat gold filled which is not great

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.170 
karat gold filled which is not great
because<00:07:31.250> it's<00:07:31.340> gold<00:07:31.490> filled<00:07:31.730> stuff<00:07:31.940> never

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:32.180 
because it's gold filled stuff never

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.830 
because it's gold filled stuff never
does<00:07:32.360> well<00:07:32.740> but<00:07:33.740> I<00:07:34.550> only<00:07:35.120> paid<00:07:35.360> a<00:07:35.390> dollar<00:07:35.690> for

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 
does well but I only paid a dollar for

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.520 
does well but I only paid a dollar for
it

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:36.530 
it

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.680 
it
they<00:07:37.100> even<00:07:37.280> has<00:07:37.400> a<00:07:37.430> little<00:07:37.700> Ruby<00:07:38.210> here<00:07:38.510> and

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:38.690 
they even has a little Ruby here and

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.870 
they even has a little Ruby here and
thinker<00:07:39.140> some<00:07:39.890> stone<00:07:40.430> that<00:07:40.580> looks<00:07:40.730> like<00:07:40.790> a

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 
thinker some stone that looks like a

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.000 
thinker some stone that looks like a
ruby<00:07:41.150> you<00:07:41.900> can't<00:07:42.140> see<00:07:42.260> it<00:07:42.350> to<00:07:42.440> own<00:07:42.560> the<00:07:42.680> camera

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:43.010 
ruby you can't see it to own the camera

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.500 
ruby you can't see it to own the camera
unfortunately<00:07:43.100> my<00:07:43.730> estimate<00:07:44.120> for<00:07:44.240> this<00:07:44.360> is

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:44.510 
unfortunately my estimate for this is

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.150 
unfortunately my estimate for this is
it's<00:07:44.630> gonna<00:07:44.720> sell<00:07:44.990> for<00:07:45.200> maybe<00:07:45.530> ten<00:07:45.800> dollars

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 
it's gonna sell for maybe ten dollars

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.560 
it's gonna sell for maybe ten dollars
it's<00:07:46.730> pretty<00:07:46.910> cool<00:07:47.120> though<00:07:47.270> when<00:07:47.450> you're

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.570 
it's pretty cool though when you're

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.180 
it's pretty cool though when you're
searching<00:07:47.840> through<00:07:48.050> stuff<00:07:48.500> that<00:07:48.980> other

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.190
