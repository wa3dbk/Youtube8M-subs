00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.059
 great emotions were experienced last night in 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.190
 a new chapter in the forest where 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.900
 battles between the teams that fought 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.910
 the talent of future promises 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.170
 musicals in looking 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.170
 from new to which 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.520
 with me 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.700
 thank you 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.900
 on the other hand we met the mentors 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.870
 of the cars our cars will not be 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.840
 alone in his mission then he has the 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.390
 help from janet with 14 years of career in 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.520
 one of the most successful duos is without 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.910
 doubt a recognized figure in music 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.190
 urban 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.320
 natalia jimÃ©nez has recruited the 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.850
 singer-songwriter kany garcia who has 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.760
 placed in the first places of 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.680
 popularity at the international level 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.510
 deserves two ongo awards in the 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.390
 first battle was the team 's 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.050
 natalia composed by daniel twist and 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.050
 samantha 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:36.070
 Battle of the quake was between 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.070
 sachs and the end pain and affection 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.340
 two 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.480
 do not miss the next episode of the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.800
 I look up and on Sundays at 7 8 downtown 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.080
 only by telemundo 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.330
 and the truth is that each chapter of the 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.040
 voice that I made is very emotional but once 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.200
 that the battles begin already as 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.270
 you're pieces to eat your nails so that's 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.490
 we wish the best to all 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.590

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.440
 Sunday this show where they are discovered 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.180
 these talented children besides that 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.620
 super exciting the fact that all 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.410
 we are slower so the coaches look 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.510
 in that position of eliminating one is 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.700
 difficult is definitely already known by each 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.700
