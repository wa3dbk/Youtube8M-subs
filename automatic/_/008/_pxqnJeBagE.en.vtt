00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.250 

what<00:00:01.370> you're<00:00:01.520> looking<00:00:01.640> at<00:00:01.939> here<00:00:02.000> is<00:00:02.270> wood

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:03.260 
what you're looking at here is wood

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.010 
what you're looking at here is wood
siding<00:00:03.620> and<00:00:04.040> it's<00:00:04.670> next<00:00:04.940> to<00:00:05.089> a<00:00:05.210> window<00:00:05.450> that

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:06.020 
siding and it's next to a window that

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.409 
siding and it's next to a window that
looks<00:00:06.319> like<00:00:06.529> somehow<00:00:07.400> the<00:00:07.520> window<00:00:07.970> has<00:00:08.179> been

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:08.419 
looks like somehow the window has been

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:12.699 
looks like somehow the window has been
leaking<00:00:09.999> for<00:00:10.999> quite<00:00:11.240> some<00:00:11.539> time<00:00:11.570> and<00:00:12.379> again

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:12.709 
leaking for quite some time and again

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:14.709 
leaking for quite some time and again
don't<00:00:13.039> forget<00:00:13.099> that<00:00:13.669> moisture<00:00:14.329> will

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
don't forget that moisture will

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.490 
don't forget that moisture will
accumulate<00:00:15.259> on<00:00:15.739> a<00:00:16.129> glass<00:00:16.429> window<00:00:17.080> if<00:00:18.080> it<00:00:18.349> is

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
accumulate on a glass window if it is

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.310 
accumulate on a glass window if it is
hot<00:00:18.710> on<00:00:19.009> the<00:00:19.279> outside<00:00:19.550> and<00:00:20.419> cold<00:00:20.900> on<00:00:21.169> the

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 
hot on the outside and cold on the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.669 
hot on the outside and cold on the
inside<00:00:21.740> and<00:00:22.070> of<00:00:22.220> course<00:00:22.429> vice<00:00:22.640> versa<00:00:23.679> this

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:24.679 
inside and of course vice versa this

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.630 
inside and of course vice versa this
moisture<00:00:25.220> will<00:00:25.249> leak<00:00:25.910> down<00:00:26.269> and<00:00:27.640> eventually

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
moisture will leak down and eventually

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.370 
moisture will leak down and eventually
you<00:00:28.880> will<00:00:29.119> end<00:00:29.390> up<00:00:29.539> with<00:00:29.749> something<00:00:30.140> like<00:00:30.320> this

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
you will end up with something like this

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.270 
you will end up with something like this
if<00:00:30.949> the<00:00:31.789> window<00:00:32.660> wasn't<00:00:33.289> installed<00:00:33.860> properly

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
if the window wasn't installed properly

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.520 
if the window wasn't installed properly
and<00:00:34.730> when<00:00:34.879> I<00:00:34.910> say<00:00:35.300> that<00:00:35.570> realistically<00:00:36.379> the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
and when I say that realistically the

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.049 
and when I say that realistically the
window<00:00:36.829> could<00:00:37.039> even<00:00:37.190> be<00:00:37.399> installed<00:00:37.789> properly

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
window could even be installed properly

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.400 
window could even be installed properly
and<00:00:39.070> by<00:00:40.070> properly<00:00:40.640> I<00:00:40.670> mean<00:00:41.239> through<00:00:41.989> regular

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
and by properly I mean through regular

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.959 
and by properly I mean through regular
construction<00:00:43.629> methods<00:00:44.629> but<00:00:45.609> you<00:00:46.609> know<00:00:46.730> this

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
construction methods but you know this

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.740 
construction methods but you know this
is<00:00:47.120> where<00:00:47.359> even<00:00:48.140> standard<00:00:48.590> construction

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
is where even standard construction

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.650 
is where even standard construction
methods<00:00:50.750> could<00:00:51.469> leave<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.579> homeowners<00:00:53.480> with

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
methods could leave the homeowners with

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.450 
methods could leave the homeowners with
something<00:00:54.109> like<00:00:54.289> this<00:00:54.469> and<00:00:54.679> again<00:00:54.859> I<00:00:54.920> see<00:00:55.250> this

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
something like this and again I see this

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.180 
something like this and again I see this
a<00:00:55.489> lot<00:00:55.760> and<00:00:56.179> I<00:00:56.269> believe<00:00:56.719> this<00:00:56.870> is

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
a lot and I believe this is

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.400 
a lot and I believe this is
realistically<00:00:58.190> one<00:00:58.429> of<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.579> reasons<00:00:58.969> why

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
realistically one of the reasons why

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.380 
realistically one of the reasons why
you're<00:01:00.410> starting<00:01:00.769> to<00:01:00.890> see<00:01:01.070> more<00:01:01.100> stucco<00:01:02.089> or

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
you're starting to see more stucco or

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.650 
you're starting to see more stucco or
foam<00:01:02.960> based<00:01:03.550> exterior<00:01:04.550> applications<00:01:05.300> and

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
foam based exterior applications and

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.010 
foam based exterior applications and
getting<00:01:06.230> away<00:01:06.350> from<00:01:07.040> wood<00:01:07.730> because<00:01:08.660> people

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
getting away from wood because people

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.090 
getting away from wood because people
are<00:01:09.110> tired<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.530> repairs<00:01:10.430> like<00:01:10.670> this<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.420> know

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
are tired of repairs like this you know

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.740 
are tired of repairs like this you know
and<00:01:13.100> again<00:01:13.400> here's<00:01:13.700> here's<00:01:14.120> the<00:01:14.180> windows<00:01:14.540> kind

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
and again here's here's the windows kind

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.450 
and again here's here's the windows kind
of<00:01:14.870> a<00:01:14.930> closer<00:01:15.200> look<00:01:15.590> at<00:01:15.800> it<00:01:15.980> you<00:01:16.100> can<00:01:16.280> see

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
of a closer look at it you can see

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.990 
of a closer look at it you can see
there's<00:01:18.580> sisal<00:01:19.580> craft

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 
there's sisal craft

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.620 
there's sisal craft
paper<00:01:20.920> around<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.270> bottom<00:01:23.270> of<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.450> window

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
paper around the bottom of the window

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.160 
paper around the bottom of the window
and<00:01:24.320> it<00:01:24.500> looks<00:01:24.680> like<00:01:24.860> it's<00:01:25.070> it<00:01:25.280> was<00:01:25.370> you<00:01:25.850> know

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
and it looks like it's it was you know

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.460 
and it looks like it's it was you know
applied<00:01:27.170> properly<00:01:28.130> but<00:01:29.140> realistically<00:01:30.140> when

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
applied properly but realistically when

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.920 
applied properly but realistically when
I<00:01:30.500> say<00:01:30.770> properly<00:01:31.190> it's<00:01:31.640> not<00:01:32.090> doing<00:01:32.570> you<00:01:32.690> much

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
I say properly it's not doing you much

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.890 
I say properly it's not doing you much
good<00:01:32.960> I<00:01:33.740> can't<00:01:34.430> really<00:01:34.610> think<00:01:34.730> of<00:01:35.090> any<00:01:35.360> way

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
good I can't really think of any way

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.670 
good I can't really think of any way
that<00:01:36.440> you<00:01:36.710> could<00:01:36.860> avoid<00:01:37.130> something<00:01:37.520> like<00:01:37.730> this

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
that you could avoid something like this

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.870 
that you could avoid something like this
unless<00:01:39.680> you<00:01:39.860> put<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.160> window<00:01:40.340> on<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.730> outside

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
unless you put the window on the outside

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.020 
unless you put the window on the outside
of<00:01:41.870> deciding<00:01:42.620> you<00:01:43.070> know<00:01:43.100> you've<00:01:43.520> got<00:01:43.790> to<00:01:43.940> get

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
of deciding you know you've got to get

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.680 
of deciding you know you've got to get
the<00:01:44.180> moisture<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.630> your<00:01:44.660> your<00:01:45.350> window<00:01:45.770> is

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
the moisture of your your window is

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.720 
the moisture of your your window is
leaking<00:01:47.690> and<00:01:47.870> it's<00:01:48.410> providing<00:01:49.370> you<00:01:49.520> with<00:01:49.550> a

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:49.730 
leaking and it's providing you with a

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.660 
leaking and it's providing you with a
steady<00:01:50.000> supply<00:01:50.210> of<00:01:50.540> moisture<00:01:50.740> behind<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
steady supply of moisture behind the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.910 
steady supply of moisture behind the
wood<00:01:52.910> siding<00:01:53.330> you<00:01:54.140> know<00:01:54.260> it<00:01:54.440> might<00:01:54.650> be<00:01:54.830> in

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
wood siding you know it might be in

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.590 
wood siding you know it might be in
front<00:01:55.190> of<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.400> building<00:01:55.760> paper<00:01:56.030> but<00:01:56.450> it's

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
front of the building paper but it's

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.020 
front of the building paper but it's
behind<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.440> wood<00:01:57.710> you're<00:01:58.190> gonna<00:01:58.370> woods<00:01:58.880> going

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
behind the wood you're gonna woods going

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.890 
behind the wood you're gonna woods going
to<00:01:59.120> get<00:01:59.270> wet

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
to get wet

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.980 
to get wet
and<00:02:00.640> there<00:02:01.640> isn't<00:02:01.850> much<00:02:02.090> you're<00:02:02.480> going<00:02:02.660> to<00:02:02.840> be

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
and there isn't much you're going to be

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.420 
and there isn't much you're going to be
able<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.470> do<00:02:03.620> about<00:02:03.890> it

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
able to do about it

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.660 
able to do about it
so<00:02:04.610> again<00:02:05.000> problems<00:02:05.840> like<00:02:06.050> these<00:02:06.350> will<00:02:06.920> be<00:02:06.950> a

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
so again problems like these will be a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.480 
so again problems like these will be a
little<00:02:08.000> worse<00:02:08.209> in<00:02:08.629> areas<00:02:09.409> with

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
little worse in areas with

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.800 
little worse in areas with
higher<00:02:11.150> humidity<00:02:11.480> more<00:02:12.140> moisture<00:02:12.650> in<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.070> air

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
higher humidity more moisture in the air

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.300 
higher humidity more moisture in the air
and<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.930> course<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.560> know<00:02:15.650> problem<00:02:16.010> like<00:02:16.160> this

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
and of course you know problem like this

like this could have happened because

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.890

soaking the crap out of the wood siding

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.840 
soaking the crap out of the wood siding
you've<00:02:33.170> got<00:02:33.500> to<00:02:33.740> keep<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.190> moisture<00:02:34.640> away
