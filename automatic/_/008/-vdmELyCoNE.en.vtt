00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.060
 Hello everyone, this issue of enem 2014 is 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.010
 the question that involves knowledge there 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.050
 our elementary school 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.990
 she said that during the second war 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.880
 a technique was used to decipher 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.090
 secret messages based on 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.420
 decomposition into prime factors therein 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.810
 number n is given by the expression 2 raised 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.590
 x times five high ayr 7 and taken to 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.830
 z 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.430
 in which x and y are integers not 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.410
 negative we know that n is a multiple of 10 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.430
 and is not multiple of seven the number of 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:44.520
 dn different dn dividers is which is good 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.180
 then we have the number n which is equal 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.750
 a 2 would take x5 carried ay and a 7 raise a 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.840
 12 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.510
 the problem says that it is a multiple of 10 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.449
 then it will be based on this 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.300
 expression here and also says that he does not 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.640
 is a multiple of 7 which leads us to 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.369
 conclusion that jay z is equal to zero 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.700
 because 7/0 is one then it will not be the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.460
 last of seven right but to us 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.560
 find out how many are 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.560
 divisors of this number n 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.659
 we had to go back there in the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.270
 our knowledge and remember that the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.659
 calculation of the number of dividers of a 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.580
 determined number n being greater than 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.390
 what a nerd says here is a number 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.380
 negative integer is and in this case 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.500
 different from zero in factoring 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.920
 this number is neither billed in the factors 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.530
 cousins 2 taken x3 taken and these five 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.990
 high aze out there 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.159
 depends on the number being these 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.899
 expoentes xyz belonging to the set of 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.930
 natural numbers 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.780
 we can calculate this number of 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.590
 based on the so-called 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.110
 fundamental principle of the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.649
 says that the number of divisors of a 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:11.280
 term is equal to the exponent 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.530
 plus 11 times the exponent of the second 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.900
 prime number plus one 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.480
 the exponent of the third prime number 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.670
 one and so on 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.610
 then knowing this principle 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.360
 fundamentally the issue is resolved 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.420
 for our 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.260
 in our case the number n we have to 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:35.220
 the number of divisors is equal to x + 1 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:39.060
 times and more 11 times and one more 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.069
 this - a divisor because among them - a 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.610
 divisor here is different because the 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:48.570
 problem tells us that it is we should 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:51.120
 consider the different dn dividers 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.090
 So when I only go here without 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:58.019
 subtract 11 I have all the divisors 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:01.260
 of this number n including himself if I 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.410
 subtract one I will tell a divider to 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.170
 less than in this case is the enemy itself 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.530
 Okay, so the answer to that question is 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.370
 letra is beauty do you have doubts let us 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.989
 comments 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.989
 This is until the next
