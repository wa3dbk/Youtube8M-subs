00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 not there right away the reactions in 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:09.330
 changing rooms with first eriko 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.460
 fabbro then there will be saÃ¯d belkalem 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.949
 and roger lemerre the coach of the cs 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.410
 constantine marie past I have a beautiful 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.930
 match we will overtake with the zm after 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.060
 two incredible matches that's either 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.480
 team 1 a partnership wins full 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.630
 with 15 minutes is done a lot in 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.529
 concentrating mostly on the left sides 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.170
 I made some changes on the map 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.850
 intact and that the company was going to 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.620
 complained of being jean de luz 1 me dont 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.940
 the team is playing better I think of 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.039
 constantine after the red card of ben 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.300
 ammar and the team gave their all 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.739
 no longer won at this very important 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.059
 for us it will be a click for 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.339
 however she has until wins a 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.670
 match where the outspoken talk of click 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.540
 the team I like football I think a good 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.479
 soccer 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.180
 all saints sweet way even a 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.970
 box the hunting import tonight 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.130
 maybe 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.270
 luck remembers the jsk and 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.270
 will lose the next match 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.520
 today to face screw there it is 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.900
 true maybe in the first half we have 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.910
 had difficulty getting into the 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.190
 match but in the second half 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.720
 this is true we lose first 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.660
 allowing to cash a bad scorer 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.330
 moment maybe this is the one that we 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.910
 may have disrupted first 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.890
 half time have already but be careful we have 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.270
 spoken between us other players in the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.370
 cloakroom 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.200
 that's good second reaction life 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.120
 half time they do not see there we scored 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.820
 the first goal of equalization 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.190
 after maybe that motivated us 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.869
 in the end we could see who is the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.390
 second goal and in the end it's true 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.310
 it's not it's not easy to manage the 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.660
 match ten but we did bah on 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.190
 thanks anyway the players for having 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.190
 provided so much effort 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.119
 to say that we met a great 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.119
 from Algeria 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.760
 his 10 years the reference in Algeria we 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.650
 like it or not 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.850
 even if the club of Algiers also does and this 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.740
 athletically tonight we were 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.180
 really struggling because this 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.180
 jsk is a 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.910
 the physical strength that emerges from this 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.060
 team there maybe we have been 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.770
 in trouble yes in the contacts in 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:47.210
 the duels 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:50.660
 except two central champions 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:53.210
 organize forces after that was very 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.720
 very very powerful and very exhausting for 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.540
 everyone in the middle and even in front 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.150
 since it's really an ethics 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.050
 very well organized also with people 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.900
 of 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:09.550
 we could think in the first half that 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.300
 6th 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.300
 a better result 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.920
 the jsk is back it is not necessary either 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:20.260
 forget about a stopped kick but 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.530
 we also did a lot 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.359
 far too many mistakes what this 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.590
 which explains a little too appreciated at 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:29.910
 me is that we belong to the moment 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.790
 you fail is that you are 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:37.200
 and that we can not forget but so 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:41.240
 go football but it's also true that the 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:45.410
 defeat is bad 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.180
 it always hurts even at cc paste 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.640
 its strengths that we have these weaknesses and 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.350
 I think in the light 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.060
 we're going to straighten up we'll go back a little 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.830
 in rank in the standings 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.680
 because if adventurous kept this to 0 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.990
 we stayed or won even the nagy sk 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.230
 in terms of accounting on a plan 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.230
 accounting
