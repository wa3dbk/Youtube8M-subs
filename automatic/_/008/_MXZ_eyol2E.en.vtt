00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.670
 to unscrew the meter you need 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.429
 simply a pliers power strip and 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.830
 you're already coming to davis and the 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.040
 cape of storytellers who are here so 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:19.560
 do not press too fast 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.910
 to break and so you turn to the beginning 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:31.109
 you can turn it to the next pass 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:36.390
 you finish by hand here is the cap of 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:38.700
 storyteller and remove to reposition the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.250
 counters cap so the square you 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.379
 will come to position him in the 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.579
 counter delicately you do have a 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.129
 little bit so that they can without 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.559
 limp in and you then mostly forced 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.030
 to impose their there to break for 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.079
 to break the meter must go all 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.600
 only once he is positioned you 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.710
 tighten the nut so you tighten 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.560
 the nut in your hand and when you have a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:13.110
 you just shake their resistance with 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.729
 a pliers power strip makes you a little 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.820
 quarter turn a little dessert the cape 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:25.979

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.140

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.210

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.979
 pretty fragile is making everything fit 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.740
 slowly 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.680
 you are squeezing at the beginning so 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.710
 positioned well cable right by 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.850

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:48.750

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.990
 quarter turn or even a half turn to 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.659
