of my teammates to back me up and I just

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.010 
of my teammates to back me up and I just
magically<00:00:56.370> stumbled<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.059> gameplay<00:00:57.329> um

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
magically stumbled on this gameplay um

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.990 
magically stumbled on this gameplay um
it<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> quite<00:00:58.829> long<00:00:59.160> kem<00:00:59.520> strikes<00:00:59.789> like<00:00:59.969> a

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it is a quite long kem strikes like a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.430 
it is a quite long kem strikes like a
four-minute<00:01:00.510> something<00:01:00.870> can<00:01:01.020> strike<00:01:01.289> but

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
four-minute something can strike but

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.869 
four-minute something can strike but
there's<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.649> couple<00:01:01.829> nice<00:01:02.129> feed<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
there's a couple nice feed here and

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.179 
there's a couple nice feed here and
there<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.930> enemy<00:01:04.199> team<00:01:04.439> some<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.129> them

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
there and the enemy team some of them

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.250 
there and the enemy team some of them
back<00:01:05.400> out<00:01:05.580> so<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.119> slows<00:01:06.360> down<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.840> game<00:01:06.869> play

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
back out so it slows down the game play

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.820 
back out so it slows down the game play
and<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.920> was<00:01:08.070> also<00:01:08.250> playing<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.790> kill<00:01:09.510> whores

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
and I was also playing with kill whores

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.960 
and I was also playing with kill whores
some<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> guys<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.340> were<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.490> me<00:01:11.850> they

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
some of the guys that were with me they

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.460 
some of the guys that were with me they
silly<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.360> line<00:01:12.630> they<00:01:12.780> got<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> lot<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.140> kills

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
silly a line they got a lot of kills

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.920 
silly a line they got a lot of kills
just<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:14.010> me<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.330> slowed<00:01:15.630> down<00:01:15.869> a

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
just like me so that slowed down a

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.090 
just like me so that slowed down a
little<00:01:16.110> bit<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:16.530> other<00:01:16.650> than<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:16.799> it's<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
little bit but other than that it's a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.820 
little bit but other than that it's a
nice<00:01:17.280> kem<00:01:17.549> strike<00:01:17.880> Oh<00:01:18.060> miss<00:01:18.810> my<00:01:19.020> first<00:01:19.320> one<00:01:19.560> I

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
don't think that's an even playing field

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.400 
don't think that's an even playing field
in<00:04:20.700> my<00:04:20.789> opinion

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
in my opinion

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.130 
in my opinion
easily<00:04:21.980> we<00:04:22.490> could<00:04:22.700> take<00:04:23.420> the<00:04:23.570> wicked<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.930> lead

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
easily we could take the wicked a lead

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.170 
easily we could take the wicked a lead
and<00:04:24.290> divide<00:04:24.590> it<00:04:24.620> in<00:04:24.890> half<00:04:24.920> and<00:04:25.400> 50<00:04:25.820> people<00:04:26.120> are

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
and divide it in half and 50 people are

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.690 
and divide it in half and 50 people are
active<00:04:26.660> we'll<00:04:26.840> just<00:04:27.050> massacre<00:04:27.590> dude<00:04:27.770> but

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700
