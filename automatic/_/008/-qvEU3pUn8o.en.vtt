00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.070
 j 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.349
 do not do 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:22.319
 reiss this 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:24.019
 worms that we have here 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.099
 on the sheet 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.659
 for years 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:32.509
 because this is the culprit of the soy producers who have all these years the truth 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.530
 is that he is hungry 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.060
 and wanting to grow up to 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.990
 after forming at that time there are no things that we see in the field fluttering 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.320
 between the flowers 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.560
 efe are still looking for 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.160
 that attacks only the French 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.130
 esther that is called the geranium butterfly 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.240
 come out of this musical 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.610
 the butterflies before arriving fast they only have different stages the 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.260
 first would be the egg 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.310
 then 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.299
 of the eggs the little worms are born 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.420
 that practically when they are so tiny we can not see them 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.409
 they start eating the plants 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.409
 and we do not know what it is 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.790
 the muse goes to the next stadium that occurred when lusa has not grown 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.180
 it becomes a chrysalis 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.180
 and the taxation again transforms the butterfly 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.510
 the butterflies are practically harmless 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.140
 they are even beneficial because 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.560
 promotes the pollination of flowers 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.960
 and they only eat nectar from the flowers 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.140
 instead 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.420
 the spurs have 2 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.790
 are those that the case of the mind wreak havoc on these plants 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.920
 eating on the flowers and leaves and stems of our plants 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.600
 when we save what 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.600
 by the way there are butterflies fluttering among our flowers 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.570
 they are probably laying eggs 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.220
 then at fifteen days if the fed if the temperatures have accompanied 

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:13.879
 we have to be aware of pearce if the first objects appear is 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:14.649
 remarkable 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:19.109
 that the butterfly eggs have hatched and the larvae begin to 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.049
 eat a hundred leaves and flowers of our plants other than 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.499
 of the places where 

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:27.429
 and the worms usually attack and a lot 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.439
 southeast of the fruit vienna apples pears peaches 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:32.479
 when the fruit 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.909
 the genital issste 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:36.369
 is going to take a little bit of shape 

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:40.599
 look at the fruit they put us inside who make this breakdown and then 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.149
 that when we're going to eat the apple 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:45.589
 we found that he signed with 40 

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:48.989
 to fight caterpillars that can affect our plants 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:53.439
 we can use well 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:58.089
 my ecological product can be abÃ¡s in extracts of axis san telmo this 

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.489
 product works very well 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.599
 Applying once every 15 days 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.370
 the most likely thing is that the butterflies do not enter to lay eggs they will do these 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.370
 plants and therefore we do not have back the flat of the caterpillars 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:12.779
 i this other one is specific to 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:14.799
 alamar and wells per year 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.819
 the caterpillar this one that gets inside him 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.649
 the payo of the geranium that taught them at the beginning 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.659
 because this one fights but that very well to others 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:27.120
 and preventively we have these two products what 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.540
 the operation making a monthly application 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:35.589
 we could avoid that our geraniums with these plants have 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:37.149
 mists 

00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:39.619
 and in the same way the fruit trees 

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:42.619
 every 15 days if we do an insecticide treatment 

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:44.619
 we can avoid 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.290
 that then we have apples like these that are in the network 

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:53.049
 well with these tips that we have given we hope you do not have and instincts 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:56.349
 unwanted linens or our fruits or flowers samples 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.519
 and the only worms you have and houses are 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.729
 those of your children 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.729
 when 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:08.569
 but also
