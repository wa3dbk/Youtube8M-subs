it called now bell tower and then lugia

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.750 
it called now bell tower and then lugia
level<00:03:47.400> 46<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.150> did<00:03:48.510> get<00:03:48.660> it<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.840> little<00:03:48.959> bit<00:03:49.380> 45<00:03:49.890> 40

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
level 46 I did get it a little bit 45 40

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.710 
level 46 I did get it a little bit 45 40
but<00:03:51.630> I<00:03:51.660> used<00:03:52.170> as<00:03:52.350> nearly<00:03:52.590> 4<00:03:52.920> as<00:03:53.070> you<00:03:53.190> guys<00:03:53.310> know

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
but I used as nearly 4 as you guys know

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.120 
but I used as nearly 4 as you guys know
I<00:03:54.720> don't<00:03:55.079> remember<00:03:55.230> if<00:03:55.440> I<00:03:55.500> thought<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.829> moves

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
I don't remember if I thought it moves

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.390 
I don't remember if I thought it moves
or<00:03:56.280> not<00:03:56.400> but<00:03:56.670> yeah<00:03:57.049> they<00:03:58.049> have<00:03:58.380> one<00:03:58.590> medially<00:03:59.130> 4

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
or not but yeah they have one medially 4

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.920 
or not but yeah they have one medially 4
so<00:03:59.640> it's<00:03:59.790> that<00:03:59.970> epoch<00:04:00.269> if<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:00.510> want<00:04:00.690> it<00:04:00.810> you

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
so it's that epoch if you want it you

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.330 
so it's that epoch if you want it you
know<00:04:01.079> choose<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:02.359> anyway<00:04:03.359> that's<00:04:04.100> that's<00:04:05.100> it

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
know choose that anyway that's that's it

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.220 
know choose that anyway that's that's it
I<00:04:05.459> guess<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:06.390> I<00:04:06.540> thought<00:04:06.660> I<00:04:06.720> had<00:04:06.900> more<00:04:07.049> in<00:04:07.140> the
