okay just a quick little video of the

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.920 
okay just a quick little video of the
pad<00:00:05.009> i<00:00:05.040> received<00:00:05.520> today<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:06.000> thought<00:00:06.779> I'd

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
pad i received today I thought I'd

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.400 
pad i received today I thought I'd
ordered<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:08.090> h<00:00:09.090> AI<00:00:09.360> pad<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.370> this<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.519> what<00:00:11.700> came

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
ordered a h AI pad and this is what came

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.959 
ordered a h AI pad and this is what came
looks<00:00:13.410> very<00:00:13.620> much<00:00:13.799> like<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.730> haven't

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
looks very much like it it's I haven't

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.359 
looks very much like it it's I haven't
pulled<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.269> stuff<00:00:15.509> off<00:00:15.690> in<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.020> got<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> nice

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
pulled the stuff off in it's got a nice

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.939 
pulled the stuff off in it's got a nice
aluminum<00:00:17.660> side<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.020> it's<00:00:19.650> got<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.830> little

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
aluminum side to it it's got a little

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.849 
aluminum side to it it's got a little
green<00:00:20.220> light<00:00:20.400> when<00:00:20.580> it's<00:00:20.699> running<00:00:21.859> looks

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
green light when it's running looks

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.300 
green light when it's running looks
pretty<00:00:23.039> much<00:00:23.310> just<00:00:23.580> like<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.859> but<00:00:25.859> as<00:00:26.039> you<00:00:26.160> can

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
pretty much just like it but as you can

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.529 
pretty much just like it but as you can
tell<00:00:26.369> it's<00:00:26.760> running<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.090> slightly<00:00:27.300> different

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
tell it's running a slightly different

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.780 
tell it's running a slightly different
firmware<00:00:29.779> it's<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.230> newer<00:00:31.410> version<00:00:31.790> I

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
firmware it's a it's a newer version I

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.910 
firmware it's a it's a newer version I
think<00:00:33.660> from<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.290> I've<00:00:34.410> been<00:00:34.440> reading<00:00:34.649> online

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
think from what I've been reading online

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.380 
think from what I've been reading online
or<00:00:35.340> possibly<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.420> knockoff<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:38.210> yeah<00:00:39.210> let

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
or possibly just a knockoff and yeah let

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.880 
or possibly just a knockoff and yeah let
me<00:00:39.480> just<00:00:39.510> first<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.050> all<00:00:40.140> show<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.410> things

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
me just first of all show you things

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.900 
me just first of all show you things
about<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.340> device<00:00:41.670> here<00:00:43.100> you<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.280> see<00:00:44.550> maybe

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
about the device here you can see maybe

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.900 
about the device here you can see maybe
you<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.480> there<00:00:45.719> so<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:47.070> it<00:00:47.610> says

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
you can see that there so it's it says

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.600 
you can see that there so it's it says
that<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.270> running<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.899> firmware<00:00:49.649> that's

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
that it's running a firmware that's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.650 
that it's running a firmware that's
dated<00:00:51.030> from<00:00:51.469> September<00:00:52.469> fourth<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.660> the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
dated from September fourth and the

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.340 
dated from September fourth and the
colonel<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.199> 29<00:00:55.789> with<00:00:56.789> 188<00:00:57.329> as<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.870> diversion

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
colonel is 29 with 188 as the diversion

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.700 
colonel is 29 with 188 as the diversion
there<00:00:59.809> but<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.230> is<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> initial

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
there but I think this is the initial

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.110 
there but I think this is the initial
version<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.280> firmware<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.730> was<00:01:02.850> put<00:01:03.030> up

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
version of the firmware that was put up

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.830 
version of the firmware that was put up
for<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.359> device<00:01:03.890> it<00:01:05.060> it<00:01:06.060> seems<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.510> connect

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
for this device it it seems to connect

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.929 
for this device it it seems to connect
just<00:01:06.990> fine<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.470> my<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> my<00:01:07.860> Wi-Fi<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.520> stuff<00:01:08.700> I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
just fine to my to my Wi-Fi and stuff I

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.500 
just fine to my to my Wi-Fi and stuff I
even<00:01:09.119> all-stock<00:01:09.420> connected<00:01:09.840> right<00:01:10.020> now<00:01:11.510> I've

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
even all-stock connected right now I've

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.149 
even all-stock connected right now I've
tried<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> couple<00:01:13.170> different<00:01:13.380> games<00:01:13.770> on<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
tried out a couple different games on it

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.039 
tried out a couple different games on it
and<00:01:14.310> some<00:01:15.030> work<00:01:15.240> fine<00:01:15.600> some<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:16.920> much<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
and some work fine some not so much the

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.800 
and some work fine some not so much the
wave<00:01:19.049> blaster<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:20.130> seams<00:01:20.970> always<00:01:21.240> turn<00:01:21.479> full

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
wave blaster the seams always turn full

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.050 
wave blaster the seams always turn full
to<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.020> right<00:01:22.290> if<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.189> hold<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.610> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
to the right if I hold it like this I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.749 
to the right if I hold it like this I
can<00:01:24.240> kind<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.509> steer<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.080> seems<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.439> be<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.680> a

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:25.759 
can kind of steer so it seems to be on a

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.149 
can kind of steer so it seems to be on a
90<00:01:26.759> degree<00:01:26.909> angle<00:01:27.119> they're<00:01:27.590> raging<00:01:28.590> thunder

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
90 degree angle they're raging thunder

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.350 
90 degree angle they're raging thunder
runs<00:01:30.030> but<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.640> takes<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> long<00:01:32.820> time<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.090> load

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
runs but the takes a long time to load

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.780 
runs but the takes a long time to load
and<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.960> cars<00:01:34.200> don't<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.680> any<00:01:34.829> textures<00:01:35.610> on

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
and the cars don't have any textures on

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.219 
and the cars don't have any textures on
them<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> does<00:01:36.509> handle<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:36.900> steering

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
them but it does handle the steering

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.069 
them but it does handle the steering
properly<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.850> tilt<00:01:38.850> display<00:01:39.270> here<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
properly a tilt display here the the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.130 
properly a tilt display here the the
labyrinth<00:01:40.439> game<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.829> works<00:01:41.040> fine<00:01:41.509> and<00:01:45.140> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
labyrinth game it works fine and it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.690 
labyrinth game it works fine and it
actually<00:01:46.259> has<00:01:46.500> 3d<00:01:46.829> walls<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.340> stuff<00:01:47.460> which<00:01:47.670> is

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
actually has 3d walls and stuff which is

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.580 
actually has 3d walls and stuff which is
a<00:01:47.820> little<00:01:48.000> different<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.570> here's<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.350> game

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
a little different and here's a game

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.649 
a little different and here's a game
that<00:01:49.740> comes<00:01:49.979> on<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:51.000> one<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.210> didn't<00:01:51.540> get

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
that comes on it this one I didn't get

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.170 
that comes on it this one I didn't get
from<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.049> marketplace<00:01:52.820> which<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.909> haven't

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
from the marketplace which I haven't

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.039 
from the marketplace which I haven't
even<00:01:54.240> tried<00:01:54.509> before<00:01:56.479> so<00:01:57.479> I'm<00:01:57.540> assuming<00:01:57.659> this

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
even tried before so I'm assuming this

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.679 
even tried before so I'm assuming this
will<00:01:58.229> work<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:59.159> kind<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.460> see<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.729> 3d<00:02:00.030> effect

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
will work you kind of see the 3d effect

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.740 
will work you kind of see the 3d effect
on<00:02:01.200> there<00:02:01.579> must<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.729> some<00:02:02.909> way<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.030> hit<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.479> I

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
on there must be some way to hit this I

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:13.450 
on there must be some way to hit this I
guess<00:02:04.259> there<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.530> go

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.320 

there<00:02:14.030> we<00:02:14.180> go<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.630> can<00:02:14.780> see<00:02:14.960> break<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.440> balls

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
there we go you can see break the balls

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
there we go you can see break the balls

in that and they just don't seem to work
so<00:04:19.460> i<00:04:19.670> don't<00:04:20.299> believe<00:04:20.630> that<00:04:20.930> that<00:04:21.770> this<00:04:21.919> thing

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
so i don't believe that that this thing

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.830 
so i don't believe that that this thing
has<00:04:22.280> multitouch<00:04:22.760> are<00:04:22.970> these<00:04:23.150> not<00:04:23.300> enabled<00:04:23.750> in

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
has multitouch are these not enabled in

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.830 
has multitouch are these not enabled in
the<00:04:23.870> firmware<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:25.370> one<00:04:25.550> Chinese

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
the firmware the one Chinese

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.830 
the firmware the one Chinese
site<00:04:27.440> that<00:04:27.620> i<00:04:27.680> found<00:04:28.210> describes<00:04:29.210> it<00:04:29.389> a<00:04:29.480> single

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
site that i found describes it a single

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.129 
site that i found describes it a single
touch<00:04:30.610> just<00:04:31.610> that's<00:04:31.910> kind<00:04:32.540> of<00:04:32.600> sucks<00:04:32.840> i<00:04:33.020> was

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
touch just that's kind of sucks i was

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.620 
touch just that's kind of sucks i was
hoping<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.410> have<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.590> multi-touch<00:04:34.540> hoping<00:04:35.540> to

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
hoping to have the multi-touch hoping to

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.909 
hoping to have the multi-touch hoping to
have<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.930> support<00:04:36.320> for<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:37.690> h.a<00:04:38.690> iPads<00:04:39.290> you

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:39.919 
have the support for the h.a iPads you

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.490 
have the support for the h.a iPads you
know<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.370> firmware<00:04:40.729> since<00:04:41.270> there<00:04:42.199> seems<00:04:42.229> to

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
know the firmware since there seems to

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.379 
know the firmware since there seems to
be<00:04:42.590> a<00:04:42.620> lot<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:42.800> revisions<00:04:43.699> on<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:45.729> but<00:04:46.729> the<00:04:47.180> cost

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
be a lot of revisions on it but the cost

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.210 
be a lot of revisions on it but the cost
to<00:04:47.600> send<00:04:47.750> us<00:04:47.900> back<00:04:48.080> is<00:04:48.260> probably<00:04:48.620> not<00:04:48.860> worth<00:04:49.040> it

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
to send us back is probably not worth it

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.430 
to send us back is probably not worth it
so<00:04:49.540> probably<00:04:50.540> end<00:04:50.660> up<00:04:50.690> sticking<00:04:50.900> with<00:04:51.169> it<00:04:51.320> and

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
so probably end up sticking with it and

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.500 
so probably end up sticking with it and
we'll<00:04:51.530> see<00:04:51.740> what<00:04:51.949> what<00:04:52.610> I<00:04:52.639> can<00:04:52.850> get<00:04:53.030> back<00:04:53.240> in

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
we'll see what what I can get back in

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.750 
we'll see what what I can get back in
differences<00:04:54.350> for<00:04:54.530> for<00:04:54.889> the<00:04:55.040> wrong<00:04:55.460> device

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
differences for for the wrong device

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.140 
differences for for the wrong device
shipped<00:04:56.320> okay<00:04:57.320> I<00:04:57.530> think<00:04:58.430> that's<00:04:58.669> all<00:04:58.820> show<00:04:59.120> no

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
shipped okay I think that's all show no

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.860 
shipped okay I think that's all show no
