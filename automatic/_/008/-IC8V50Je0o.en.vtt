00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.230 
probably I'll probably just give this
one<00:06:14.800> away<00:06:14.949> so<00:06:15.070> someone<00:06:15.520> else<00:06:15.669> can<00:06:15.880> get<00:06:16.000> some

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
one away so someone else can get some

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.650 
one away so someone else can get some
good<00:06:16.360> use<00:06:16.419> out<00:06:16.780> of<00:06:16.840> it<00:06:17.080> but<00:06:17.860> um<00:06:18.040> I<00:06:18.449> mean<00:06:19.449> really

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:19.660 
good use out of it but um I mean really

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.659 
good use out of it but um I mean really
for<00:06:19.930> everything<00:06:20.350> in<00:06:20.470> this<00:06:20.620> kit<00:06:20.949> I<00:06:21.190> would<00:06:21.460> say

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:21.669 
for everything in this kit I would say

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:22.860 
for everything in this kit I would say
that's<00:06:21.820> probably<00:06:21.970> the<00:06:22.180> only<00:06:22.360> thing<00:06:22.660> that<00:06:22.840> I

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
that's probably the only thing that I

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.230 
that's probably the only thing that I
would<00:06:22.960> not<00:06:23.260> use<00:06:23.820> everything<00:06:24.820> is<00:06:25.090> just

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:25.240 
would not use everything is just

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.930 
would not use everything is just
gorgeous<00:06:25.510> and<00:06:26.160> they<00:06:27.160> were<00:06:27.220> just<00:06:27.490> saying<00:06:27.760> I

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
gorgeous and they were just saying I

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.790 
gorgeous and they were just saying I
think<00:06:28.000> just<00:06:28.360> if<00:06:28.479> you<00:06:28.570> bought<00:06:28.780> maybe<00:06:29.320> these<00:06:29.530> two

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
think just if you bought maybe these two

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.770 
think just if you bought maybe these two
products<00:06:30.280> alone<00:06:30.370> it<00:06:30.850> was<00:06:30.940> worth<00:06:31.000> buying<00:06:31.510> the

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780 
products alone it was worth buying the

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.280 
products alone it was worth buying the
whole<00:06:31.930> kit<00:06:32.169> so<00:06:33.010> that's<00:06:33.340> pretty<00:06:33.550> exciting<00:06:34.290> and

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
whole kit so that's pretty exciting and

whole kit so that's pretty exciting and
then<00:06:35.470> the<00:06:35.560> last<00:06:35.740> product<00:06:36.190> that<00:06:36.310> came<00:06:36.460> in<00:06:36.610> here
