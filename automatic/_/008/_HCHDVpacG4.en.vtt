00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.080
 it will be quite interesting for you 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.619
 is about a league of legends 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.290
 paysafecard to me 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.810
 that means we organize intone we 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.380
 are in the case digital zoom so mine 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.470
 wenigkeit the latter x box maxim maurice 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.270
 and legendary tm have us 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.489
 united and organize for 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.100
 a tournament in league of legends 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.930
 where you win paysafe cards 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.370
 can you can with these paysafe cards 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.590
 you then, for example, riot points 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.860
 recharge and join in league of legends 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.400
 so that champions from sides or skins 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.810
 to buy 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.310
 let's start with the rough 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.510
 tournament dates the tournament should 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.250
 take place on 10 11 2012 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.330
 of course and about 17 o'clock 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.570
 start clock 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.800
 that will be an afternoon or 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.439
 there is an evening event to win 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.170
 a total profit pool of 30 euros 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:10.600
 the whole in the form of paysafecard and 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.700
 Although the first place 15 the second place 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.649
 10 and the third place five no fear 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.240
 you can do that if you want it for example 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.729
 in league of legends issues without 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.329
 Sharing problems by two becomes what becomes 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.270
 played 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:23.920
 So there are always two against two 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.359
 with tracks 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.420
 that means it will be this tournament mode 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:30.700
 and then you can play in that 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.359
 your absolute have championship tracks 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.280
 three bands putin quite normal and 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:39.759
 is played on the map of the founding 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.020
 forest and only the bot lane and 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:44.560
 the average gange 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.630
 that means the upper jungle is taboo 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.549
 well what is what it takes to achieve 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.950
 this game physics conditions are the 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.709
 following the team either first 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.299
 scored four kills, which does not matter 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.939
 who of the opponents then how often or 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.439
 how died or by her 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.990
 Two towers of the opposing team 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.819
 destroys those are these conditions that 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.859
 team that wins first 

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.170
 we think that's to a maximum 

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:10.750
 Event length of maybe 20 minutes 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.770
 what should lead into the maximum 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.840
 terms of participation 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.970
 you have to subscribe because we have that 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.090
 of course only for the subscribers 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.810
 want to organize that is subscribed

 and since we loose the encounters 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.610
 will not be so much unfair 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.840
 Be clear with the Wendler player 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.599
 These are better but that's always the case 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.099
 that's how we get to it now

 then please write only the one e-mail 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:17.660
 we do not want to be pushed here 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:20.870
 with e mails and many players we leave 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.810
 We have not fixed that yet 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:27.290
 We will either be at 16 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.890
 teams speaks 32 games or 32 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.200
 teams 64 players not so much as 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.650
 a total of 64 players play 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.780
 in sum, that means we have one 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.700
 but a whole bunch of players have it 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.590
 so that the relatively short time in 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.569
 hopefully pretty soon 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.489
 if you can take the stage 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.810
 you will be or not by e 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.579
 to be aware of mail 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.500
 in the answer he then e-mail 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:55.459
 all will get for you too 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.130
 important info in it are so come as 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.609
 at the application deadline 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:04.310
 The application deadline is the seventh eleventh 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:06.739
 2012 or but and now comes the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.870
 Special feature when you have 35 teams 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.760
 I will have to apply now 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.829
 ok, why 35 teams 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.470
 so it's easy 35 teams 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:16.789
 That's because we have a small reserve 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.060
 we want to play yes as I said 

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:23.090
 a maximum of 32 teams take but after 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.240
 we have 32 registrations hole in 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:28.669
 connecting possible stragglers up to 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.229
 Of course, then no three 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:30.919
 have a solid right to the tournament 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:34.070
 participate 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.690
 but just give us the opportunity 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.050
 and somebody fail with security 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.950
 will happen again a few people 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.080
 to let move up 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.660
 he will be completely normal ko system 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.820
 be played and we will finish 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.100
 in the final and have a small final 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.960
 play talk game for place three 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.010
 then just the prize money place 3 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.390
 to be able to forgive 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.280
 that was it for you now 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.250

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:00.050
 participation and we will see you then 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.210
