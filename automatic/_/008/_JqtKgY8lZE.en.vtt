00:00:40.170 --> 00:01:25.720 
succulents oil specialist and Lilith
comes<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.649> with<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> most<00:00:40.920> beautiful<00:00:41.640> design

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.020 

one<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.770> signatures<00:01:27.770> of<00:01:27.800> this<00:01:28.220> idea<00:01:28.790> is

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
one of the signatures of this idea is

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.260 
one of the signatures of this idea is
that<00:01:29.300> it's<00:01:29.480> a<00:01:29.600> tic-tac-toe<00:01:30.820> idea<00:01:31.820> so<00:01:32.090> that

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
that it's a tic-tac-toe idea so that

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.810 
that it's a tic-tac-toe idea so that
means<00:01:32.540> that<00:01:32.810> you<00:01:32.960> would<00:01:33.110> use<00:01:33.380> five<00:01:34.010> of<00:01:34.220> one<00:01:34.460> and

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
means that you would use five of one and

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.500 
means that you would use five of one and
for<00:01:35.120> the<00:01:35.360> other<00:01:35.540> and<00:01:36.700> usually<00:01:37.700> what<00:01:37.910> I<00:01:37.940> do<00:01:38.090> is

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
for the other and usually what I do is

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.410 
for the other and usually what I do is
that<00:01:38.540> the<00:01:39.200> filler<00:01:39.530> type<00:01:40.340> thing<00:01:40.610> would<00:01:40.880> be<00:01:41.090> the

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
that the filler type thing would be the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.970 
that the filler type thing would be the
ones<00:01:41.630> on<00:01:41.810> the<00:01:41.990> sides<00:01:42.290> and<00:01:42.620> the<00:01:42.740> main

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:42.980 
ones on the sides and the main

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.880 
ones on the sides and the main
attraction<00:01:43.760> is<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.900> ones<00:01:45.140> in<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.470> corners

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
attraction is the ones in the corners

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.040 
attraction is the ones in the corners
and<00:01:45.920> then<00:01:46.190> in<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.730> center<00:01:47.000> I'll<00:01:47.450> say<00:01:47.660> that<00:01:47.870> the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
and then in the center I'll say that the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.780 
and then in the center I'll say that the
crema<00:01:48.320> theorem<00:01:48.800> one<00:01:48.980> would<00:01:49.130> have<00:01:49.280> a<00:01:49.340> look<00:01:49.640> of

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
crema theorem one would have a look of

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.350 
crema theorem one would have a look of
filler<00:01:50.150> and<00:01:50.480> the<00:01:51.460> larger<00:01:52.460> rosette<00:01:53.000> for<00:01:53.300> the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
filler and the larger rosette for the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.120 
filler and the larger rosette for the
thumper<00:01:53.720> viven<00:01:54.080> would<00:01:54.260> have<00:01:54.440> more<00:01:54.680> of<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:54.950> WOW

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
thumper viven would have more of a WOW

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.810 
thumper viven would have more of a WOW
factor

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
factor

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.990

mm-hm how am i doing let's see that
looks<00:02:02.120> good<00:02:02.480> you<00:02:03.580> wanted<00:02:04.580> to<00:02:04.670> take<00:02:05.150> a<00:02:05.210> little

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
looks good you wanted to take a little

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.560 
looks good you wanted to take a little
bit<00:02:05.540> out<00:02:05.690> of<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.260> bottom<00:02:06.770> of<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:06.950> root<00:02:07.100> ball

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
bit out of the bottom of the root ball

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.540 
bit out of the bottom of the root ball
even<00:02:08.570> even<00:02:08.990> with<00:02:09.080> the<00:02:09.260> height<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.950> plants

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
even even with the height of the plants

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.550 
even even with the height of the plants
you're<00:02:10.820> going<00:02:11.150> for<00:02:11.450> uniformity<00:02:12.080> so<00:02:12.200> here's

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
you're going for uniformity so here's

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.030 
you're going for uniformity so here's
what<00:02:12.739> we<00:02:12.860> got<00:02:12.890> so<00:02:13.340> far<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:18.040> partially

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
what we got so far is the partially

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.890 
what we got so far is the partially
completed<00:02:19.459> composition<00:02:20.300> so<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.570> can<00:02:20.720> see

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
completed composition so you can see

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.470 
completed composition so you can see
about<00:02:21.110> how<00:02:21.320> high<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.590> level<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.790> soil<00:02:23.030> is

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
about how high the level of the soil is

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.120 
about how high the level of the soil is
and<00:02:24.130> how<00:02:25.130> there's<00:02:25.970> there's<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.450> lot<00:02:26.540> of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
and how there's there's a lot of

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.460 
and how there's there's a lot of
evenness<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.310> regularity<00:02:29.120> to<00:02:29.989> what<00:02:30.170> Linda's

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
evenness and regularity to what Linda's

00:02:30.470 --> 00:03:35.500 
evenness and regularity to what Linda's
doing

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510
