as all I can say is just I like the
clean<00:03:09.410> look

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
clean look

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.030 
clean look
it's<00:03:10.520> more<00:03:10.790> like<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.000> street<00:03:11.390> rod<00:03:11.630> than<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:11.960> in<00:03:12.830> a

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
it's more like a street rod than a in a

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:27.450 
it's more like a street rod than a in a
van<00:03:13.450> but<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:16.390> wanted<00:03:17.390> something<00:03:17.810> different

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.230 

you

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.510 

you

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.580 

you
