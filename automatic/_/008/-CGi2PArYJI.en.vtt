00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:08.480
 In this video we look at how 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.730
 to get a realtech 8 191s wlan card 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.710
 installed on a windows 7 computer 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.470
 In my case that's a 64 bit 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.000
 operating system first needs 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.289
 of course first the drivers we 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.520
 not automatically reloaded 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.689
 you have to download it so rather 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.010
 For example , it can be either from 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.300
 download this page 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.470
 you can find the link in the video 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.529
 description I have now, too 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.119
 once again uploaded the driver 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.170
 as there are those on the page 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.090
 link you can also find in the video 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:40.770
 because the description that are left there 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:42.300
 some are a bit slow so if he 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.890
 then up here you have yours 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.149
 designation stand from the card and there 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.399
 can then look it out 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.829
 from which server wanted to download 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.680
 So as once from the left click well 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.350
 in which then made then should you 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.109
 a zip file exists and that exactly 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.449
 These ones 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.850
 and what we finally do second 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.030
 first the device 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.820
 I open the device manager and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.909
 Shortly you are working the network connections 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.570
 that in his circa tapped and now 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.570
 finally 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.850
 what happens then is that he gets a device 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.650
 recognizes here have indeed is not it 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.000
 but the same he tries the same 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.100
 to install drivers here 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.840
 But I already predict that 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.070
 fail with we wait for that good 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.630
 I seemingly hung up here now 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:42.720
 Let's just skip it here 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:45.220
 yes and I hope that breaks off now 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.100
 the next thing we do is we 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.840
 open the zip file here and leave 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.450
 so he will not find it 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.060
 Let's take the zip file and go 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.319
 in the folder pure so for lazy but 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.090
 I do not recommend it here 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.610
 directly setup run then also 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.080
 install stupidest worker 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.179
 tool from realtech with the installed 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.500
 you do not really need 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.450
 that's why there are more elegant ones up here 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.369
 Just go to this folder now 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.260
 Here you chose your operating system 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.360
 which operating system has experienced how 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.950
 For example, on windows 7 in the on 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.319
 start menu on the computers right click 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.510
 makes properties and stands up here 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.850
 a windows 7 professional and here 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.920
 Below is important system type 64 bit 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.700
 operating system that is for me 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.709
 now here win x64 important and this 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.000
 I need three files so I click 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.620
 now here on the folder times 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.660
 right-click and copy neat and now 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.859
 I go for example with desktop 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.079
 control woman can I then again 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.590
 here put the folder 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.239
 Now I'm going back to the 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.780
 device manager where now i like it 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.280
 he promised nothing found 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.040
 and because here again the card goes out 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.410
 raise up drivers update 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.150
 and because here is the bottom out on the 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.280
 computer search for driver software and 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.350
 now just enter the path where 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.930
 I filed this and got it here 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.230
 very from desktop so here username 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.650
 desktop and here is our folder me 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.450
 okay too 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.109
 let in karmann 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.579
 Need to use here on next 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.269
 and now the driver software 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.269
 Installed 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.080
 and yes, nothing cut so 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.030
 The software is ready to use in no time 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.710
 it is the 2011 distributor that is too 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.570
 the latest from the realtech page 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:34.050
 So the dates should be 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:39.150
 agree look here so 2011 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:42.260
 that fits so far and the map can 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.260
 just used
