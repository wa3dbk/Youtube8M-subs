00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.419
 a very warm greeting for all and 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.090
 all today we will learn to make a garden 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.100
 vertical as its name indicates this 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.730
 is a type of garden that is 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.800
 hanging on vertical surfaces do 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.660
 vertical gardens is a useful therapy 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.850
 for those of us who live in cities where 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.100
 concrete predominates and it is also a 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:55.339
 way to embellish and renature 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.710
 our spaces to do our 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.659
 vertical gardens we need 3 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.309
 important plastic bottles that you 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.620
 bottles have the same size as 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.229
 have a lid we also need land 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.020
 with compost an atomizer with water 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:12.110
 small river stones gloves 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.229
 we also need a scissors marker 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.670
 I scalpel a garden stick and the 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.670
 seedlings that we are going to transplant 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.350
 we started cutting in half a 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.350
 bottle 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.870
 and ready the bottom will be the base 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.560
 of our vertical garden and this part 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.560
 it will be the top 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.300
 the next step is to take the part 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.300
 lower than the remaining bottles 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.400
 i 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.400
 to each of the bottles we are going to 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.000
 make a window of approximately 6 x 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.000
 6 centimeters 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.470
 ready in this way should be the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.450
 pieces it is important that the base that 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.520
 let's use have holes in the background 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.490
 just like the covers so that the water 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.170
 can be filtered let's start then 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.170
 to join our vertical garden 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.780
 now we fill the base with stones 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.780
 approximately two or three centimeters 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.310
 then we fill in the next 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.310
 module with stones and with compost 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:21.170
 important that when filling it with compost and 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.860
 of earth does not exceed the window that 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.860
 we did 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.770
 now we are going to plant the seedling that is going 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.340
 to go out the window we did and 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.340
 we assembled 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:57.150
 and we do the same with all 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:59.849
 bottles we fit one on top of the 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.589
 another the number of bottles that we are going to 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:03.059
 use depend on the size of the 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:06.029
 structure that we want to build 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:07.979
 We recommend using between 3 and 5 bottles 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:10.490
 to make your garden more stable 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.490
 vertical 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.080
 in the stage of our vertical garden 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:20.470
 that is to say the last piece that we are going to 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:22.830
 join can also plant 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.830
 i 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.320
 and this we finished the vertical garden what 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.300
 You can locate in a place in your home or 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.160
 from your school where you get enough 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.020
 light remembers that most of the 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.760
 Plants need at least 2 hours 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.729
 daily sun to grow in a way 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.520
 adequate in this type of gardens the 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.540
 location is key to ensure that the 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.540
 watering is easy 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.770
 it is vital to water our garden once a 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.750
 day do not add harmful chemicals and take care 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.520
 and do not have plates this kind of 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.830
 structure does not only work with 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.199
 ornamental plants but also with 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.389
 aromatic and root vegetables 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:08.340
 small there are many ways to 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.169
 reuse the plastic bottles 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:12.300
 only limits that exist are those of the 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.550
 imagination for more information on 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.650
 these issues and many more and so that 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.270
