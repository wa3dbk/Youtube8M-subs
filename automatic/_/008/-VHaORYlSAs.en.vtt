at the base like so and then take the
top<00:04:03.070> ball<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.670> twist<00:04:04.030> it<00:04:04.270> off<00:04:05.220> now<00:04:06.220> sometimes

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
top ball and twist it off now sometimes

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.430 
top ball and twist it off now sometimes
like<00:04:07.150> when<00:04:07.300> you<00:04:07.390> get<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.630> pierced<00:04:08.020> for<00:04:08.350> the

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
like when you get it pierced for the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.020 
like when you get it pierced for the
first<00:04:08.650> time<00:04:08.920> it<00:04:09.070> might<00:04:09.190> the<00:04:09.460> ball<00:04:09.790> might<00:04:10.000> be

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
first time it might the ball might be

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.160 
first time it might the ball might be
quite<00:04:10.390> tight<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:13.660> you're<00:04:13.780> just<00:04:13.900> going<00:04:14.050> to<00:04:14.080> want

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
quite tight so you're just going to want

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.040 
quite tight so you're just going to want
to<00:04:14.260> twist<00:04:14.470> it<00:04:14.710> off<00:04:14.830> to<00:04:15.280> whatever<00:04:15.490> way<00:04:15.900> is<00:04:16.900> loose

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
to twist it off to whatever way is loose

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.600 
to twist it off to whatever way is loose
so<00:04:20.050> once<00:04:20.230> you<00:04:20.350> have<00:04:20.500> that<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:21.370> ball<00:04:21.580> is

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
so once you have that the ball is

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.330 
so once you have that the ball is
totally<00:04:22.450> separate<00:04:23.050> so<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:23.920> just<00:04:24.100> looks<00:04:24.250> like

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
totally separate so it just looks like

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.640 
totally separate so it just looks like
that<00:04:24.670> I<00:04:25.210> don't<00:04:25.330> know<00:04:25.420> if<00:04:26.020> you<00:04:26.110> can<00:04:26.260> see<00:04:26.470> that

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.130 
that I don't know if you can see that
like<00:04:27.280> that<00:04:27.520> so<00:04:28.270> that's<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.630> ball<00:04:28.780> that<00:04:28.930> comes

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.630 
like that so that's the ball that comes
off<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.530> then<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.770> bellybutton<00:04:30.220> ring<00:04:30.370> after

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
tried to get out the best angle and

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.450 
tried to get out the best angle and
lighting<00:06:45.140> that<00:06:45.170> I<00:06:45.290> could<00:06:45.590> but<00:06:46.130> it's<00:06:46.310> really

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
lighting that I could but it's really

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:47.740 
lighting that I could but it's really

straightforward all it does it just

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.290 
straightforward all it does it just
takes<00:06:48.230> some<00:06:48.440> practice<00:06:48.650> but<00:06:49.580> you<00:06:49.730> will<00:06:49.940> get<00:06:50.180> it

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
takes some practice but you will get it

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.420
