that's<00:00:02.850> a<00:00:02.970> big<00:00:03.240> flapper<00:00:03.780> on<00:00:03.810> that<00:00:04.080> wastegate

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:05.480 
that's a big flapper on that wastegate

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.760 
that's a big flapper on that wastegate
that's<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.569> little<00:00:06.839> port<00:00:07.109> underneath<00:00:07.470> that<00:00:07.740> I

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
that's a little port underneath that I

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.749 
that's a little port underneath that I
believe<00:00:09.290> and<00:00:10.290> we<00:00:10.530> we<00:00:10.710> can<00:00:10.740> find<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:11.309> out<00:00:11.519> is

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
believe and we we can find this out is

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.529 
believe and we we can find this out is
to<00:00:11.849> remove<00:00:12.269> this<00:00:12.540> clip<00:00:17.060> we<00:00:18.060> need<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.359> loosen

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
to remove this clip we need to loosen

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:28.429 
to remove this clip we need to loosen
that<00:00:18.810> as<00:00:18.960> well<00:00:26.869> look<00:00:27.869> at<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.050> little<00:00:28.320> tiny

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
that as well look at that little tiny

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.240 
that as well look at that little tiny
port<00:00:29.039> that's<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.970> problem<00:00:30.390> in<00:00:30.539> my<00:00:30.689> opinion<00:00:31.250> it's

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
port that's a problem in my opinion it's

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.870 
port that's a problem in my opinion it's
got<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.820> flapper<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> much<00:00:33.899> bigger<00:00:34.140> port

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
got the flapper for a much bigger port

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.350 
got the flapper for a much bigger port
but<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.090> hole<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.540> miserable

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
but that hole is miserable

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.630 
but that hole is miserable
look<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.480> get<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.629> measurement<00:00:39.989> on<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.379> hole

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.319 

get<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.879> there

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
get it in there

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.130 
get it in there
can't<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.530> down<00:00:46.680> there<00:00:47.480> so<00:00:48.480> what<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.750> do

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
can't get it down there so what I can do

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.700 
can't get it down there so what I can do
is<00:00:49.230> stick<00:00:49.410> something<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.950> hole<00:00:51.620> is<00:00:52.620> a

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
is stick something in that hole is a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.510 
is stick something in that hole is a
piece<00:00:52.949> of<00:00:52.980> clay<00:00:53.780> what<00:00:54.780> I'm<00:00:54.899> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.079> do<00:00:55.230> here

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
piece of clay what I'm going to do here

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.680 
piece of clay what I'm going to do here
cram<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.730> in<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> hole<00:00:57.410> pull<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.559> back<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:58.980> I

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
cram that in the hole pull it back out I

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.799 
cram that in the hole pull it back out I
have<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.840> do<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.109> again<00:01:02.239> now<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> factory

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
have to do that again now the factory

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.880 
have to do that again now the factory
part<00:01:04.199> is<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:05.000> it's<00:01:06.000> 22<00:01:06.420> millimeters<00:01:06.930> that's

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
part is a it's 22 millimeters that's

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.350 
part is a it's 22 millimeters that's
what<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> looks<00:01:08.400> like<00:01:08.490> we've<00:01:08.790> got<00:01:09.000> here

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
what that looks like we've got here

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.100 
what that looks like we've got here
measure<00:01:10.320> its<00:01:10.770> largest<00:01:11.220> side<00:01:11.750> just<00:01:12.750> right

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
measure its largest side just right

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.830 
measure its largest side just right
about<00:01:13.350> there<00:01:13.850> that's<00:01:14.850> even<00:01:15.119> smaller<00:01:15.270> than<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
about there that's even smaller than the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.219 
about there that's even smaller than the
factory<00:01:16.229> part<00:01:19.369> hmm<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.390> looks<00:01:21.930> like<00:01:22.049> I've<00:01:22.200> got

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
factory part hmm so looks like I've got

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.560 
factory part hmm so looks like I've got
a<00:01:22.380> porting<00:01:22.740> job<00:01:22.950> ahead<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> me<00:01:23.430> what<00:01:24.299> I'm<00:01:24.390> going

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
a porting job ahead of me what I'm going

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.210 
a porting job ahead of me what I'm going
to<00:01:24.600> do<00:01:24.780> now<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.259> measure<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.650> size<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.159> this

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
to do now is measure the size of this

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.569 
to do now is measure the size of this
wastegate<00:01:26.759> flapper<00:01:27.799> see<00:01:28.799> what<00:01:28.950> they've<00:01:29.130> left

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
wastegate flapper see what they've left

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.990 
wastegate flapper see what they've left
me<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:29.970> here

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
me with here

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.670 
me with here
that's<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.299> 34<00:01:33.780> millimeter<00:01:34.200> waist<00:01:34.409> gate

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
that's the 34 millimeter waist gate

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.310 
that's the 34 millimeter waist gate
clapper<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.180> put<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> flapper<00:01:36.810> on<00:01:37.079> it

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
clapper so they put the flapper on it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.100 
clapper so they put the flapper on it
but<00:01:37.619> they<00:01:37.740> didn't<00:01:37.979> make<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> hole<00:01:38.400> big<00:01:38.670> enough

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
but they didn't make the hole big enough

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.990 
but they didn't make the hole big enough
now<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.500> why<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:41.070> lot<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.460> people<00:01:41.610> have

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
now this is why a lot of people have

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.490 
now this is why a lot of people have
probably<00:01:42.240> complained<00:01:43.079> about<00:01:43.259> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
probably complained about the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
probably complained about the
performance<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.070> these<00:01:44.220> Chinese<00:01:44.610> turbos

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
performance of these Chinese turbos

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.600 
performance of these Chinese turbos
looks<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.049> me<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.409> exhaust<00:01:46.710> isn't<00:01:47.369> going

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
looks to me like the exhaust isn't going

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.520 
looks to me like the exhaust isn't going
to<00:01:47.670> flow<00:01:47.820> well<00:01:48.060> enough<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:49.049> when<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> close

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
to flow well enough and when I close

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.319 
to flow well enough and when I close
that<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:50.220> does<00:01:50.399> look<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.729> me<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:51.149> even

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
that it does look to me like that even

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.889 
that it does look to me like that even
lines<00:01:51.659> up<00:01:51.869> very<00:01:51.899> well<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.619> does<00:01:53.329> it<00:01:54.329> lines<00:01:54.720> up

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
lines up very well it does it lines up

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:03.440 
lines up very well it does it lines up
okay<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.439> seat<00:01:55.909> I've<00:01:56.909> seen<00:01:57.180> better<00:01:57.420> but

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.690 

we've<00:02:03.870> got<00:02:04.020> enough<00:02:04.260> of<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.470> flat<00:02:04.770> plane<00:02:05.160> surface

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
we've got enough of a flat plane surface

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.450 
we've got enough of a flat plane surface
there<00:02:05.910> to<00:02:06.350> meet<00:02:07.350> crush<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.890> seal<00:02:08.070> it<00:02:08.250> I'm

there to meet crush and seal it I'm
going<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.820> make<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.149> hole<00:02:09.330> bigger<00:02:09.860> that's

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
going to make that hole bigger that's

for<00:02:38.250> now<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:39.150> going<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.390> be<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.540> problem<00:02:46.370> nice

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
for now it's going to be a problem nice

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.990 
for now it's going to be a problem nice
mm-hmm<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:51.890> don't<00:02:52.890> know<00:02:53.040> what<00:02:53.310> model<00:02:53.490> number<00:02:53.880> it

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
mm-hmm I don't know what model number it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:04:13.940 
mm-hmm I don't know what model number it
is

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.180 

25<00:04:14.950> millimeters<00:04:16.410> here's<00:04:17.410> the<00:04:17.530> factory<00:04:18.010> hole

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
25 millimeters here's the factory hole

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.729 
25 millimeters here's the factory hole
in<00:04:18.340> a<00:04:18.400> Mitsubishi<00:04:18.669> turbo<00:04:19.329> you<00:04:20.290> see<00:04:20.500> if<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.650> can

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
in a Mitsubishi turbo you see if I can

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.310 
in a Mitsubishi turbo you see if I can
get<00:04:20.829> some<00:04:20.979> light<00:04:21.160> in<00:04:21.190> here

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
get some light in here

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.960 
get some light in here
get<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.470> bugs<00:04:23.710> out<00:04:23.949> of<00:04:24.100> it<00:04:27.660> settle<00:04:29.789> I'm<00:04:30.789> gonna

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
get the bugs out of it settle I'm gonna

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.060 
get the bugs out of it settle I'm gonna
get<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.210> angle<00:04:31.539> right<00:04:31.620> that<00:04:32.620> hole<00:04:32.770> is<00:04:32.919> not

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
get the angle right that hole is not

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:39.060 
get the angle right that hole is not
very<00:04:33.310> big<00:04:36.570> it's<00:04:37.570> actually<00:04:37.720> smiling<00:04:38.380> and<00:04:38.949> the

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
very big it's actually smiling and the

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.580 
very big it's actually smiling and the
hole<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.220> just<00:04:39.520> made<00:04:42.750> that<00:04:43.750> on<00:04:43.960> a<00:04:43.990> brief<00:04:44.229> plenty

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
hole I just made that on a brief plenty

00:04:44.590 --> 00:05:06.240 
hole I just made that on a brief plenty
of<00:04:44.710> exhaust<00:04:45.070> gas<00:05:04.710> so<00:05:05.710> this<00:05:05.830> is<00:05:05.979> what<00:05:06.130> we're

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
of exhaust gas so this is what we're

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.340 
of exhaust gas so this is what we're
dealing<00:05:06.340> with<00:05:06.810> looks<00:05:07.810> to<00:05:07.960> me<00:05:08.050> like<00:05:08.080> I<00:05:08.289> could

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
dealing with looks to me like I could

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.629 
dealing with looks to me like I could
stand<00:05:08.650> to<00:05:08.770> lose<00:05:08.979> a<00:05:09.010> little<00:05:09.310> bit

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
stand to lose a little bit

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.150 
stand to lose a little bit
so<00:05:10.539> everything's<00:05:10.840> gasket<00:05:11.320> matched<00:05:11.530> that's<00:05:12.010> a

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
so everything's gasket matched that's a

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.250 
so everything's gasket matched that's a
little<00:05:12.340> bit<00:05:12.490> off-center

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
little bit off-center

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:45.580 
little bit off-center
what<00:05:14.260> do<00:05:14.320> you<00:05:14.380> expect

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.930 

so<00:05:46.590> what<00:05:46.710> we<00:05:46.830> learned<00:05:47.040> about<00:05:47.160> this<00:05:47.430> is<00:05:47.639> to<00:05:47.880> the

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
so what we learned about this is to the

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.730 
so what we learned about this is to the
machining<00:05:48.389> tolerances<00:05:48.540> aren't<00:05:49.169> as<00:05:49.260> tight<00:05:49.500> as

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
machining tolerances aren't as tight as

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.909 
machining tolerances aren't as tight as
the<00:05:50.190> factory<00:05:51.030> tolerances<00:05:51.690> are<00:05:51.870> and<00:05:52.110> the

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
the factory tolerances are and the

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.010 
the factory tolerances are and the
wastegate<00:05:53.280> is<00:05:53.700> too<00:05:54.000> small<00:05:54.270> for<00:05:54.330> its<00:05:54.660> own<00:05:54.780> good

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
wastegate is too small for its own good

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.600 
wastegate is too small for its own good
if<00:05:55.650> anybody's<00:05:56.040> going<00:05:56.160> to<00:05:56.220> be<00:05:56.310> throwing<00:05:56.490> a

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
if anybody's going to be throwing a

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.680 
if anybody's going to be throwing a
whole<00:05:56.700> lot<00:05:56.880> of<00:05:56.910> boost<00:05:57.180> at<00:05:57.360> one<00:05:57.480> of<00:05:57.600> these

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
whole lot of boost at one of these

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.810 
whole lot of boost at one of these
things<00:05:57.990> this<00:05:58.410> really<00:05:58.710> has<00:05:58.860> to<00:05:58.889> be<00:05:59.130> opened<00:05:59.460> up

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
things this really has to be opened up

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.550 
things this really has to be opened up
I<00:05:59.850> guess<00:06:00.300> the<00:06:00.419> factory<00:06:00.840> boost<00:06:01.080> levels<00:06:01.440> it

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
I guess the factory boost levels it

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.460 
I guess the factory boost levels it
wouldn't<00:06:01.800> be<00:06:01.889> a<00:06:01.919> problem<00:06:02.220> but<00:06:02.780> this<00:06:03.780> turbo<00:06:04.169> has

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
wouldn't be a problem but this turbo has

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.020 
wouldn't be a problem but this turbo has
a<00:06:04.500> lot<00:06:04.800> more<00:06:04.830> potential<00:06:05.580> than<00:06:05.700> what<00:06:05.910> the

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
a lot more potential than what the

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.390 
a lot more potential than what the
factory<00:06:06.419> turbo<00:06:06.780> flows<00:06:07.080> and<00:06:07.440> it's<00:06:08.040> going<00:06:08.190> to<00:06:08.250> be

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
factory turbo flows and it's going to be

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.880 
factory turbo flows and it's going to be
a<00:06:08.430> lot<00:06:08.639> laggy<00:06:08.910> or<00:06:09.090> -<00:06:09.419> but<00:06:09.990> we'll<00:06:10.590> see<00:06:10.710> how<00:06:10.740> that

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
a lot laggy or - but we'll see how that

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.840 
a lot laggy or - but we'll see how that
looks<00:06:11.010> in<00:06:11.280> the<00:06:11.370> log<00:06:11.600> sig<00:06:12.600> around
