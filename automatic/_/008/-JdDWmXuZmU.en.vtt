00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.700
 The track construction is completed trial runs 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.889
 have been done well now goes 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.360
 it to the finish of the tracks 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.879
 First, the profiles and the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.669
 dyed swell I have very good 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.980
 Experiences made with water-soluble 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:21.779
 acrylic paint you can with the brush 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.880
 apply but there are also in 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.830
 practical spray cans and these have 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.539
 I just used this case now 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.070
 with a pretty good result 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.829
 that is the reconstruction of a 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.660
 Segment plant that means some parts 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.010
 were already gravel and the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.010
 new, of course, not yet 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.700
 insofar 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.410
 here were some reworking due 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.410
 for example in and at the bw 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.679
 on friday the same 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.200
 at the bw access 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.770
 and still 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.979
 other areas 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.560
 the driveway soft group was complete 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.299
 therefore had to be rebuilt 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.299
 completely be switched on 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.060
 the segments 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.230
 must be considered separately 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.580
 otherwise you will be torn by the beautiful one here 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.110
 If you take the gravel again 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.500
 then separate segments again 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.500
 would like to 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.770
 parallel to the Scots action 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.160
 the salt canals of the company are crying 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160
 relocated 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.030
 they were the same 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.650
 already gravel so had the city 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.140
 to be scratched out at these places 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.310
 as it dummies the cable duct 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.310
 could be introduced 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.460
 a good guide here in every case 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.640
 is the songbook mechanical 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.640
 interlockings 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.800
 also my time invested 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.500
 platform had to be renovated 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.810
 One reason among others was mine 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.730
 bavarian mallett whose back 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.200
 cylinder pair was so wide that it always 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.200
 the platform edges adjoin 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.660
 and have this little nice signage 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.280
 we found my on the flea market 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.570
 children thought that could be 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.760
 maybe do something 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.300
 Let's see maybe in one of the 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.300
 next 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.120
 now only the thresholds swelled again 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.110
 taped and then another is one 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.110
 Dyeing takes place 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.520
 later will be then 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.069
 with a light color again 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.780
 be trained 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.209
 This will give it again 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.850
 more plasticity and then works 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.050
 realistic 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.690
 But now, first, the 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.190
 cleaned profiles and especially the 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.820
 soft tongues made common again 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.790
 become 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.910
 a wonderful task until the next one 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.910
 times
