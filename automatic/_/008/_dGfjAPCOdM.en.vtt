00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello dear friends with you I yuri 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.420
 I have this gameplay for you 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.210
 just awesome news on android 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.700
 the craziest and craziest came out 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.840
 crash test simulator called turbo 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.269
 dismount 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.150
 yes yes this is exactly the game for which 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.550
 There are a lot of summer reviews and 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.890
 a toy that was probably very 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.039
 very popular on pc now it is and 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.970
 Android-just say for processors 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.859
 nvidia tegra and here more is done better 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.809
 smoothing i.e. graphics a bit 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.170
 will be better than other devices 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.910
 but in principle and on other devices 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.190
 I think the game will look good 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.460
 nice what can be done here 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.559
 There are achivki board leaders and customization 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.989
 section customization that you can 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.890
 do you can set your face on 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.600
 dummy and set a logo on your 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.730
 van yes so I did not think not 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.760
 not installed logo gameplay but yes 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.699
 okay but i tried with the mannequin i 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.970
 I'll show you who I put there, no, no 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.200
 yourself and this is kt times here 20 pieces and on 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.130
 all of them you can swagger arrange 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.229
 crash tests and so on let's 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.600
 let's go to the first and the example of this 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.570
 tracks look at the toy toy 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.210
 looks very very nice very 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.659
 beautiful yes the graphics here are really 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.180
 very very decent and pretty 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.280
 so I promised to show you what am I 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.610
 made with a mannequin remember it play not me 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.070
 showed his insanely funny 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.680
 smiling friend so here i set 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.100
 his face here I think she is exactly here 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 just amazingly fits and so 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.700
 you can do first you can 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.750
 choose a character this is mister dismount 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.090
 missions dismount 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.060
 and mr eco it's a dude with a hefty 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.049
 head do not know his background 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.210
 he appeared here 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.310
 then there is the section vehicles 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.950
 there are plenty of vehicles here 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.040
 she even has a lot of fire engine 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.170
 office chair and much more in 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.210
 principle, you can choose all that your 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.099
 your heart's content you can arrange 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.539
 various obstacles but they can 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.880
 arrange only on specially 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.250
 allotted point but leave everything without 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.130
 although no, I'll just show you what 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.330
 they are there for example 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.000
 baronial ones here are these pins and 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.010
 much much more even 10 puddle with 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.350
 oiled so ok 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.110
 then you can change the position that is 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.190
 where your character is sitting and can be 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.080
 put him here so he is 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.670
 I was sitting here shaking as much as possible 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.200
 more grass can be strewed back and 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.350
 on the side and generally so here so that he 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.920
 terebone coles and on asphalt behind the general 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.030
 there is a choice and where to plant it 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.920
 choose yourself further 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.820
 You can choose the trajectory of movement on 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.850
 each track 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.710
 several of them well, that's basically all well 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.270
 you can still change the camera that is 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.230
 automatic can be like this from 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.040
 first person 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.470
 cameras turn on third-person view 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.870
 then there is a button dice mount 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.480
 to gazanut and finally have to arrange 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.050
 your unique crash test click on 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.110
 button released at the right moment 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.670
 accordingly to type 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.860
 max speed up i got 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.990
 quite a lot of injuries and 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.060
 set a new record on this track 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.340
 so here it turned out cool let's ka 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:33.790
 let's see what happened to my friend 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.320
 Andrei oh yes it hurts probably okay 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.280
 let's look at some other 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.470
 track and let's turn it on last 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.150
 also quite interesting and curious and 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.370
 so here it looks like it has y 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.280
 we have a few rings such a movement 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.470
 a kind of crossroads and suggest you 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.130
 let's change the vehicle 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.380
 deliver supply supply supply where 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.690
 here I saw a tricycle 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:04.990
 choose it it is generally for Fanu yah 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:09.570
 Well, supposedly a little baby will come out an hour 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:13.510
 on a busy highway drove the head 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:16.310
 dude dude look it's just tin he 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.220
 drove around all the cars and didn't hit 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.829
 no and just what he took up on 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.389
 turning unfortunately and crashed in general 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.430
 here really to have fun 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.780
