that<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.390> running<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.720> same<00:00:30.900> play<00:00:31.140> over<00:00:31.500> and

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
that is running the same play over and

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.459 
that is running the same play over and
over<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.009> you<00:00:32.489> can't<00:00:32.669> stop<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.230> first<00:00:34.230> there

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
over and you can't stop it first there

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.660 
over and you can't stop it first there
are<00:00:34.500> two<00:00:34.800> schools<00:00:35.040> of<00:00:35.219> thought<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.460> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
are two schools of thought on the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.729 
are two schools of thought on the
subject<00:00:35.700> one<00:00:36.510> side<00:00:36.719> thinks<00:00:36.750> if<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.530> working

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
subject one side thinks if it's working

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.530 
subject one side thinks if it's working
why<00:00:38.129> should<00:00:38.340> they<00:00:38.460> stop<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.760> it's<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.450> you

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
why should they stop it it's up to you

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.760 
why should they stop it it's up to you
to<00:00:39.600> stop<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.079> force<00:00:40.260> them<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> use<00:00:40.620> other

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
to stop it and force them to use other

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.459 
to stop it and force them to use other
plays<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:42.059> other<00:00:42.180> things<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:43.020> is<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.230> simple

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
plays the other things this is a simple

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.920 
plays the other things this is a simple

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
that there's something to learn for in

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.760 
that there's something to learn for in
something<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.570> could<00:00:48.690> take<00:00:48.899> from<00:00:49.590> this

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
something we could take from this

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.490 
something we could take from this
scenario<00:00:50.309> now<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> last<00:00:51.870> tutorial<00:00:52.110> we

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
scenario now in the last tutorial we

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.840 
scenario now in the last tutorial we
spoke<00:00:52.800> about<00:00:52.980> using<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> highlights<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
spoke about using the highlights at the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.010 
spoke about using the highlights at the
end<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> game<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.510> scout<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:54.930> an

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
end of the game to scout what an

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.900 
end of the game to scout what an
opponent<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:55.469> doing<00:00:55.770> effectively<00:00:56.430> against

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
opponent was doing effectively against

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.810 
opponent was doing effectively against
you<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.600> same<00:00:57.840> thing<00:00:58.079> can<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.289> done<00:00:58.379> here<00:00:59.070> jump

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
you the same thing can be done here jump

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.130 
you the same thing can be done here jump
in<00:00:59.940> there<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.120> see<00:01:00.329> what<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.570> was<00:01:00.690> happening

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
in there and see what all was happening

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.209 
in there and see what all was happening
during<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.469> play<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.859> see<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.039> there's

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
during the play and see if there's

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.160 
during the play and see if there's
something<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.579> could<00:01:02.699> take<00:01:02.850> from<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> after

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
something you could take from it after

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.420 
something you could take from it after
you've<00:01:04.290> done<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.500> attempt<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> find<00:01:05.280> that

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
you've done that attempt to find that

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.490 
you've done that attempt to find that
same<00:01:05.729> play<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.270> same<00:01:06.570> formation<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.320> one

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
same play in that same formation in one

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.080 
same play in that same formation in one
of<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.680> playbooks<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> hit<00:01:08.400> practice<00:01:08.880> mode

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
of the playbooks and hit practice mode

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.510 
of the playbooks and hit practice mode
remember<00:01:09.990> that<00:01:10.110> tutorial<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.799> spoke<00:01:11.460> about

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
remember that tutorial I spoke about

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.370 
remember that tutorial I spoke about
using<00:01:11.970> practice<00:01:12.420> mode<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.080> fact<00:01:13.290> that

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
using practice mode and the fact that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.440 
using practice mode and the fact that
the<00:01:13.530> ball<00:01:13.740> simply<00:01:14.159> resets<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:15.000> practice

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the ball simply resets to practice

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.870 
the ball simply resets to practice
against<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.900> particular<00:01:16.140> concept<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.070> this

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
against a particular concept in this

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.130 
against a particular concept in this
example<00:01:18.270> we're<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> jump<00:01:19.020> into

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
example we're going to jump into

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.330 
example we're going to jump into
practice<00:01:19.500> mode<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:19.950> go<00:01:20.100> through

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
practice mode and just go through

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.399 
practice mode and just go through
defenses<00:01:21.000> until<00:01:21.299> we<00:01:21.420> find<00:01:21.630> one<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.110> think

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
defenses until we find one that we think

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.679 
defenses until we find one that we think
looks<00:01:22.650> good<00:01:22.890> plug<00:01:23.759> in<00:01:23.880> your<00:01:24.000> other<00:01:24.210> controller

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
looks good plug in your other controller

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.210 
looks good plug in your other controller
and<00:01:24.990> when<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.200> think<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.470> defense<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:26.009> set

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
and when you think the defense is set

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.670 
and when you think the defense is set
press<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.060> on<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.479> other<00:01:27.659> controller<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.470> test

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
press a on the other controller to test

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.859 
press a on the other controller to test
the<00:01:28.829> outcome<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:30.060> process<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.720> repeated

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
the outcome this process can be repeated

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.510 
the outcome this process can be repeated
until<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.500> find<00:01:31.740> something<00:01:31.950> you're<00:01:32.130> happy

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
until you find something you're happy

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.760 
until you find something you're happy
with<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:33.360> can<00:01:33.479> go<00:01:33.570> at<00:01:33.689> your<00:01:33.780> own<00:01:33.810> pace<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.350> you

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
with you can go at your own pace and you

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.289 
with you can go at your own pace and you
can<00:01:34.920> change<00:01:35.100> play<00:01:35.430> books<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.850> back<00:01:36.060> out<00:01:36.240> of

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
can change play books and back out of
