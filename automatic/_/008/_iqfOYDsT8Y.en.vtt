but
yeah<00:01:51.350> one<00:01:51.530> of<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.649> problems<00:01:52.009> is<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.250> feels

guys<00:01:56.090> this<00:01:56.539> just<00:01:56.810> not<00:01:56.960> yeah<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.920> it's<00:01:58.280> deep

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
guys this just not yeah and it's deep

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.279 
guys this just not yeah and it's deep
because<00:01:58.670> what<00:01:59.240> what<00:01:59.509> caused<00:01:59.780> us<00:01:59.960> a<00:01:59.990> lot<00:02:00.079> of

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
because what what caused us a lot of

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.350 
because what what caused us a lot of
feedback<00:02:00.439> howl<00:02:00.950> and<00:02:01.219> hollow<00:02:01.490> body<00:02:01.729> guitars<00:02:02.119> is

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
feedback howl and hollow body guitars is

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.179 
feedback howl and hollow body guitars is
the<00:02:02.750> air<00:02:02.869> movement<00:02:03.110> from<00:02:03.530> the<00:02:03.710> low<00:02:03.860> side<00:02:04.070> of

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
the air movement from the low side of

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:05.230 
the air movement from the low side of
the<00:02:04.280> body<00:02:04.399> of<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.640> right<00:02:04.789> side<00:02:04.969> of<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.119> body

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
the body of the right side of the body

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.330 
the body of the right side of the body
so<00:02:05.719> because<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.259> that<00:02:06.590> brace<00:02:06.829> goes<00:02:07.070> all<00:02:07.310> the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
so because that that brace goes all the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.859 
so because that that brace goes all the
way<00:02:07.490> through<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.759> top<00:02:07.939> it<00:02:08.090> prevents<00:02:08.479> that<00:02:08.630> too

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
way through the top it prevents that too

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.990 
way through the top it prevents that too
and<00:02:09.110> this<00:02:09.679> will<00:02:09.920> Hallam<00:02:10.340> out<00:02:10.550> in<00:02:10.700> front<00:02:10.880> of

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
and this will Hallam out in front of

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.210 
and this will Hallam out in front of
that<00:02:11.480> beautiful<00:02:11.810> orange<00:02:12.319> marshal<00:02:12.769> stack<00:02:13.010> that

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
that beautiful orange marshal stack that

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.370 
that beautiful orange marshal stack that
they<00:02:13.370> have<00:02:13.489> in<00:02:13.700> Chicago<00:02:14.239> yeah<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.200> does

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
they have in Chicago yeah but it does

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.809 
they have in Chicago yeah but it does
have<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.620> higher<00:02:15.800> feedback<00:02:16.310> threshold<00:02:16.790> that

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
have a higher feedback threshold that

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.789 
have a higher feedback threshold that

Reverend<00:03:08.069> along<00:03:08.459> with<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.700> hollow<00:03:08.940> body<00:03:09.120> we

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
Reverend along with that hollow body we

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.369 
Reverend along with that hollow body we
just<00:03:09.480> talked<00:03:09.629> about<00:03:09.720> it<00:03:09.930> so<00:03:10.019> it's<00:03:10.140> cool<00:03:10.349> that

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
just talked about it so it's cool that

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.420 
just talked about it so it's cool that
you<00:03:10.590> mentioned<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:12.379> large<00:03:13.379> semi<00:03:13.890> auto<00:03:14.129> body

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
you mentioned this large semi auto body

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.970 
you mentioned this large semi auto body
kareena<00:03:15.239> bag<00:03:16.790> solid<00:03:17.790> spruce<00:03:18.120> top<00:03:18.510> on<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.980> boat

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
kareena bag solid spruce top on a boat

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.910 
kareena bag solid spruce top on a boat
on<00:03:20.599> 25<00:03:21.599> and<00:03:21.629> a<00:03:21.780> half<00:03:21.930> inch<00:03:22.110> scale<00:03:22.349> maple<00:03:22.769> neck

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.920 
on 25 and a half inch scale maple neck
so<00:03:23.489> these<00:03:23.640> think<00:03:23.970> these<00:03:24.150> three<00:03:24.420> features<00:03:24.599> all

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
so these think these three features all

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.530 
so these think these three features all
combined<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.980> give<00:03:26.129> this<00:03:26.310> guitar<00:03:26.730> like<00:03:27.420> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
combined to give this guitar like the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.990 
combined to give this guitar like the
open<00:03:27.930> sound<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.709> semi<00:03:29.040> hollow<00:03:29.220> but<00:03:29.760> it<00:03:29.910> has

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
open sound of the semi hollow but it has

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.520 
open sound of the semi hollow but it has
a<00:03:30.030> little<00:03:30.239> acoustic<00:03:30.569> zing<00:03:30.989> from<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.319> first

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
a little acoustic zing from this first

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.220 
a little acoustic zing from this first
top<00:03:31.799> that<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.040> can<00:03:32.250> hear<00:03:32.569> and<00:03:33.569> it's<00:03:33.900> really
