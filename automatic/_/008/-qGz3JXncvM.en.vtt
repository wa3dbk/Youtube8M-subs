00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:09.580 

I<00:00:06.580> think<00:00:07.580> the<00:00:07.939> best<00:00:08.090> part<00:00:08.300> of<00:00:08.450> having<00:00:08.690> students

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
I think the best part of having students

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.370 
I think the best part of having students
participate<00:00:10.190> in<00:00:10.430> a<00:00:10.490> program<00:00:10.880> like<00:00:10.910> my<00:00:11.660> ass<00:00:11.840> is

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
participate in a program like my ass is

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.269 
participate in a program like my ass is
that<00:00:12.620> it<00:00:12.770> stretches<00:00:13.310> them<00:00:13.520> and<00:00:13.820> it<00:00:14.540> gives<00:00:14.810> them

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:15.279 
that it stretches them and it gives them

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:21.790 
that it stretches them and it gives them
role<00:00:16.279> models<00:00:16.760> to<00:00:17.000> emulate<00:00:20.230> you<00:00:21.230> have<00:00:21.380> an<00:00:21.499> idea

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
of what children can accomplish and then

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.309 
of what children can accomplish and then
