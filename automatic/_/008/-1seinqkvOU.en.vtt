00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:31.849
 yes hello my dear ones get to mine 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:34.190
 review of game and vario the nintendo 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.800
 console has something new at the moment 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.870
 something unique and new feature 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.850
 but that because the people came 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.410
 motionplus but also had before 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.820
 nintendo always great new ideas and 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.390
 Now we have a video with this 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.309
 Game pad and spend is always certain 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.379
 games gave the first show exactly 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.210
 wanted and had to do what can this 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.860
 console at that time was the wii 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.449
 sports or replay you can 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.920
 remember you showed the people 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.470
 you can do that wii and have this 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.989
 games tricked and now we had 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.449
 For example, Nintendo Entertainment was 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.299
 just nice but in my opinion 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:11.000
 is now the perfect way around 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.500
 show people what can youview what 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.869
 is really everything with this game pad 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.640
 possible there is in my opinion the 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.640
 perfect opportunity game and vario 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.530
 like to put on dunga as well 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.530
 the radio 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.290
 in game and vario there ne story 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.930
 I did not care a bit I wanted to 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.930
 not willing and the one with mario has me 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.780
 in a certain sense disappointed 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.240
 but also surprised 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.430
 game and vario playing time quite a lot 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.860
 mini-games and to anticipate it 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.000
 desires because it is less about 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.400
 the multiplayer goes 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.670
 it surprised me a lot 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.470
 because it's damn ideal singleplayer 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.000
 campaigns really has you have to stop 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.850
 always a few minigames 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.850
 In any case, the simplest degree exist 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.110
 just to get the next game 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.390
 and it starts right away 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.190
 Pretty fun mini game and I can 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.870
 not show all today 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.030
 I can only say the mini games 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.190
 with vario they are such fun 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.810
 there are things like that you do that 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.360
 gamepad heats from back to front 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.980
 hold and shoot an arrow or 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.260
 Bowling balls shoot and the tax 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.150
 is that on the gamepad or that 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.250
 you are two at a gamepad meeting there 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.200
 the things are my favorite 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.940
 minispiel is yes that with the camera on 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.290
 In any case, the other things have good 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.269
 also really fun and that with the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.650
 looking that you stop on the gamepad yes 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.880
 other things she is than on the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.100
 TV that was already both 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.830
 nintendo lenz thus this joschi fruit 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.320
 play but here it is super fun 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.700
 implemented and the one with the camera it 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.769
 it was just so cold this gameplay 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.660
 you have to stop with the gamepad son of a 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.660
 handheld camera you have to keep it as a camera 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.010
 and so it is on the television 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.360
 Do you keep these celebrities or later 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.340
 also spirits and other things and must 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.410
 you take the picture in a certain pose 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.660
 you can zoom in and out and me 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.600
 have always thought only one thing makes so 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.260
 have fun that why not think now 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.820
 a pokÃ©mon snap 2 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.650
 that was as perfectly shown as the one with 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.350
 this camera thing works that 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.700
 bike around with this path and 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.930
 then you constantly see the book and the 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.610
 page and you have to with this game per 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.329
 Listen to it and look for something 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.860
 would be a dream 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:37.110
 but I know to anticipate it 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.820
 moderate is gaming barrio 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.959
 not the new revelation, that's what 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.049
 I actually thought 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.090
 there are multiplayer games but yes 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.590
 The whole thing does not work online 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.800
 Where 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.959
 and also in the multiplayer gives time already 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.000
 but it's not like that now 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.040
 one like mario party are all evening 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.660
 could fill it or how with mario 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.650
 kart or smash brothers he then 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.780
 also come sometime 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.819
 It may be fun to do 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.700
 Jump or this funny game modo 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.310
 hockey thus a slingshot so to speak 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.519
 the whole blocks on a target 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.549
 Shooting makes everything fun but I had 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.380
 I have to expect more honestly 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.389
 but I still love this game 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.680
 totally always when people are looking for me and 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.079
 I want to be the people look that 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.970
 Can this game pad then I lay game 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.900
 and barrio rhine and the people have it 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.610
 a fun with it 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.400
 you know still missing at which the 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.229
 wiimotion have shown and the people only 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.669
 does that work and we have the whole thing 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.200
 completely rediscovered that happens now 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.510
 with game and vario they are like that 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.639
 fascinated by it or with the 3ds show 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.590
 I like that face raiders like you 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.639
 really do the thing and in 3d that 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.010
 have to complete completely 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:46.830
 and game and mario really do a lot 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.389
 fun and is it just different multiplayer 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.370
 moderately if you stop people visit 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.110
 then then plays from time to time one or two 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.990
 the gamepad and it goes the thing rome 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.030
 and you have so much fun with the thing 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.700
 and that would be synonymous my conclusion to 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:01.410
 game in bio it's not the big new one 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.729
 online multiplayer experience the man 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:04.590
 maybe had expected 

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.630
 Nevertheless, this game is playing along 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.729
 many people have a lot of fun 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.320
 not by the multiplayer title the 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.669
 the game involves but simply 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.590
 by the way of the game through the 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.970
 funny crazy batty by the 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.760
 many different possibilities 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.410
 the gamepad used in sometimes 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.090
 do you think keep it that way and you have so 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.099
 the jumps only followed in peace you have to 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.500
 as I said to shoot or sit her 

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:27.330
 two then a gamepad and thereby makes 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.250
 It also holds true with several people 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.630
 I have a lot of fun with several people 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.120
 played and I can only say we 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.860
 had a lot of fun and my conclusion 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.710
 actually quite right for this game 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.090
 well, and i am in one 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.620
 Certainly recommend 

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.840
 It also does a lot in the singleplayer 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.740
 fun but also with several people makes 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.599
 it is very moody 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.919
 my conclusion is already good but me 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.050
 I was stung this one 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.460
 mustache get a lot and one 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.130
 vario figure 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.930
 and since I am very very stable 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.099
 My conclusion is much better and me 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.009
 you have to tell her you have to get that 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.800
 Sell âârag 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:02.479
 well, if you like the game after mine 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.009
 I would like to buy video then it would be me 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:06.080
 happy if ye if ye on 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.699
 amazon buys my amazon link power 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.830
 but would not really be happy 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:12.020
 I hope we always have this video 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.029
 you liked and i could not play 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.169
 wins is against your imagination 

00:06:14.029 --> 00:06:16.759
 the recommend 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.039
 always remember I do not recommend it 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.300
 but all this game, people stop 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.249
 with several people like something 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.139
 play ball on the menu and it lacks 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:25.969
 Gaming allows me to play 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:28.039
 Barium is a lot of fun with several 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:30.289
 people, even if not so many 

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:31.699
 multiplayer title beat montagsmaler was 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.770
 course also in the box so one 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:35.389
 great match 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.919
 nevertheless we see you at 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.919
 next the place says goodbye 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.670
 walter this double-sided adhesive tape 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:49.830
 that I used for the mustache 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.830
 beastly old ear stinks
