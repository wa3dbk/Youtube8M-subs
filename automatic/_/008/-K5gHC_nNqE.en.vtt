00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
site in this list should work with the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.760 
site in this list should work with the

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
accept flash and work on the tablet but

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.430 
accept flash and work on the tablet but
that<00:03:18.030> doesn't<00:03:18.330> seem<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.540> be<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.720> case<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:18.960> what

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
that doesn't seem to be the case so what

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.630 
that doesn't seem to be the case so what
you<00:03:20.280> need<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.490> do<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:22.340> copy<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:25.430> previous<00:03:26.430> one

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
you need to do is copy a previous one

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.520 
you need to do is copy a previous one
this<00:03:27.480> is<00:03:27.600> very<00:03:27.750> difficult<00:03:28.020> to<00:03:28.260> do<00:03:28.380> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
this is very difficult to do the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.400 
this is very difficult to do the
keyboard<00:03:28.950> so<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.630> may<00:03:30.630> just<00:03:30.660> have<00:03:30.960> stayed<00:03:31.200> in

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
keyboard so I may just have stayed in

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.710 
keyboard so I may just have stayed in
the<00:03:31.470> keyboard<00:03:31.650> at<00:03:31.920> some<00:03:32.100> point<00:03:32.310> just<00:03:32.520> to<00:03:32.850> get

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
the keyboard at some point just to get

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.430 
the keyboard at some point just to get
this<00:03:33.780> done<00:03:34.170> is<00:03:35.510> let<00:03:36.510> me<00:03:36.630> just<00:03:36.810> paste<00:03:37.110> that<00:03:37.230> in

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
this done is let me just paste that in

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.300 
this done is let me just paste that in
there<00:03:39.590> just<00:03:40.590> bear<00:03:40.740> with<00:03:40.770> me<00:03:40.920> while<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.100> get<00:03:41.250> my

little better you just need the name and

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.920 
little better you just need the name and
the<00:04:10.650> final<00:04:11.610> de<00:04:11.730> name<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.180> main<00:04:12.300> bit<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:12.720> if<00:04:12.780> i

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
the final de name the main bit so if i

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.849 
the final de name the main bit so if i
pasted<00:04:13.860> in<00:04:14.070> there<00:04:14.250> now<00:04:15.109> that<00:04:16.109> should<00:04:16.560> do<00:04:16.830> it

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
pasted in there now that should do it

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.440 
pasted in there now that should do it
let<00:04:17.190> me<00:04:17.220> just<00:04:17.459> delete<00:04:17.850> that<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.120> little<00:04:18.359> bit

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
let me just delete that a little bit

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.090 
let me just delete that a little bit
there<00:04:20.330> so<00:04:21.330> i<00:04:21.359> think<00:04:21.570> now<00:04:22.230> that<00:04:22.290> that<00:04:22.620> should<00:04:22.830> be

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
there so i think now that that should be

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.200 
there so i think now that that should be
the<00:04:23.400> correct<00:04:24.410> address<00:04:25.410> so<00:04:26.280> we<00:04:26.310> save<00:04:27.000> the

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
the correct address so we save the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.439 
the correct address so we save the
document<00:04:27.419> there

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.260 

and<00:04:30.830> since<00:04:31.830> we're<00:04:32.039> in<00:04:32.069> internet<00:04:32.610> explorer<00:04:33.029> I'm

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
and since we're in internet explorer I'm

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.129 
and since we're in internet explorer I'm
going<00:04:33.449> to<00:04:33.539> have<00:04:33.659> to<00:04:33.689> delete<00:04:34.169> the<00:04:36.139> browsing

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
going to have to delete the browsing

going to have to delete the browsing
history<00:04:37.409> again<00:04:44.629> so<00:04:45.629> delete<00:04:45.960> the<00:04:46.110> browsing

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:46.349

history<00:04:51.050> which<00:04:52.050> has<00:04:52.229> done<00:04:53.150> will<00:04:54.150> close<00:04:54.449> the

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
not a particularly great video this one

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.040 
not a particularly great video this one
I<00:05:42.890> must<00:05:43.130> admit<00:05:43.310> I<00:05:43.460> just<00:05:44.300> got<00:05:44.420> a<00:05:44.450> bit<00:05:44.630> stumped<00:05:44.960> on

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.860 
again soon in another surface rvt video
which<00:05:49.580> would<00:05:49.730> probably<00:05:50.030> be<00:05:50.180> the<00:05:50.390> response<00:05:50.720> to

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
which would probably be the response to

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.540 
which would probably be the response to
this<00:05:51.020> one<00:05:51.290> when<00:05:51.770> somebody<00:05:52.130> tells<00:05:52.280> me<00:05:52.400> how<00:05:52.490> to

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:52.550 
this one when somebody tells me how to

00:05:52.550 --> 00:06:01.800 
this one when somebody tells me how to
fix<00:05:52.820> it<00:05:52.970> see<00:05:53.660> you<00:05:53.750> later
