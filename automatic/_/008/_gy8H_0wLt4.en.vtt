ridiculous<00:03:05.020> card<00:03:05.590> anyway<00:03:05.950> very<00:03:06.340> very<00:03:06.700> rare<00:03:07.090> i

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
think is very cheap as well but there is

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.310 
think is very cheap as well but there is
some<00:03:10.090> on<00:03:10.180> the<00:03:10.270> market<00:03:10.600> they've<00:03:10.780> always<00:03:11.050> pick

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
but i wanted to use

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.840 
but i wanted to use
tennessee's<00:04:26.960> and<00:04:27.170> Alexis<00:04:27.620> Sanchez<00:04:28.070> who<00:04:28.520> also

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
tennessee's and Alexis Sanchez who also

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.420 
tennessee's and Alexis Sanchez who also
is<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.360> very<00:04:29.690> very<00:04:29.900> good<00:04:30.080> player<00:04:30.350> now<00:04:30.890> if<00:04:31.250> you

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
is a very very good player now if you

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.130 
is a very very good player now if you
can<00:04:31.550> change<00:04:31.820> anything<00:04:32.090> about<00:04:32.330> a<00:04:32.360> team<00:04:32.600> i<00:04:32.810> would

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
can change anything about a team i would

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.110 
can change anything about a team i would
probably<00:04:33.290> put<00:04:33.500> a<00:04:33.650> target<00:04:33.950> man<00:04:34.340> at<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.850> striker

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
probably put a target man at the striker

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.480 
probably put a target man at the striker
position<00:04:35.690> just<00:04:36.560> because<00:04:36.800> obviously<00:04:37.130> when<00:04:37.370> you

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
position just because obviously when you

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.130 
position just because obviously when you
ping<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:37.850> ball<00:04:38.000> to<00:04:38.210> sergio<00:04:38.600> grammar<00:04:38.810> it

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
ping the ball to sergio grammar it

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.420 
ping the ball to sergio grammar it

doesn't have the height on board but

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.540 
doesn't have the height on board but
finishing<00:04:42.500> why<00:04:42.620> is<00:04:42.680> he<00:04:42.890> is<00:04:43.010> ridiculous<00:04:43.520> and

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
finishing why is he is ridiculous and

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.160 
finishing why is he is ridiculous and

like for a player which edori the light

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.220 
like for a player which edori the light
moving<00:04:51.680> from<00:04:51.890> camp<00:04:52.300> actually<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.360> serious<00:04:53.810> and

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
moving from camp actually I serious and

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.230

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
all that players moving from come to the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.150 
all that players moving from come to the
wings<00:04:56.480> because<00:04:57.020> they<00:04:57.260> don't<00:04:57.440> feel<00:04:57.620> right<00:04:57.830> but

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
wings because they don't feel right but

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.220 
wings because they don't feel right but
DeMaria<00:04:58.640> honesty<00:04:59.150> suits<00:04:59.450> the<00:04:59.780> left<00:05:00.020> wing

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
DeMaria honesty suits the left wing

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.230 
DeMaria honesty suits the left wing
maybe<00:05:00.890> it's<00:05:01.130> because<00:05:01.250> of<00:05:01.460> his<00:05:01.550> magnitude<00:05:01.940> pace

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
maybe it's because of his magnitude pace

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.360 
maybe it's because of his magnitude pace
maybe<00:05:03.230> it's<00:05:03.470> because<00:05:03.620> of<00:05:03.860> his<00:05:03.950> magnitude

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
maybe it's because of his magnitude

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.890 
maybe it's because of his magnitude
really<00:05:04.700> maybe<00:05:04.910> because<00:05:05.270> of<00:05:05.330> his<00:05:05.450> false<00:05:05.690> fire

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
really maybe because of his false fire

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.800 
really maybe because of his false fire
skills<00:05:06.110> but<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.890> one<00:05:07.120> negative<00:05:08.120> i<00:05:08.450> did<00:05:08.600> find

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
skills but the one negative i did find

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.410 
skills but the one negative i did find
him<00:05:08.960> it's<00:05:09.230> obviously<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:10.520> fact<00:05:10.820> that<00:05:11.030> when

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
him it's obviously the fact that when

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.240 
him it's obviously the fact that when
you<00:05:11.540> cut<00:05:11.750> inside<00:05:12.080> of<00:05:12.290> him<00:05:12.380> he<00:05:12.680> has<00:05:12.800> a<00:05:12.830> tuesday

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.250 
you cut inside of him he has a tuesday

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.530 
you cut inside of him he has a tuesday
how<00:05:13.340> weak<00:05:13.550> foot<00:05:13.820> so<00:05:13.940> he<00:05:14.000> doesn't<00:05:14.270> really<00:05:14.360> like

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
how weak foot so he doesn't really like

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.840 
how weak foot so he doesn't really like
using<00:05:14.810> his<00:05:15.050> right<00:05:15.260> foot<00:05:15.560> which<00:05:16.100> is<00:05:16.340> perfect
