I think it'll be good for him to kind of

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.840

daily plan or a straining is much

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.950 
daily plan or a straining is much
different<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.350> mean<00:01:01.649> his<00:01:01.770> training<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.430> half

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960

different I mean his training is half
might<00:01:03.960> be<00:01:04.140> in<00:01:04.799> some<00:01:05.100> places<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.489> third<00:01:05.850> well<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
might be in some places a third well you

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.810 
might be in some places a third well you
get<00:01:06.900> back<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.260> where<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.560> were<00:01:07.710> never<00:01:08.580> going

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
get back to where you were never going

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.340 
get back to where you were never going
and<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.540> it's<00:01:09.630> working<00:01:09.810> right<00:01:10.140> what

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and I think it's working right what

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.990 
and I think it's working right what
we're<00:01:10.500> doing<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.799> working<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.700> dis

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
we're doing is working for this dis

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.640 
we're doing is working for this dis
races<00:01:12.390> now<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.570> don't<00:01:12.689> think<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.020> works<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.470> you

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
races now I don't think it works for you

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.740 
races now I don't think it works for you
know<00:01:13.740> 17<00:01:14.310> swims<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.820> eight<00:01:14.970> days<00:01:15.180> but<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.540> might

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
know 17 swims in eight days but it might

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.649 
know 17 swims in eight days but it might
work<00:01:15.780> for<00:01:16.400> six<00:01:17.400> or<00:01:17.610> seven<00:01:17.909> swims<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.390> shorter

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
work for six or seven swims and shorter

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.070 
work for six or seven swims and shorter
races<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.380> think<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.009> he<00:01:20.840> has<00:01:21.840> done<00:01:22.049> a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
races so I think that he has done a

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.719 
races so I think that he has done a
really<00:01:22.290> good<00:01:22.530> job<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.920> he's<00:01:22.979> it's<00:01:23.310> gonna<00:01:23.520> go

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
really good job and he's it's gonna go

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.700 
really good job and he's it's gonna go
off<00:01:23.759> but<00:01:24.570> just<00:01:24.810> at<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> point<00:01:25.229> where<00:01:25.439> we<00:01:25.560> are<00:01:25.590> I

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
off but just at the point where we are I

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.950 
off but just at the point where we are I
think<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.250> quite<00:01:26.460> good<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.810> one

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
think it's really quite good so that one

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.789 
think it's really quite good so that one

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.420 
backstroker in 1976 and it works same
thing<00:03:12.450> same<00:03:12.660> program<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.830> it's<00:03:14.160> kind<00:03:14.370> of

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
thing same program so it's kind of

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.759 
thing same program so it's kind of
cyclical<00:03:14.880> and<00:03:15.239> what<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.750> try<00:03:16.080> to<00:03:16.110> do<00:03:16.380> is<00:03:16.620> take

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
cyclical and what I try to do is take

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.470 
cyclical and what I try to do is take
the<00:03:16.950> best<00:03:17.190> parts<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.610> that<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.090> have<00:03:18.239> done

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
the best parts of that and we have done

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.690 
the best parts of that and we have done
something<00:03:19.019> relatively<00:03:19.890> similar<00:03:20.190> I<00:03:20.310> plan<00:03:20.670> to

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
something relatively similar I plan to

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.920 
something relatively similar I plan to
actually<00:03:20.970> do<00:03:21.239> something<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.630> little<00:03:21.660> more

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
actually do something a little more

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.949 
actually do something a little more
similar<00:03:22.530> going<00:03:22.800> forward<00:03:23.330> but<00:03:24.330> kind<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.630> mixing

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
similar going forward but kind of mixing

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.660 
similar going forward but kind of mixing
it<00:03:25.050> with<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.260> other<00:03:25.410> things<00:03:25.680> we<00:03:26.190> do<00:03:26.340> which<00:03:26.550> I

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
it with the other things we do which I

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.979 
it with the other things we do which I
think<00:03:26.850> are<00:03:26.910> really<00:03:27.090> important<00:03:27.630> because<00:03:27.720> I

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
think are really important because I

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.920 
think are really important because I
tend<00:03:28.680> to<00:03:28.769> see<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.100> more<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.610> a<00:03:30.030> holistic

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
tend to see it more as a holistic

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.380 
tend to see it more as a holistic
organism<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.800> has<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.370> be<00:03:32.610> conditioned<00:03:33.269> in

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
organism that has to be conditioned in

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.820 
organism that has to be conditioned in
many<00:03:33.600> ways<00:03:33.810> not<00:03:34.080> just<00:03:34.140> physically

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
many ways not just physically

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.640 
many ways not just physically
emotionally<00:03:35.660> psychological<00:03:36.660> holistic

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
emotionally psychological holistic

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.070 
emotionally psychological holistic
program<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.730> you<00:03:38.850> have<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.180> follow<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:40.050> I

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
program that you have to follow and I

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.720 
program that you have to follow and I
don't<00:03:40.260> think<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.500> just<00:03:40.650> do<00:03:40.950> one<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.370> this

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
don't think you just do one of this

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.820 
don't think you just do one of this
thing<00:03:42.030> or<00:03:42.300> just<00:03:42.330> only<00:03:42.780> do<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.530> think<00:03:43.709> there

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
thing or just only do this I think there

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.410 
thing or just only do this I think there
needs<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.040> be<00:03:44.100> a<00:03:44.160> variety<00:03:44.610> of<00:03:44.640> stimulant<00:03:45.090> but<00:03:45.390> I

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
needs to be a variety of stimulant but I

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.880 
needs to be a variety of stimulant but I
think<00:03:45.660> it's<00:03:45.750> all<00:03:45.870> good<00:03:46.080> it's<00:03:46.290> very<00:03:46.410> very<00:03:46.769> good

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
think it's all good it's very very good

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.440 
think it's all good it's very very good
