00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
start the shakes that they would not fan

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.830 
start the shakes that they would not fan
out<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.079> shelves<00:01:34.640> these<00:01:35.640> cans<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.270> here<00:01:36.540> are

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
obviously unprotected then the shaker

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.660

pretty<00:01:51.110> good<00:01:51.320> shape<00:01:51.380> they<00:01:51.979> wouldn't<00:01:52.340> be

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
pretty good shape they wouldn't be

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.330 
pretty good shape they wouldn't be
destroyed<00:01:53.350> hands<00:01:54.350> might<00:01:54.650> be<00:01:54.860> dead<00:01:55.100> up<00:01:55.220> a

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340
