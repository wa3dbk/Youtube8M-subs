can see the ice buildup at the bottom of

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:53.990 
can see the ice buildup at the bottom of
this<00:00:52.000> it<00:00:52.269> just<00:00:52.480> continually<00:00:53.109> leaks<00:00:53.320> water

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
they're absolutely flat

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.319 
they're absolutely flat
there<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.049> no<00:03:40.230> rocking<00:03:40.849> they're<00:03:41.849> absolutely

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.770 
flat they're sitting on rubber feet I
will<00:03:47.160> try<00:03:47.519> and<00:03:47.790> get<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.180> maybe<00:03:48.419> with<00:03:48.660> some

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
will try and get this maybe with some

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.159 
will try and get this maybe with some
contrast<00:03:49.379> we<00:03:49.530> might<00:03:49.709> be<00:03:49.829> able<00:03:49.949> to<00:03:50.069> see<00:03:51.169> down

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
contrast we might be able to see down

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:57.920 
contrast we might be able to see down
here<00:03:52.230> if<00:03:52.980> you<00:03:53.250> look<00:03:53.430> at<00:03:53.730> this<00:03:54.980> time<00:03:56.599> right<00:03:57.599> here

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
here if you look at this time right here

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.059 
here if you look at this time right here
and<00:03:58.579> if<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.699> come<00:03:59.879> across<00:04:00.239> here<00:04:03.260> this<00:04:04.260> tine<00:04:04.709> is

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
and if you come across here this tine is

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.800 
and if you come across here this tine is
high<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.849> this<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.180> low<00:04:06.650> which<00:04:07.650> creates<00:04:08.129> the

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
high and this is low which creates the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:13.099 
high and this is low which creates the
depression<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:10.909> which<00:04:11.909> raises<00:04:12.389> up<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.870> pot

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:13.109 
depression and which raises up the pot

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.629 
depression and which raises up the pot
and<00:04:13.319> allows<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:14.329> rock<00:04:15.329> back<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:15.840> forth

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
and allows it to rock back and forth

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.310 
and allows it to rock back and forth
this<00:04:17.639> is<00:04:17.849> high<00:04:18.030> this<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.510> low<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.930> that's<00:04:19.169> the

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
this is high this is low and that's the

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.940 
this is high this is low and that's the
same<00:04:19.560> as<00:04:20.419> you<00:04:21.419> can<00:04:21.450> see<00:04:22.039> right<00:04:23.039> here

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
same as you can see right here

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.240 
same as you can see right here
this<00:04:25.100> drops<00:04:25.730> down<00:04:26.560> you<00:04:27.560> can<00:04:27.710> see<00:04:27.830> it<00:04:27.920> angle

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
this drops down you can see it angle

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:35.550 
this drops down you can see it angle
down<00:04:28.460> in<00:04:28.900> the<00:04:29.900> n1<00:04:30.380> on<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.830> far<00:04:31.520> left<00:04:31.910> is<00:04:33.760> high

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
down in the n1 on the far left is high

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.160 
down in the n1 on the far left is high
so<00:04:36.560> that<00:04:36.800> is<00:04:37.100> my<00:04:37.900> problem

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
so that is my problem

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.350 
so that is my problem
hopefully<00:04:40.130> we<00:04:40.250> will<00:04:40.400> get<00:04:40.490> Electrolux<00:04:41.090> to

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
hopefully we will get Electrolux to

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.050 
hopefully we will get Electrolux to
resolve<00:04:41.720> the<00:04:41.900> issue
