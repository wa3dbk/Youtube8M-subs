00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.530 
bid of as much money as I could possibly
have<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.700> it<00:01:29.820> doesn't<00:01:29.850> matter<00:01:30.090> if<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.360> lose

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
have because it doesn't matter if I lose

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.410 
have because it doesn't matter if I lose
at<00:01:30.720> all<00:01:30.840> pretty<00:01:31.110> much<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.520> accepted<00:01:33.030> so

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
at all pretty much and they accepted so

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.380 
at all pretty much and they accepted so
i<00:01:34.340> think<00:01:35.340> i<00:01:35.610> am<00:01:36.590> bid<00:01:37.590> over<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.100> hundred<00:01:38.549> million

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
i think i am bid over a hundred million

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.649 
i think i am bid over a hundred million
I<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:40.020> firm<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:41.130> says<00:01:41.430> he<00:01:41.880> was<00:01:42.119> average

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
I think firm and it says he was average

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.929 
I think firm and it says he was average
at<00:01:42.780> about<00:01:43.049> 50<00:01:43.829> million<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.700> was<00:01:44.790> no

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
at about 50 million so there was no

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.230 
at about 50 million so there was no
doubt<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> team<00:01:45.780> would<00:01:46.850> would<00:01:47.850> accept

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
doubt that the team would would accept

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.830 
doubt that the team would would accept
but<00:01:49.280> he<00:01:50.280> may<00:01:50.549> not<00:01:50.729> accept<00:01:51.060> he<00:01:51.390> didn't<00:01:51.630> accept

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
but he may not accept he didn't accept

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.620 
but he may not accept he didn't accept
the<00:01:51.960> first<00:01:52.170> time<00:01:52.350> he<00:01:52.470> declined<00:01:52.799> yeah<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:54.119> what

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
the first time he declined yeah so what

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.130 
the first time he declined yeah so what
I<00:01:54.659> did<00:01:54.780> was<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.500> think<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.250> changed<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.420> a

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
I did was I think I changed it to a

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.109 
I did was I think I changed it to a
one-year<00:01:58.770> contract<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.880> made<00:02:00.030> it

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
one-year contract and that made it

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.670 
one-year contract and that made it
easier<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.780> keep<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.079> three<00:02:01.290> years<00:02:01.469> he

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
easier so if you keep on three years he

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.889 
easier so if you keep on three years he
might<00:02:01.860> decline<00:02:02.130> and<00:02:02.520> Wayne<00:02:03.210> Rooney<00:02:03.540> himself

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
might decline and Wayne Rooney himself

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.069 
might decline and Wayne Rooney himself
but<00:02:04.439> i<00:02:04.619> changed<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.640> rebid<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.570> one

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
but i changed it then I rebid to one

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.050 
but i changed it then I rebid to one
year<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.530> got<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:07.979> achievement<00:02:08.039> here<00:02:08.520> which

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
year and got the achievement here which

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.880 
year and got the achievement here which
is<00:02:09.179> massive<00:02:09.509> signing<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.020> not<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.349> talk<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.770> get

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
is massive signing so not to talk to get

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.110 
is massive signing so not to talk to get
that's<00:02:11.069> probably<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.400> easiest<00:02:11.760> way<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> get

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
that's probably the easiest way to get

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.820 
that's probably the easiest way to get
it<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.420> sign<00:02:13.080> Wayne<00:02:13.379> Rooney
