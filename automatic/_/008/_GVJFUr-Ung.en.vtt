00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
to use today I've also got five

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
to use today I've also got five
different<00:00:36.059> shades<00:00:36.510> of<00:00:36.809> our<00:00:37.200> sweet

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
different shades of our sweet

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.040 
different shades of our sweet
buttercream<00:00:38.010> recipe<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.760> I've<00:00:39.540> attached<00:00:39.870> to

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
buttercream recipe and I've attached to

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.979 
buttercream recipe and I've attached to
the<00:00:40.200> ends<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.620> them<00:00:40.800> just<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.760> couple<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.780> we

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
the ends of them just a couple up so we

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.389 
the ends of them just a couple up so we
normally<00:00:43.110> use<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.100> can<00:00:44.250> keep

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
normally use this so that we can keep

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.459 
normally use this so that we can keep
changing<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> piping<00:00:45.329> tip<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.719> this<00:00:46.170> case

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
changing the piping tip in this case

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.319 
changing the piping tip in this case
we're<00:00:46.739> going<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.890> use<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.309> exactly<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:48.090> this

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
we're going to use it exactly like this

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.660 
we're going to use it exactly like this
so<00:00:48.930> look<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> coupler<00:00:49.800> where<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.430> doesn't

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
so look for a coupler where it doesn't

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.580 
so look for a coupler where it doesn't
have<00:00:50.820> any<00:00:51.059> cut<00:00:51.360> out<00:00:51.539> section<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:52.199> all<00:00:52.350> it's

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
have any cut out section at all it's

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.979 
have any cut out section at all it's
just<00:00:52.860> nice<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.520> round<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.270> we're<00:00:54.780> going<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
just nice and round and we're going to

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
just nice and round and we're going to
be<00:00:55.110> using<00:00:55.320> those<00:00:55.649> to<00:00:56.340> create<00:00:56.699> our<00:00:56.879> little

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
be using those to create our little

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.299 
be using those to create our little
dollops<00:00:57.629> then<00:00:58.289> we're<00:00:58.440> going<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.620> be<00:00:58.770> taking<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
dollops then we're going to be taking a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.849 
dollops then we're going to be taking a

and<00:01:55.429> then<00:01:55.609> you<00:01:55.700> want<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:55.909> come<00:01:56.090> ahead<00:01:56.210> with

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
and then you want to come ahead with

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.960 
and then you want to come ahead with
your<00:01:56.539> spatula

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:16.360 

and<00:02:00.060> just<00:02:00.690> drag<00:02:01.050> it

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.430 

now<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.030> start<00:02:17.360> our<00:02:17.510> second<00:02:17.900> row<00:02:18.050> we're<00:02:18.319> going

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
now to start our second row we're going

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.559 
now to start our second row we're going
to<00:02:18.500> take<00:02:18.680> our<00:02:18.800> top<00:02:19.010> color<00:02:19.310> place<00:02:19.819> it<00:02:20.000> down<00:02:20.150> here

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
to take our top color place it down here

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.759 
to take our top color place it down here
and<00:02:20.750> just<00:02:20.959> overlap<00:02:21.470> by<00:02:21.709> about<00:02:21.950> halfway

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
and just overlap by about halfway

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.729 
and just overlap by about halfway
squeeze<00:02:24.769> and<00:02:25.959> then<00:02:26.959> keep<00:02:27.170> going<00:02:27.200> with<00:02:27.650> the

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
squeeze and then keep going with the

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:37.900 
squeeze and then keep going with the
rest<00:02:27.920> of<00:02:28.069> your<00:02:28.190> color<00:02:28.400> scheme

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.390 

and<00:02:38.210> just<00:02:38.630> wiping<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.290> excess<00:02:39.710> on<00:02:40.010> a<00:02:40.070> paper

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
and just wiping the excess on a paper

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.870 
and just wiping the excess on a paper
towel<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:44.620> then<00:02:45.620> you<00:02:45.740> just<00:02:45.920> continue<00:02:46.100> along

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
towel and then you just continue along

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.910 
towel and then you just continue along
now<00:02:47.540> just<00:02:47.900> like<00:02:48.050> any<00:02:48.260> of<00:02:48.350> our<00:02:48.560> other<00:02:48.710> lessons

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
now just like any of our other lessons

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.010 
now just like any of our other lessons
when<00:02:49.700> we're<00:02:49.850> doing<00:02:49.970> piping<00:02:50.540> if<00:02:50.720> you're<00:02:50.870> unsure

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
when we're doing piping if you're unsure

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.710 
when we're doing piping if you're unsure
where<00:02:51.620> Strait<00:02:52.010> is

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
where Strait is

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.840 
where Strait is
just<00:02:53.720> make<00:02:53.930> some<00:02:54.170> marks<00:02:54.410> in<00:02:55.070> different

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:55.850 
just make some marks in different

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:58.570 
just make some marks in different
sections<00:02:56.120> of<00:02:56.450> the<00:02:56.600> cake<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.250> that<00:02:58.250> will<00:02:58.400> help

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
sections of the cake and that will help

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:21.540 
sections of the cake and that will help
to<00:02:58.880> keep<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.210> steady

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.420 

and<00:03:22.120> as<00:03:22.240> you<00:03:22.360> get<00:03:22.510> closer<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:23.080> end<00:03:23.430> you

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
and as you get closer to the end you

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.610 
and as you get closer to the end you
just<00:03:24.670> start<00:03:24.880> by<00:03:25.000> making<00:03:25.210> your<00:03:25.660> little<00:03:26.140> swipes

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
just start by making your little swipes

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.970 
just start by making your little swipes
a<00:03:26.890> little<00:03:27.340> bit<00:03:27.430> smaller<00:03:28.680> just<00:03:29.680> so<00:03:29.800> that<00:03:29.920> you

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
a little bit smaller just so that you

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.730 
a little bit smaller just so that you
don't<00:03:30.160> bump<00:03:30.340> into<00:03:30.520> your<00:03:30.820> first<00:03:31.030> row

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.240 

now<00:03:35.220> it's<00:03:35.400> just<00:03:35.550> very<00:03:35.970> gentle<00:03:37.070> okay<00:03:38.070> you<00:03:38.130> can

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
now it's just very gentle okay you can

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.350 
now it's just very gentle okay you can
leave<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.520> excess<00:03:38.910> there

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.410 

I<00:03:42.390> just<00:03:42.780> want<00:03:42.990> to<00:03:43.050> keep<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.260> same<00:03:43.680> effect<00:03:44.550> and

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
I just want to keep that same effect and

00:03:45.420 --> 00:04:02.750 
I just want to keep that same effect and
then<00:03:45.540> your<00:03:45.720> last<00:03:45.930> row<00:03:46.200> is<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.500> a<00:03:46.890> dot<00:03:47.130> on<00:03:47.310> top

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.880 

and<00:04:02.910> now<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.480> do<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.900> top<00:04:04.140> I'm<00:04:04.349> just<00:04:04.410> going<00:04:04.800> to

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
and now to do the top I'm just going to

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.170 
and now to do the top I'm just going to
start<00:04:05.099> somewhere<00:04:05.459> where<00:04:05.610> there<00:04:05.730> isn't<00:04:05.910> any

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
start somewhere where there isn't any

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.150 
start somewhere where there isn't any
yellow<00:04:07.459> polka-dot<00:04:08.459> and<00:04:09.680> work<00:04:10.680> my<00:04:10.860> way<00:04:10.890> around

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
yellow polka-dot and work my way around

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:27.090 
yellow polka-dot and work my way around
and<00:04:11.580> do<00:04:11.730> one<00:04:11.970> full<00:04:12.300> row<00:04:12.569> and<00:04:13.190> your<00:04:14.190> next<00:04:14.489> color

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.110 

and<00:04:28.100> it's<00:04:28.730> just<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.030> same<00:04:29.270> technique<00:04:31.120> working

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
and it's just the same technique working

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:40.280 
and it's just the same technique working
in<00:04:32.240> towards<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.690> center

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.600 

and<00:04:41.290> then<00:04:41.470> again<00:04:41.740> I'm<00:04:42.010> just<00:04:42.070> going<00:04:42.250> to<00:04:42.340> start

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
and then again I'm just going to start

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.240 
and then again I'm just going to start
in<00:04:42.730> a<00:04:42.820> section<00:04:43.300> it<00:04:44.290> doesn't<00:04:44.590> have<00:04:44.740> that<00:04:44.950> color

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
in a section it doesn't have that color

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.480 
in a section it doesn't have that color
working<00:04:45.880> my<00:04:46.030> way<00:04:46.060> around<00:04:49.920> it's<00:04:50.920> not<00:04:51.130> like<00:04:51.310> the

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
working my way around it's not like the

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.040 
working my way around it's not like the
size<00:04:51.730> of<00:04:51.910> the<00:04:52.030> cake<00:04:52.240> so<00:04:52.270> they<00:04:52.570> won't<00:04:52.750> line<00:04:53.020> up

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
size of the cake so they won't line up

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.840 
size of the cake so they won't line up
perfectly<00:04:53.380> you'll<00:04:54.040> end<00:04:54.220> up<00:04:54.340> getting<00:04:54.580> less<00:04:54.820> and

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
perfectly you'll end up getting less and

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.880 
perfectly you'll end up getting less and
less<00:04:55.090> each<00:04:55.420> time<00:04:55.450> so<00:04:56.290> don't<00:04:56.500> worry<00:04:56.590> too<00:04:56.710> much

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890 
less each time so don't worry too much

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:29.070 
less each time so don't worry too much
about<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:58.060> colors<00:04:58.360> lining<00:04:58.690> up

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.029 

now<00:05:29.650> for<00:05:29.860> the<00:05:29.919> final<00:05:30.159> row<00:05:31.020> I'm<00:05:32.020> just<00:05:32.349> dragging

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
now for the final row I'm just dragging

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.180 
now for the final row I'm just dragging
very<00:05:33.639> very<00:05:33.940> gently<00:05:34.180> into<00:05:34.509> the<00:05:34.599> center<00:05:34.990> just<00:05:35.229> so

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
very very gently into the center just so

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.619 
very very gently into the center just so
that<00:05:36.340> all<00:05:36.639> of<00:05:36.669> them<00:05:37.030> look<00:05:37.240> like<00:05:37.270> they're

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:37.629 
that all of them look like they're

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.800 
that all of them look like they're
