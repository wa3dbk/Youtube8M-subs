I<00:03:35.780> do<00:03:35.840> 10<00:03:36.200> x<00:03:36.500> 15<00:03:36.680> k<00:03:37.010> pack<00:03:37.220> so<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.430> should

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
I do 10 x 15 k pack so you should

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.879 
I do 10 x 15 k pack so you should
discard<00:03:37.970> them<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.780> obviously<00:03:39.319> up<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.709> risk

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
discard them to obviously up the risk

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.800 
discard them to obviously up the risk
and<00:03:40.069> something<00:03:40.639> like<00:03:40.670> that<00:03:40.880> but<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.299> knew<00:03:41.630> if<00:03:41.750> I

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
and something like that but I knew if I

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.120 
and something like that but I knew if I
did<00:03:41.959> that<00:03:41.989> little<00:03:42.319> be<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.500> lot<00:03:42.680> of<00:03:42.739> complaints

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
did that little be a lot of complaints

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.470 
did that little be a lot of complaints
because<00:03:43.310> people<00:03:43.819> would<00:03:43.910> hate<00:03:44.060> to<00:03:44.209> see<00:03:44.359> me

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
because people would hate to see me

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.599 
because people would hate to see me
discard<00:03:44.840> Roberto<00:03:45.139> Carlos<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:45.799> obviously

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
discard Roberto Carlos so obviously

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:47.920 
discard Roberto Carlos so obviously
because<00:03:46.790> it's<00:03:46.910> just<00:03:46.940> comment<00:03:47.359> two<00:03:47.420> packs<00:03:47.630> so<00:03:47.870> I

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
because it's just comment two packs so I

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.090 
because it's just comment two packs so I
didn't<00:03:48.079> want<00:03:48.200> to<00:03:48.260> do<00:03:48.350> that<00:03:48.380> they<00:03:48.620> want<00:03:48.769> upset
