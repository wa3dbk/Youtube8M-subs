this<00:00:00.599> is<00:00:00.780> a<00:00:00.810> video<00:00:01.439> demonstration<00:00:01.650> of<00:00:02.399> a

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
this is a video demonstration of a

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.550 
this is a video demonstration of a
robotic<00:00:02.939> hip<00:00:03.300> replacement<00:00:03.899> performed<00:00:04.350> with

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
robotic hip replacement performed with

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.340 
robotic hip replacement performed with
the<00:00:04.710> Mako<00:00:04.950> technology<00:00:05.990> we<00:00:06.990> begin<00:00:07.259> the

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
the Mako technology we begin the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.700 
the Mako technology we begin the
procedure<00:00:07.710> by<00:00:07.980> registering<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.670> femur<00:00:09.300> and

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
procedure by registering the femur and

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.930 
procedure by registering the femur and
this<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.889> done<00:00:11.160> based<00:00:11.429> off<00:00:11.639> of<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
this is done based off of the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.200 
this is done based off of the
three-dimensional<00:00:12.469> CT<00:00:13.469> based<00:00:13.740> model<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:15.059> is

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
three-dimensional CT based model this is

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.010 
three-dimensional CT based model this is
a<00:00:15.240> virtual<00:00:15.719> model<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.730> allows<00:00:17.730> us<00:00:17.970> for

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
a virtual model and allows us for

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.760 
a virtual model and allows us for
understanding<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.320> three-dimensional

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770

placement of the components here we're

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.150 
placement of the components here we're
marking<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.990> cut<00:00:25.199> for<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.560> femoral<00:00:25.830> neck

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
marking the cut for the femoral neck

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.779 
marking the cut for the femoral neck
which<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.359> make<00:00:27.570> using<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.990> saw

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
which we then make using a saw

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.980 
which we then make using a saw
subsequently<00:00:29.789> we'll<00:00:30.060> register<00:00:30.269> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
subsequently we'll register the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.130 
subsequently we'll register the
acetabulum<00:00:31.980> or<00:00:32.189> socket<00:00:32.660> again<00:00:33.660> this<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.989> done

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140

desired location once the cup is placed

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.130 
desired location once the cup is placed
we<00:01:21.180> check<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.810> orientation<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.930> ensure<00:01:24.930> that

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
we check the orientation and ensure that

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.200 
we check the orientation and ensure that
the<00:01:25.259> cup<00:01:25.439> has<00:01:25.590> been<00:01:25.770> placed<00:01:25.979> accurately<00:01:26.610> will

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
the cup has been placed accurately will

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.240 
the cup has been placed accurately will
then<00:01:27.420> follow<00:01:27.780> our<00:01:28.020> plan<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.710> placing<00:01:29.130> the

version and finally we'll check the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.950 
version and finally we'll check the
relationship<00:01:34.920> between<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.549> femur<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.030> the
