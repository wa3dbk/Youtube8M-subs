stays on why not do a lash primer and so

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.830 
stays on why not do a lash primer and so
that's<00:00:38.050> what<00:00:38.230> lash<00:00:38.500> builder<00:00:39.160> is<00:00:39.880> for<00:00:40.660> your

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.370 
that's what lash builder is for your
lashes<00:00:41.080> so<00:00:42.010> to<00:00:42.070> me<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:42.910> makes<00:00:43.420> them<00:00:43.720> look

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
lashes so to me it makes them look

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.770 
lashes so to me it makes them look
fuller<00:00:44.650> and<00:00:45.070> longer<00:00:45.550> and<00:00:45.790> it<00:00:46.180> just<00:00:46.390> enhances

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
fuller and longer and it just enhances

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.310 
fuller and longer and it just enhances
what<00:00:47.380> the<00:00:47.830> volumizing<00:00:48.370> mascara<00:00:48.970> does

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
what the volumizing mascara does

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.890 
what the volumizing mascara does
basically<00:00:50.320> so<00:00:51.070> it's<00:00:51.430> white<00:00:51.790> so<00:00:52.300> much<00:00:52.480> when<00:00:52.780> you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
basically so it's white so much when you

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.050 
basically so it's white so much when you
put<00:00:53.110> it<00:00:53.200> on<00:00:53.290> your<00:00:53.470> lashes<00:00:53.710> it's<00:00:54.640> going<00:00:54.820> to<00:00:54.850> look

a<00:00:55.150> little<00:00:55.270> white<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.460> so<00:00:57.880> I<00:00:57.910> just<00:00:58.150> put<00:00:58.240> that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
a little white and so I just put that

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:10.820 
a little white and so I just put that
all<00:00:58.720> over
