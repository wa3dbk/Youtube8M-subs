00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.250
 i 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.760
 Hi, I'm a blog key , sometimes you're looking for 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.160
 punto blogspot.com and in our channel 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.750
 youtube birds educating today I'm 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.279
 preparing something especially for 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.680
 those who start the diet that 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.360
 they are in their attack phase and that 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.630
 course those first days are done 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.460
 hard and we need some good dessert 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.850
 this as you can see is an apple mousse 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.010
 and raspberry and is has no 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.290
 tolerated is perfect for these first 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.300
 days of the diet and very easy to do 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.890
 I will also tell you then what 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.540
 are the ingredients to see if you like it and 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.600
 you start doing the same 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.180
 we will need a 0% apple yogurt 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.250
 fat or sugar 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.620
 and raspberry I've got these 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.980
 that are with fruits you know we can 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.890
 drink 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.229
 from cruise phase 1 with fruits if 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.990
 what are you going to do for the attack phase? 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.930
 that does not have pieces of fruit if we go to 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.909
 use a teaspoon sweetener to 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.460
 each of the mousse of each 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.410
 of the flavors and I also have here three 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.610
 whites beaten to snow that I have 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.840
 added sweetener if you want not to 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.330
 add it if you put it later 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.170
 directly to the dessert then we go to 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.090
 prepare 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.090
 we will also use a little bit of 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.630
 a food coloring 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.630
 and that if you want if not of course 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.030
 do not do not put it on, then let's put 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.850
 the apple yogurt as you see as you 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.119
 I said this one has pieces of fruit I do not 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.780
 I got the one that just flavored but from 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.210
 many brands 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.010
 I'm going to put a little bit of 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.490
 sweet coloring 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.910
 I'm going to put some yellow coloring 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.910
 drops 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.670
 Y 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.670
 we will add it as I said 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.600
 a teaspoon or a little less than 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.250
 sweetener 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.120
 this is so that the mousse has a 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.120
 little bit more flavor 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.710
 we mix it and now we're going to 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:34.130
 adding the egg whites we will use half 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.550
 so that it has the consistency we see that 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.800
 We note that we are looking for is 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.420
 very easy to see how you know what 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.630
 we are doing with movements 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.630
 envelopes 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.720
 the good thing is that we have a taste 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.720
 very soft 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.270
 They have a very rich perfume 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.600
 good to apples 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:08.220
 very well then we are going to leave it 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.220
 and we are going to prepare our kitchen gardens 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.220
 in the same way let's put 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.220
 please 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.129
 it attracts a little bit of color if 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.790
 you prefer we add a little more 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.790
 Colorant 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.680
 this one is raspberry and pomegranate 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.230
 this yogurt 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.000
 I'm going to put two or three drops of 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 Colorant 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.990
 Being red is much more intense 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.750
 right away it shows 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.260
 and then we add the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.260
 clear 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:11.330
 we're going to put it like the other one 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.330
 little bit of sweetener 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.620
 and let's mix 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.550
 so now I had the idea of 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.190
 put them in these 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.540
 in these little boats where the 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.449
 envelopes or 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:46.360
 of news that are crystal 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.889
 so that we have the illusion that it is 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.990
 one of these delicious desserts 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:54.150
 bought but good you can put it 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:58.640
 in glasses where you like 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.640
 What we can do is put 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.640
 the two colors half and half I'll leave 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.640
 to show how I'm going to do it 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.460
 with the inclined bottle 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.889
 I will go filling 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:28.969
 so that when it comes to challenge it we 

00:05:25.619 --> 00:05:28.969
 half of each color is left 

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:48.129
 look now we are going to clean the 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:51.959
 little part above 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.959
 but the idea is that 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.980
 we have the dessert 

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.380
 of the two colors so we can go 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:03.130
 eating at the same time a little bit of each one 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.230
 See how easy good idea is now 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.270
 prepare we have at least for 

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:09.910
 prepare four of these these desserts 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.040
 Milestones and take them to the fridge and 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.750
 enjoy them as I told you if you use the 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.689
 yogurt that only flavored it 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.299
 You can use from passional 

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:19.799
 enter our blog on our channel and 

00:06:18.299 --> 00:06:23.539
 let us your comments know that you 

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:23.539
 it looked like this and see you in the next 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:27.069
 no no
