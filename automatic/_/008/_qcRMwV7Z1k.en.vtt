00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740
 but the impacts they have on the surface while maneuvering 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.740
 properly the accelerator 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.919
 jose a speeds up when he heads up 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.919
 and it stops accelerating when it was headed down 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.279
 the last of the techniques is the jump 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.249
 It is a very spectacular technique but it is necessary to completely master the 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:27.339
 Bases of the technique 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:31.099
 since by an equilibrium error you can fall with your head down or 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.099
 it can jump obliquely and fall down later 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.620
 to jump 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.250
 first you have to make a starter race directly to the point of 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.960
 jump 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.560
 already close to the point, take the half-inclined position, slightly return the 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.100
 accelerator before the point the spokes of the front wheel are compressed a little and 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.010
 the opportunity of the exit is measured 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.750
 when the front wheel reaches the mound that is the point of the jump it 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.700
 Abruptly opens the accelerator and pulls the handlebar slightly towards the body 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.370
 in the air the accelerator is closed and the machine is held by pressing the 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.370
 knees so that the balance of the body is maintained 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.870
 it lands with the rear wheel first pulling the handlebar towards the body 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.870
 The knees are flexed to cushion the impact 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.560
 this is the jump technique 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.350
 these techniques that we have learned are applicable in different places of the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.520
 motorcycling off the road 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.520
 let's see how it runs on stony ground 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.950
 marshy 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.229
 hoare the eyes in any case 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.640
 before entering the route, change the speed position to reduce it 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.780
 always maintaining the millo posture will tip that this base position in the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.479
 motorcycling off the road a good balance is achieved by squeezing the 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.860
 machine with the knees the brakes and the accelerator are maneuvered smoothly 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.680
 avoiding sudden movements 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.049
 when the champion technique is performed 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.709
 to run along a slope the machine remains vertical or 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:07.749
 slightly inclined towards the slope by the body slid to the side of 

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.519
 the glen placing the weight of the body on the stirrup of the machine 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.589
 you have to control the accelerator and dogs cautiously 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.739
 let's review again the body position exercises on the 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.099
 machine that is the basis of off road bayly motorcycling off the road 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:34.260
 to be able to run on surfaces of different conditions the opposition 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:36.699
 it has to be always a means tilt 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:41.349
 the knees squeezing the machine using the knees cobos and waist 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.349
 to cushion the impacts 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:48.080
 in motorcycling off the road 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.759
 different landscapes open in front of you 

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:55.499
 one after another presenting the charm of the wonderful world that exists outside the
