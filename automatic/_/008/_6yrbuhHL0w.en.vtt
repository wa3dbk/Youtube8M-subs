00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:09.190
 no not all road works are from 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.190
 well thought out in advance 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:20.340
 so many nice hands around my standing 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.340
 which also perform on each other 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.580
 hup and those types who drive just 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.580
 it about that I think so 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.330
 and look this is the trick new 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.289
 to press 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.740
 I watch look 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.740
 opel 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:56.620
 and there is an absolute is the car with 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:58.030
 imperial this is how we ensure mobile 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.980
 support look how far that 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.670
 negativity that work at peace to your 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.670
 first time dating 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.870
 did you see that 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.320
 come another day 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.210
 and then it turns out arranging it 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.070
 to be a profession in its own right 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.850
 that not just anyone without it 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.850
 can do training 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.960
 the road workers working here are late 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.410
 the two traffic flows interchangeably 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.990
 walk 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.020
 contrary to the question that is asking 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.130
 for problems with road users or such 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.130
 in this case even with the police 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.460
 scudder 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.960
 when who is you performing 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.170
 I can contact you but now 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.710
 here we have a left span over the 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.820
 away there bar none of it 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.440
 roadworks none of it 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.430
 activities and many of them 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.140
 regularly 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.270
 in other words i want us now 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.270
 disappears from the street road 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.760
 you must place bottom here 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.290
 regulate the traffic they entered 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.510
 Yes, but there is more people 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.500
 morilles not left past a sign 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.140
 states 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.930
 but otherwise also not so made way 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.340
 but empty if you want then you should 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.580
 say good to your tools 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.580
 each other 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.730
 the traffic runs and mars you so now 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.970
 not yet 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.950
 people stand opposite each other here like this 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.610
 if you want to work on the road 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.049
 courses for which have your advice 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.159
 to co to insert through the bottom in 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.159
 this is business must rain 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.720
 no but have to say it there 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.100
 thereby assisting traffic controllers and 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.880
 these two traffic controller you 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.880
 put down 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.010
 your picks up a can at a time can do it 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.540
 the traffic that wanted to get off the roundabout 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.370
 that was blocked 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.100
 one that programs will be completely dropped off 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.880
 yes then the physio will probably also run 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.040
 crossing 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.600
 you were part of that work, so that too 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.300
 cyclists who want a stab over and who 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.250
 therefore had to find their own way 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.230
 the was not specified and then the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.240
 the chance of an accident is quite high though 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.320
 there were those beautiful ribbons 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.030
 tense 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.950
 he ribbon has no value whatsoever 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.330
 for that matter 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.010
 and you can use it in order 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.300
 connecting things together 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.890
 but legally none 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.459
 status but this is certainly not the case 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.130
 serious 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.470
 although the consequences are mainly for the 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.120
 liability if someone is insufficient 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.310
 understands what the intention is and and and 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.230
 so in the way france and therefore 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.120
 road worker to drive then is basically 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.100
 that motorist has fun landing error 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.590
 he to me one but he can 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.420
 actually do well because of insufficient 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.940
 setting was not in accordance with the rules and 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.830
 if you like getting rid of it makes sure your work 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.900
 It just looks good on the plates 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.000
 placed and prescribed me wise and that 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.830
 you have made a good deposit 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.110
 if something goes wrong then is in 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.790
 always the motorist 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.350
 liable but how does it work 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.540
 deposition that should actually go out 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.489
 and are just fixed procedures 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.989
 for and everyone who works on the road 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.730
 which also know I have to put soil 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.140
 there for at least a 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.260
 must be a warning of 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.909
 road work 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.370
 and then there must be indicated 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.110
 where the problem lies in especially what's there 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.239
 is expected from the motorist 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:18.579
 in this case you have a piece of road where 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.410
 so one wooden can go over it simultaneously 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.850
 you have to make sure it's around 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.160
 is arranged and then you can with 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.160
 traffic lights or my traffic controller
