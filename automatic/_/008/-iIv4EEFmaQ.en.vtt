00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
wondering why it's the semtex and it's

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
wondering why it's the semtex and it's
not<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> grenade<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.900> semtex<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.710> to

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
not the grenade the semtex you have to

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.440 
not the grenade the semtex you have to
actually<00:01:02.010> buy<00:01:02.460> off<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:02.940> wall<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.329> the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
actually buy off the wall this is the

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.329 
actually buy off the wall this is the
funny<00:01:03.720> part<00:01:03.810> because<00:01:04.290> what<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> semtex<00:01:04.890> is

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
funny part because what the semtex is

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.580 
funny part because what the semtex is
actually<00:01:05.939> cheaper<00:01:06.600> it's<00:01:06.810> cheaper<00:01:07.319> than<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
actually cheaper it's cheaper than the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.469 
actually cheaper it's cheaper than the
regular<00:01:07.890> Danai<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.369> you<00:01:08.490> get<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.909> Islam<00:01:09.299> B's

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
regular Danai that you get on Islam B's

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.690 
regular Danai that you get on Islam B's
Maps<00:01:09.719> and<00:01:10.259> I<00:01:10.319> don't<00:01:10.530> know<00:01:10.679> why<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
Maps and I don't know why you have to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.899 
Maps and I don't know why you have to
buy<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.539> just<00:01:12.810> so<00:01:13.079> stupid<00:01:13.469> and<00:01:14.039> yeah

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
buy it it's just so stupid and yeah

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.399 
buy it it's just so stupid and yeah
that's<00:01:15.149> the<00:01:15.210> semtex<00:01:15.479> where<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.869> guys<00:01:16.020> it's

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
that's the semtex where you guys it's

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.830 
that's the semtex where you guys it's
weaker<00:01:17.039> it<00:01:17.249> doesn't<00:01:17.999> make<00:01:18.149> crawlers<00:01:18.659> as

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
weaker it doesn't make crawlers as

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.959 
weaker it doesn't make crawlers as
efficiently<00:01:19.409> as<00:01:19.679> the<00:01:19.859> regular<00:01:20.189> grenades<00:01:20.549> so

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
efficiently as the regular grenades so

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:22.819 
efficiently as the regular grenades so
that<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> why<00:01:21.389> I<00:01:21.450> believe<00:01:21.899> it<00:01:22.139> deserves<00:01:22.499> the

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
that is why I believe it deserves the

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.190 
that is why I believe it deserves the
number<00:01:23.159> 5<00:01:23.369> spot<00:01:23.399> so<00:01:23.999> now<00:01:24.179> guys<00:01:24.389> going<00:01:24.749> down<00:01:24.929> to

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200

called the dead as well but other than
that<00:02:53.900> I<00:02:54.290> guess<00:02:54.530> it's<00:02:54.920> okay<00:02:55.310> but<00:02:55.579> it's<00:02:55.760> not<00:02:56.510> that

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
that I guess it's okay but it's not that

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.870 
that I guess it's okay but it's not that
