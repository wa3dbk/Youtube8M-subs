00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.250
 10,000 psuv follows the 10,000 subsal 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.699
 I have to do a special as soon as possible 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.489

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.489

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:06.460

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.490

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.640

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.750

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.750

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:35.289
 place is perfect I do not feel that something 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.170
 bad is going to happen like something is going to happen 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:41.280
 here there are only stupid turtles and some 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.280
 brown mushrooms 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.380
 this is a room I wonder who 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.380
 will live here 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.870
 which is the boldest that's one level 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.300
 it can not be the level if I am free 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:05.180
 death to me they are bursting 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.180
 let's get out of here not 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.149
 i hate you 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.100
 this has to be a damn joke 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.090
 it can not be where the oxygen is 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.590
 and what happened to the earth 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.410
 is that many people were made 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:35.180
 youtubers and they marked them with copyright 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.400
 so to not have to be marking 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.349
 always with copyright they decided to put him 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.590
 copyright to the world and go live in 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.849
 another planet sounds good this takes away that 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.849
 ridiculous we're going 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.700

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.910
 you want to stay for a while 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.860
 I opened this channel on April 30, 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.420
 2014 with the video of curiosities of 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:22.000
 pokemon as my first video not 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.640
 introductory in those moments I only had 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.680
 a subscriber then I uploaded the video from 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.440
 curiosities of mario and still had 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.630
 a subscriber but still I did not give up 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.610
 when I uploaded the video of the girl 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.250
 ghost is when I started to grow 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.110
 keep uploading enough videos after 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.540
 until you reach the 1000 special 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.670
 subs where he celebrated that a thousand people 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.070
 they admired my work and look at me now 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.990
 now I have 10,000 subscribers a 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.450
 number that many may not believe that 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.310
 be a lot but for me it does represent 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.620
 that my work here on youtube is not in 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.900
 vain really represents that open my 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.660
 channel on April 30 has been the best 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.700
 decision of my life well let's leave those 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.400
 sentimental things to say the future 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.410
 of the channel to start tell if you have 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.050
 decided to stay in the channel so 

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:09.690
 things may be different the 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.270
 part 2 of the questions and answers 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.090
 it's 40% done so they only have 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.680
 to wait a little longer I also decided 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.620
 make a new section in the channel 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.169
 theory 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.419
 in this section I will put complete theories 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:25.520
 made by my imagination as the girl 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.620
 ghost opening with a new theory 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.990
 of Fatima that would explain all the 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.240
 ghosts of the pokemon hours also 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.250
 I'm thinking about doing part 2 of 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.840
 curiosities of 'spongebob' though 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.690
 first I want to see the movie for 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.430
 have more material and also 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:43.130
 curiosities of pokemon part 7 fight 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.220
 night sad fredys part 2 if possible 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.139
 a part 3 of mario and so on the tops 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.060
 of the songs of the videogames I think 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:52.039
 that I will no longer do because of the 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.740
 damn copyright although maybe I 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.870
 anime in the normal tops because I do not know 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.600
 nothing happens but the 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.449
 topics in the future and then analyze in the 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.570
 future the dlc of mario kart eight and a half 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:07.610
 in the smash and then just say hello to 

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:09.770
