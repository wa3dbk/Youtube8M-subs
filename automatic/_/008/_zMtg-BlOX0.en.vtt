snow pro 440 and it's trail converted um
I<00:00:11.400> just<00:00:12.240> have<00:00:12.540> some<00:00:12.690> questions<00:00:12.840> about<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:13.530> not

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
I just have some questions about it not

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.580 
I just have some questions about it not
too<00:00:14.130> familiar<00:00:14.280> with<00:00:14.549> these<00:00:15.109> so<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.320> seems<00:00:16.500> to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
too familiar with these so it seems to

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.269 
too familiar with these so it seems to
be<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.770> pretty<00:00:16.890> good<00:00:16.980> shape

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
be in pretty good shape

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.250 
be in pretty good shape
I<00:00:17.430> paid<00:00:17.699> twelve<00:00:18.090> hundred<00:00:18.240> bucks<00:00:18.510> for<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:18.990> I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
I paid twelve hundred bucks for it so I

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.929 
I paid twelve hundred bucks for it so I
thought<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.680> was<00:00:19.770> pretty<00:00:19.890> good<00:00:20.010> deal<00:00:20.220> um

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
thought that was pretty good deal um

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.160 
thought that was pretty good deal um
it's<00:00:23.939> got<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.240> ten<00:00:24.480> gallon<00:00:24.840> tank

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
it's got the ten gallon tank

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.439 
it's got the ten gallon tank
I<00:00:25.260> believe<00:00:25.619> that's<00:00:25.980> what<00:00:26.250> size<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.640> is<00:00:26.789> it's

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
I believe that's what size it is it's

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.370 
I believe that's what size it is it's
got<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.660> fire<00:00:27.869> cat<00:00:28.140> seat<00:00:28.789> and<00:00:29.789> then<00:00:30.109> just<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> fit

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
got a fire cat seat and then just to fit

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.380 
got a fire cat seat and then just to fit
over<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.650> tape<00:00:31.920> better<00:00:33.140> so<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.469> then<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:36.210> has

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
over the tape better so and then it has

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.340 
over the tape better so and then it has
these<00:00:36.570> two<00:00:36.950> coolers<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.100> either<00:00:38.250> side<00:00:38.930> on<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
these two coolers on either side on the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.750 
these two coolers on either side on the
running<00:00:40.620> boards<00:00:40.890> those<00:00:41.129> are<00:00:41.250> normally<00:00:41.579> there

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
running boards those are normally there

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.639 
running boards those are normally there
I'm<00:00:41.850> pretty<00:00:42.030> sure<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.540> guess<00:00:42.930> I'm<00:00:43.050> not<00:00:43.200> exactly

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
I'm pretty sure I guess I'm not exactly

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.240 
I'm pretty sure I guess I'm not exactly
sure<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.160> then<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:44.969> got<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.329> one<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:46.250> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
sure but then it's got this one on the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.940 
sure but then it's got this one on the
back<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> bumper<00:00:48.410> mounted<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> bumper

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
back on the bumper mounted on the bumper

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.549 
back on the bumper mounted on the bumper
um<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.550> don't<00:00:51.120> know<00:00:51.239> if<00:00:51.600> that's<00:00:51.899> stock<00:00:52.199> or<00:00:52.410> not

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
um I don't know if that's stock or not

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.959 
um I don't know if that's stock or not
but<00:00:53.840> um<00:00:54.840> those<00:00:55.770> are<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.100> only<00:00:56.219> coolers<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.820> can

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
but um those are the only coolers I can

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.910 
but um those are the only coolers I can
find<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.140> should<00:00:58.320> be<00:00:58.440> running<00:00:58.620> more

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
find know if I should be running more

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.560 
find know if I should be running more
coolers<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.489> put<00:00:59.850> some<00:01:00.000> more<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.180> or<00:01:00.449> whatever

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
coolers and put some more on or whatever

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.070 
coolers and put some more on or whatever
but<00:01:03.589> and<00:01:04.589> then<00:01:04.970> he<00:01:05.970> said<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.630> guy<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.810> bought<00:01:07.020> it

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
but and then he said the guy I bought it

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.350 
but and then he said the guy I bought it
from<00:01:07.170> said<00:01:07.409> he's<00:01:07.530> running<00:01:07.760> 170<00:01:08.760> I<00:01:08.790> think<00:01:09.210> was

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
from said he's running 170 I think was

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.530 
from said he's running 170 I think was
main<00:01:09.659> Jets<00:01:09.960> um<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.710> wasn't<00:01:11.520> sure<00:01:11.700> about<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.479> uh

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
main Jets um I wasn't sure about that uh

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.780 
main Jets um I wasn't sure about that uh
I<00:01:13.049> know<00:01:13.470> I'm<00:01:13.830> not<00:01:14.010> sure<00:01:14.189> what<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> should<00:01:14.700> be

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
I know I'm not sure what I should be

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.120 
I know I'm not sure what I should be
running<00:01:15.000> right<00:01:15.119> now<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.630> live<00:01:16.439> up<00:01:16.799> in

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
running right now I live up in

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.300 
running right now I live up in
northwestern<00:01:17.759> Wisconsin<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.890> winter<00:01:20.250> is

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
northwestern Wisconsin so the winter is

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.170 
northwestern Wisconsin so the winter is
around<00:01:20.430> here<00:01:20.729> probably

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
around here probably

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.080 
around here probably
I<00:01:21.450> mean<00:01:21.960> average<00:01:22.140> about<00:01:22.590> 0<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.310> 20<00:01:23.790> degrees

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
I mean average about 0 to 20 degrees

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.280 
I mean average about 0 to 20 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:26.509> he<00:01:27.509> said<00:01:27.689> he<00:01:27.750> had<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:27.990> CDI

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
Fahrenheit he said he had the CDI

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.960 
Fahrenheit he said he had the CDI
remapped<00:01:28.799> I'm<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.130> sure<00:01:29.280> what<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.520> look<00:01:29.729> for

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
remapped I'm not sure what you look for

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.679 
remapped I'm not sure what you look for
to<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:31.079> sure<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.500> was<00:01:31.590> remapped<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.310> I

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
to make sure that it was remapped so I

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.510 
to make sure that it was remapped so I
mean<00:01:33.689> I'm<00:01:33.960> not<00:01:34.110> sure<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.829> like<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.280> said<00:01:35.430> I'm

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
mean I'm not sure not like I said I'm

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.700 
mean I'm not sure not like I said I'm
not<00:01:35.640> very<00:01:35.790> familiar<00:01:35.939> with<00:01:36.180> these<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:37.560> then

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
not very familiar with these and then

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.950 
not very familiar with these and then
the<00:01:37.829> timing<00:01:38.189> set<00:01:38.400> at<00:01:39.380> negative<00:01:40.380> 2<00:01:41.899> I'm<00:01:42.899> not

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
the timing set at negative 2 I'm not

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.760 
the timing set at negative 2 I'm not
sure<00:01:43.170> about<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.439> either

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
sure about that either

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.240 
sure about that either
um<00:01:45.860> I<00:01:46.860> think<00:01:47.579> here

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:58.539 

so<00:01:53.770> then<00:01:54.770> I<00:01:55.100> mean<00:01:56.110> basically<00:01:57.110> I<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:57.979> kind<00:01:58.520> of

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
so then I mean basically I I kind of

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.460 
so then I mean basically I I kind of
want<00:01:58.790> to<00:01:58.850> know<00:01:58.909> what<00:01:59.000> what<00:01:59.810> jets<00:02:00.080> I<00:02:00.200> should<00:02:00.380> be

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
want to know what what jets I should be

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.710 
want to know what what jets I should be
running<00:02:00.909> for<00:02:01.909> where<00:02:02.060> I<00:02:02.090> am<00:02:02.390> for<00:02:02.630> my

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
running for where I am for my

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.760 
running for where I am for my
temperature<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:04.990> if<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.140> should<00:02:06.290> put<00:02:06.409> on<00:02:06.470> extra

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
temperature and if I should put on extra

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.609 
temperature and if I should put on extra
coolers<00:02:07.250> or<00:02:07.790> anything<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.989> can<00:02:09.229> tell<00:02:09.410> me

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
coolers or anything you can tell me

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.620 
coolers or anything you can tell me
about<00:02:09.830> what<00:02:10.520> I<00:02:10.550> should<00:02:10.670> do<00:02:10.970> before<00:02:11.120> I<00:02:11.360> try<00:02:11.569> to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
about what I should do before I try to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.890 
about what I should do before I try to

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
run it so I don't blow it up because I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.030 
run it so I don't blow it up because I
know<00:02:15.140> these<00:02:15.380> are<00:02:15.560> kind<00:02:15.800> of<00:02:15.860> high<00:02:16.010> maintenance

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
have this this oil looks like it's

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.880 
have this this oil looks like it's
leaking<00:02:49.430> from<00:02:49.459> there<00:02:49.880> and<00:02:50.350> then<00:02:51.350> between<00:02:51.560> the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
leaking from there and then between the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.819 
leaking from there and then between the
can<00:02:52.100> and<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.370> pipe<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:54.230> looks<00:02:54.410> like<00:02:54.530> this<00:02:54.650> is

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
can and the pipe it looks like this is

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.819 
can and the pipe it looks like this is
pretty<00:02:55.220> loose<00:02:56.260> yeah<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.410> looks<00:02:57.590> like<00:02:57.650> it's

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
pretty loose yeah it looks like it's

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.250 
pretty loose yeah it looks like it's
pretty<00:02:57.950> loose<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:59.019> don't<00:03:00.019> know<00:03:00.079> what<00:03:00.230> I

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
pretty loose so I don't know what I

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.810 
pretty loose so I don't know what I
should<00:03:00.470> do<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.739> prevent<00:03:01.160> that<00:03:01.310> or<00:03:01.730> stop<00:03:02.510> it<00:03:02.720> um

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
should do to prevent that or stop it um

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:09.460 
should do to prevent that or stop it um
and<00:03:04.820> then<00:03:05.950> it<00:03:06.950> and<00:03:07.750> I'm<00:03:08.750> pretty<00:03:08.930> sure<00:03:09.079> that<00:03:09.350> it

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
and then it and I'm pretty sure that it

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.810 
and then it and I'm pretty sure that it
should<00:03:09.680> be<00:03:09.890> doing<00:03:10.459> this<00:03:10.579> but<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:13.160> I<00:03:13.370> don't<00:03:13.579> mean

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
should be doing this but it I don't mean

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.759 
should be doing this but it I don't mean
it<00:03:14.090> won't<00:03:14.480> engage<00:03:14.690> she'll<00:03:15.230> probably<00:03:15.380> forty

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
it won't engage she'll probably forty

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.910 
it won't engage she'll probably forty
eight<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:15.980> 5,000<00:03:16.700> rpms<00:03:17.060> and<00:03:17.470> I'm<00:03:18.470> pretty<00:03:18.739> sure

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
eight to 5,000 rpms and I'm pretty sure

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.250 
eight to 5,000 rpms and I'm pretty sure
that's<00:03:19.040> normal<00:03:19.459> but<00:03:19.910> I'm<00:03:20.660> pretty<00:03:20.989> sure<00:03:21.140> that

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
that's normal but I'm pretty sure that

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.130 
that's normal but I'm pretty sure that
must<00:03:21.440> be<00:03:21.500> stopped<00:03:21.920> gearing<00:03:22.570> and<00:03:23.570> I'd<00:03:23.720> like<00:03:23.900> to

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
must be stopped gearing and I'd like to

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.979 
must be stopped gearing and I'd like to
get<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.530> to<00:03:25.519> make<00:03:25.910> it<00:03:26.030> so<00:03:26.180> it<00:03:26.299> will<00:03:26.450> engage<00:03:26.600> at

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
get a to make it so it will engage at

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.430 
get a to make it so it will engage at
lower<00:03:27.200> rpms<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:28.269> I'm<00:03:29.269> thinking<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.320> all

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
lower rpms and I'm thinking that all

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.110 
lower rpms and I'm thinking that all
you'd<00:03:30.620> have<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.769> do<00:03:30.950> is<00:03:31.070> get<00:03:31.220> a<00:03:31.250> weaker<00:03:31.579> spring

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120
