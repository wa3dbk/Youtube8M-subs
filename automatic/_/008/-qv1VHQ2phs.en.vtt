00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.360
 this is it girl it's true then 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:18.560
 today I am doing a review 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.900
 special so on the mark that co but 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.570
 especially on the adar collection 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.860
 in game which is a collection that is 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.869
 released a week ago that is 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.630
 simply beautiful 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.570
 I love it so I started 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:37.190
 in the products that I bought so 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.570
 for the complexion I already took a blush 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.150
 so here is the packaging 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.160
 it looks like a pack of cards so here 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.559
 it's really a collection that is 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.700
 based on the casino games so game of 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.320
 just beautiful cards 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.540
 so that's packaged a cardboard so 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:58.340
 I took the shade of 0.02 the race 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.840
 pink berets and beach so that's the 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:07.220
 just gorgeous bluff packaging 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:08.330
 and then so here's the inside with 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.770
 a large mirror 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:14.799
 this is really too good so 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.150
 there are two colors ya pink and peach 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.860
 I love these two colors that's why 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.320
 I really really flashed on 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.869
 this duo of blush so I will make you 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.970
 the swatch right away we start 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:32.930
 i do not have swatch yet and at home 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:38.270
 so pink and pech here and so 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:40.640
 on the hand it gives that it's really 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.250
 Too beautiful I 'll make you a 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.750
 zoom on the packaging and after that the 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.090
 design inside it's just too much 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.740
 beautiful and here are the two colors of 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.770
 then I flashed on pencils 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.590
 jumbo so that the pencils that we put on 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.500
 the eyelids and frankly at the beginning I 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.899
 had not taken 2 and if I'm going to test a 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.100
 little to see what it gives 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.079
 and then I knew how to return to prices 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.759
 third because he's just too much 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.209
 beautiful the third one I wear on the 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.079
 eyelids 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.750
 so here is a dark green to help 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:16.910
 reflections a little golden too 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.160
 gorgeous i will make you and swatch 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:23.060
 of all that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:27.050
 already at first already I have 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:32.060
 so the jumbo packaging it is 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:35.090
 present like this here is just beautiful 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.430
 there is nothing to say so shadows to 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.760
 eyelids color up long lasting eye 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.830
 shadow so it looks like that it's 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.340
 big fat pencil django so that I 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:50.060
 took the hue number 28 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.490
 so here's the 28th it's a kind of gray 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.440
 dark with slight reflections 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:55.520
 bluish he looks a lot like 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.340
 creating that I usually put 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:04.070
 that's why I pray to them and he 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.080
 is just too good now here I am at 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:10.640
 where it is really too beautiful 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:14.060
 this pencil and at the same time I took 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:18.710
 with the number 20 which is a purple 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:25.459
 dark of just like robots so the 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:28.040
 number 20 they are mega creamy brake 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.650
 there is nothing to say what it is 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.870
 just that happiness applied to 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.640
 eyelids 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.709
 so here's the purple is just in 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.470
 below I'm going to zoom you 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.209
 too much moss and the last and not the 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.490
 least is green so I wear 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.790
 on the eyelids 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:48.400
 so that's number 22 and yes it's 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.780
 the same 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:55.000
 Here I knew back is good for 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:04:01.120
 something must map number 22 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:05.709
 and so the green there are reflections of phew 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.110
 I love it too too too good 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:13.220
 fish everything is always too good 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:17.570
 so whoever is right here the same I 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:20.209
 you zoom in also so against I 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:25.640
 did not tell you the prices will I forget 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:28.080
 so the bluff bluff the double blush 14 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:33.050
 90 and the pencils this euro 4 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:36.210
 10 I also took a nail winner 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:39.139
 So that's poker is not the 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:42.419
 hearts so it's the hue 0 1 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:47.659
 there are six shades that's it 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:51.900
 the dice the face we remove the cap is 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:54.030
 in fact they have an effect he's just 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:59.900
 too beautiful too they apparently have a 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:05:04.409
 effect a little a bit how to say 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:09.330
 gel so here is the varnish it was at 6 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:10.830
 euros 90 is the last product that I 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.870
 bought me which I bought a time 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.530
 that the green pencil 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.849
 so I took it so it's 5 euros 90 and 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:23.129
 a pencil contour of the lips 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:27.270
 this is the ace of diamonds here we are of 

00:05:23.129 --> 00:05:31.650
 diamonds the penalties it is therefore created in 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:34.169
 lifts tells a number 34 and so like 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.199
 I often put in red rose 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:43.129
 lips just why I like it here 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:43.129
 too pretty too and so 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:54.210
 so here it is a fuchsia pink I 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:58.319
 a lot of rejection of this color so 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:01.770
 here for my purchases from the collection 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:03.029
 ring game of checchi co which is 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.659
 simply magnificent 

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:08.629
 frankly fond it's because this 

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:11.729
 collection is simply 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:14.610
 impressive packaging every 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.830
 colors that's all is really very 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.259
 very beautiful even if some products are 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.669
 already in the permanent range but then 

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:23.909

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:26.069
