00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:39.159 
like it's probably gonna be a 60 if I

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:42.210 
like it's probably gonna be a 60 if I
play<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.400> right<00:03:39.670> hopefully<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.150> will<00:03:41.220> that's

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.979 
play this right hopefully I will that's
definitely<00:03:42.579> what<00:03:42.730> it's<00:03:42.849> looking<00:03:43.090> like<00:03:43.120> Miguel

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
definitely what it's looking like Miguel

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.240 

let's<00:04:04.989> go<00:04:05.079> let's<00:04:05.260> go<00:04:05.349> come<00:04:05.530> on<00:04:05.650> I<00:04:05.829> feel<00:04:06.069> like<00:04:06.129> it

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
let's go let's go come on I feel like it

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.920 
let's go let's go come on I feel like it
takes<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:06.489> lot<00:04:06.700> longer<00:04:06.819> to<00:04:06.970> plant<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.329> bomb<00:04:07.450> to

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
takes a lot longer to plant the bomb to

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.629 
takes a lot longer to plant the bomb to
defuse<00:04:08.049> the<00:04:08.470> bomb<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.859> think<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.250> actually<00:04:09.340> does

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:12.000 
defuse the bomb I think it actually does
I<00:04:09.879> think<00:04:10.090> does<00:04:10.269> competitive<00:04:10.540> rules<00:04:11.010> okay

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010
