00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.170
 good but in friends here in this 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.679
 recording should be like planting the 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.410
 Chia is a plant with many 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.330
 virtues that is currently used 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.670
 a lot to give 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.670
 for those who suffer from cholesterol and 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.200
 good many other things more than you 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.779
 can investigate but here I the 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.270
 I want to show how you can plant it in 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.610
 their houses in some way to have the 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.760
 I grow a home grown crop more than 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.529
 commercial is a home grown what 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.540
 let's do good we have this that is 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.940
 a milk seedbed then for 200 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.540
 plants this here you can see it by 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.870
 down 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.090
 what we need is a seedbed can 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.640
 be this one can be a smaller one like 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.530
 these we are seeing this is the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.520
 Chia Plant Look 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.830
 10 days old 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.230
 what we are going to do next is to use 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:01:01.120
 me in this is the most pit we have 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.400
 here this is a very light material that 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.940
 they are practically like ground roots 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.940
 make an account 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.920
 this is rather an American material 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.560
 here in mexico although if they sell it but 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.240
 rather I think it's American what 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.840
 we do with the pine come here is 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.180
 this tray already filled 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.590
 let's repeat it soak and we put it here in 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.259
 this part 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.590
 and then what we do is make a 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.979
 small with your finger we gave you a little 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.040
 to place our seed a little bit 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.170
 A) Yes 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.850
 and once we've done that with 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.650
 all the holes that we are going to 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.950
 plant it 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.870
 What we do is start to accommodate 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.760
 seeds 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.610
 these are the little seeds of the earth 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.460
 how can you see it 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.490
 I do not know if you can appreciate it well 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.530
 requirement 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.930
 but that's the little seed of chia 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.930
 then what we are going to do we grab 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.290
 of 2 or 3 seeds and we are going 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.290
 placing 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.810
 here he attends in the hole 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.700
 we go calmly 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.700
 we go slowly 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.640
 here you can see how we leave them 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:34.010
 of 2 or 3 seeds per each 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.790
 later 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.060
 and what we do is cover the hold 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.770
 again rhythms of this that I tell you and 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.550
 let's cover the little seed 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.550
 we cover it 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:55.650
 and our was ready and nothing else to water 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.990
 and after 45 days with warmth we are going to 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.500
 to plant the already we are going to have the 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:05.350
 little plant here we will see already once 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.030
 they were born how is it look this is from here 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.930
 it is already a day was born here we can see it 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.109
 I hope you have served them 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.569
 and then later I will put other 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.409
 videos of how he has gone already when he is more 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.409
