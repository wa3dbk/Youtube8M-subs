00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.520
 very good friend we are back here 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.400
 in the garage we are going to talk now about 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.369
 the new dodge lasted that 2014 version 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.700
 at 2015 it is exactly the same and that is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.570
 the most equipped and powerful of the 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.220
 durango the rt 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.380
 is a comedian of three rows of 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.630
 seats with its direct competitors 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.239
 they are very tough rivals like the toyota 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.070
 highlander in my opinion always the most 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.520
 recommended segment then the sling 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.949
 pilot the second highly recommended then 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.579
 we have others like the travers the car and 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:47.640
 the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.280
 explorer de ford we have other 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.559
 several vehicles that compete against the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.829
 lasting however this seems to me the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.769
 let's say more masculine of all and 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.799
 I do not mean just aesthetics 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:05.369
 I really like 28 to return to Durango 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.799
 this cross grill that is so strong 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.189
 see and that in the past it was a brand 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.990
 registered finger somehow 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.880
 it was lost in some models we see 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.979
 also here the wheels in graphite color 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.729
 with some glitter wheels of 20 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:24.630
 inches very wide very solid wheels 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.630
 and in the back we also have 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.959
 new skulls although they are complete 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.539
 the style of the challenger and when 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:35.569
 we learn to light the little light here in 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.180
 the little shore we are going to show you 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.130
 here s 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.180
 that game of leds in the skull 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.460
 later falls very well seems very 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.650
 interesting is like every vehicle of 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.870
 three rows of seats the space 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.380
 rear behind the third row of 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:57.170
 seats is relatively small not in the 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.520
 case of durango is not smaller than 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.140
 we have and even a 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.820
 compartment that you can store 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.030
 Wet objects can be served as 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.640
 gilera for example and it works very well 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.289
 here this is going to cover a little bit is in 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.540
 that position or you can put it towards 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.300
 there the seats are dropped and you have there 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.209
 a good space the trunk by 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.959
 course is electrical and all the equipment 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:24.200
 of the world we have in in this truck 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:28.640
 inside of it we are not going to go up and let's go 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.320
 from the start we realize that it is 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.650
 a little sporty version no and 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.540
 we see that through the red background of the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.380
 dashboard we turn on the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:44.440
 truck and we also see that everything 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.780
 the board lights red 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.850
 and that feeling or the acronym of 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.790
 are embroidered on the seats that 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.700
 have good sunroof side support 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.280
 here is we have controls for the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.350
 opening of the door of our houses 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.820
 in short but one of the first things 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.280
 that we realize is that there is no 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.920
 shifter what we have since 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.870
 that knob 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.340
 rotatory that like the ram we 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.960
 we move through it so that the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.090
 Car reach its different speeds 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.480
 and along with that knob comes a box 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.360
 8 changes automatic that box me 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:27.310
 improves both acceleration and 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.280
 Hemi v8 5.7 liter engine consumption 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.770
 this truck and that's performance the 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.460
 fact that you have a g8 and that you 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.160
 behaves that way makes it in my very 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:43.030
 particular opinion the only version 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.000
 of the sound of 8 and feel but not 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:48.190
 is let's say done 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.400
 in the style of a challenger so that what 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.880
 listen to everyone in a van much more 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.460
 familiar but I repeat it is not the version 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.720
 more masculine among these vans that 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.850
 yes it is a name that will handle 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.430
 any of those trucks I think 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:06.120
 who will feel more comfortable being in 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.560
 a durango that being in a 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.050
 highlanders even in a ball that 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.350
 he also seems relatively masculine 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:17.500
 the rear space is good and you have to 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.720
 take into account that here this seat 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.419
 goes back when I move 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.950
 here we have screens and in the 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.870
 headers and it's not so good no 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.150
 precisely in the headers what is 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.990
 even better because from the outside it 's 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.940
 necessary for people to see it forgive the 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.280
 people are not going to see the lovers of what 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.830
 others will not see here and they will not have 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.710
 both the science the temptation of 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.410
 steal them in the third row of 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.930
 seats to go back for I get up here 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.350
 and it is heavy, not everyone can do it 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.350
 and let's go 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.220
 here is the space of the third row 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.560
 It is not a very abundant space but 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.780
 within its segment rivals is very 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.180
 good space very similar to the one 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.440
 we find for example in the highlander 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.930
 much better than the space of a 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.030
 chevrolet tahoe and very similar even 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.770
 to the space of the suburban that what 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.540
 has more than that is space for 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.220
 suitcases 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.680
 now most cases the 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.650
 people are going to use this truck as 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.680
 for four for five passengers and have 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:25.810
 a lot of luggage and that's great 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.160
 Summing up I really like la durán 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.530
 has good handling good acceleration 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.870
 good space capacity finished 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.160
 etcetera is not the perfect truck no 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.229
 but its cost 684 thousand pesos can 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.700
 seem very high but it is not much more 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.979
 expensive than his rival the follow up and 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.039
 offers things that others do not offer 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.410
 besides me in particular I love 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:50.500
 have a face and sit a truck 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:52.150
 more masculine we go to a cut and right now 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.840
 we come back with the bm 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.840
 18 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.570
 in safe we ​​have the spare parts 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.910
 Original Mercedes Benz Audi and BMW 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.450
 porsche volvo jaguar mini cooper and land 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.750
 rovers for cooling system 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:21.600
 suspension engine and many more now 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.160
 also with giving more of the toyota in six 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.760
 of the spare parts are so original 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.760
 with lacquer
