00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 hi today we have the pleasure of 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.090
 present this special support 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:12.860
 professional grip for 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.529
 camera camcorders or concorde also 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:19.770
 cameras as we can see has 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.840
 a classic thread fourth 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.500
 it can slide forward backwards 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.050
 right or left so as to find the 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.029
 better system balance than there 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.009
 will allow during filming of 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.030
 maintain the best balance 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.300
 possible 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.149
 at the base there is the classic fillet from a 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.309
 quarter of an inch to use it 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.840
 on a tripod in the upper part 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.559
 of the handle we find a contact 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.739
 hot 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.940
 this allows us to mount accessories 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.940
 like a microphone 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.660
 in this way we have assembled a 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.660
 microphone 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:14.230
 a practical illuminator we will now assemble 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.230
 a video camera 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.890
 we can shoot with the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:40.210
 video camera resting on the floor or 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:44.049
 in the traditional way preserving one 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.070
 good grip and excellent stability 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.380
 however its characteristic 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.250
 main is to carry out 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.179
 shooting from below with a perspective 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:59.759
 different than the typical traditional way 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.759
 than that of a child or an animal 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.120
 in this regard invites you to follow i 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.620
 next few minutes in which a brief will follow 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:15.580
 fragment of the film the heart of a dog in 1988 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.320
 where it is highlighted as they are 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.610
 some beautiful ones have been made 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.860
 shooting 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.860
 using this type of handle 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.640
 now we will analyze some together 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.210
 fragments of the Russian drama 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:39.450
 dog heart these signatures was 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.450
 taken from a famous Bulgarian novel 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:03:00.280
 here the main character is a dog 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:03:04.390
 the dog's name and charm rightly 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.560
 datura language are all the prospect 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.560
 made from below 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.830
 in this sequence it is clear that 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.280
 the operator is using the room a 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.280
 free hand 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.390
 looking at this picture we have to say 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.540
 that was really good 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.620
 the bloody mary borough director assure 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.620
 the mission to the animal 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:01.180
 here the typical view from below that 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.180
 which is known about 50 centimeters above the ground 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.680
