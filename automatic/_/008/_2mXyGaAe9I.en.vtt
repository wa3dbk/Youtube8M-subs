00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.050 
want this to be mixed up again but at
least<00:04:04.800> you'll<00:04:05.010> know<00:04:05.070> what<00:04:05.430> you're<00:04:05.850> going<00:04:05.970> to

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
least you'll know what you're going to

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.479 
least you'll know what you're going to
get<00:04:06.209> so<00:04:07.080> for<00:04:07.380> instance<00:04:07.410> if<00:04:07.920> i<00:04:08.070> enchant<00:04:08.370> right

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
get so for instance if i enchant right

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.780 
get so for instance if i enchant right
now<00:04:08.640> i'll<00:04:08.850> get<00:04:09.150> on<00:04:09.360> breaking<00:04:10.049> three

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
now i'll get on breaking three

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.679 
now i'll get on breaking three
and<00:04:12.090> then<00:04:13.079> if<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.730> try<00:04:14.730> again<00:04:14.760> okay<00:04:15.360> now<00:04:15.540> its

00:04:15.679 --> 00:04:15.689 
and then if I try again okay now its

00:04:15.689 --> 00:04:17.420 
and then if I try again okay now its
efficiency<00:04:16.079> for<00:04:16.410> so<00:04:16.709> it's<00:04:16.829> telling<00:04:17.009> you<00:04:17.220> but

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
efficiency for so it's telling you but

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.699 
efficiency for so it's telling you but
at<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.639> same<00:04:17.820> time<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.870> can't<00:04:19.109> really<00:04:19.289> mix<00:04:19.560> it

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
at the same time you can't really mix it

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.330 
at the same time you can't really mix it
up<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:19.949> have<00:04:20.100> to<00:04:20.130> enchant<00:04:21.030> before<00:04:21.389> you<00:04:21.479> can

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
up you have to enchant before you can

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.390 
up you have to enchant before you can
switch<00:04:23.340> and<00:04:24.270> also<00:04:24.660> on<00:04:24.780> top<00:04:24.960> of<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.280> it'll<00:04:26.280> be

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
switch and also on top of that it'll be

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.620 
switch and also on top of that it'll be
harder<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:26.759> get<00:04:27.080> levels<00:04:28.080> for<00:04:29.039> enchanting<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:30.600> I

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
harder to get levels for enchanting so I

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.810 
harder to get levels for enchanting so I
would<00:04:30.870> imagine<00:04:30.960> going<00:04:31.590> from<00:04:31.620> level<00:04:32.130> 27<00:04:32.610> to

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
would imagine going from level 27 to

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.600 
would imagine going from level 27 to
level<00:04:33.060> 30<00:04:33.330> would<00:04:33.660> be<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:34.259> lot<00:04:35.039> more<00:04:35.070> difficult

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
level 30 would be a lot more difficult

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.430 
level 30 would be a lot more difficult
than<00:04:35.669> it<00:04:35.759> is<00:04:35.910> now<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.900> guess<00:04:37.110> it<00:04:37.259> would<00:04:37.350> be

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
than it is now and I guess it would be

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.810 
than it is now and I guess it would be
sort<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.800> greater<00:04:38.009> penalty<00:04:38.430> for<00:04:38.610> death

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
sort of a greater penalty for death

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.230 
sort of a greater penalty for death
because<00:04:40.190> it<00:04:41.190> might<00:04:41.340> cost<00:04:41.580> three<00:04:41.850> levels<00:04:42.120> to

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
because it might cost three levels to

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.810 
because it might cost three levels to
enchant<00:04:42.570> something<00:04:42.960> but<00:04:43.139> then<00:04:43.229> if<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:43.410> die

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
enchant something but then if you die

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
enchant something but then if you die
it'll<00:04:44.820> be<00:04:44.940> harder<00:04:45.150> to<00:04:45.180> get<00:04:45.330> through<00:04:45.539> levels

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
it'll be harder to get through levels

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.100 
it'll be harder to get through levels
one<00:04:46.050> through<00:04:46.380> 30<00:04:46.650> again<00:04:47.419> so<00:04:48.419> I'm<00:04:48.780> not<00:04:48.930> sure

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
one through 30 again so I'm not sure

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.450 
one through 30 again so I'm not sure
really<00:04:49.229> how<00:04:49.349> I<00:04:49.470> feel<00:04:49.710> about<00:04:49.740> that<00:04:50.009> I'm<00:04:50.160> kind<00:04:50.310> of

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
really how I feel about that I'm kind of

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.520 
really how I feel about that I'm kind of
mixed<00:04:50.729> I<00:04:50.910> guess<00:04:51.150> it<00:04:51.300> I'll<00:04:52.050> have<00:04:52.199> to<00:04:52.320> kind<00:04:52.500> of

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
mixed I guess it I'll have to kind of

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.570 
mixed I guess it I'll have to kind of
try<00:04:52.740> playing<00:04:53.220> some<00:04:53.610> survival<00:04:54.150> and<00:04:54.330> and<00:04:54.960> see

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580 
try playing some survival and and see

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.969 
try playing some survival and and see
but<00:04:56.960> but<00:04:57.960> yeah<00:04:58.080> that's<00:04:58.259> basically<00:04:58.470> what's

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
but but yeah that's basically what's

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.150 
but but yeah that's basically what's
going<00:04:59.130> to<00:04:59.190> be<00:04:59.280> happening<00:04:59.310> with<00:04:59.789> both<00:05:00.000> the

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
going to be happening with both the

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.360 
going to be happening with both the
enchanting<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.310> the<00:05:02.550> the<00:05:03.389> villagers<00:05:04.370> also

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
enchanting and the the villagers also

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.820 
enchanting and the the villagers also
when<00:05:06.180> you're<00:05:06.330> fixing<00:05:06.930> items<00:05:07.410> or<00:05:07.530> renaming

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
when you're fixing items or renaming

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.909 
when you're fixing items or renaming
items<00:05:08.220> let's<00:05:08.400> say<00:05:09.139> you<00:05:10.139> won't<00:05:10.259> have<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.680> pay

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
items let's say you won't have to pay

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.560 
items let's say you won't have to pay
more<00:05:11.880> than<00:05:12.240> one<00:05:14.060> enchantment<00:05:15.060> level<00:05:15.330> to

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
more than one enchantment level to

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.260 
more than one enchantment level to
rename<00:05:16.110> an<00:05:16.260> item<00:05:16.500> the<00:05:17.430> way<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.669> was<00:05:17.760> described

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
rename an item the way it was described

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:19.909 
rename an item the way it was described
is<00:05:18.599> that<00:05:18.930> they're<00:05:19.169> flattening<00:05:19.770> the

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
is that they're flattening the

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.300 
is that they're flattening the
enchantment<00:05:20.400> system<00:05:20.699> so<00:05:21.000> you<00:05:21.060> won't<00:05:21.360> have<00:05:21.539> to

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
enchantment system so you won't have to

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.980 
enchantment system so you won't have to
have<00:05:23.310> so<00:05:24.060> you<00:05:24.150> won't<00:05:24.270> have<00:05:24.360> to<00:05:24.419> deal<00:05:24.599> with<00:05:24.780> the

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
have so you won't have to deal with the

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.790 
have so you won't have to deal with the
ramping<00:05:25.380> up<00:05:25.500> of<00:05:25.710> costs<00:05:26.490> for<00:05:26.840> enchanting<00:05:27.840> you

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
ramping up of costs for enchanting you

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.290 
ramping up of costs for enchanting you
can<00:05:28.979> just<00:05:29.130> kind<00:05:29.340> of<00:05:29.400> know<00:05:29.820> what<00:05:30.060> you're<00:05:30.210> going

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
can just kind of know what you're going

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.800 
can just kind of know what you're going
to<00:05:30.389> pay<00:05:30.570> for<00:05:30.780> now<00:05:31.409> on<00:05:31.610> which<00:05:32.610> definitely<00:05:33.570> is<00:05:33.780> a

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
to pay for now on which definitely is a

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.110 
to pay for now on which definitely is a
nice<00:05:34.020> thing<00:05:34.260> right<00:05:35.220> now<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.370> repair<00:05:35.729> system

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
nice thing right now the repair system

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.570 
nice thing right now the repair system
still<00:05:36.389> works<00:05:36.419> on<00:05:37.169> what<00:05:37.830> seems<00:05:38.070> like<00:05:38.280> the<00:05:38.400> old

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
still works on what seems like the old

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.050 
still works on what seems like the old
system<00:05:39.060> where<00:05:39.539> you<00:05:39.870> would<00:05:39.990> have<00:05:40.139> to<00:05:40.289> pay<00:05:40.500> a<00:05:41.060> one

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
system where you would have to pay a one

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.189 
system where you would have to pay a one
through<00:05:42.360> thirty<00:05:44.210> amount<00:05:45.210> of<00:05:45.330> levels<00:05:45.690> for

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 
through thirty amount of levels for

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.659 
through thirty amount of levels for
repairing<00:05:46.740> something<00:05:47.070> or<00:05:47.370> renaming

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
repairing something or renaming

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.170 
repairing something or renaming
something<00:05:48.060> or<00:05:48.180> whatever<00:05:49.639> it<00:05:50.639> looks<00:05:50.909> like<00:05:51.060> the

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180 
something or whatever it looks like the

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.580 
something or whatever it looks like the
costs<00:05:51.570> are<00:05:51.630> actually<00:05:51.780> little<00:05:52.110> bit<00:05:52.199> cheaper

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
costs are actually little bit cheaper

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:53.750 
costs are actually little bit cheaper
I'm<00:05:52.710> not<00:05:52.830> sure<00:05:52.979> if<00:05:53.070> that's<00:05:53.159> just<00:05:53.400> because<00:05:53.520> i'm

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
I'm not sure if that's just because i'm

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.790 
I'm not sure if that's just because i'm
using<00:05:54.030> a<00:05:54.120> fully<00:05:54.389> almost<00:05:55.229> fully<00:05:55.409> charged

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
using a fully almost fully charged

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.100 
using a fully almost fully charged
pickaxe<00:05:56.250> with<00:05:56.520> a<00:05:56.550> fully<00:05:57.090> charged<00:05:57.360> one<00:05:57.599> most

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.360

likely<00:05:59.210> but<00:06:00.210> some<00:06:00.830> they<00:06:01.830> may<00:06:01.949> change<00:06:02.159> the

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
likely but some they may change the

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.279 
likely but some they may change the
system<00:06:02.760> in<00:06:03.030> order<00:06:03.210> to<00:06:03.419> better<00:06:03.570> pair<00:06:04.080> it<00:06:04.169> up

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289 
system in order to better pair it up
