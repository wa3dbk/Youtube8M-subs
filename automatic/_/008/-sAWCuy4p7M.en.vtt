let's go into the functions of this and

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.640 
let's go into the functions of this and
I'm<00:04:26.449> just<00:04:26.690> trying<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:26.930> think<00:04:27.020> how<00:04:27.229> long<00:04:27.410> I<00:04:27.500> do

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650

this ok good this you pull these wings

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.749 
this ok good this you pull these wings
down<00:04:34.550> in<00:04:35.449> the<00:04:35.750> back<00:04:35.990> bit<00:04:36.409> like<00:04:37.069> that<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.550> can

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 
down in the back bit like that it can

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.879 
down in the back bit like that it can
fool<00:04:38.030> them<00:04:38.240> as<00:04:38.419> well<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:39.830> ok<00:04:41.319> now<00:04:42.319> fold<00:04:42.560> enter

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
fool them as well that ok now fold enter

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.399 
fool them as well that ok now fold enter
it's<00:04:43.009> on<00:04:43.129> the<00:04:43.280> mood<00:04:43.490> it's<00:04:44.419> fine<00:04:44.840> what<00:04:45.199> if<00:04:45.289> you

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409 
it's on the mood it's fine what if you

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.070 
it's on the mood it's fine what if you
like<00:04:45.560> ok<00:04:46.550> there<00:04:46.729> we<00:04:46.819> go<00:04:46.849> so<00:04:47.569> that<00:04:47.720> can<00:04:47.930> move

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
like ok there we go so that can move

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:56.499 
like ok there we go so that can move
around<00:04:53.139> quick<00:04:54.139> a<00:04:54.169> deal<00:04:54.400> cockpit<00:04:55.400> will<00:04:56.330> be<00:04:56.449> the

00:04:56.499 --> 00:04:56.509 
around quick a deal cockpit will be the
