00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:23.730
 this new boat of 45 meters the 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.710
 the greater the oil and you built up today 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.980
 a traditional boat that has a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.949
 extraordinary performance the displacement 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.170
 is 150 tonnes combined with that 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.230
 the mobile that provides a boat 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.750
 fast and equipped with complete appliances 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:47.070
 and needed to stay high 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.500
 sea ​​for long periods of 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 of its main characteristics is the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.480
 great use of composite materials 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.500
 used during its production that 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.390
 more sectional lightness 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.430
 decreasing the weight actually improves if the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.799
 relation to the environment 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.390
 beyond the benefits obtained in terms of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.360
 flat the old boy 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.979
 in this sense - weight helps in softness 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.229
 of the main rolling hull is characterized 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.020
 in particular by placing a command 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.780
 powerful the wide door that allows the 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.580
 access from the cope to the main hall 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.950
 better still the concept of 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.770
 habitability and external relations 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.619
 Inside a typical design of 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.479
 designs wally the natural light enters 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.810
 directly into the internal spaces 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.860
 through the large glass panes located 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.020
 in the house is this nautical jewel is capable of 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.540
 host eight passengers and six 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.250
 crew and sail calmly to the 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.920
 12 speed nodes 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.070
 the layout of internal spaces provides that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.189
 habitat sites 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.810
 located at the stern of the vessel 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.890
 presenting the suite and the office 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.680
 armatori

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.459
 providing a 360 degree view 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.590
 besides being located in the center of 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.140
 boat while the spaces of the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.910
 crew and service locations 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.550
 are at the bow, simple and elegant 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.830
 it's the inner design that I blindly like 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.440
 owner who wanted to create a 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.010
 comfortable and familiar with the profit 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:38.070
 minimalist though great class

 Inclusive or in-depth Olympiad 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.030

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.030
 the vibrations of the large room
