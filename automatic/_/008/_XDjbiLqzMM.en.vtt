workshop on the frame and how to use it

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.490 
workshop on the frame and how to use it
involve<00:00:33.130> Nancy<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:34.570> way<00:00:34.750> we<00:00:34.960> need<00:00:35.080> to<00:00:35.140> think

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
involve Nancy the way we need to think

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.920 
involve Nancy the way we need to think
about<00:00:35.650> our<00:00:36.010> frame<00:00:36.430> is<00:00:36.760> that<00:00:36.790> it<00:00:37.330> is<00:00:37.510> sort<00:00:37.870> of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
about our frame is that it is sort of

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.500 
about our frame is that it is sort of
the<00:00:38.080> infrastructure<00:00:38.650> upon<00:00:39.489> which<00:00:39.790> all<00:00:40.030> of<00:00:40.360> our

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
the infrastructure upon which all of our

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.479 
the infrastructure upon which all of our
dancing<00:00:40.960> is<00:00:41.110> built<00:00:41.380> so<00:00:41.710> if<00:00:41.920> we<00:00:41.950> can<00:00:42.280> have<00:00:42.460> a

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
dancing is built so if we can have a

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.940 
dancing is built so if we can have a
good<00:00:42.730> and<00:00:42.940> clear<00:00:43.150> understanding<00:00:43.870> of<00:00:43.989> what<00:00:44.080> to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
good and clear understanding of what to

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.220 
good and clear understanding of what to
do<00:00:45.130> without<00:00:45.340> frame<00:00:45.790> many<00:00:46.480> other<00:00:46.720> things<00:00:47.020> will

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
do without frame many other things will

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.920 
do without frame many other things will
become<00:00:47.380> much<00:00:48.190> easier<00:00:48.220> for<00:00:48.940> us<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.059> do<00:00:49.360> we<00:00:49.780> will

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
become much easier for us to do we will

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.930 
become much easier for us to do we will
be<00:00:50.050> able<00:00:50.140> to<00:00:50.290> move<00:00:50.559> as<00:00:50.770> one<00:00:51.010> unit<00:00:51.460> and<00:00:51.670> we'll<00:00:51.790> be

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
be able to move as one unit and we'll be

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.210 
be able to move as one unit and we'll be
able<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.180> fit<00:00:52.600> together<00:00:52.780> all<00:00:53.350> throughout<00:00:53.920> our

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
able to fit together all throughout our

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.729 
able to fit together all throughout our
dancing<00:00:54.699> so<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.690> first<00:00:55.900> thing<00:00:56.050> I'd<00:00:56.350> like<00:00:56.559> to

dancing so the first thing I'd like to
talk<00:00:56.949> about<00:00:57.129> is<00:00:57.460> where<00:00:57.940> our<00:00:58.210> weight<00:00:58.660> should<00:00:58.989> be

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
talk about is where our weight should be

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.670 
talk about is where our weight should be
relative<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.769> our<00:00:59.980> feet<00:01:00.460> so<00:01:01.330> as<00:01:01.629> a<00:01:01.660> man<00:01:02.019> what<00:01:02.650> I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
relative to our feet so as a man what I

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.940 
relative to our feet so as a man what I
try<00:01:03.400> to<00:01:03.430> do<00:01:03.790> is<00:01:04.030> before<00:01:04.629> i<00:01:04.900> start<00:01:05.440> i<00:01:05.500> try<00:01:05.890> to

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
try to do is before i start i try to

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.730 
try to do is before i start i try to
straighten<00:01:06.730> out<00:01:07.030> my<00:01:07.240> back<00:01:07.659> so<00:01:08.350> there's<00:01:08.620> a

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
straighten out my back so there's a

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.690 
straighten out my back so there's a
sense<00:01:08.890> that<00:01:09.490> as<00:01:10.360> my<00:01:10.690> arms<00:01:11.140> go<00:01:11.380> forward<00:01:11.950> they<00:01:12.430> go

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
sense that as my arms go forward they go

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.680 
sense that as my arms go forward they go
forward<00:01:13.060> because<00:01:13.330> my<00:01:13.750> spine<00:01:14.260> pulls<00:01:14.770> back<00:01:15.690> as

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
forward because my spine pulls back as

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.330 
forward because my spine pulls back as
you<00:01:16.900> can<00:01:17.050> see<00:01:17.290> there's<00:01:17.560> movement<00:01:17.890> in<00:01:18.220> the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
you can see there's movement in the

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.340 
you can see there's movement in the
spine<00:01:18.640> from<00:01:18.940> being<00:01:19.300> towards<00:01:19.870> the<00:01:19.990> front<00:01:20.200> of

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
spine from being towards the front of

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.280 
spine from being towards the front of
the<00:01:20.470> foot<00:01:20.650> and<00:01:21.300> now<00:01:22.300> is<00:01:22.479> towards<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.020> back<00:01:23.260> of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
is slightly different so we have a

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.600 
is slightly different so we have a
little<00:01:34.570> exercise<00:01:34.840> we<00:01:35.320> can<00:01:35.470> do<00:01:35.620> as<00:01:35.980> a<00:01:36.010> lady<00:01:36.310> if

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
little exercise we can do as a lady if

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.030 
little exercise we can do as a lady if
we<00:01:36.760> both<00:01:36.940> stand<00:01:37.330> here<00:01:37.600> together<00:01:38.010> with<00:01:39.010> our

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
we both stand here together with our

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.100 
we both stand here together with our
feet<00:01:39.520> together<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.970> our<00:01:40.210> arms<00:01:40.660> to<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.840> side

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
feet together and our arms to the side

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.990 
feet together and our arms to the side
now<00:01:41.800> what<00:01:42.100> we<00:01:42.280> do<00:01:42.460> is<00:01:42.490> we<00:01:43.420> relax<00:01:43.900> our<00:01:44.230> left<00:01:44.530> side

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
now what we do is we relax our left side

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.990 
now what we do is we relax our left side
we<00:01:46.000> level<00:01:46.510> our<00:01:46.720> arms<00:01:47.290> and<00:01:47.500> we<00:01:48.040> open<00:01:48.490> our<00:01:48.670> feet

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
we level our arms and we open our feet

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.660 
we level our arms and we open our feet
and<00:01:49.180> flex<00:01:49.840> our<00:01:50.050> knees<00:01:50.260> slightly<00:01:50.560> forward<00:01:51.100> you

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
and flex our knees slightly forward you

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.970 
and flex our knees slightly forward you
will<00:01:51.850> see<00:01:52.120> if<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.540> look<00:01:52.750> at<00:01:52.900> Barbara<00:01:53.140> now<00:01:53.440> that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
will see if you look at Barbara now that

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.070 
will see if you look at Barbara now that
there<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.370> a<00:01:54.400> slight<00:01:54.760> sense<00:01:55.180> that<00:01:55.480> her<00:01:55.720> right

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
there is a slight sense that her right

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.640 
there is a slight sense that her right
hip<00:01:56.410> is<00:01:56.710> slightly<00:01:57.550> high<00:01:58.000> than<00:01:58.720> our<00:01:58.960> left<00:01:59.230> her

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
hip is slightly high than our left her

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.610 
hip is slightly high than our left her
left<00:01:59.890> and<00:02:00.310> therefore<00:02:01.180> she<00:02:01.870> sort<00:02:02.140> of<00:02:02.200> has<00:02:02.410> her

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
left and therefore she sort of has her

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.970 
left and therefore she sort of has her
weight<00:02:02.970> completely
