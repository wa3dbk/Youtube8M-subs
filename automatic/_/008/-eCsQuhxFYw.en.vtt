before I depart I just want to say it

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:27.990 
before I depart I just want to say it
does<00:03:26.170> take<00:03:26.380> some<00:03:26.410> experimentation<00:03:27.070> if<00:03:27.790> you

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
does take some experimentation if you

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.120 
does take some experimentation if you
have<00:03:28.120> to<00:03:28.239> go<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.390> bed<00:03:28.540> by<00:03:28.690> 10<00:03:29.019> p.m.<00:03:29.350> and<00:03:29.590> you're

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
have to go to bed by 10 p.m. and you're

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.800 
have to go to bed by 10 p.m. and you're
still<00:03:30.370> able<00:03:30.580> to<00:03:30.850> drink<00:03:31.090> something<00:03:31.330> at<00:03:31.630> like

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
still able to drink something at like

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.590 
still able to drink something at like
9:30<00:03:32.140> thirty<00:03:32.860> minutes<00:03:33.160> before<00:03:33.250> bed<00:03:33.700> and<00:03:34.000> still

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
9:30 thirty minutes before bed and still

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.120 
9:30 thirty minutes before bed and still
sleep<00:03:34.959> through<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.380> night<00:03:35.410> perfect<00:03:35.860> without

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
sleep through the night perfect without

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.920 
sleep through the night perfect without
having<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.670> go<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:37.030> bathroom<00:03:37.360> that

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
having to go to the bathroom that

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.800 
having to go to the bathroom that
probably<00:03:38.410> means<00:03:38.800> that<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.580> were<00:03:39.810> dehydrated

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
probably means that you were dehydrated

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.800 
probably means that you were dehydrated
prior<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.500> going<00:03:42.280> to<00:03:42.459> bed<00:03:42.760> so<00:03:43.300> it's<00:03:43.540> gonna<00:03:43.630> take

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
prior to going to bed so it's gonna take

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.870 
prior to going to bed so it's gonna take
some<00:03:43.959> experimentation<00:03:44.380> like<00:03:44.800> I<00:03:44.920> said<00:03:45.190> but<00:03:45.850> I

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
some experimentation like I said but I

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.180 
some experimentation like I said but I
would<00:03:46.060> say<00:03:46.390> at<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.720> very<00:03:46.750> least<00:03:47.140> an<00:03:47.380> hour<00:03:47.800> and

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
would say at the very least an hour and

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.009 
would say at the very least an hour and
a<00:03:48.250> half<00:03:48.489> two<00:03:48.820> and<00:03:48.850> two<00:03:49.180> hours<00:03:49.390> before<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:49.900> go

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
a half two and two hours before you go

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.420 
a half two and two hours before you go
to<00:03:50.080> bed<00:03:50.200> make<00:03:50.470> sure<00:03:50.590> you<00:03:50.680> have<00:03:50.830> your<00:03:50.950> last<00:03:51.130> sip

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
to bed make sure you have your last sip

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.240 
to bed make sure you have your last sip
so<00:03:51.970> your<00:03:52.120> sleep<00:03:52.450> doesn't<00:03:52.690> get

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
so your sleep doesn't get

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.890
