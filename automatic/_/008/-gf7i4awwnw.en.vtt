00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.670 
a few unique things about this pit guard
that<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:21.359> know<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.689> guess<00:00:22.050> convinced<00:00:22.500> me<00:00:22.590> to

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
that you know I guess convinced me to

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.080 
that you know I guess convinced me to
buy<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:22.890> over<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.369> buying<00:00:23.670> individual

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
buy it over just buying individual

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.990 
buy it over just buying individual
pickups<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.689> and<00:00:24.869> putting<00:00:25.500> them<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:26.000> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
pickups and and putting them in the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.689 
pickups and and putting them in the
first<00:00:27.210> thing<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.830> volume<00:00:29.189> knob<00:00:29.429> is

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
first thing is the volume knob is

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.870 
first thing is the volume knob is
equipped<00:00:30.660> with<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.929> treble<00:00:31.349> bleed<00:00:31.640> which<00:00:32.640> just

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
equipped with a treble bleed which just

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.090 
equipped with a treble bleed which just
means<00:00:33.120> as<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.719> backup<00:00:34.200> your<00:00:34.380> volume<00:00:34.890> usually

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
means as you backup your volume usually

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.920 
means as you backup your volume usually
it<00:00:35.399> would<00:00:35.520> warm<00:00:35.730> up<00:00:35.940> or<00:00:36.180> you'd<00:00:36.510> lose<00:00:36.660> a<00:00:36.719> little

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
it would warm up or you'd lose a little

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.000 
it would warm up or you'd lose a little
bit<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.260> treble<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.860> would<00:00:37.980> just

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
bit of that treble and it would just

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.410 
bit of that treble and it would just
kind<00:00:38.250> of<00:00:38.370> give<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.850> mellow<00:00:39.149> tone

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
kind of give you that really mellow tone

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.170 
kind of give you that really mellow tone
this<00:00:40.410> one<00:00:40.590> will<00:00:40.710> keep<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.790> tone<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.030> you

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
this one will keep the the tone that you

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.360 
this one will keep the the tone that you
have<00:00:42.329> set<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.870> given<00:00:43.800> pickup

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
have set for the given pickup

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.760 
have set for the given pickup
so<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.120> back<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.450> off<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.379> keep<00:00:46.559> that

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
so as you back it off it will keep that

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.060 
so as you back it off it will keep that
same<00:00:47.070> amount<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:48.050> treble<00:00:49.050> bass<00:00:49.230> mids<00:00:49.649> that

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
same amount of treble bass mids that

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.970 
same amount of treble bass mids that
same<00:00:50.399> balance<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:52.289> just<00:00:52.530> decrease<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
same balance and just decrease the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.500 
same balance and just decrease the
volume<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.460> I've<00:00:53.730> never<00:00:54.090> played<00:00:54.329> an

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
volume so I've never played an

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.029 
volume so I've never played an
instrument<00:00:54.809> like<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.079> before<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:55.710> I'm<00:00:55.770> very

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
curious to see how that will play out in

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.470 
curious to see how that will play out in
real-life<00:00:59.670> situations

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
real-life situations

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.650 
real-life situations

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
sorry this pick guard keeps hitting the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.609 
sorry this pick guard keeps hitting the
strings<00:01:13.909> this<00:01:14.909> tone<00:01:15.270> knob<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.720> set<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
strings this tone knob is set up to

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.609 
strings this tone knob is set up to
affect<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.460> bridge<00:01:17.640> pickup<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.439> middle

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
affect the bridge pickup so the middle

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.249 
affect the bridge pickup so the middle
pickup<00:01:19.950> will<00:01:20.130> always<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.729> full<00:01:21.360> bright<00:01:21.900> or

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
pickup will always be full bright or

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.120 
pickup will always be full bright or
full<00:01:22.500> treble<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:24.200> yeah<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.860> sort<00:01:26.070> of

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
full treble and yeah so you can sort of

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.249 
full treble and yeah so you can sort of
tailor<00:01:26.909> these<00:01:27.060> two<00:01:27.270> pickups<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.930> then<00:01:28.049> in<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
tailor these two pickups and then in the

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.530 
tailor these two pickups and then in the
combinations<00:01:28.950> you'll<00:01:29.880> add<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.060> brightness

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
combinations you'll add the brightness

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.899 
combinations you'll add the brightness
of<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> middle<00:01:31.259> pickup<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.829> then<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.790> that

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
of the middle pickup and then like that

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.800 
of the middle pickup and then like that
so<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.960> bit<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.619> unique<00:01:35.450> setup<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:36.780> I

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
so it's a bit of a unique setup but I

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.620 
so it's a bit of a unique setup but I
think<00:01:37.049> something<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:38.060> should<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.180> fun<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
think something that should be fun to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.319 
think something that should be fun to
try<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.869> anyway<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.890> think<00:01:41.729> what<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:41.880> will<00:01:42.000> do

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
try out anyway I think what I will do

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.990 
try out anyway I think what I will do
although<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.630> do<00:01:42.720> like<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.500> look<00:01:43.619> of<00:01:43.770> this

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
although I do like the look of this

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.950 
although I do like the look of this
tortoise<00:01:45.000> guard<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.329> think<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:45.720> I'm<00:01:45.810> going

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
tortoise guard I think of what I'm going

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.179 
tortoise guard I think of what I'm going
to<00:01:45.990> do<00:01:46.140> is<00:01:46.350> transfer<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.590> components

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
to do is transfer all the components

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.880 
to do is transfer all the components
into<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.939> pearloid<00:01:51.479> guard<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.930> really<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:52.710> like

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
into the pearloid guard I really do like

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.580 
into the pearloid guard I really do like
the<00:01:53.070> white<00:01:53.250> on<00:01:53.399> white<00:01:53.549> look<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:55.049> strap<00:01:55.350> as

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the white on white look of the strap as

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.190 
the white on white look of the strap as
it<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.189> then<00:01:56.969> either<00:01:57.149> I'll<00:01:57.570> load<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:57.930> this
