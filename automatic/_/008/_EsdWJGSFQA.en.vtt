00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.809
 in us from last week what 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.570
 We send Santiago to make a 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.410
 treatment to improve as fast 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.970
 possible his injury if it was as I said before 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.859
 and it was possible on Friday and we are going to 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.680
 test it to the bottom to see if it could or not 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.240
 to play 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.740
 I repeat that it is in very good 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:30.710
 conditions but we believe I believe 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:34.310
 risky in this case that there is not 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.650
 fulfilled with the necessary rest and not 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.060
 I think it's convenient to wait until the day 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.030
 Friday 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.320
 hoping it gets better that it has 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.840
 some possibilities of being 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.670
 transferred and I would not like to me from 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.940
 interfere physically so that this does not 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.080
 happen after what we all know 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.900
 that have happened I preferred to give 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:00.750
 give him this rest this is not 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.240
 it's not any kind of sanction does not go into 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.540
 no kind of extension leadership or 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.450
 nothing is a technical decision so today 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.490
 was released to mediate committed 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.650
 with every Thursday the 'u' that I 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.170
 I was risking a lot in lending it 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.600
 by circles an accident occurred and 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.670
 the commitment was that each of 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.300
 them once the game and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.300
 go to their homes 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.330
 55 of them went to their homes and one did not 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.430
 and is that it was evidently not more than 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.460
 Of course he did not keep the word that 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.670
 had with me fundamentally so 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:42.190
 that's why I thought it was not 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.140
 convenient that it was because I do not know 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.110
 meets a word there is no penalty 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.390
 it's just a separate 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.060
 set him aside in this game and hope that 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.340
 the next what we're going to have the 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.810
 true that there are many girls are not 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.350
 leaving without players 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.850
 it's a big complication what I do 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.610
 would like each one the two were in 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.520
 your free day that's very important 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.240
 but then we had commitments of 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.760
 words 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.320
 then this does not run any kind of 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.790
 sanction that says he is sanctioned 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.800
 for not putting any kind of sanction 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.350
 because in his free time and any 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.480
 of you who are workers good not 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.400
 all but they are workers 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.060
 On their day off they can do what they 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:34.879
 want or the team is ok I repeat it was 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:40.549
 matías instead of income because it was 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:42.739
 he did it well and it's not what 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:49.099
 we have seen of the Venezuelan team 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:51.700
 in aerial balls is the strong one that 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.870
 they have them and many other computers do not 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.540
 we can not be prized by the 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.640
 Chilean so we have to look for weapons 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.530
 that prevent them from having 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.780
 has the center needed near the 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.190
 area that complicate us something that also 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.250
 we saw in Bolivia another day in the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.069
 first we could not avoid so the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.069
 idea of ​​course is to keep the ball 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.769
 down below the ground that I think is 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.879
 I do not say that we are superior but that 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.879
 better for us example
