00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.280
 to work but congost 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:06.290
 after the youtube gang 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.770
 reporting how they are very well where 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.770
 want them to be 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.310
 the greetings your service will have some 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.540
 new job and commented what they are going to 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.940
 be watching in the background when it is already a 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.560
 normal day in which the diamond gets 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.960
 to play against everyone and try to take 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.330
 one that you know I'm trying to 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.950
 take it out of 'www I'm trying because 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.170
 I still do not take it out to this good could 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.360
 have been that example that I want to take 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.460
 but later we'll see how it is that I 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.110
 they removed the streak in a way from a 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.180
 so that everyone has not happened to us 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.190
 remember I remember a little love in 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.810
 wolffer 2 right now we get to that 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.970
 moment I think it is this same I go to 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.380
 that I killed twice in a row that 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.850
 then it comes in a very 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.530
 cowardly but good gang like a 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.810
 normal day trying to get one who 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.030
 is using the in tareck and they are 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.280
 enough so good but as it is 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.800
 custom here in color and goal looks 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.050
 of iron that already come with the weapon are 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.600
 a blowjob and I had to put a look of 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.090
 red dot and muffler 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.710
 it was working pretty well for me 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.160
 towards the weapon I recommend it always 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.810
 when you believe yourself capable of 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.850
 control what is the recoil that the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.790
 silencer gives the gun when it 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.680
 put the gun course and are otherwise 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.350
 able to control it, I recommend 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.360
 put on muffler and handle if 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.340
 is that they settle with the sight with the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.110
 Iron look that already comes with the gun 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.120
 and if not then it is used in the advantage 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.410
 that lets you put three add-ons 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.000
 alarm so that all are played 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.920
 happy to me well pulling 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.930
 precipitation and greater good happy well 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.370
 glad that I'm going through here they're going to 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.940
 reappear over there for some reason 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.430
 I do not know why I came back I returned to and 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.400
 This is where everything happened that wey see it 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:50.300
 21 360 like a knife in the air and I 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.000
 grabbed me as you do not see that blowjob 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.010
 these kinds of things are the ones that 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.650
 I fall for sanity goes because the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.780
 principle you 're already in the dark block no 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.670
 there was very strange that someone would listen 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.160
 the truth I do not know much about blades 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.490
 because as you know they used or used 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.400
 the tactical command and stabbing is to move 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.830
 the finger is a movement that takes away 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.510
 how can you say time I do not have 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.130
 like big fingers like to try 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.950
 of blades then many times high 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.630
 because I do not know that a fucking cricket either 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.270
 to walk santi jump after a while do not have 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.670
 in control such as something like for 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.290
 make them more pros but I jump down 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.610
 you know that here in olive color 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.960
 then they have to be good rather in 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.030
 collector and you have to do what you 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.940
 have to do to kill the enemy 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.490
 - change course gang them 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.680
 I wanted to comment a little bit about 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.540
 this one of the videos that all this stir 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.030
 that there has been lately that no longer 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.380
 will no longer be able to upload videos 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.510
 helping and that they will no longer be able to 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.970
 monetize me all this roll the truth 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.320
 what I 've seen so what's better 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.520
 well I saw a video of iuc airways or by 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.080
 it exists they have not seen it I'm going to leave 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.970
 in the description so that more or less 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.090
 inform yourself a little 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.800
 he says that this kind of thing swims 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.290
 more are going to affect the people that you see 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.870
 like who says campaigns thank God 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.640
 and thanks to activision that I hope not 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.830
 it is put on mammon later because 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.760
 Sincerely exhibit in what is 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.100
 color is due to youtube I think if 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.489
 your video can be popular that much 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.140
 has already been kept all this time in 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.880
 the taste could be said of the people 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.500
 lately it's not going but it has 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.660
 maintained and thanks to all the examples 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.110
 that people climb most of 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.000
 gameplay is from gaming and youtubers 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.000
 great to all the big youtubers 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.560
 as for example willy red stack are the 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.900
 that you know started with call 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.000
 of duty going up call of duty is not a 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.460
 channel grew through to October 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.580
 so I think that types of games 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.680
 as minecraft or things like that should be 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.939
 to the videos that people upload I hope 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.439
 that nothing happens to me until the 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:54.229
 moment nothing else has detected me a 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:56.990
 video and that for the song that I put was 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.460
 South project gets a bomb 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.080
 nuclear in battered moron that was not 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.719
 so important so I worked to not 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.580
 have any kind of problem and good a 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:06.830
 day out there they gave me try to take out 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.539
 one that I packed which was a fail 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.639
 because you supposedly have to do it 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.409
 up on this map from the beginning 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:15.770
 of the game thing I do not understand why 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:17.419
 because he gave me a quimo or that you 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.310
 they think it was me I'm sure that 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.139
 was one who because in this in this 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.150
 map when you buy the challenge that the 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.159
 portfolio I prayed here but good 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.690
 I was left with that doubt you who believe there 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.159
 leave some comments I say goodbye 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.289

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:31.759
 you can always sacred you already know that 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.770
