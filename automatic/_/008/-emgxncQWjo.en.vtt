00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
block at a local hardware store and I

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.190 
block at a local hardware store and I
took<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.030> one<00:02:27.180> flipped<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.660> upside<00:02:27.900> down<00:02:28.019> like

you<00:02:28.349> said<00:02:28.380> took<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.280> one<00:02:29.430> flipped<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.910> right

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
you said took the one flipped the right

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.140 
you said took the one flipped the right
side<00:02:30.330> up<00:02:30.569> filled<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.500> with<00:02:31.530> water<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.340> then

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
side up filled it with water and then

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.479 
side up filled it with water and then
put<00:02:33.750> these<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.290> cool<00:02:34.470> submersible<00:02:35.250> lights

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489

it<00:02:38.069> with<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:38.280> water<00:02:38.489> so<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:38.970> it<00:02:39.120> really

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
it with the water so that it really

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.589 
it with the water so that it really
reflects<00:02:39.780> all<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.019> line<00:02:40.310> then<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.730> took<00:02:42.150> a

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
reflects all the line then I took a

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.259 
reflects all the line then I took a
plate<00:02:43.049> and<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:43.890> just<00:02:44.130> a<00:02:44.250> simple<00:02:44.670> glass<00:02:44.910> plate

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
plate and it's just a simple glass plate

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.120 
plate and it's just a simple glass plate
that<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.599> can<00:02:45.780> pick<00:02:45.930> up<00:02:45.959> on<00:02:46.230> ice<00:02:46.410> anywhere<00:02:46.860> I

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
that you can pick up on ice anywhere I

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.770 
that you can pick up on ice anywhere I
put<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.239> top

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
put that on top

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.789 
put that on top
I<00:02:48.810> took<00:02:49.650> glue<00:02:50.640> dots<00:02:51.079> layered<00:02:52.079> those<00:02:52.410> around

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
I took glue dots layered those around

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.360 
I took glue dots layered those around
then<00:02:53.640> I<00:02:53.670> took<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.269> actual<00:02:54.810> bling<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:56.130> cut

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
wide and I cut these long strips out

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.960 
wide and I cut these long strips out
these<00:03:01.470> are<00:03:01.620> probably<00:03:01.860> about<00:03:01.980> 24<00:03:02.459> inches<00:03:02.760> long

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.110 
these are probably about 24 inches long
I<00:03:03.239> used<00:03:03.989> two<00:03:04.290> different<00:03:04.319> colors<00:03:05.220> of<00:03:05.250> bling<00:03:05.790> to

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
I used two different colors of bling to
