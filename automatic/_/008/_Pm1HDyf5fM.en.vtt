00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
future and then you find stuff I've

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.569 
future and then you find stuff I've
about<00:02:48.810> now<00:02:49.200> and<00:02:49.560> then<00:02:49.950> you're<00:02:50.099> thinking<00:02:50.400> oh<00:02:50.549> I

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
about now and then you're thinking oh I

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.190 
about now and then you're thinking oh I
know<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.090> going<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.299> happen<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
know this is going to happen and the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.839 
know this is going to happen and the
responsibility<00:02:52.980> would<00:02:53.069> be<00:02:53.190> too<00:02:53.370> much<00:02:53.400> and

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
responsibility would be too much and

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.520 
responsibility would be too much and
therefore<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.360> would<00:02:54.630> probably<00:02:54.959> just<00:02:55.290> stay
