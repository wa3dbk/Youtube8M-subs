00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
generator so everything should be fine

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
who live here get their energy from the

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.900 
who live here get their energy from the
electric<00:03:23.870> stones<00:03:24.200> inside<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.860> caves<00:03:25.310> maybe

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
electric stones inside the caves maybe

at<00:03:28.160> all<00:03:28.310> to<00:03:28.940> our<00:03:29.090> pokemon<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:29.870> world<00:03:30.170> I<00:03:30.530> think

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
at all to our pokemon this world I think

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.020 
at all to our pokemon this world I think
so<00:03:31.520> nigga<00:03:32.830> perhaps<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:34.070> pokemon<00:03:34.700> weren't

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
so nigga perhaps the pokemon weren't

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.060 
so nigga perhaps the pokemon weren't
able<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.450> use<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.780> cave<00:03:35.990> anymore<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:36.950> they

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
able to use the cave anymore so they

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.980 
able to use the cave anymore so they
drank<00:03:37.310> your<00:03:37.430> pokemons<00:03:38.060> electricity<00:03:38.600> instead

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
drank your pokemons electricity instead

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:51.610 
drank your pokemons electricity instead
that<00:03:39.680> would<00:03:39.890> explain<00:03:40.010> it

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.199 

we<00:03:52.620> should<00:03:52.829> be<00:03:52.950> able<00:03:53.099> to<00:03:53.340> wrap<00:03:53.489> this<00:03:53.730> up<00:03:53.969> by

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
we should be able to wrap this up by

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.869 
we should be able to wrap this up by
today<00:03:54.540> right<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.379> we'll<00:03:55.859> be<00:03:56.040> able<00:03:56.189> to<00:03:56.400> secure

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
today right and we'll be able to secure

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.870 
today right and we'll be able to secure
even<00:03:57.060> more<00:03:57.420> than<00:03:57.689> what
