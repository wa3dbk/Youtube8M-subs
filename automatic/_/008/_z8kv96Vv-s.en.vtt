00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.620 

so<00:01:15.740> I<00:01:15.770> think<00:01:16.040> on<00:01:16.160> maple<00:01:16.520> summon<00:01:16.880> is<00:01:17.030> just<00:01:17.420> about

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.450 
so I think on maple summon is just about
ready<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.170> how<00:01:18.260> do<00:01:18.320> I<00:01:18.440> know<00:01:18.530> that<00:01:18.620> because<00:01:19.190> of
