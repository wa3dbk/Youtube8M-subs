still<00:00:40.920> doable<00:00:41.600> kind<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.750> but<00:00:43.170> uh<00:00:43.219> it's<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.340> lot

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
still doable kind of but uh it's a lot

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.850 
still doable kind of but uh it's a lot
harder<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> went<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.110> was<00:00:46.590> our

black white anything if you I don't
really<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.079> how<00:02:07.829> it<00:02:07.950> looks<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.520> characters

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
really like how it looks on characters

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.820 
really like how it looks on characters
so<00:02:09.539> I'm<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:09.780> gonna<00:02:09.929> leave<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:10.679> like<00:02:10.800> that

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
so I'm just gonna leave it like that

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.809 
so I'm just gonna leave it like that
because<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.849> can

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
because you can

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.479 
because you can
later<00:02:13.599> on<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.900> think<00:02:14.170> when<00:02:14.530> you<00:02:14.650> get<00:02:14.769> into<00:02:15.010> face

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
later on I think when you get into face

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.970 
later on I think when you get into face
this<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.689> also<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.049> second<00:02:17.469> Scott<00:02:17.709> as<00:02:17.859> they

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
this is also the second Scott as they

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.160 
this is also the second Scott as they
give<00:02:18.129> you<00:02:18.219> scars<00:02:18.489> to<00:02:18.760> pick<00:02:18.939> anyway<00:02:19.689> later<00:02:19.930> on

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
give you scars to pick anyway later on

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.550 
give you scars to pick anyway later on
once<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.680> get<00:02:20.829> into<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.010> face<00:02:21.310> you<00:02:21.579> can<00:02:22.560> pick

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
once you get into the face you can pick

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.160 
once you get into the face you can pick
separate<00:02:24.099> things<00:02:24.639> to<00:02:25.120> do<00:02:25.269> they<00:02:25.510> also<00:02:25.659> have<00:02:25.870> war

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
separate things to do they also have war

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.099 
separate things to do they also have war

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
war paint they didn't do a good job with

these<00:02:33.430> guys<00:02:33.639> this<00:02:33.969> game<00:02:34.889> let's<00:02:35.889> just<00:02:35.950> set<00:02:36.189> it

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:36.219 
these guys this game let's just set it

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:37.440 
these guys this game let's just set it
to<00:02:36.370> a<00:02:36.400> random<00:02:36.609> one<00:02:36.819> so<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.090> can<00:02:37.209> see<00:02:37.359> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
to a random one so you can see the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.800 
to a random one so you can see the
colors<00:02:38.250> here<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.430> go<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:40.180> think<00:02:40.569> actually

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
colors here you go I think actually

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.959 
colors here you go I think actually
maybe<00:02:41.319> if<00:02:41.590> you<00:02:41.709> were<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.859> pick<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.249> darker

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:42.969 
maybe if you were to pick the darker

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:44.729 
maybe if you were to pick the darker
colors<00:02:42.999> I've<00:02:43.540> blended<00:02:43.780> with<00:02:44.139> the<00:02:44.260> skin<00:02:44.530> tone

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
colors I've blended with the skin tone

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.039 
colors I've blended with the skin tone
more<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.219> mean<00:02:45.459> if<00:02:45.849> you<00:02:46.150> say<00:02:46.359> your<00:02:46.510> guy<00:02:46.629> all<00:02:46.930> the

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
more I mean if you say your guy all the

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.589 
more I mean if you say your guy all the
way<00:02:47.079> to<00:02:47.230> white<00:02:47.500> then<00:02:47.829> obviously<00:02:48.419> the<00:02:49.419> white

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
way to white then obviously the white

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.080 
way to white then obviously the white
skin<00:02:49.840> tones<00:02:50.109> would<00:02:50.409> fit<00:02:50.709> better<00:02:50.919> but<00:02:51.310> um<00:02:51.340> I'm

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
skin tones would fit better but um I'm

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.309 
skin tones would fit better but um I'm
just<00:02:52.299> going<00:02:52.419> to<00:02:52.480> leave<00:02:52.629> that<00:02:52.659> blank<00:02:53.019> for<00:02:53.290> now

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
just going to leave that blank for now

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.740 
just going to leave that blank for now
I'm<00:02:53.620> not<00:02:53.769> really<00:02:54.040> going<00:02:54.159> to<00:02:54.250> focus<00:02:55.209> on<00:02:55.569> the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
I'm not really going to focus on the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.089 
I'm not really going to focus on the
character<00:02:56.169> because<00:02:56.500> you<00:02:56.650> don't<00:02:56.829> really<00:02:57.010> even

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
character because you don't really even

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.390 
character because you don't really even
look<00:02:57.519> at<00:02:57.669> them<00:02:57.760> along<00:02:58.090> especially<00:02:58.780> like<00:02:59.650> you

this game is like they don't it's

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.899 
this game is like they don't it's
definitely<00:05:42.500> more<00:05:42.680> limited<00:05:43.219> that's<00:05:43.520> the<00:05:43.729> one

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
definitely more limited that's the one

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:47.110 
definitely more limited that's the one
thing<00:05:44.150> that<00:05:44.210> I'm<00:05:44.449> going<00:05:44.599> to<00:05:44.659> say<00:05:45.129> this<00:05:46.129> is<00:05:46.520> very

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
thing that I'm going to say this is very

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.129 
thing that I'm going to say this is very
like<00:05:48.430> limited<00:05:49.430> this<00:05:49.879> character<00:05:50.419> creation<00:05:50.930> but

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
like limited this character creation but

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.200 
like limited this character creation but
that<00:05:51.409> is<00:05:51.979> actually<00:05:52.310> seven<00:05:52.969> the<00:05:53.060> right

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
that is actually seven the right

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.170 
that is actually seven the right
direction<00:05:53.389> for<00:05:53.960> oblivion<00:05:54.680> because<00:05:54.969> even<00:05:55.969> um

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
direction for oblivion because even um

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.659 
direction for oblivion because even um
they<00:05:56.990> kind<00:05:57.259> of<00:05:57.319> like<00:05:57.500> super<00:05:58.250> dumbed<00:05:58.490> it<00:05:58.610> down

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
they kind of like super dumbed it down

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.579 
they kind of like super dumbed it down
when<00:05:59.120> they<00:05:59.240> did<00:05:59.419> fall<00:05:59.719> out<00:05:59.930> which<00:06:00.199> is<00:06:00.229> on<00:06:00.500> the

00:06:00.579 --> 00:06:00.589 
when they did fall out which is on the

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:04.269 
when they did fall out which is on the
same<00:06:00.770> engine<00:06:01.339> as<00:06:01.520> oblivion<00:06:02.060> but<00:06:02.810> um<00:06:03.039> they<00:06:04.039> just

00:06:04.269 --> 00:06:04.279 
same engine as oblivion but um they just

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:07.929 
same engine as oblivion but um they just
really<00:06:04.819> that<00:06:05.180> was<00:06:05.270> just<00:06:05.449> broken<00:06:06.310> very<00:06:07.310> broken

00:06:07.929 --> 00:06:07.939
