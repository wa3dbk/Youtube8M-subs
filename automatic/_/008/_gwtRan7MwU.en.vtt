00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
them sit in there like this it helps to

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.089 
them sit in there like this it helps to
Center<00:00:23.210> the<00:00:23.509> egg<00:00:23.929> yolk<00:00:24.259> and<00:00:24.560> when<00:00:24.710> you<00:00:24.800> boil

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
them then the egg yolk is in the middle

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.950 
them then the egg yolk is in the middle
when<00:00:28.429> you<00:00:28.490> use<00:00:28.609> some<00:00:28.820> first<00:00:29.150> radish<00:00:29.949> some

another egg out from somewhere else so

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.860 
another egg out from somewhere else so
it'll<00:01:09.680> be<00:01:09.800> interesting<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:10.370> see<00:01:10.490> cuz<00:01:11.480> this<00:01:11.630> egg

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 
it'll be interesting to see cuz this egg

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.960 
it'll be interesting to see cuz this egg
wasn't<00:01:12.410> stored<00:01:13.750> on<00:01:14.750> its<00:01:14.930> side<00:01:15.670> you<00:01:16.670> know<00:01:16.790> like

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
wasn't stored on its side you know like

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.010 
wasn't stored on its side you know like
these<00:01:17.180> were<00:01:18.370> overnight<00:01:19.370> so<00:01:20.000> we'll<00:01:20.540> see<00:01:20.750> if<00:01:20.930> it

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
these were overnight so we'll see if it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.260 
these were overnight so we'll see if it
makes<00:01:21.050> much<00:01:21.470> of<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.800> difference<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.970> I'm<00:01:23.090> going

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
makes much of a difference so I'm going

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.170 
makes much of a difference so I'm going
to<00:01:23.330> poke<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:23.659> holes<00:01:23.900> in<00:01:24.140> here<00:01:27.640> it's<00:01:28.640> simple<00:01:29.060> to

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
to poke the holes in here it's simple to

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.660 
to poke the holes in here it's simple to

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.490 
do if you have a push again and I'm
going<00:01:34.820> to<00:01:34.850> put<00:01:35.240> them<00:01:35.390> in<00:01:35.479> my<00:01:35.630> pot<00:01:35.930> over<00:01:36.260> here
