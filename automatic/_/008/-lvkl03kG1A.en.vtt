swing bowls have always troubled batsman
and<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:24.979> I<00:01:25.069> think<00:01:25.310> at<00:01:25.399> the<00:01:25.490> moment<00:01:25.819> the<00:01:25.910> world

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
and and I think at the moment the world

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.600 
and and I think at the moment the world
is<00:01:26.240> very<00:01:26.479> fortunate<00:01:27.050> to<00:01:27.170> have<00:01:27.200> two<00:01:28.069> excellent

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
is very fortunate to have two excellent

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.999 
is very fortunate to have two excellent
ones<00:01:28.789> to<00:01:29.030> watch<00:01:29.179> in<00:01:29.539> in<00:01:29.899> two<00:01:30.259> nominees<00:01:30.709> there

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009

Dale<00:01:31.399> Steyn<00:01:31.640> finished<00:01:32.060> up<00:01:32.209> winning<00:01:32.539> the<00:01:32.630> award

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:32.959 
Dale Steyn finished up winning the award

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.290 
Dale Steyn finished up winning the award
I'm<00:01:33.649> not<00:01:33.920> sure<00:01:34.190> he's<00:01:34.459> probably<00:01:34.729> a<00:01:35.000> touch

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
I'm not sure he's probably a touch

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.270 
I'm not sure he's probably a touch
better<00:01:35.569> than<00:01:35.750> Jimmy<00:01:35.990> Anderson<00:01:36.259> he<00:01:36.500> he's<00:01:37.250> a

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
better than Jimmy Anderson he he's a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.219 
better than Jimmy Anderson he he's a
touch<00:01:37.580> quicker<00:01:37.910> so<00:01:38.360> if<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.630> can<00:01:38.810> swing<00:01:39.080> the

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
touch quicker so if you can swing the

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.949 
touch quicker so if you can swing the
ball<00:01:39.410> at<00:01:40.009> a<00:01:40.250> slightly<00:01:41.060> quicker<00:01:41.330> pace<00:01:41.690> then<00:01:41.929> I

00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:41.959 
ball at a slightly quicker pace then I

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:43.749 
ball at a slightly quicker pace then I
guess<00:01:42.259> that<00:01:42.289> makes<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:42.770> more<00:01:42.920> dangerous<00:01:43.369> but

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
guess that makes you more dangerous but

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.760 
guess that makes you more dangerous but
we're<00:01:43.910> very<00:01:44.149> fortunate<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.840> have<00:01:44.869> two<00:01:45.229> bowlers

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
we're very fortunate to have two bowlers

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.010 
we're very fortunate to have two bowlers

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
watch and the other thing that that

interests me is you know there's a quote

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.850 
interests me is you know there's a quote
there<00:01:52.849> from<00:01:52.910> Dale<00:01:53.390> Steyn<00:01:53.720> saying<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.739> know

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
there from Dale Steyn saying you know

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.620 
there from Dale Steyn saying you know
when<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.190> pitch<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.610> ball<00:01:55.789> up<00:01:56.000> you<00:01:56.149> might<00:01:56.420> get

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
when you pitch the ball up you might get

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.380 
when you pitch the ball up you might get
driven<00:01:56.929> but<00:01:57.319> that's<00:01:57.619> that's<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.489> the<00:01:59.000> art<00:01:59.209> of

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
driven but that's that's the the art of

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.719 
driven but that's that's the the art of
good<00:01:59.780> swing<00:02:00.050> bowling<00:02:00.289> is<00:02:00.560> -<00:02:00.739> yeah<00:02:01.280> even<00:02:01.489> if<00:02:01.640> you

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
good swing bowling is - yeah even if you

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.609 
good swing bowling is - yeah even if you
get<00:02:01.910> hit<00:02:02.060> for<00:02:02.239> for<00:02:02.450> keep<00:02:02.869> pitching<00:02:03.050> it<00:02:03.319> up<00:02:03.440> and

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
get hit for for keep pitching it up and

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.260 
get hit for for keep pitching it up and
take<00:02:03.860> your<00:02:04.069> chances<00:02:04.429> on<00:02:04.580> getting<00:02:04.910> a<00:02:04.970> batsman

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
take your chances on getting a batsman

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.359 
take your chances on getting a batsman
out<00:02:05.450> and<00:02:05.720> that's<00:02:06.140> why<00:02:06.319> swing<00:02:06.649> bowling<00:02:06.890> is<00:02:07.130> so

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
out and that's why swing bowling is so

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.100 
out and that's why swing bowling is so
important<00:02:07.819> to<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.030> game<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.239> cricket<00:02:08.450> because

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
important to the game of cricket because

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.779 
important to the game of cricket because
it's<00:02:09.289> such<00:02:09.470> an<00:02:09.619> attacking<00:02:09.950> medium<00:02:10.459> the

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
it's such an attacking medium the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.670 
it's such an attacking medium the
batsman<00:02:11.270> might<00:02:11.450> hit<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.660> boundary<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.410> bowler

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
batsman might hit a boundary the bowler

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.770 
batsman might hit a boundary the bowler
might<00:02:12.980> get<00:02:13.190> a<00:02:13.220> wicket<00:02:13.430> nothing<00:02:14.270> can<00:02:14.420> be<00:02:14.540> better

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
might get a wicket nothing can be better

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.570 
might get a wicket nothing can be better
for<00:02:14.989> the<00:02:15.080> fans<00:02:15.319> I<00:02:15.620> would<00:02:15.830> do<00:02:16.010> number<00:02:16.310> three

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
for the fans I would do number three

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.030 
for the fans I would do number three
yeah<00:02:16.849> well<00:02:17.180> if<00:02:17.299> you<00:02:17.390> know<00:02:17.599> that<00:02:17.840> if<00:02:18.409> a<00:02:18.560> fastball

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
yeah well if you know that if a fastball

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.020 
yeah well if you know that if a fastball
comes<00:02:19.280> straight<00:02:19.610> it's<00:02:19.909> not<00:02:20.000> as

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
comes straight it's not as

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.809 
comes straight it's not as
as<00:02:21.390> difficult<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.200> counter<00:02:22.620> as<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:23.520> ball<00:02:23.670> that

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
as difficult to counter as the ball that

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.840 
as difficult to counter as the ball that
moves<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.240> fast<00:02:25.140> bowling<00:02:25.500> with<00:02:26.160> swing<00:02:26.640> is

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
moves and fast bowling with swing is

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.300 
moves and fast bowling with swing is

what make stains light a light swing to

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.970

Anderson and now Stein light and also
the<00:02:33.870> fact<00:02:34.110> that<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.590> South<00:02:34.800> Africa

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
the fact that in a South Africa

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.250 
the fact that in a South Africa
generally<00:02:35.459> have<00:02:35.790> had<00:02:35.970> Seema's<00:02:36.780> who<00:02:36.959> would<00:02:37.110> hit

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
generally have had Seema's who would hit

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.440 
generally have had Seema's who would hit
the<00:02:37.440> deck<00:02:37.590> yes<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.730> know<00:02:38.850> do<00:02:39.420> the

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
the deck yes and you know do the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.660 
the deck yes and you know do the
clinical<00:02:39.840> stuff<00:02:40.290> outside<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.650> off<00:02:40.860> stop<00:02:41.069> so

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
clinical stuff outside the off stop so

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.640 
clinical stuff outside the off stop so
when<00:02:41.850> I<00:02:41.880> watched<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.390> lane<00:02:42.720> he<00:02:42.959> doesn't<00:02:43.530> look

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
when I watched a lane he doesn't look

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.890 
when I watched a lane he doesn't look
South<00:02:43.890> African<00:02:44.340> he<00:02:44.489> looks<00:02:44.880> to<00:02:45.270> me<00:02:45.300> more<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:45.750> a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
South African he looks to me more like a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.930 
South African he looks to me more like a
Pakistani<00:02:46.470> bowler<00:02:46.739> bowling<00:02:47.190> on<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.489> flat

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
Pakistani bowler bowling on the flat

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.510 
Pakistani bowler bowling on the flat
Indian<00:02:48.690> or<00:02:48.810> Pakistani<00:02:48.930> pitches<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.770> that<00:02:49.830> is

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
Indian or Pakistani pitches and that is

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.949 
Indian or Pakistani pitches and that is
what<00:02:50.760> you<00:02:51.030> know<00:02:51.150> actually<00:02:51.540> gets<00:02:51.780> this

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
what you know actually gets this

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.840 
what you know actually gets this
performance<00:02:52.470> rated<00:02:52.770> so<00:02:52.950> high<00:02:53.130> because<00:02:53.370> the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
performance rated so high because the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.940 
performance rated so high because the
surface<00:02:54.300> was<00:02:54.750> a<00:02:54.780> typical<00:02:55.200> Indian<00:02:55.380> pitch<00:02:55.680> I

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
surface was a typical Indian pitch I

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.920 
surface was a typical Indian pitch I
don't<00:02:56.640> think<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:56.880> was<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.030> first<00:02:57.330> day<00:02:57.480> morning

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
don't think it was a first day morning

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.240 
don't think it was a first day morning
where<00:02:58.140> there<00:02:58.260> was<00:02:58.350> something<00:02:58.680> for<00:02:58.769> Dale<00:02:58.950> Steyn

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
where there was something for Dale Steyn

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.340 
where there was something for Dale Steyn
and<00:02:59.489> that<00:02:59.970> spell<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.390> five<00:03:00.600> wickets<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:01.170> there

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
and that spell of five wickets and there

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.660 
and that spell of five wickets and there
were<00:03:01.440> a<00:03:01.470> couple<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.800> batsmen<00:03:02.100> there<00:03:02.400> who

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
were a couple of batsmen there who

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.390 
were a couple of batsmen there who
clearly<00:03:03.450> were<00:03:03.989> not<00:03:04.050> in<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.410> same<00:03:04.590> league<00:03:04.800> and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
clearly were not in the same league and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.740 
clearly were not in the same league and
started<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:05.940> innings<00:03:06.180> as<00:03:06.300> well<00:03:06.510> they<00:03:06.660> were

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
started the innings as well they were

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.440 
started the innings as well they were
beaten<00:03:07.050> by<00:03:07.170> pace<00:03:07.440> and<00:03:07.650> swing<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.580> the<00:03:09.209> length

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
beaten by pace and swing and the length

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.330 
beaten by pace and swing and the length
is<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.870> most<00:03:10.080> appealing<00:03:10.530> part<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:11.100> his

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
is the most appealing part of his

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.160 
is the most appealing part of his
bowling<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:11.910> I<00:03:12.150> think<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.780> reason

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
bowling and I think that is the reason

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.720 
bowling and I think that is the reason
why<00:03:13.500> is<00:03:13.560> able<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:13.950> get<00:03:14.100> wickets<00:03:14.400> of<00:03:14.519> those

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
why is able to get wickets of those

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.040 
why is able to get wickets of those
kinds<00:03:15.090> because<00:03:15.300> then<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.540> take<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.840> pitch

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
kinds because then you take the pitch

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:18.470 
kinds because then you take the pitch
out<00:03:16.350> of<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.620> equation<00:03:17.130> which<00:03:17.640> Pakistanis<00:03:18.330> do

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
out of the equation which Pakistanis do

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.120 
out of the equation which Pakistanis do
wonderfully<00:03:19.080> because<00:03:19.350> they<00:03:19.440> have<00:03:19.650> no<00:03:19.830> choice

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
wonderfully because they have no choice

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.100 
wonderfully because they have no choice
but<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.430> do<00:03:20.640> that<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.030> Dale's<00:03:21.540> saying<00:03:21.840> it's

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
but to do that and Dale's saying it's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.449 
but to do that and Dale's saying it's
quite<00:03:22.319> amazing<00:03:22.620> for<00:03:22.830> somebody<00:03:23.220> who<00:03:23.280> comes

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
quite amazing for somebody who comes

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.699 
quite amazing for somebody who comes
from<00:03:23.580> South<00:03:23.819> Africa<00:03:24.330> is<00:03:24.569> able<00:03:25.260> to<00:03:25.380> bowl<00:03:25.530> like

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
from South Africa is able to bowl like

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:26.990 
from South Africa is able to bowl like
this<00:03:25.739> he<00:03:26.070> doesn't<00:03:26.370> he<00:03:26.430> doesn't<00:03:26.459> boil<00:03:26.850> the

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
this he doesn't he doesn't boil the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.640 
this he doesn't he doesn't boil the
inswinger<00:03:27.450> much<00:03:27.630> just<00:03:27.900> get<00:03:28.049> reversed<00:03:28.290> later

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
inswinger much just get reversed later

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.410 
inswinger much just get reversed later
on<00:03:28.860> but<00:03:29.010> he's<00:03:29.130> predominantly<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.910> out<00:03:30.060> swing

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
on but he's predominantly the out swing

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.270 
on but he's predominantly the out swing
bowler<00:03:30.600> where<00:03:31.170> do<00:03:31.320> you<00:03:31.410> read<00:03:31.650> him<00:03:31.890> you've<00:03:32.250> seen

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
bowler where do you read him you've seen

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.890 
bowler where do you read him you've seen

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
a lot of fast bowlers to swing the ball

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.140 
a lot of fast bowlers to swing the ball
over<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.320> years<00:03:34.560> but<00:03:35.250> is<00:03:35.459> he<00:03:35.700> up<00:03:35.820> there<00:03:36.030> in

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
over the years but is he up there in

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.620 
over the years but is he up there in

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
your book

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.319 
your book
oh<00:03:36.660> yeah<00:03:37.200> he's<00:03:37.380> up<00:03:37.980> there<00:03:38.130> I<00:03:38.370> mean<00:03:38.610> because<00:03:39.030> he

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
oh yeah he's up there I mean because he

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.090 
oh yeah he's up there I mean because he
can<00:03:39.450> he<00:03:39.900> seems<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.470> be<00:03:40.560> able<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.769> swing<00:03:40.980> it

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
can he seems to be able to swing it

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.789 
can he seems to be able to swing it
pretty<00:03:41.310> consistently<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:43.200> at<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.350> good

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
pretty consistently and and at a good

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.620 
pretty consistently and and at a good
pace<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:44.489> know<00:03:44.579> that<00:03:45.060> makes<00:03:45.299> him<00:03:45.480> difficult

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
pace you know that makes him difficult

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.680 
pace you know that makes him difficult
as<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.320> say<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:46.620> think<00:03:46.829> at<00:03:47.220> the<00:03:47.340> moment<00:03:47.370> it's<00:03:48.239> sort

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
as I say I think at the moment it's sort

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.410 
as I say I think at the moment it's sort
of<00:03:48.799> nose<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:50.010> nose<00:03:50.160> with<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:50.850> Jimmy<00:03:51.120> Anderson

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
of nose to nose with the Jimmy Anderson

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.150 
of nose to nose with the Jimmy Anderson
and<00:03:51.750> Dowell<00:03:51.930> stone<00:03:52.200> as<00:03:52.350> to<00:03:52.500> who<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.799> the<00:03:52.950> best

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
and Dowell stone as to who is the best

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.160 
and Dowell stone as to who is the best
when<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.760> ball<00:03:53.940> swing<00:03:54.269> those<00:03:54.600> two<00:03:54.900> are

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
when the ball swing those two are

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.430 
when the ball swing those two are
standout<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:55.799> I<00:03:55.859> think<00:03:55.940> Mohammad<00:03:56.940> Asif<00:03:57.440> but

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
standout so I think Mohammad Asif but

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.440 
standout so I think Mohammad Asif but
he's<00:03:58.799> not<00:03:58.980> quite<00:03:59.190> as<00:03:59.370> quick<00:03:59.549> as<00:03:59.760> those<00:03:59.970> two<00:04:00.239> and

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
he's not quite as quick as those two and

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.690 
he's not quite as quick as those two and
you<00:04:00.989> know<00:04:01.109> sadly<00:04:01.709> he's<00:04:02.070> probably<00:04:02.370> ruled

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
you know sadly he's probably ruled

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.069 
you know sadly he's probably ruled
himself<00:04:03.060> out<00:04:03.209> or<00:04:03.239> hopefully<00:04:03.750> he's<00:04:03.870> ruled

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
himself out or hopefully he's ruled

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.180 
himself out or hopefully he's ruled
himself<00:04:04.410> out<00:04:04.560> of<00:04:04.590> cricket<00:04:05.060> forevermore<00:04:06.060> but

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
himself out of cricket forevermore but

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.090 
himself out of cricket forevermore but
you<00:04:08.190> know<00:04:08.310> those<00:04:08.880> two<00:04:09.180> guys<00:04:09.390> I<00:04:09.450> think<00:04:10.100> it's

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
you know those two guys I think it's

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.990 
you know those two guys I think it's
very<00:04:11.370> difficult<00:04:11.700> to<00:04:11.820> separate<00:04:12.180> them<00:04:12.359> I<00:04:14.000> mean

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
very difficult to separate them I mean

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.330 
very difficult to separate them I mean
the<00:04:15.090> rankings<00:04:15.810> say<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.019> but<00:04:16.709> this<00:04:16.859> is<00:04:16.919> a<00:04:17.070> jury

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
the rankings say so but this is a jury

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.979 
the rankings say so but this is a jury
decision<00:04:17.910> so<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.329> a<00:04:18.419> more<00:04:18.539> qualitative

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
decision so it's a more qualitative

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.020 
decision so it's a more qualitative
decision<00:04:19.470> yeah<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:19.859> think<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.220> it<00:04:20.400> slightly<00:04:20.669> one

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
decision yeah I think is it slightly one

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.060 
decision yeah I think is it slightly one
not<00:04:21.239> higher<00:04:21.810> than<00:04:21.840> Jimmy<00:04:22.500> Anderson<00:04:22.740> and

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
not higher than Jimmy Anderson and

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.920 
not higher than Jimmy Anderson and
because<00:04:23.550> he<00:04:23.729> swings<00:04:24.030> the<00:04:24.090> ball<00:04:24.270> at<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.660> pace

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
because he swings the ball at that pace

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.590 
because he swings the ball at that pace
and<00:04:25.169> maybe<00:04:26.130> in<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.340> 70s<00:04:26.490> and<00:04:26.880> 80s<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.240> batsman

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
and maybe in the 70s and 80s the batsman

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.969 
and maybe in the 70s and 80s the batsman
would<00:04:27.690> have<00:04:27.810> played<00:04:28.140> him<00:04:28.260> differently<00:04:28.770> but

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
would have played him differently but

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.890 
would have played him differently but
now<00:04:29.190> with<00:04:29.490> most<00:04:29.760> batsmen<00:04:30.180> looking<00:04:30.450> to<00:04:30.570> plant

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
now with most batsmen looking to plant

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.120 
now with most batsmen looking to plant
the<00:04:31.020> front<00:04:31.260> foot<00:04:31.409> down<00:04:31.530> and<00:04:31.770> hit<00:04:31.919> through<00:04:32.099> the

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
the front foot down and hit through the

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.010 
the front foot down and hit through the
line<00:04:32.400> he<00:04:32.550> becomes<00:04:32.880> even<00:04:33.030> more<00:04:33.180> dangerous<00:04:33.720> so

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
line he becomes even more dangerous so

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.730 
line he becomes even more dangerous so
yes

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
yes
