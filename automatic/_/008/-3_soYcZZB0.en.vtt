origami but and I didn't actually learn

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.479 
origami but and I didn't actually learn
this<00:00:33.570> one<00:00:33.690> from<00:00:33.930> my<00:00:34.050> origami<00:00:34.379> teacher<00:00:35.010> I

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
this one from my origami teacher I

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.329 
this one from my origami teacher I
learned<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.360> from<00:00:37.100> kids<00:00:38.100> in<00:00:38.519> school<00:00:39.120> but

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:40.339 
learned it from kids in school but

learned it from kids in school but
nonetheless<00:00:41.339> it<00:00:42.000> could<00:00:42.239> technically

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
nonetheless it could technically

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.140 
nonetheless it could technically
qualifies<00:00:43.290> origami<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.879> another

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
qualifies origami but this is another

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.310 
qualifies origami but this is another
piece<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.600> starts<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> square

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
piece that starts with a square

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.360 
piece that starts with a square
eight-and-a-half<00:00:49.320> by<00:00:49.530> eleven<00:00:49.980> piece<00:00:50.159> of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
eight-and-a-half by eleven piece of

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.280 
eight-and-a-half by eleven piece of
paper<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:53.269> yeah<00:00:54.269> and<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.629> works<00:00:54.780> best<00:00:55.080> with

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
paper and yeah and it works best with

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.420 
paper and yeah and it works best with
these<00:00:55.500> because<00:00:55.650> there's<00:00:55.890> got<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.159> a<00:00:56.250> little

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
these because there's got to be a little

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.479 
these because there's got to be a little
bit<00:00:56.640> durable<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:58.080> happens<00:00:58.470> as<00:00:58.769> you<00:00:59.339> do

regular printer paper and what you're
going<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.990> do<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.350> fold<00:01:34.620> it<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.890> half

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
going to do is fold it in half

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:43.999 
going to do is fold it in half
lengthwise<00:01:35.940> so<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.260> long<00:01:37.500> rectangle

fold it to that tip right there matching

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.210 
fold it to that tip right there matching
up<00:03:05.590> good<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:07.209> since<00:03:07.569> this<00:03:07.750> is<00:03:07.959> such<00:03:08.200> a<00:03:08.230> you

up good and since this is such a you
know<00:03:09.370> it's<00:03:09.659> not<00:03:10.659> real<00:03:11.019> critical<00:03:11.650> on<00:03:11.829> this<00:03:12.040> one

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
know it's not real critical on this one

know it's not real critical on this one
it's<00:03:12.459> more<00:03:12.670> about<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.299> fun<00:03:13.480> of<00:03:13.689> popping<00:03:14.200> it

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
it's more about the fun of popping it

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.849 
it's more about the fun of popping it
rather<00:03:14.680> than<00:03:15.120> how<00:03:16.120> neat<00:03:16.659> and<00:03:16.959> cool<00:03:17.379> it<00:03:17.590> looks

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
rather than how neat and cool it looks

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.059 
rather than how neat and cool it looks
so<00:03:18.219> I<00:03:18.900> can't<00:03:19.900> say<00:03:20.139> that<00:03:20.349> the<00:03:20.470> folds<00:03:20.799> are<00:03:20.920> all

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
so I can't say that the folds are all

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.550 
so I can't say that the folds are all
that<00:03:21.250> critical<00:03:21.519> on<00:03:21.760> this<00:03:21.790> but<00:03:22.260> for<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.349> sake

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
that critical on this but for the sake

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.920 
that critical on this but for the sake
of<00:03:23.590> good<00:03:23.889> practice<00:03:24.400> make<00:03:24.760> make<00:03:25.299> it<00:03:25.480> as<00:03:25.629> good

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
of good practice make make it as good

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.479 
of good practice make make it as good
looking<00:03:26.079> as<00:03:26.290> you<00:03:26.409> can<00:03:26.590> so<00:03:26.739> we<00:03:26.859> just<00:03:26.980> fold<00:03:27.189> it<00:03:27.310> in

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
looking as you can so we just fold it in

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:28.710 
looking as you can so we just fold it in
half<00:03:27.519> like<00:03:27.879> that<00:03:27.939> okay

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
half like that okay

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.319 
half like that okay
now<00:03:29.439> we've<00:03:29.739> already<00:03:29.950> got<00:03:30.189> a<00:03:30.220> crease<00:03:31.060> right

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
now we've already got a crease right

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.890 
now we've already got a crease right
here<00:03:31.389> or<00:03:31.959> fold<00:03:32.290> I'll<00:03:33.159> lift<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.579> up<00:03:33.790> kind<00:03:34.720> of

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
here or fold I'll lift it up kind of

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.500 
here or fold I'll lift it up kind of
make<00:03:35.769> sure<00:03:35.799> we<00:03:36.099> got<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> fold<00:03:36.549> all<00:03:36.669> the<00:03:36.700> way<00:03:36.790> now

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
make sure we got a fold all the way now

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.670 
make sure we got a fold all the way now
we're<00:03:37.720> gonna<00:03:37.810> do<00:03:38.019> another<00:03:38.200> one<00:03:38.349> of<00:03:38.470> those

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
we're gonna do another one of those

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.670 
we're gonna do another one of those
opening<00:03:39.579> folds<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.169> the<00:03:41.260> third<00:03:41.470> time

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
opening folds this is the third time

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.780 
opening folds this is the third time
we've<00:03:41.829> done<00:03:41.859> this<00:03:42.189> so<00:03:42.400> you<00:03:42.459> should<00:03:42.669> be<00:03:42.760> a

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
we've done this so you should be a

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.420 
we've done this so you should be a
master<00:03:43.359> at<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.510> by<00:03:43.750> now<00:03:43.930> okay<00:03:44.680> but<00:03:45.069> make<00:03:45.400> sure

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
master at it by now okay but make sure

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.909 
master at it by now okay but make sure
it<00:03:45.639> goes<00:03:45.760> all<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.030> way<00:03:46.150> up<00:03:46.389> in<00:03:46.569> there<00:03:46.810> and<00:03:47.799> all

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:47.919 
it goes all the way up in there and all

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.699 
it goes all the way up in there and all
we're<00:03:48.099> going<00:03:48.250> to<00:03:48.400> do<00:03:48.549> just<00:03:49.200> take<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:50.409> and

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
we're going to do just take this and

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.580 
we're going to do just take this and
squish<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.250> down<00:03:51.959> see<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:53.109> fold<00:03:53.379> right<00:03:53.560> there

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
squish it down see that fold right there

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.990 
squish it down see that fold right there
let's<00:03:53.949> make<00:03:54.129> sure<00:03:54.159> that<00:03:54.459> it<00:03:54.579> lines<00:03:54.760> up<00:03:57.000> make

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
let's make sure that it lines up make

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.319 
let's make sure that it lines up make
sure<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.329> opens<00:03:58.750> all<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:58.989> way<00:03:59.109> to<00:03:59.229> the<00:03:59.409> top<00:04:00.329> and

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:01.329 
sure it opens all the way to the top and

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.089 
sure it opens all the way to the top and
let's<00:04:02.290> finish<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:02.829> fold<00:04:04.319> all<00:04:05.319> right<00:04:05.560> see

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
let's finish that fold all right see

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.080 
let's finish that fold all right see
that<00:04:06.310> all<00:04:07.150> we<00:04:07.359> did<00:04:07.569> was<00:04:07.840> open<00:04:08.169> it<00:04:08.470> up<00:04:08.620> and

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
that all we did was open it up and

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.140 
that all we did was open it up and
squish<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.120> down<00:04:11.099> now<00:04:12.099> flip<00:04:12.669> it<00:04:12.790> over<00:04:12.909> and

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.930 
together
make<00:04:44.800> sure<00:04:44.949> it<00:04:45.039> opens<00:04:45.370> all<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.520> way<00:04:45.639> to<00:04:45.759> the

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
make sure it opens all the way to the

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:54.159 
make sure it opens all the way to the
top<00:04:46.150> and<00:04:47.490> squish<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.669> down

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.629 

there<00:04:55.169> we<00:04:55.380> go<00:04:56.030> really<00:04:57.030> pretty<00:04:57.330> easy

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
there we go really pretty easy

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.879 
there we go really pretty easy
perfectly<00:04:59.639> fun<00:05:00.060> thing<00:05:00.510> all<00:05:01.320> right<00:05:01.440> we<00:05:01.680> almost

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
perfectly fun thing all right we almost

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.650 
perfectly fun thing all right we almost
got<00:05:02.100> our<00:05:02.250> popper<00:05:02.669> these<00:05:03.030> little<00:05:03.419> thingies

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
got our popper these little thingies

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.659 
got our popper these little thingies
here<00:05:04.020> this<00:05:04.470> is<00:05:04.620> your<00:05:04.800> handle<00:05:05.220> this<00:05:05.340> is<00:05:05.490> what

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
here this is your handle this is what

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.159 
here this is your handle this is what
you<00:05:05.760> hold<00:05:06.000> on<00:05:06.210> to<00:05:06.510> when<00:05:07.080> you're<00:05:07.550> popping<00:05:08.550> away

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
you hold on to when you're popping away

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.710 
you hold on to when you're popping away
so<00:05:10.169> at<00:05:10.620> this<00:05:11.130> point<00:05:11.370> all<00:05:11.639> I'm<00:05:11.729> going<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.090> do<00:05:12.270> is

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
so at this point all I'm going to do is

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.560 
so at this point all I'm going to do is
fold<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.290> in<00:05:13.530> half<00:05:13.820> it<00:05:14.820> doesn't<00:05:15.210> matter<00:05:15.360> which

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
fold it in half it doesn't matter which

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.030 
fold it in half it doesn't matter which
way<00:05:15.720> you<00:05:15.780> fold<00:05:16.080> it<00:05:16.260> because<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.590> popper<00:05:17.010> has

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 
way you fold it because the popper has

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.870 
way you fold it because the popper has
two<00:05:17.669> good<00:05:17.910> sides<00:05:18.240> so<00:05:19.020> if<00:05:19.320> I<00:05:19.500> fold<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.979> this<00:05:20.490> way

more the paper works into it and the

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:05.750 
more the paper works into it and the
more<00:06:04.200> paper<00:06:04.590> the<00:06:04.830> more<00:06:04.979> the<00:06:05.100> paper<00:06:05.310> bends

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760

more paper the more the paper bends
around<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:06.510> again<00:06:06.900> gets<00:06:07.169> moving<00:06:07.650> the<00:06:08.340> better

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
around and again gets moving the better

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:11.240 
around and again gets moving the better
the<00:06:08.789> popper<00:06:09.180> will<00:06:09.389> work<00:06:09.620> but<00:06:10.620> that's<00:06:10.830> that's

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.250 
the popper will work but that's that's

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.070 
the popper will work but that's that's
basically<00:06:11.460> what's<00:06:11.789> gonna<00:06:11.910> happen<00:06:12.030> as<00:06:12.510> you<00:06:12.840> do

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
basically what's gonna happen as you do

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.900 
basically what's gonna happen as you do
this<00:06:13.260> motion<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:13.830> air<00:06:14.070> is<00:06:14.250> going<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.580> catch<00:06:14.880> it

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
this motion the air is going to catch it

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.050 
this motion the air is going to catch it
and<00:06:15.419> like<00:06:16.200> a<00:06:16.229> parachute<00:06:16.889> opening<00:06:17.340> that<00:06:17.550> pops

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
and like a parachute opening that pops

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.850 
and like a parachute opening that pops
open<00:06:18.270> and<00:06:18.660> the<00:06:19.260> paper

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
open and the paper

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.300 
open and the paper
claps<00:06:20.280> together<00:06:20.729> and<00:06:21.229> makes<00:06:22.229> a<00:06:22.500> popping

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
claps together and makes a popping

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.510 
claps together and makes a popping
clapping<00:06:24.180> sound<00:06:24.800> okay<00:06:25.800> so<00:06:25.860> it's<00:06:26.190> that<00:06:26.310> motion

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 
clapping sound okay so it's that motion

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.620 
clapping sound okay so it's that motion
right<00:06:26.789> there<00:06:28.940> so<00:06:29.940> we<00:06:30.090> had<00:06:30.240> it<00:06:30.330> right<00:06:30.389> there

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
right there so we had it right there

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.589 
right there so we had it right there
fold<00:06:31.200> it<00:06:31.380> in<00:06:31.620> half<00:06:31.680> and<00:06:32.099> the<00:06:32.520> inside<00:06:33.060> part<00:06:33.090> is

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
fold it in half and the inside part is

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:42.850 
fold it in half and the inside part is
what's<00:06:33.840> going<00:06:34.080> to<00:06:34.169> fold<00:06:34.440> out

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.919
