00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.050
 dance 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.660
 you do not deserve 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.770
 s 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.770
 to the garden 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.820
 no no 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.140
 all right 

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:08.960
 division 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.960
 for me 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.580
 to me 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.090
 h 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.659
 the reason for d 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.229
 portico 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.229
 Hello 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.650
 in time 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.650
 there is a time 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.400
 They have worked 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.090
 but no 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.430
 for 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.530
 when all the attacks 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.530
 or 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.330
 and the sea 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.239
 Y 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.840
 I say 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.840
 time 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.099
 ah 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.900
 in my life is another song from the road show 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.310
 from lennon mccartney those who know a 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.170
 little and distinguish well that this is a 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.810
 typical song of John Legend was 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.500
 confused I do not and then it starts with 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.040
 a riff that he would come to do by playing alone 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.040
 the notes 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.430
 so that between the first and second 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.430
 starting the second 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.270
 well so that it does not sound so bland I'll 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.180
 I strum, we start with the accord 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.460
 of sun me what are you crazy like that with two 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.710
 fingers nothing more with this touch the fifth and 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:12.630
 left her speechless in the fifth would not form 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.459
 part of the sun and ripped until the second 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.820
 after the first of santaquin to try 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.820
 fret 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.940
 you see that in the end like the chord of 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.920
 seventh re 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.590
 well that riff that you see that repeats 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.050
 several times throughout the song 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:41.450
 the chords are not many and they are easy 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.450
 to see the sun 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:51.810
 re major and minor its seventh or greater evil 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:01.210
 C minor 26 cause this is much greater 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:03.920
 what would it mean this this greater or 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:05.690
 would be lower 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.110
 I know we have put a position on the 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.110
 that 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.950
 your bow 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.790
 or from least to most 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:48.690
 it's a dance show my youngest 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.850
 german in the seventh although I prefer in 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.280
 this time tread here in the third in 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.530
 the first rope 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.020
 and that layer of sun comes out a lot on the disk 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:05.199
 just have your client 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:09.409
 or so although you can also put it like this 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:12.340
 for the last note that sounds is my 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.340
 like more than that 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.340
 to the 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.240
 you see that those chords that sequence of 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.060
 chords are repeating all the 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.300
 song and at the end there is a riff when 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.300
 He says 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.170
 do less to the same 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.180
 this is what we have always done and 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.180
 now we add 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.800
 sometimes 

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.210
 raise 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.210
 from the first 

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:53.819
 well it's a nice song good as 

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:56.789
 my daughters do not want to help me anymore 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:58.649
 do the choirs and they have left themselves 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:00.479
 now it's my turn to play the songs that 

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:02.909
 Some double- bearded voice 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:06.119
 I have to record it first with 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:08.789
 the computer and add it here with a 

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:10.770
 team when they want to help me 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:13.369
 well, your work 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.369
 until next time
