00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.290
 currently mode is not an abo model 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.960
 pursue but similar to guild wars 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:55.540
 2 as a full price without monthly 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.070
 Subscription fees appear like the mmo 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.239
 shooter ultimately beats and how 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.460

 tv series with the shooter in 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.770
 should be connected to certain points 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.390
 who in the recently released 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.950
 pulls the pages of a good 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.230
 functioning traffic network is not 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.660

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.310

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.440
 throw motion 2 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.330
 the strategy game of paradox 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.160
 interactive leaves it to you 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.140

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.180
 a big city plan and the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.860
 Residents on the fastest way from a 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.140
 to transport to b 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.910
 who does not want to build that alone 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.920
 with a colleague a common 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.420
 erect road network or optional 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.420
 compete against each other 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.260
 in justice the gods remains among us 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.060
 no stone lying on the other 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.789
 all superheroes as well 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.160
 super villains of the dc universe 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.500
 itself , however, as spanking the jack in 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.170
 the hand and dug themselves on the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.060
 according to the developer, it should be next to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.440
 the beatings for several hours 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.780
 between sequences 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.910
 and who succeeds in the story mode 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.920
 has ended may then over 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.770
 the most different stage is fighting 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.100
 and over all sorts 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.880
 interaction possibilities with the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.880
 surroundings look forward 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.069
 on 23 april the bizarre appears 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.050
 survival adventure donzdorf and leaves 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.120
 thus the beta in the player 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.280
 already with the scientist mÃ¼lsen 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.140
 should get used similarly to 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.060
 minecraft was already in the title 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.970

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.070
 developer klei entertainment in two 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.959
 be divided into modes 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.180
 so can the players for the story 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.160
 mode or for a free 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.110
 game decide how it ultimately 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:17.000
 picture of long-term motivation look 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.000
 will have to show, however, still 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.120
 In terms of long-term motivation should be 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.709
 capcoms dragon's dogma there circle well 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.750
