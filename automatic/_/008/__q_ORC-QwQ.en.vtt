00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
little sock in there but to protect the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.680 
little sock in there but to protect the
fuel<00:00:46.230> canister<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.850> don't<00:00:48.239> fits<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:48.660> that

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
fuel canister and it don't fits on that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:57.110 
fuel canister and it don't fits on that
fairly<00:00:49.140> nice<00:00:54.379> but<00:00:55.379> this<00:00:55.949> thing<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.340> pretty

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
fairly nice but this thing is pretty

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.319 
fairly nice but this thing is pretty
tiny<00:00:57.449> I<00:00:57.600> fold<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> up<00:00:58.789> you<00:00:59.789> know<00:00:59.910> I<00:00:59.940> don't<00:01:00.300> like

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
tiny I fold it up you know I don't like

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.170 
tiny I fold it up you know I don't like
cross<00:01:00.660> lacing<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.230> cuz<00:01:01.379> it's<00:01:01.500> hard<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.800> open<00:01:02.180> so

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
cross lacing it cuz it's hard to open so

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.870 
cross lacing it cuz it's hard to open so
I<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.300> fold<00:01:04.260> two<00:01:04.530> in<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.220> then<00:01:05.580> fold<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
I just fold two in and then fold the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.280 
I just fold two in and then fold the
other<00:01:05.970> two<00:01:06.210> against<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.869> still<00:01:07.080> fits

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
other two against it and it still fits

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:17.950 
other two against it and it still fits
in<00:01:07.560> fairly<00:01:08.010> fairly<00:01:08.520> easy

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.960 

I<00:01:18.049> just<00:01:18.620> put<00:01:18.799> a<00:01:18.830> sock<00:01:19.100> around<00:01:19.159> the<00:01:19.490> canister

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
I just put a sock around the canister

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.109 
I just put a sock around the canister
just<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.270> protect<00:01:20.690> the<00:01:21.500> pan<00:01:22.040> and<00:01:22.970> on<00:01:23.030> the

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
just to protect the pan and on the

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:24.370 
just to protect the pan and on the
bottom<00:01:23.360> of<00:01:23.420> that<00:01:23.540> I<00:01:23.600> just<00:01:23.869> stick<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:24.229> little

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
bottom of that I just stick the little

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.680 
bottom of that I just stick the little
pot<00:01:24.650> grabber<00:01:24.979> it's<00:01:25.670> kind<00:01:25.850> of<00:01:25.880> an<00:01:26.000> empty<00:01:26.210> dead

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
pot grabber it's kind of an empty dead

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.530 
pot grabber it's kind of an empty dead
spot<00:01:27.020> there<00:01:27.350> it's<00:01:28.340> magnetic<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:28.909> it<00:01:29.090> sticks<00:01:29.360> to

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
spot there it's magnetic so it sticks to

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.540 
spot there it's magnetic so it sticks to
the<00:01:29.659> pot<00:01:30.440> there<00:01:30.770> that's<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.130> little<00:01:31.190> empty

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
the pot there that's a little empty

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:41.109 
the pot there that's a little empty
space<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:32.030> works<00:01:32.210> out<00:01:32.390> well<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.990> packing<00:01:40.119> some

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
space it works out well the packing some

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:42.580 
space it works out well the packing some
people<00:01:41.300> have<00:01:41.420> had<00:01:41.570> problems<00:01:42.110> with<00:01:42.320> this

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
people have had problems with this

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.219 
people have had problems with this
packing<00:01:43.100> down<00:01:43.310> with<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.700> valve<00:01:44.000> open<00:01:44.960> my

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
packing down with the valve open my

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.960 
packing down with the valve open my
closures<00:01:46.930> when<00:01:47.930> it's<00:01:48.080> closed<00:01:48.470> it<00:01:49.280> actually<00:01:49.670> is

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
closures when it's closed it actually is

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.600 
closures when it's closed it actually is
pretty<00:01:50.300> well<00:01:50.630> straight<00:01:51.440> up<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:51.800> down<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.520> it

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
pretty well straight up and down so it

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.010 
pretty well straight up and down so it
worked<00:01:52.759> out<00:01:52.910> pretty<00:01:53.119> well<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:53.390> it<00:01:53.690> can<00:01:53.810> be<00:01:53.990> a

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
worked out pretty well so it can be a

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.790 
worked out pretty well so it can be a
little<00:01:54.140> open<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:57.470> fold<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.860> up<00:01:59.619> but<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:00.679> just

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
little open to fold it up but you just

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.109 
little open to fold it up but you just
got<00:02:00.920> to<00:02:00.950> remember<00:02:01.190> when<00:02:01.460> you<00:02:01.520> take<00:02:01.700> this<00:02:01.820> out

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
got to remember when you take this out

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.540 
got to remember when you take this out
to<00:02:02.509> close<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.869> down<00:02:03.080> before<00:02:03.860> you<00:02:04.130> screw<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.460> on

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
to close it down before you screw it on

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:13.180 
to close it down before you screw it on
this<00:02:04.670> industry<00:02:05.330> I<00:02:11.380> don't<00:02:12.380> have<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.590> tripod<00:02:12.890> so

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
this industry I don't have a tripod so

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.280 
this industry I don't have a tripod so
this<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:14.239> bent<00:02:14.450> down<00:02:14.630> with<00:02:14.780> an<00:02:14.870> iTouch<00:02:15.080> so<00:02:20.290> I'll

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
this is bent down with an iTouch so I'll

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:30.820 
this is bent down with an iTouch so I'll
just<00:02:21.560> read<00:02:21.830> on<00:02:22.040> like<00:02:22.250> that

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.130 

it<00:02:31.830> says<00:02:32.070> on<00:02:32.250> doozies<00:02:32.730> gigapower<00:02:33.240> canisters<00:02:33.930> I

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
it says on doozies gigapower canisters I

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.100 
it says on doozies gigapower canisters I
think<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.710> can<00:02:34.920> use<00:02:35.130> any<00:02:36.090> Coleman's<00:02:36.690> work<00:02:36.900> as

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
think you can use any Coleman's work as

00:02:37.110 --> 00:03:13.160 
think you can use any Coleman's work as
well<00:02:37.350> but<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.190> haven't<00:02:38.400> tried<00:02:38.580> any<00:02:38.850> others

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.100 

it<00:03:14.170> seems<00:03:14.379> to<00:03:14.500> go<00:03:15.150> this<00:03:16.150> seems<00:03:16.390> to<00:03:16.510> go<00:03:16.629> pretty

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
it seems to go this seems to go pretty

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.960 
it seems to go this seems to go pretty
it<00:03:17.440> seems<00:03:17.980> like<00:03:18.159> it<00:03:18.280> would<00:03:18.340> simmer<00:03:18.730> pretty

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
it seems like it would simmer pretty

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.520 
it seems like it would simmer pretty
well<00:03:19.180> never<00:03:19.510> really<00:03:19.720> tested<00:03:19.959> that<00:03:20.200> out<00:03:20.349> too

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
well never really tested that out too

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.630 
well never really tested that out too
much<00:03:21.810> of<00:03:22.810> course<00:03:23.080> you<00:03:23.470> know<00:03:23.590> with<00:03:23.739> wind<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.459> may

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
much of course you know with wind it may

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:32.339 
much of course you know with wind it may
change<00:03:25.030> quite<00:03:25.299> a<00:03:25.360> bit<00:03:25.569> I<00:03:31.170> was<00:03:32.170> debating

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:32.349 
change quite a bit I was debating

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.890 
change quite a bit I was debating
between<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:33.069> and<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.400> pocket<00:03:33.790> rocket

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
between this and the pocket rocket

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.690 
between this and the pocket rocket
you<00:03:35.260> know<00:03:35.379> the<00:03:35.500> flame<00:03:35.739> pattern<00:03:36.160> on<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.430> seems

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
you know the flame pattern on this seems

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.720 
you know the flame pattern on this seems
to<00:03:36.790> be<00:03:36.819> pretty<00:03:37.180> wide<00:03:37.480> oh<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:39.250> may<00:03:39.400> even<00:03:39.579> be<00:03:39.640> a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
to be pretty wide oh it may even be a

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.880 
to be pretty wide oh it may even be a
little<00:03:39.790> wide<00:03:40.150> for<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:40.930> minimalist<00:03:41.409> the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
little wide for the minimalist the

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.199 
little wide for the minimalist the
pocket<00:03:42.250> rocket<00:03:42.340> may<00:03:42.670> work<00:03:42.849> out<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.060> little

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
pocket rocket may work out a little

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.350 
pocket rocket may work out a little
better<00:03:47.069> but<00:03:48.069> for<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.310> most<00:03:48.459> part<00:03:48.819> I<00:03:49.150> think

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
better but for the most part I think

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.940 
better but for the most part I think
either<00:03:49.690> ones<00:03:49.959> fine<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.440> reason<00:03:50.650> why<00:03:50.739> I<00:03:50.769> got

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
either ones fine the reason why I got

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.349 
either ones fine the reason why I got
this<00:03:51.129> one<00:03:51.370> it<00:03:51.459> just<00:03:51.489> packs<00:03:51.849> up<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.150> little

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
this one it just packs up a little

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.160 
this one it just packs up a little
smaller<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.959> can<00:03:53.019> fit<00:03:53.290> everything<00:03:53.560> in<00:03:54.220> to<00:03:54.849> the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
smaller you can fit everything in to the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.390 
smaller you can fit everything in to the
into<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.200> pot<00:03:56.470> itself<00:03:58.530> other<00:03:59.530> than<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.739> it

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
into the pot itself other than that it

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.190 
into the pot itself other than that it
seems<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.819> work<00:04:01.180> out<00:04:01.329> pretty<00:04:01.540> well<00:04:01.690> I've<00:04:02.049> only

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200

tested<00:04:02.410> indoor-outdoor<00:04:03.310> a<00:04:03.340> couple<00:04:03.670> times

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940

I<00:04:06.629> haven't<00:04:07.629> purchased<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:08.019> yet<00:04:08.170> but<00:04:08.349> I

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:08.379 
I haven't purchased it yet but I

I haven't purchased it yet but I
probably<00:04:08.650> will<00:04:09.040> seems<00:04:09.730> like<00:04:09.910> light<00:04:10.150> wind
