mean<00:01:41.079> bean<00:01:41.259> it's<00:01:41.439> just<00:01:41.649> so<00:01:41.859> fast<00:01:42.189> and<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:42.640> loose

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
mean bean it's just so fast and so loose

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.609 
mean bean it's just so fast and so loose
it's<00:01:43.149> almost<00:01:43.390> like<00:01:43.569> it<00:01:43.840> doesn't<00:01:44.170> pivot<00:01:44.530> off

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
it's almost like it doesn't pivot off

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.289 
it's almost like it doesn't pivot off
the<00:01:44.799> front<00:01:44.979> of<00:01:45.219> back<00:01:45.460> of<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.700> board<00:01:45.909> but<00:01:46.119> more

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
the front of back of the board but more

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.940 
the front of back of the board but more
kind<00:01:46.810> of<00:01:46.869> laterally<00:01:47.380> through<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.679> center<00:01:47.890> of

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
kind of laterally through the center of

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.289 
kind of laterally through the center of
it<00:01:48.039> so<00:01:48.189> you're<00:01:48.310> taking<00:01:48.579> off<00:01:48.670> on<00:01:48.819> a<00:01:48.850> wave<00:01:49.060> and

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
it so you're taking off on a wave and

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.330 
it so you're taking off on a wave and
you<00:01:50.140> know<00:01:50.229> go<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.409> do<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:50.619> turn<00:01:50.890> and<00:01:51.069> it<00:01:51.189> just

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
you know go to do a turn and it just

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.590 
you know go to do a turn and it just
feels<00:01:51.549> like<00:01:51.670> you<00:01:51.999> know<00:01:52.030> you<00:01:52.149> can<00:01:52.329> kind<00:01:52.539> of

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
feels like you know you can kind of

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.359 
feels like you know you can kind of
pivot<00:01:52.899> the<00:01:52.990> board<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.799> know<00:01:53.889> any<00:01:54.069> way<00:01:54.219> you'd

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
pivot the board you know any way you'd

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.809 
pivot the board you know any way you'd
like<00:01:54.399> really<00:01:55.210> fun<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:55.659> fast<00:01:55.840> them<00:01:56.109> and<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:57.490> a

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
like really fun and fast them and and a

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.760 
like really fun and fast them and and a
great<00:01:58.119> you<00:01:58.420> know<00:01:58.450> kind<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.840> feeling<00:01:59.200> in<00:01:59.679> the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
great you know kind of feeling in the

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.620 
great you know kind of feeling in the
water<00:01:59.950> when<00:02:00.159> it's<00:02:00.280> small<00:02:00.520> and<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:01.450> want<00:02:01.569> to

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
water when it's small and you want to

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.989 
water when it's small and you want to
have<00:02:01.749> a<00:02:01.780> bit<00:02:01.929> of<00:02:01.960> excitement<00:02:02.289> so<00:02:03.100> in<00:02:03.670> order<00:02:03.850> to

have a bit of excitement so in order to
achieve<00:02:04.179> that<00:02:04.569> you<00:02:05.530> can<00:02:05.679> see<00:02:05.859> that<00:02:05.889> he's<00:02:06.159> got

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
achieve that you can see that he's got

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.770 
achieve that you can see that he's got
this<00:02:06.429> very<00:02:06.670> kind<00:02:06.939> of<00:02:07.030> wide<00:02:07.209> I'll<00:02:07.539> blong

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
this very kind of wide I'll blong

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.749 
this very kind of wide I'll blong
outlines<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:08.380> it's<00:02:08.500> you<00:02:08.590> know<00:02:08.709> very<00:02:08.920> much<00:02:09.160> kind

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
outlines so it's you know very much kind

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.550 
outlines so it's you know very much kind
of<00:02:09.819> an<00:02:09.940> elliptical<00:02:10.360> outline<00:02:10.750> with<00:02:11.230> a<00:02:11.260> lot<00:02:11.470> of

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
of an elliptical outline with a lot of

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.440 
of an elliptical outline with a lot of
width<00:02:11.709> running<00:02:12.040> through<00:02:12.220> the<00:02:12.310> nose<00:02:12.490> wide<00:02:13.270> all

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
width running through the nose wide all

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.880 
width running through the nose wide all
the<00:02:13.540> way<00:02:13.630> through<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.870> center<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.800> know

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
the way through the center and you know

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.260 
the way through the center and you know
why<00:02:15.190> they're<00:02:15.400> kind<00:02:15.580> of<00:02:15.640> round<00:02:15.850> tailed<00:02:16.120> the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
why they're kind of round tailed the

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.270 
why they're kind of round tailed the
back<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.750> he's<00:02:17.560> carried<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:17.980> foam

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
back and he's carried the foam

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.860 
back and he's carried the foam
throughout<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.880> board<00:02:19.120> so<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.510> got<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.690> lot

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
throughout the board so it's got a lot

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.810 
throughout the board so it's got a lot
of<00:02:19.900> foil<00:02:20.260> it's<00:02:20.740> got<00:02:20.890> kind<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.160> fuller<00:02:21.490> rails

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
of foil it's got kind of fuller rails

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.860 
of foil it's got kind of fuller rails
but<00:02:22.420> not<00:02:22.570> full

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
but not full

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.930 
but not full
rails<00:02:23.110> they're<00:02:23.860> still<00:02:24.190> kind<00:02:24.519> of<00:02:24.549> refined

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
rails they're still kind of refined

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.369 
rails they're still kind of refined
enough<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.390> again<00:02:25.629> you<00:02:25.720> feel<00:02:25.930> looking<00:02:26.019> turn

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
enough that again you feel looking turn

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.140 
enough that again you feel looking turn
the<00:02:26.530> board<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:27.250> it's<00:02:27.400> very<00:02:27.430> flat<00:02:27.819> from

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
the board and then it's very flat from

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.699 
the board and then it's very flat from
you<00:02:28.330> know<00:02:28.420> tip<00:02:28.629> to<00:02:28.780> tail<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.200> very<00:02:29.560> little

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
you know tip to tail so very little

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.190 
you know tip to tail so very little
rocker<00:02:30.250> so<00:02:30.580> again<00:02:31.150> directionally<00:02:31.750> very<00:02:31.989> much

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
rocker so again directionally very much

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.289 
rocker so again directionally very much
a<00:02:32.230> small<00:02:32.620> way<00:02:32.769> forward<00:02:33.159> now<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.730> thing<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.269> I

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
a small way forward now the thing that I

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.539 
a small way forward now the thing that I
think<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.989> dynamic<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.830> gives<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.370> that

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
think the dynamic that gives that that

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.130 
think the dynamic that gives that that
very<00:02:36.849> kind<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.209> loose<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.780> know<00:02:37.870> kind<00:02:38.080> of

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
very kind of loose you know kind of

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.160 
very kind of loose you know kind of
catchy<00:02:38.760> feeling<00:02:39.760> is<00:02:39.879> what<00:02:40.569> he's<00:02:40.690> done<00:02:40.930> with

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
catchy feeling is what he's done with

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.110 
catchy feeling is what he's done with
this<00:02:41.290> very<00:02:41.620> deep<00:02:41.950> double<00:02:42.280> concave<00:02:42.489> so<00:02:42.909> you<00:02:43.000> can

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
this very deep double concave so you can

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.759 
this very deep double concave so you can
see<00:02:43.390> it's<00:02:43.870> got<00:02:43.959> a<00:02:44.019> single<00:02:44.349> through<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.620> front

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
see it's got a single through the front

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.920 
see it's got a single through the front
then<00:02:45.250> this<00:02:45.430> comes<00:02:45.579> out<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:45.849> this<00:02:46.239> very<00:02:46.510> kind<00:02:46.870> of

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
then this comes out to this very kind of

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.500 
then this comes out to this very kind of
pronounced<00:02:47.430> concave<00:02:48.430> through<00:02:48.640> the<00:02:48.730> back<00:02:48.879> and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
pronounced concave through the back and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.180 
pronounced concave through the back and
it<00:02:49.599> almost<00:02:49.720> feels<00:02:50.049> like<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.709> know<00:02:50.739> goes<00:02:51.040> from

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
it almost feels like you know goes from

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.940 
it almost feels like you know goes from
rail<00:02:51.489> rolled<00:02:52.030> into<00:02:52.329> that<00:02:52.540> concave<00:02:53.260> their<00:02:53.530> hump

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
rail rolled into that concave their hump

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.410 
rail rolled into that concave their hump
through<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.370> center<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.030> string<00:02:55.239> or<00:02:55.329> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
through the center and the string or the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.670 
through the center and the string or the
board<00:02:55.599> and<00:02:55.690> then<00:02:55.780> humps<00:02:56.049> back<00:02:56.200> out<00:02:56.349> like<00:02:56.530> that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
board and then humps back out like that

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.009 
board and then humps back out like that
so<00:02:56.980> really<00:02:57.760> kind<00:02:58.030> of<00:02:58.060> define<00:02:58.420> channels

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
so really kind of define channels

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.690 
so really kind of define channels
running<00:02:59.650> along<00:02:59.890> the<00:02:59.920> length<00:03:00.310> of<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.459> board

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
running along the length of the board

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.580 
running along the length of the board
out<00:03:00.849> through<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.150> tail<00:03:01.359> and<00:03:01.629> I<00:03:02.140> think<00:03:02.379> that

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
out through the tail and I think that

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.440 
out through the tail and I think that
again<00:03:02.829> gives<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.430> kind<00:03:03.609> of<00:03:03.670> in<00:03:03.849> a<00:03:03.879> really<00:03:04.239> fun

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
again gives that kind of in a really fun
