00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello together the mario of the music fair 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.240
 tv i have the overdrive effect here 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.130
 pedal green mile from the micro series of the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:19.410
 Chinese manufacturer Moore and that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:20.699
 Let's take a closer look 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.039
 Floor Trainer is not even halfway like that 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.529
 Big as a bus pedal effect and holds 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.619
 in its aluminum injection-molded housing 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.090
 all controls and connections ready 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.610
 only on a battery compartment had due 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.829
 the size be waived 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.559
 We have two plastic jack socket 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.180
 right input left output at the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.690
 the front side is the 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.719
 network connection was the overdrive regulator 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.760
 in normal size the tone and 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.719
 level controls were much smaller 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.280
 dimensioned continues to be the pedal 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.820
 a footswitch with associated 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.230
 Status LED donated additionally became 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.480
 the effect box with a toggle switch 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.710
 equipped with the one between two 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.880
 modes warm and hott can select 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.500
 so that the floor does not slip away 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.220
 was the bottom with foam rubber 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.560
 Provided 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.090
 the green mile has three controllers 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.990
 The level control can be the volume 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.270
 to adjust 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.390
 the tone controller takes over the sound color 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.299
 and with the overdrive controller 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.710
 one the distortions grad 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:26.159
 with the green mile can warm 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.390
 natural and creamy of the sounds with 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.290
 the dynamics of a classic 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.909
 tube amplifier can be generated 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.350
 you choose with the toggle switch warmuth 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.659
 you get a warm, homogeneous sound 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.060
 you play the green mile in hot mode 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.399
 the remedies are raised what the 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.700
 considerably increases the pressure and the 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:51.750
 Transparency increases and how that sounds 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.850
 Let's take a look at it now 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.890
 green mile i have the warm fashion 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.290
 set with the tone and level controls 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.090
 I am at 3 o'clock and with the overdrive 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.250
 I am in the starting position 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.549
 at memc i have the clean channel 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.549
 adjusted 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.880
 and now switches the climate to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.790
 I'm going with the overdrive at 12 o'clock now 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.280
 completely overdriven 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:02.030
 so that was the was courageous look at you times 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.030
 to go to the hot mode 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.710
 you become something you have to 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.710
 go back with the volume 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.500
 so I'm still in the hot 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:43.910
 Mode as I said with the level regulator 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.910
 you can adjust the volume 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.500
 with the sound carrier you can the 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.910
 Determine sound color 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.910
 I'll go to the starting position 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.960
 two ideas 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.030
 3 o'clock position 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.110
 sound carrier fully turned on yes so can 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.470
 everyone gets their personal sound 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:24.210
 put together with the green mile that 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.770
 cream is also very good at 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.970
 easy on strained ems even more 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.130
 get out of distortion 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:41.640
 I can show that for a moment 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:45.110
 at my quandt sound has selected 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.110
 now the green mile in hot mode 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.120
 much more distortion and pressure yes 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.890
 So my tip not only place 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.870
 but also wants to save money looks 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.000
 make sure you have that green mile on 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.050
 I think it's the character of the company 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.300
 his role models 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.300
 that was it from me mio
