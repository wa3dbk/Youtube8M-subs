00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.370

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.040
 applications and today I do not call you here 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.690
 today it's me again I did not leave 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.630
 You and I came here today to tell you 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.520
 You guys about wwdc 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.109
 for those who do not know the wwdc conference 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.840
 Apple's annual developer and 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.060
 in it they usually launch the news 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.230
 software update 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.840
 noting that it is not yet available 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.340
 also on the site there date and even when I 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.590
 I'm making this video, I do not know yet. 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.090
 site information then do this 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.530
 video here to talk a little to you guys 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.239
 about what was said there if you did not 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.399
 got to watch wwdc 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.379
 So I brought the information here to 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.570
 You're the most important one you had there. 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.239
 reminding them that they were launching 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.270
 the mec 10.10 that will interact enough 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.670
 with his s now and there were some 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.610
 design changes but the most important 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.410
 will be to interactions with 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.079
 everything you're doing if scp goes 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.579
 write an email you can simply 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.109
 keep doing the computer 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.059
 but I'll talk here about the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.739
 west first and one of the things well 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.380
 legal is that now in the notifications 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.570
 those that appear at the top of the screen 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.979
 You can interact with them. 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.420
 she will appear for example received the 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.549
 message as you can see in the image 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.530
 you can simply click to 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.360
 to answer for him even so has 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.860
 Stop what you're doing and that's it. 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.479
 for many other things like 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.790
 example you can come to events 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.280
 you receive an invitation you can 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.770
 simply reject or accept there 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.659
 even works as well as for example 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.490
 facebook if you can come here 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.670
 has been marked and the person was booked in 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.939
 and you can comment or give a 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.320
 like simply there even notifications 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.210
 as you can see from the bottom it is 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.799
 in the music app so you do not 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.450
 have to stop but what are you doing in 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.310
 leave to go to another application something 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.290
 very good another very simple change 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.240
 was here in the management part of 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.070
 applications before here only had part of 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.680
 applications you close managerial that 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.299
 doing now also has people 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.369
 What else do you talk about? 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.130
 then you can just touch them 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.140
 and have a message call or give a 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.640
 facetime dog over there 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.649
 another significant change was in the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.560
 spotlight who does not know the spotlight 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.450
 is the pursuit of iphone or ipad only you 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.680
 slide down there he goes 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.510
 option is displayed . 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.950
 with it you can publish them 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.420
 contents your mobile 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.040
 so if you write something you can 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.170
 search and sort you can search 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.569
 applications that are inside 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.370
 from home and now it goes much further 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.109
 background you can put movies it goes 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.959
 talk the movie in the cinema you can 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:33.060
 put information of places it goes 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.829
 appear information from wikipedia and everything 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.989
 more interesting too 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:39.359
 another very meaningful update will 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.359
 to be the keyboard now the keyboard is now 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.189
 smart and will give you tips of what 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.930
 you wanted to write you are 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.419
 writing a message and you will have 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.609
 up there as you can see some 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:52.439
 then write options than the keyboard 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:54.239
 smart because of the context you are going 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:56.370
 writing it goes by suggesting the words 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.260
 next words something very good for the 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.000
 iphone did not have and was very 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.859
 important and already has in the androids there 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.739
 long and quite interesting that 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.250
 they commented is that he changes person 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.379
 for person 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.060
 if you talk in a way with a person 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.340
 for example, at work, do you speak? 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.260
 but formally with the work person 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.239
 he will suggest more formal words 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.129
 he realizes that with this person who 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.669
 a friend if you talk more usually 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:23.190
 he will suggest more usual words and the 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.349
 important is also that this new 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.879
 update already come in Portuguese as 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.930
 You can see the flag of Brazil in 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.329
 third place 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.400
 here we can also see the integration of 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.319
 your gadgets as you can see there 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.010
 we have an iphone that is open on 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.079
 fish 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.449
 he is writing a document and in the 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.340
 ipad will show there when they are 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:43.620
 connected on the same network it will show 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.459
 on the lock screen itself the option of 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.560
 pages 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.790
 so you'll just play there and 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.139
 will continue what you were 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.209
 typing on your iphone if you 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.579
 continue on your ipad this works 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.109
 also on your mac also something else 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.669
 very cool is that this integration 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.870
 also works with phone calls and 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.359
 messages then if you are receiving 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.069
 a phone call from your iphone iphone 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.439
 is in the other room was using the 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:06.150
 ipad in the living room 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.590
 You'll see that someone's calling you. 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.720
 Are you going to get it now? 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.479
 phone call by ipad 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.799
 mst also several changes now have 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.629
 voice message if you can see that you 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.479
 click the right button it will have the 

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:20.400
 microphone and you can cancel or send 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.349
 message and this also works. 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.760
 for videos and can record videos and 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.380
 send messages 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.970
 there have also been some updates to 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.710
 chat 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.990
 the group does not emerge that they are well 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.550
 these authorizations of the 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.260
 'master' are really cool because they will 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.240
 appear on the screen as you can see the 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.950
 person to receive a voice message and 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.200
 simply lifting the cellphone 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.420
 Taking it to your ear it will ring 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.090
 will play the audio you received 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.740
 and you can respond to it yourself 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.750
 sending the Christmas message she 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.760
 blocked something interesting does not need 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.280
 more open the application to respond 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.590
 it would be interesting to see this in the nickname zap 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.510
 but we do not know how long 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.770
 take that for something else to happen 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.870
 very cool they brought you too 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.460
 icloud authorizations now is cl√°udio 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.050
 will have repositories so it gets very 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.530
 Easier to manage your documents 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.540
 of px notes knot photos and images all 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.340
 will now be super synchronized if 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.350
 you will have access to it from any 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.970
 Where are you going to have everyone now? 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.330
 all the documents in the cloud 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.250
 your iphone and ipad mac and windows all 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.190
 synchronized something very interesting and 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.680
 which caused a lot of difficulty 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.320
 previously a novelty now from scratch 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.470
 same will be the health part they will 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.930
 have health applications and the health kit 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.700
 that will be the health kit you will have 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.140
 a place you will manage all the 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.030
 health applications 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.740
 so if you have applications that 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.530
 monitor your sleep your calorie 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.930
 heart rate he will manage 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.640
 all in one place and will be well 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.820
 interesting that we can not see yet 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:53.210
 in Brazil so early but he will manage 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:55.640
 synchronize with some hospitals. 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.680
 and some health plans then you go 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.169
 able to be monitoring their health and 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.150
 if something very strange happens for 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.580
 example a heart beat that is very 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.650
 of the standard it will send this to your 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.660
 doctor and your doctor will know and 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:10.010
 will contact you of course 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.780
 that we can see that this is very cool 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.010
 but we do not know how long it will take to 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.680
 get to that in brazil 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.240
 a novelty, the family will also be the 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.100
 film ch√©ri that will be the 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.960
 family sharing if you have 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.370
 you have an account for your child gives 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.050
 his wife and can have a 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.390
 family sharing your family 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.740
 can have up to six people in it already 

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:29.750
 can share all your 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.590
 content purchased from music movies and 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:32.810
 shows 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.849
 then you will now have a unique place 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.650
 to divide up into the whole family 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:38.900
 so you do not have to keep trading 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.270
 bills if you bought 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.550
 movie on an account your brother is 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.800
 marked as your family will also have 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.720
 access to this film and last to speak 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:50.060
 a bit of history the story goes 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:52.250
 also change a little now you can buy 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.830
 packet of applications coming out cheaper 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:56.780
 they all buy something individually 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:58.699
 very interesting and also not now 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:01.280
 predicted from applications you can place 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:03.740
 video reviews something that made a lot 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.940
 missing because it starts can see 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:07.340
 really as the app works 

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.199
 then today's video pro guys is it 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.060
 it was a very simple and very small video 

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:12.289
 here more or less talking about what 

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.360
 It was spoken there. 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:16.430
 more information you have on the website of the 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.949
 soon you will have everything there is 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.960
 site more information and each time will 

00:07:18.949 --> 00:07:22.039
 appearing more news than it will in the 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.830
 s 8 

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.870
 still do not have the date but we already have the 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.490
 information about which devices it 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.349
 will be available as you can see 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:33.380
 here in the video 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:35.479
 so this is we get around here that 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:39.340
 You found it in the comments. 

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:39.340
