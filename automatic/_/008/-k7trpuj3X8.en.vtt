00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:39.990 
too much make sure I don't need to
adjust<00:02:37.590> we're<00:02:38.590> still<00:02:38.829> at<00:02:38.920> like<00:02:39.010> 360<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.819> that's

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
adjust we're still at like 360 so that's

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.500 
adjust we're still at like 360 so that's
good

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
good

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.539 
good
and<00:02:40.959> they<00:02:41.650> shouldn't<00:02:41.920> take<00:02:42.010> more<00:02:42.250> than<00:02:42.370> two

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
and they shouldn't take more than two

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.130 
and they shouldn't take more than two
minutes<00:02:42.579> that's<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.150> key<00:02:43.329> to<00:02:43.599> not<00:02:43.629> ending<00:02:44.019> up

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
minutes that's the key to not ending up

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.410 
minutes that's the key to not ending up
with<00:02:44.260> tough<00:02:44.590> chewy<00:02:45.010> calamari<00:02:45.609> like<00:02:45.909> so<00:02:46.209> often

sec<00:03:58.169> ok<00:03:59.169> so<00:03:59.590> these<00:04:00.400> really<00:04:00.819> don't<00:04:01.030> need

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
sec ok so these really don't need

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.180 
sec ok so these really don't need
anything<00:04:01.389> but<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.989> little<00:04:02.169> bit<00:04:02.409> of<00:04:02.530> lemon<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:03.129> I

serve<00:04:04.959> them<00:04:05.109> just<00:04:05.470> let<00:04:05.560> them<00:04:05.650> cool<00:04:05.769> off<00:04:05.829> for<00:04:06.069> a
