the PCB in the battery compartment in

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.939 
the PCB in the battery compartment in
case<00:00:54.030> that's<00:00:54.210> lifted<00:00:54.629> out<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.050> make<00:00:55.739> sure

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
case that's lifted out and make sure

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.400 
case that's lifted out and make sure
that<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.430> two<00:00:56.579> plastic<00:00:56.820> lenses<00:00:57.360> are<00:00:58.020> still<00:00:58.289> in

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that the two plastic lenses are still in

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.430 
that the two plastic lenses are still in
position<00:00:59.480> we<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.629> now<00:01:00.750> put<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:00.989> two<00:01:01.170> halves

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
position we can now put the two halves

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.110 
position we can now put the two halves
of<00:01:01.620> short<00:01:01.890> flap<00:01:02.100> back<00:01:02.280> together<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.940> make

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
of short flap back together but make

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.240 
of short flap back together but make
sure<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.329> these<00:01:03.690> antenna<00:01:04.229> wires<00:01:04.500> are<00:01:05.189> not

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
sure that these antenna wires are not

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.670 
sure that these antenna wires are not
trapped<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.810> place<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.229> unit<00:01:07.500> back

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
trapped as you place the unit back

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.789 
trapped as you place the unit back
together<00:01:11.869> so<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.020> halves<00:01:13.470> should<00:01:13.710> be

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
together so the two halves should be

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.910 
together so the two halves should be
lined<00:01:14.100> up<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:15.150> above<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.540> other<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.960> then

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
lined up one above the other and then

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.460 
lined up one above the other and then
gently<00:01:17.280> lowered<00:01:17.729> down<00:01:18.049> this<00:01:19.049> ensures<00:01:19.439> that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
gently lowered down this ensures that

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.450 
gently lowered down this ensures that
the<00:01:19.799> spring<00:01:20.189> on<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.540> catch<00:01:22.250> goes<00:01:23.250> together

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
the spring on the catch goes together

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.350 
the spring on the catch goes together
properly<00:01:24.860> now<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:25.920> can<00:01:26.220> screw<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.939> two<00:01:27.090> halves

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
properly now we can screw the two halves

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.780 
properly now we can screw the two halves
back<00:01:27.600> together<00:01:27.750> with<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.680> four<00:01:29.040> Phillips

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
back together with the four Phillips

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:41.130 
back together with the four Phillips
screws

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.290 

and<00:01:41.680> now<00:01:41.800> we<00:01:41.860> just<00:01:42.100> want<00:01:42.370> to<00:01:42.460> test<00:01:42.700> that<00:01:43.180> the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
and now we just want to test that the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.880 
and now we just want to test that the
door<00:01:43.710> swings<00:01:44.710> okay<00:01:45.160> and<00:01:46.440> that<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.530> catch<00:01:47.710> and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
door swings okay and that the catch and

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.070 
door swings okay and that the catch and
spring<00:01:48.010> are<00:01:48.280> working<00:01:48.610> correctly<00:01:48.820> so<00:01:49.390> push<00:01:49.900> the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
spring are working correctly so push the

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.460 
spring are working correctly so push the
door<00:01:50.230> back<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.700> push<00:01:52.630> down<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.020> catch<00:01:53.230> with

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
door back and push down the catch with

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.610 
door back and push down the catch with
your<00:01:53.560> finger<00:01:53.980> and<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.880> should<00:01:55.090> pop<00:01:55.300> back<00:01:55.510> up

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:55.620 
your finger and you should pop back up

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.740 
your finger and you should pop back up
under<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.710> pressure<00:01:56.950> from<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.280> spring<00:01:57.750> if

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
under the pressure from the spring if

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.480 
under the pressure from the spring if
that<00:01:58.960> is<00:01:59.320> not<00:01:59.530> the<00:01:59.650> case<00:01:59.800> then<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.280> will<00:02:00.370> need

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
that is not the case then you will need

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.340 
that is not the case then you will need
to<00:02:00.550> take<00:02:00.760> the<00:02:00.940> unit<00:02:01.210> apart<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.960> repeat<00:02:02.260> the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
to take the unit apart and repeat the

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.730 
to take the unit apart and repeat the
process<00:02:03.150> and<00:02:04.150> last<00:02:04.360> of<00:02:04.540> all<00:02:04.630> place<00:02:05.590> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
process and last of all place the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.710 
process and last of all place the
battery<00:02:06.010> door<00:02:06.160> back<00:02:06.370> in<00:02:06.580> and<00:02:06.790> you're<00:02:07.390> ready<00:02:07.570> to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
battery door back in and you're ready to

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.500 
battery door back in and you're ready to
reinstall<00:02:07.900> shortly
