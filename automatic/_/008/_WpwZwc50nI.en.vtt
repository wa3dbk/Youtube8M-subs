00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:14.929
 rich and exquisite marinated tenderloin and 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.850
 ingredients are 3 kilos of loin me 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.510
 they gave it long and I broke it in half 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:25.010
 because I do not fit in my fret everything 2 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:29.480
 tablespoons of 6 peppers 6 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:35.270
 nails a hairline of cinnamon and a pinch 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:39.500
 of cumin 250 grams of chile ancho 1 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.680
 liter of orange juice see this is my 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.680
 chile ancho I'm going to remove the tail 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.010
 we open it 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.670
 and we are going to remove the seeds to all 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.489
 our peppers so it's clean and 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.789
 we are going to cook it with water 10 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.939
 minutes to be sewn so that it 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:09.520
 put soft on what our 

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:13.179
 chile are cooking we are going to 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:17.350
 to seal our loin a little bit of 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:20.909
 butter or oil what they have but with 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.909
 butter is much better 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:29.060
 we are going to seal our back 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:33.320
 we follow our back because the loin 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:37.910
 it is more the drier than the leg and if not 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:43.070
 we seal it remain drier still 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:46.370
 then so so in this cube 5 of 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.160
 golden alert my back on one side and what 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.070
 I'm going to put the other side 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.220
 see how pretty red does not cook 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.310
 It smells delicious and that's how we're going to 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.110
 make our loin see is already sealed 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.390
 my loin 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.630
 stamping means that we already gave it to you 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.540
 the turn in the pan we pass to 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.850
 our fret and we're going to seal our 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.980
 another piece because remember that they 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.860
 I said splitting it is because I was 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.130
 very large and could not fit in bunk beds 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.400
 then we will put it to seal and already 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.680
 my piece of loin is golden now 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.260
