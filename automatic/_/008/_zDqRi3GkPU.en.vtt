hey<00:00:02.350> my<00:00:02.710> name<00:00:02.860> is<00:00:02.889> sage<00:00:03.159> and<00:00:03.460> today<00:00:03.820> I<00:00:03.850> want<00:00:04.030> to

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.090 
hey my name is sage and today I want to

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.550 
hey my name is sage and today I want to
show<00:00:04.210> you<00:00:04.270> how<00:00:04.420> to<00:00:04.480> choose<00:00:04.690> a<00:00:04.750> guitar<00:00:05.110> pick<00:00:05.320> I

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:05.560 
show you how to choose a guitar pick I

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.070 
show you how to choose a guitar pick I
don't<00:00:06.340> really<00:00:06.490> believe<00:00:06.790> that<00:00:07.090> thin<00:00:07.600> picks<00:00:07.870> or

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 
don't really believe that thin picks or

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.780 
don't really believe that thin picks or
light<00:00:08.230> picks<00:00:08.440> are<00:00:08.620> superior<00:00:08.980> to<00:00:09.280> medium<00:00:09.580> picks

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:09.790 
light picks are superior to medium picks

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.459 
light picks are superior to medium picks
or<00:00:09.999> that<00:00:10.150> heavy<00:00:10.299> picks<00:00:10.599> are<00:00:10.780> superior<00:00:11.139> to

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
or that heavy picks are superior to

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.770 
or that heavy picks are superior to
medium<00:00:11.830> I<00:00:12.070> think<00:00:12.820> that<00:00:12.910> each<00:00:13.030> pick<00:00:13.299> has<00:00:13.509> a

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780 
medium I think that each pick has a

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.329 
medium I think that each pick has a
specific<00:00:14.259> purpose<00:00:14.410> and<00:00:14.889> they<00:00:14.980> produce<00:00:15.129> a

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:15.339 
specific purpose and they produce a

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.980 
specific purpose and they produce a
different<00:00:15.549> sound<00:00:15.910> and<00:00:16.209> if<00:00:16.480> you<00:00:16.570> choose<00:00:16.840> the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
different sound and if you choose the

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.570 
different sound and if you choose the
pick<00:00:17.140> that<00:00:17.260> you<00:00:17.380> use<00:00:17.530> based<00:00:17.800> on<00:00:17.980> the<00:00:18.130> specific

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
pick that you use based on the specific

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.070 
pick that you use based on the specific
musical<00:00:18.910> sound<00:00:19.150> that<00:00:19.359> you<00:00:19.449> want<00:00:19.630> to<00:00:19.720> get<00:00:19.840> I

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
musical sound that you want to get I

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.950 
musical sound that you want to get I
would<00:00:20.980> say<00:00:21.250> that<00:00:21.429> in<00:00:21.609> general<00:00:21.910> a<00:00:22.300> heavy<00:00:22.720> pick

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:22.960 
would say that in general a heavy pick

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.150 
would say that in general a heavy pick
has<00:00:23.259> a<00:00:23.789> rounder<00:00:24.789> fuller<00:00:25.240> tone<00:00:25.599> and<00:00:25.960> that<00:00:26.920> the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
has a rounder fuller tone and that the

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.009 
has a rounder fuller tone and that the
light<00:00:27.339> pick<00:00:27.550> has<00:00:27.759> a<00:00:27.789> lighter<00:00:28.240> or<00:00:28.599> a<00:00:28.630> clearer

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
light pick has a lighter or a clearer

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.040 
light pick has a lighter or a clearer
tone<00:00:29.580> for<00:00:30.580> that<00:00:30.669> reason<00:00:31.089> most<00:00:31.539> of<00:00:31.749> the<00:00:31.869> time

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050 
tone for that reason most of the time

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.270 
tone for that reason most of the time
though<00:00:32.290> not<00:00:32.439> all<00:00:32.590> the<00:00:32.740> times<00:00:32.920> it<00:00:33.130> may<00:00:33.220> be

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
though not all the times it may be

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.040 
though not all the times it may be
reason<00:00:33.640> to<00:00:33.730> deviate<00:00:33.910> I<00:00:34.270> would<00:00:34.450> use<00:00:34.570> a<00:00:34.600> heavy

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
reason to deviate I would use a heavy

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.080 
reason to deviate I would use a heavy
pick<00:00:35.320> when<00:00:35.530> playing<00:00:35.829> melodies<00:00:36.250> and<00:00:36.489> I<00:00:37.000> would

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
pick when playing melodies and I would

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.090 
pick when playing melodies and I would
use<00:00:37.180> a<00:00:37.239> thin<00:00:37.329> pick<00:00:37.719> when<00:00:37.870> strumming<00:00:38.170> chords<00:00:38.350> if

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
use a thin pick when strumming chords if

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.130 
use a thin pick when strumming chords if
I<00:00:39.219> was<00:00:39.340> playing<00:00:39.489> musically<00:00:39.940> used<00:00:40.090> both<00:00:40.510> in

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
I was playing musically used both in

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.930 
I was playing musically used both in
combination<00:00:41.800> or<00:00:41.980> moving<00:00:42.550> it<00:00:42.610> back<00:00:42.730> and<00:00:42.760> forth

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
combination or moving it back and forth

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.490 
combination or moving it back and forth
I<00:00:43.239> might<00:00:43.390> use<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.539> medium<00:00:43.899> pick<00:00:44.110> as<00:00:44.289> an

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
I might use a medium pick as an

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.549 
I might use a medium pick as an
all-around<00:00:44.829> compromise<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:47.289> let's<00:00:47.440> just

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
all-around compromise but let's just

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:48.660 
all-around compromise but let's just
test<00:00:47.739> them<00:00:47.859> on<00:00:47.980> here<00:00:48.129> so<00:00:48.250> you<00:00:48.340> can<00:00:48.430> hear<00:00:48.579> them

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
test them on here so you can hear them

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.400 
test them on here so you can hear them
for<00:00:48.820> yourself<00:00:49.149> I'm<00:00:49.840> going<00:00:50.020> to<00:00:50.109> start<00:00:50.289> by

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
for yourself I'm going to start by

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.229 
for yourself I'm going to start by
playing<00:00:50.680> AC<00:00:50.949> major<00:00:51.399> scale<00:00:51.640> with<00:00:51.969> a<00:00:52.000> thin<00:00:52.539> pick

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
playing AC major scale with a thin pick

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.090 
playing AC major scale with a thin pick
it<00:00:55.239> sounds<00:00:55.510> like<00:00:55.600> this<00:00:55.780> I'll<00:00:56.649> play<00:00:56.859> it<00:00:56.949> slowly

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
it sounds like this I'll play it slowly

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:06.970 
it sounds like this I'll play it slowly
so<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:57.519> can<00:00:57.609> hear<00:00:57.760> the<00:00:57.850> tone

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.840 

you

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.830 

now<00:01:13.850> I'm<00:01:13.909> going<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.090> do<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.270> same<00:01:14.420> thing<00:01:14.630> with

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
now I'm going to do the same thing with

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.990 
now I'm going to do the same thing with
a<00:01:15.020> medium<00:01:15.560> pick<00:01:15.740> you're<00:01:16.640> gonna<00:01:16.729> hear<00:01:16.909> it's

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
a medium pick you're gonna hear it's

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:32.520 
a medium pick you're gonna hear it's
gonna<00:01:17.090> be<00:01:17.210> a<00:01:17.240> little<00:01:17.330> more<00:01:17.509> full<00:01:17.899> and<00:01:17.930> sound

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:51.850 

NLA<00:01:33.530> heavy<00:01:34.100> pick<00:01:50.289> so<00:01:51.289> you<00:01:51.319> can<00:01:51.409> see<00:01:51.619> that<00:01:51.799> the

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
NLA heavy pick so you can see that the

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.980 
NLA heavy pick so you can see that the
heavy<00:01:52.039> pick<00:01:52.250> has<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.429> sort<00:01:52.759> of<00:01:52.819> bigger<00:01:53.390> fuller

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
heavy pick has a sort of bigger fuller

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.749 
heavy pick has a sort of bigger fuller
sound<00:01:54.289> and<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:54.679> light<00:01:54.860> pick<00:01:55.069> has<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.310> thinner

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
sound and the light pick has a thinner

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.919 
sound and the light pick has a thinner
or<00:01:56.119> clearer<00:01:56.990> sound<00:01:57.789> let's<00:01:58.789> just<00:01:58.970> do<00:01:59.179> test<00:01:59.780> them

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929 
or clearer sound let's just do test them

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.840 
or clearer sound let's just do test them
back-to-back<00:02:00.140> on<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:00.649> single<00:02:01.009> note<00:02:01.159> so<00:02:01.429> here<00:02:01.670> is

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
back-to-back on a single note so here is

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.300 
back-to-back on a single note so here is
a<00:02:01.880> high<00:02:02.420> e<00:02:04.090> that's<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.299> heavy<00:02:05.479> pick<00:02:06.159> here<00:02:07.159> is

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
a high e that's the heavy pick here is

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.220 
a high e that's the heavy pick here is
the<00:02:07.490> medium<00:02:07.789> pick<00:02:10.480> say<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> little<00:02:11.660> thinner<00:02:11.930> but

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
the medium pick say a little thinner but

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.560 
the medium pick say a little thinner but
maybe<00:02:12.769> a<00:02:12.920> little<00:02:13.250> clearer<00:02:13.519> and<00:02:13.790> here<00:02:14.299> is<00:02:14.420> the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
maybe a little clearer and here is the

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.390 
maybe a little clearer and here is the
thin<00:02:14.720> pick<00:02:17.680> perhaps<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.890> brightest<00:02:19.280> and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
thin pick perhaps the brightest and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.599 
thin pick perhaps the brightest and
clearest<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.880> all<00:02:21.040> now<00:02:22.040> let's<00:02:22.190> check<00:02:22.340> them<00:02:22.519> out

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:22.609 
clearest of all now let's check them out

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.190 
clearest of all now let's check them out
on<00:02:22.850> some<00:02:22.880> chords<00:02:23.450> let's<00:02:23.660> start<00:02:23.870> with<00:02:23.989> a<00:02:24.019> thin

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
on some chords let's start with a thin

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.780 
on some chords let's start with a thin
pick<00:02:24.410> and<00:02:24.620> I'm<00:02:24.680> just<00:02:24.829> going<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.010> play<00:02:25.160> AG<00:02:25.370> major

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
pick and I'm just going to play AG major

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:34.660 
pick and I'm just going to play AG major
chord<00:02:25.940> I'll<00:02:26.630> strum<00:02:26.989> it<00:02:27.109> a<00:02:27.140> few<00:02:27.290> times<00:02:27.470> here

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.900 

you

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.060 

I<00:02:37.080> think<00:02:38.080> that<00:02:38.200> sounds<00:02:38.320> pretty<00:02:38.470> light<00:02:38.830> pretty

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
I think that sounds pretty light pretty

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:52.130 
I think that sounds pretty light pretty
crisp<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.410> medium<00:02:41.710> pick

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.830 

a<00:02:52.730> little<00:02:53.730> foreign<00:02:54.090> sound<00:02:54.360> but<00:02:54.660> perhaps

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
a little foreign sound but perhaps

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.150 
a little foreign sound but perhaps
lacking<00:02:55.380> just<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.740> little<00:02:55.920> bit<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.100> that

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
lacking just a little bit of that

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:06.160 
lacking just a little bit of that
clarity<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:56.970> now<00:02:57.870> here<00:02:58.140> is<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.680> heavy<00:02:58.980> pick<00:02:59.220> a

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.020 

perhaps<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.500> loudest<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.190> heaviest<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.910> all

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
perhaps the loudest and heaviest of all

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.390 
perhaps the loudest and heaviest of all
but<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.840> think<00:03:10.140> it's<00:03:10.290> lacking<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.680> bit<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:11.220> that

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
but I think it's lacking a bit of that

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.630 
but I think it's lacking a bit of that
clarity<00:03:11.790> also<00:03:12.150> of<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.630> thin<00:03:12.900> pick<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.640> think

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
clarity also of the thin pick I think

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.460 
clarity also of the thin pick I think
that<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:15.660> should<00:03:15.780> help<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.050> decide<00:03:16.080> which

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
that that should help you decide which

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.320 
that that should help you decide which
pick<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.800> choose<00:03:17.010> right<00:03:17.430> playing<00:03:17.940> melodies

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
pick to choose right playing melodies

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.820 
pick to choose right playing melodies
maybe<00:03:18.630> you<00:03:18.750> want<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:18.930> use<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.140> heavy<00:03:19.290> pick<00:03:19.500> and

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
maybe you want to use the heavy pick and

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.800 
maybe you want to use the heavy pick and
playing<00:03:20.670> chords<00:03:21.000> maybe<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.360> want<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:21.540> use<00:03:21.600> the

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
playing chords maybe you want to use the

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.199 
playing chords maybe you want to use the
light<00:03:21.959> pick<00:03:22.310> combination<00:03:23.310> both<00:03:23.459> maybe<00:03:23.760> go<00:03:23.970> for

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
light pick combination both maybe go for

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.850 
light pick combination both maybe go for
medium<00:03:24.390> but<00:03:25.170> that<00:03:25.320> doesn't<00:03:25.590> mean<00:03:25.709> there

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
medium but that doesn't mean there

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.080 
medium but that doesn't mean there
aren't<00:03:25.980> situations<00:03:26.520> we're<00:03:26.730> going<00:03:26.850> to<00:03:26.910> do<00:03:26.970> the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
aren't situations we're going to do the

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.760 
aren't situations we're going to do the
opposite<00:03:27.480> maybe<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.170> want<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:28.410> have<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.590> very

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:28.770 
opposite maybe I want to have a very

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.570 
opposite maybe I want to have a very
heavy<00:03:29.070> sound<00:03:29.430> with<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:31.130> maybe<00:03:32.130> it's<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> punk

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
heavy sound with a maybe it's a punk

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:40.370 
heavy sound with a maybe it's a punk
folk<00:03:33.120> song<00:03:33.360> something<00:03:33.690> like<00:03:33.810> that<00:03:39.260> I'm<00:03:40.260> going

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
folk song something like that I'm going

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.870 
folk song something like that I'm going
to<00:03:40.440> go<00:03:40.500> for<00:03:40.650> the<00:03:40.709> heavy<00:03:40.800> pick<00:03:41.100> on<00:03:41.280> the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
to go for the heavy pick on the

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.940 
to go for the heavy pick on the
strumming<00:03:42.630> but<00:03:43.019> maybe<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.260> want<00:03:43.500> a<00:03:43.530> very<00:03:43.709> very

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
strumming but maybe I want a very very

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.520 
strumming but maybe I want a very very
bright<00:03:44.810> articulate<00:03:45.810> sound<00:03:46.050> when<00:03:46.200> I'm<00:03:46.290> playing

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
bright articulate sound when I'm playing

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
to go for the light pick on the melodic

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.670 
to go for the light pick on the melodic
bits<00:03:53.850> but<00:03:54.360> again<00:03:54.540> let<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.930> music<00:03:55.110> dictate

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
bits but again let the music dictate

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.069 
bits but again let the music dictate
which<00:03:55.890> pick<00:03:56.130> you<00:03:56.280> use<00:03:56.519> thin<00:03:57.450> picks<00:03:57.720> give<00:03:57.959> you<00:03:58.049> a

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079
