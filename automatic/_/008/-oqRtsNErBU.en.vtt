00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.720
 jsg paper with a video on the subject 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.480
 Periodization and that's exactly what it's about 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.090
 So the eu principle is my current one 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.099
 periodization schema to was in 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.870
 Recently asked relatively often in 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.390
 the past in the past yes 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.279
 there were also a lot of questions 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.820
 I always said that I was just after 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.900
 train the eu principle and believe it 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.420
 I never explained 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.670
 and for the reason now it's going to be active 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.470
 Definitely time a few words about 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.200
 The eu principle I say to lose 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.020
 So first of all the eu means nothing 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.450
 other than the anti aging playstation 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.120
 Sounds complicated and sounds like 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.610
 a lot of is extremely flexible but many 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.440
 People think in a relatively rigid way 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.430
 state model but as I said it is 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.739
 immensely versatile and even at all 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.250
 not rigid very flexible and for 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.809
 advanced perhaps the best 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.030
 Personalization topic currently what the 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.030
 current science just gives value 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.680
 ie daily op. to rating period 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.380
 station what does it say 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 that says nothing else than that we 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.220
 in a given time unit to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.290
 for example, one week our repetition 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.880
 vary 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.409
 small example for example us 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.189
 Exercise three times a week as legs 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.600
 example 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.430
 and then we would go to the monday 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.590
 Example 15 with the order on 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.180
 wednesday 10 repetitions and on friday 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.860
 Repeat 5 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.509
 the repetitions but not rigid that 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.890
 means theoretically the op 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.590
 do and do 10 86 or 20 10 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.970
 and 1 what admittedly bit 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.880
 extreme in extreme approach is the ps 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.799
 who but absolutely top4 could you 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.290
 also say that you just instead of three 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.329
 blocks two blocks has yes or one 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.790
 just had three blocks but not 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.250
 outweigh days but on ten days that 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.439
 means the first monday you do ten 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.149
 repetitions on friday again and again 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.590
 you practice eight repetitions 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.049
 and you do not do it the next monday 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.340
 ten but six and tell 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.909
 and so on and so on you know what 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.219
 I mean 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.039
 so briefly summarized the op 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.709
 means time in a certain time 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.150
 at an already time interval 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.430
 we vary the repetition altogether 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.250
 simply why should you ever 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.690
 maybe terrorize again 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.190
 Explains especially for 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.530
 advanced are periodization 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.629
 schemas is a pretty important one 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.220
 pretty useful tool to get better 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.310
 to be able to make a profit because you are over 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.290
 more given level next to adapt 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.879
 I can also do a separate video 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.110
 if the interest is there but 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.150
 that will probably be the frame 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.090
 this videos will speak if i tell you 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.500
 Now explain why why why the 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.470
 It's just a kind of 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:46.440
 Periodization and latest studies the 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.970
 just say that is just superior is yes 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.160
 consider, for example, a linear one 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.720
 or blog periodization one could as well 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.849
 Theoretically, I train one 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.890
 whole month with 10 repetitions to 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.470
 for example, take a look at 102 again 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.780
 Water always and I find the second 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.640
 month or the fourth month then with 20 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.500
 Repeats the next few months 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.640
 again with 25 repetitions what also 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.400
 always that we are a kind of 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.690
 visualization no periodization man 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.810
 always train the same, that is to say 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.019
 example always makes for no matter if monday 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.060
 like gaal how often you do not care if 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.810
 first week second week first year 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.849
 second year 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.160
 you always catch the same rap 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.599
 that's just not a priority what 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.500
 also pretty good works for beginners 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.720
 but as soon as you go a bit 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.669
 advanced will be 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.590
 Periodization schemes really a very 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:34.049
 very very useful tool as I said 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.440
 to bring the border forward at the same time 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:39.299
 to continue the process 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.790
 yes, in short, I would say that 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.639
 op has the advantage as I said why 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.859
 For example, compare it to 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.750
 imperium has just done that 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:51.389
 that it probably benefits 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.590
 So, a little bit better is new studies 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.299
 just say that maybe one 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.430
 little more effective than the others 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:59.129
 perry vision types and for the reason 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.359
 I just do the op dÃ©i op is nothing 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.519
 Everyone can be complicated 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.629
 if you are at the very beginning now 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.609
 as I said then I would just 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.919
 maybe on a periodicization 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.250
 renounce 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:10.750
 otherwise you are not 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.940
 I can taste it 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.480
 and the experience with the community 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.550
 divide 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.019
 that 's it with the videos or 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.760
 video fallen and crawled thumbs up 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.829
 commented and your questions otherwise 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.780
 of course, take us in the next video 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.580
 how full and natural before I get it 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.360
 I forget them of course 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.360
 a beautiful day
