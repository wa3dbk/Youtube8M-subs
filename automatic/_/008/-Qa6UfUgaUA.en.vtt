into<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.800> battery<00:00:47.100> room<00:00:47.309> like<00:00:47.550> they've<00:00:47.700> never

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
into the battery room like they've never

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.959 
into the battery room like they've never
had<00:00:48.120> before<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.719> two<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.829> will<00:00:50.070> give<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.610> data
