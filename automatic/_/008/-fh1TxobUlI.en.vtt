00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.420
 this is the aoc 3477 pq 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.160
 it's a really huge 34 inch 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.150
 monitor with a neighbor of a sentence 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.950
 that at 9 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.170
 that runs on a week qhd resolution of 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.460
 3440 by 1440 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.410
 the remember that he really ultra a lot 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.660
 workspace and very crystal clear images 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.369
 can display if you first take a look 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.689
 and we see the material from the monitor 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.210
 that across the board just really 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.609
 very stylishly finished and then side 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.439
 You see that with its metal accents one 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.810
 little aluminum behind and on the base 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.279
 made of the same material and such 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.579
 you can see that the besson is not out of the screen 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.110
 coming 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.750
 but just right on the screen lights up 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.200
 just looks really classy like 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.239
 just said it is a wqhd eps screen and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.410
 remember that there are very nice full clear 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.210
 displays colors 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.430
 and that I am very natural and te 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.260
 look at how it is 78 degrees and on it 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.700
 thing that you from my every position 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.480
 Going fine can see what's on your screen 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.949
 happens 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.719
 it also has a matte coating 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.699
 and remember that you have very little trouble 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.340
 of direct reflections and always going 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.930
 can see perfectly what is on your screen 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.579
 I'll just get there for the ottoman right away 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.780
 to keep track of geertje so you have an idea 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.600
 from how big this monitor is 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.850
 is actual and prints A4 by default 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.340
 put it on the edge, you can see it really 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.380
 just nearly five maybe even 6 times 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.060
 contains the surface of an a4 and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.040
 that just gives him a huge amount 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.299
 space to work 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.060
 he can in all kinds of modes 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.530
 user has a 4 screen split such that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.750
 you can use your image in every possible way 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.430
 classify the use of multiple monitor 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.960
 equal to a yes simulate to the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.740
 find the optimum workspace for you 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.960
 situation 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.700
 of course super handy if you t motors 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.140
 I'm used to that you can still do that 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.790
 Stimulate you so with this 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.890
 engine also just get started right away too 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.110
 the way you are used to he is 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.000
 a srgb q space in 10-bit color depth 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.500
 and that i think he is really ideal 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.810
 is suitable for professional graphic 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.240
 use the connection he has a VGA 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.920
 and DVI and HDMI and display port 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.350
 and remember that he has enough options 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.070
 has other equipment on all your jacket 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.780
 to connect 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.939
 sit on the side of the engine too 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.619
 another 5 usb ports and there is 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.210
 one type b and you also one 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.619
 charge sport where I observed of course 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.030
 connect all kinds of other devices with 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.290
 you can also use your phone for that tarp 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.869
 Charge without turning on your computer at all 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.160
 he is equipped with a vesa 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.819
 100 mt 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.349
 And that means you put it on others 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.209
 wall brackets can connect outside the 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.730
 foot to have that mount so you 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.859
 does not necessarily have to use the foot 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.340
 the motor itself have different positions too 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:19.870
 use 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.099
 of course it can go back and forth but then 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.079
 the foot must be as on the 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.389
 bottom sees the screen itself consider 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:26.889
 front and rear tiltable and you 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.180
 can be adjusted in height by the 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.439
 weighted base 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.049
 remember that the very easy remain standing 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:33.760
 and for the graphic people among us 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.919
 designer can also be used again 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.450
 in portrait mode 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:40.319
 and that is of course very nice for all 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.879
 your vertically oriented files 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.079
 like I said before he is excellent 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:46.739
 suitable for graphic applications 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.250
 and in particular the color 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.189
 oriented graphic applications 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.599
 such as photo editing and video editing 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:54.040
 but with five milliseconds 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.239
 elms 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.069
 also suitable for the graphic 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.629
 oriented gamer but maybe not 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.969
 for the hardcore gamers who are really on the 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:02.680
 milliseconds of one or two 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.659
 did you say more about this great one 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.500
 monitor want to know if you would be right there 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.379
 want to purchase one 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.010
