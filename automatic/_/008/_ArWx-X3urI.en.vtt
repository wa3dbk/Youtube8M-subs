00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.929
 Six 63 moments after all 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:04.850
 master plan it means to achieve 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.300
 maximum good graphics do not need 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.170
 just tick the home screen 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.770
 also in the resolution of the game in the window specify 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.369
 names your permission 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.379
 also it would be better to tick 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.609
 all shaders and stop 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.689
 graphic processing 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.689
 also if there is no usa there are many mods 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.960
 it kind of thought it was about 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.849
 No if you play here very much 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.949
 there may be a message now with different 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.949
 meteonicity saga 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.720
 john distracted 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.480
 You can also view your 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.840
 advertising replays 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.270
 recorded 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.840
 have all the possibilities 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.150
 script downloads 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.320
 that's it 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 we will move to the maternity hospital 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.380
 tons a year some know bad movie 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.800
 rival but nevertheless and just as quickly 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.820
 and kelly mods themselves but the rest i 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.290
 jumped from the internet there are strips 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.360
 life there right to the left of everyone but from 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.230
 they are of little use 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.870
 checked list is checked but not 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.310
 drinks don't work 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.310
 and 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.340
 what is most important forgot 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.880
 you can change the rules like games 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.940
 m year 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.010
 here is the number of frames per 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.940
 louder this area risk assessment in one 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.420
 move 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.869
 Van veto flags on unnecessary 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.810
 disqualification is 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.130
 if a 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.180
 the player touches the floor with something other than his feet 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.940
 and brushes 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.140
 also from a very important distance she 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.850
 will offer but in the future I will 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.170
 say who is the distance of others 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.200
 tricks are better to use 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.360
 elevation above ground 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.259
 Trust but this is a turn relative 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.690
 center each other experiment 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.570
 You can also change gravity 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.369
 If here with a minus it glows as usual 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.529
 gravity 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:11.129
 also if you just remove the minutes they 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.089
 just fly top 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:15.559
 but as you can see accessibility
