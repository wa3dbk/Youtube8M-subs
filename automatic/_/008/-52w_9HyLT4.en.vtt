00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
bit of momentum but not too bad not it's

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.740 
bit of momentum but not too bad not it's
it<00:00:52.469> could<00:00:52.590> be<00:00:52.680> better<00:00:53.480> here<00:00:54.480> you'll<00:00:54.660> see

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
it could be better here you'll see

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.290 
it could be better here you'll see
they're<00:00:55.079> like<00:00:55.399> they're<00:00:56.399> better<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:56.879> I'm<00:00:57.000> not

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
they're like they're better but I'm not

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.670 
they're like they're better but I'm not
extending<00:00:57.809> all<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.020> up<00:01:00.260> yeah<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.440> I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
extending all the way up yeah I think I

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.789 
extending all the way up yeah I think I
was<00:01:01.800> running<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> 200<00:01:02.910> or<00:01:03.000> 220<00:01:03.539> here<00:01:03.799> and

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
was running like a 200 or 220 here and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.590 
was running like a 200 or 220 here and
then<00:01:05.189> after<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.820> did<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.150> full<00:01:06.390> rack

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
then after this I did the full rack

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.160 
then after this I did the full rack
which<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> 260<00:01:07.939> for<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.119> 5<00:01:09.330> reps<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:09.960> see<00:01:10.080> if

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
which is 260 for like 5 reps just see if

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.160 
which is 260 for like 5 reps just see if
I<00:01:10.260> could<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:11.220> him<00:01:11.340> up

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
I could get him up

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.950 
I could get him up
I<00:01:12.490> went<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.520> t-bar<00:01:13.909> rose<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:14.479> for<00:01:14.659> this<00:01:14.750> I

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
I went to t-bar rose so for this I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.789 
I went to t-bar rose so for this I
either<00:01:15.110> do<00:01:15.350> a<00:01:15.380> close<00:01:15.890> grip<00:01:16.509> cable<00:01:17.509> rows<00:01:17.799> or

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
either do a close grip cable rows or

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.609 
either do a close grip cable rows or
t-bar<00:01:19.640> rose<00:01:19.850> and<00:01:20.479> I<00:01:20.810> haven't<00:01:21.049> done<00:01:21.140> t-bar<00:01:21.470> rose

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
t-bar rose and I haven't done t-bar rose

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.870 
t-bar rose and I haven't done t-bar rose
in<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.860> while<00:01:22.040> so<00:01:23.049> stacked<00:01:24.049> on<00:01:24.229> some<00:01:24.439> 35<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.430> 45

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
in a while so stacked on some 35 the 45

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.660 
in a while so stacked on some 35 the 45
so<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:26.149> don't<00:01:26.270> think<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.479> get<00:01:26.689> a<00:01:27.530> good<00:01:28.190> stretch<00:01:28.399> at

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
so I don't think I get a good stretch at

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.130 
so I don't think I get a good stretch at
the<00:01:28.759> bottom<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:29.979> 35<00:01:30.979> or<00:01:31.250> even<00:01:31.460> 25<00:01:31.880> I<00:01:32.270> just<00:01:32.930> stack

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
the bottom so 35 or even 25 I just stack

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.570 
the bottom so 35 or even 25 I just stack
them<00:01:33.170> up<00:01:33.440> and<00:01:34.450> go<00:01:35.450> for<00:01:36.310> using<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.399> Rope

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
accessory they don't have one of those

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
is actually like a V there's no space to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.649 
is actually like a V there's no space to
now<00:01:45.800> place<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.159> bar<00:01:46.310> between<00:01:46.460> it<00:01:46.789> so<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:47.509> just

now place the bar between it so you just

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.760 
now place the bar between it so you just
use<00:01:47.810> the<00:01:47.929> rope<00:01:48.110> Rogers<00:01:48.500> use<00:01:48.590> my<00:01:48.710> hands<00:01:50.770> from

they're<00:01:52.069> going<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.060> some<00:01:53.330> dumbbell<00:01:53.720> rows<00:01:53.960> now

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
they're going to some dumbbell rows now

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.249 
they're going to some dumbbell rows now
this<00:01:55.429> gym<00:01:55.789> doesn't<00:01:56.090> have<00:01:56.360> super<00:01:57.080> heavy

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
this gym doesn't have super heavy

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.789 
this gym doesn't have super heavy
dumbbells<00:01:57.709> 100<00:01:58.369> pounds<00:01:58.729> because<00:01:59.420> it<00:01:59.569> goes<00:01:59.720> to

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
dumbbells 100 pounds because it goes to

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.090

35-pound<00:02:07.850> err<00:02:08.060> on<00:02:08.090> top<00:02:08.539> of<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.110> dumbbell<00:02:09.850> so

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
35-pound err on top of the dumbbell so

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.699 
35-pound err on top of the dumbbell so
it<00:02:11.600> was<00:02:11.720> two<00:02:11.810> dumbbells<00:02:12.019> pretty<00:02:12.440> much<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.650> was

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
done dumbbell rows I think in a while so

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.220

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.170 
I did a 135 48 on each side my last set

to bring their elbow back you know it's

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.620 
to bring their elbow back you know it's
like<00:02:40.040> using<00:02:40.250> their<00:02:40.520> arm<00:02:40.700> their<00:02:41.120> upper<00:02:41.420> back

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
really so I'm trying to stress that it's

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.730 
really so I'm trying to stress that it's
your<00:02:44.060> lat<00:02:44.360> bring<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.900> back<00:02:45.050> you<00:02:45.290> really<00:02:45.530> want

to<00:02:45.830> kind<00:02:46.520> of<00:02:46.610> bring<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:46.940> along<00:02:47.150> your<00:02:47.390> hip<00:02:47.600> you

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
to kind of bring it along your hip you

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.890 
to kind of bring it along your hip you
know<00:02:48.380> kind<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.710> think<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.130> your<00:02:50.090> elbow<00:02:50.300> driving

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
know kind of think of your elbow driving

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.150 
know kind of think of your elbow driving
back<00:02:51.110> not<00:02:51.350> necessarily<00:02:51.980> or<00:02:53.020> you<00:02:54.020> know<00:02:54.160> arm

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
back not necessarily or you know arm

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.160 
back not necessarily or you know arm
bringing<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.760> back<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:56.210> guess<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.780> could<00:02:56.840> say

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
bringing it back I guess you could say

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.700 
bringing it back I guess you could say
just<00:02:57.650> kind<00:02:57.830> of<00:02:57.860> using<00:02:58.160> your<00:02:58.430> back<00:02:58.640> to<00:02:59.600> do<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.960> so

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
just kind of using your back to do it so

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.050 
just kind of using your back to do it so
it's<00:03:00.860> kind<00:03:01.010> of<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.130> hard<00:03:01.340> concept<00:03:01.610> if<00:03:01.940> you've

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
it's kind of a hard concept if you've

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.490 
it's kind of a hard concept if you've
never<00:03:02.180> done<00:03:02.330> it<00:03:02.540> before<00:03:02.630> but<00:03:02.870> you<00:03:03.350> know<00:03:03.470> a

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
never done it before but you know a

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.020 
never done it before but you know a
little<00:03:03.740> bit<00:03:03.860> practice<00:03:04.310> it<00:03:04.550> becomes<00:03:05.240> easier<00:03:07.030> my

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
little bit practice it becomes easier my

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.980 
little bit practice it becomes easier my
form<00:03:08.270> is<00:03:08.330> not<00:03:08.480> perfect<00:03:08.870> but<00:03:09.580> definitely<00:03:10.580> works

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
form is not perfect but definitely works

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.530 
form is not perfect but definitely works

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
why didn't eat it too that's another

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.730 
why didn't eat it too that's another
thing<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.840> a<00:03:14.870> lot<00:03:14.990> of<00:03:15.050> people<00:03:15.260> think<00:03:15.380> you<00:03:15.620> know

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
thing to a lot of people think you know

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
readjust and it's just the nature of the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.670 
readjust and it's just the nature of the
beast<00:03:26.030> so<00:03:28.660> all<00:03:29.660> right<00:03:29.870> I'm<00:03:30.140> gonna<00:03:30.260> go<00:03:30.470> into

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
beast so all right I'm gonna go into

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
beast so all right I'm gonna go into
some<00:03:31.300> behind<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.390> head<00:03:32.510> pull<00:03:32.720> downs

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.720 

and<00:03:36.300> then<00:03:36.930> some<00:03:37.530> more<00:03:37.650> rear<00:03:37.830> delt<00:03:38.099> stuff<00:03:38.400> face

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
and then some more rear delt stuff face

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.520 
and then some more rear delt stuff face
polls<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:41.150> rear<00:03:42.150> delt<00:03:42.390> flies<00:03:42.629> on<00:03:43.050> the<00:03:43.200> key<00:03:43.349> on

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
polls and rear delt flies on the key on

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.170 
polls and rear delt flies on the key on
the<00:03:43.650> end<00:03:43.800> tables<00:03:45.590> so<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:47.550> difference<00:03:47.760> between

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
the end tables so the difference between

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.080 
the end tables so the difference between
this<00:03:48.330> pulled<00:03:48.629> a<00:03:48.780> and<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:48.959> other<00:03:49.080> pulled<00:03:49.319> a<00:03:49.470> is

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
this pulled a and the other pulled a is

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.309 
this pulled a and the other pulled a is
so<00:03:51.090> another<00:03:51.269> full<00:03:51.510> day<00:03:51.540> I<00:03:51.629> do<00:03:51.750> like<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:51.989> wide

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
so another full day I do like a wide

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.220 
so another full day I do like a wide
grip<00:03:52.620> everything's<00:03:53.220> kind<00:03:53.459> of<00:03:53.519> wide<00:03:54.230> barbell

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
grip everything's kind of wide barbell

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.240 
grip everything's kind of wide barbell
rows<00:03:55.410> you<00:03:55.769> know<00:03:55.860> wider<00:03:56.099> grab<00:03:57.860> this<00:03:58.860> one<00:03:59.069> is

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
rows you know wider grab this one is

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.240 
rows you know wider grab this one is
closer<00:03:59.519> grip<00:04:00.140> orientated<00:04:01.140> so<00:04:01.380> that's

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
closer grip orientated so that's

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.820 
closer grip orientated so that's
basically<00:04:02.430> how<00:04:02.700> I<00:04:02.790> split<00:04:03.150> them<00:04:03.269> up<00:04:03.299> and<00:04:03.830> like

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
basically how I split them up and like

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.830 
basically how I split them up and like
for<00:04:05.040> my<00:04:05.129> push<00:04:05.340> days<00:04:05.580> like<00:04:05.940> 1<00:04:05.970> days<00:04:06.390> i'm

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
starting with mostly inclined type

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.640 
starting with mostly inclined type
movements<00:04:09.390> incline<00:04:09.690> flies<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.230> climb<00:04:10.410> press

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
movements incline flies and climb press

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.089 
movements incline flies and climb press
the<00:04:10.830> other<00:04:10.920> ones<00:04:11.160> flat<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:12.650> i'll<00:04:13.650> focus<00:04:13.890> on

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
the other ones flat and i'll focus on

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.810 
the other ones flat and i'll focus on
flies<00:04:14.400> versus<00:04:15.209> pressing<00:04:16.340> for<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.669> b

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
changing it up you know basically doing

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.280 
changing it up you know basically doing
the<00:04:27.630> same<00:04:27.720> exercises<00:04:28.710> same<00:04:29.220> rep<00:04:29.460> schemes<00:04:30.290> so

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
the same exercises same rep schemes so

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.670 
the same exercises same rep schemes so
i'm<00:04:31.380> not<00:04:31.470> really<00:04:31.620> switching<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.220> up<00:04:32.340> too<00:04:33.090> much

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
i'm not really switching it up too much
