00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.599
 if you run all your goals deep so you can figure out quickly 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.599
 can put pressure on the defense 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.090
 Alternatively, you can send almost everything deep so that the defenders 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.989
 Lure way 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.459
 No, but there is a short route and will be the back of the 

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:33.459
 Defender played on 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.830
 that there are more moves and tactical concepts you'll find on the NFL Fleig

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.580
 Trier did not like running four 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.920
 you have to leave it unclear who has the ball right now 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.920
 a ball carrier can go undetected out of the dust 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.220
 in defense one distinguishes space and man coverage 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.080
 a man covering himself a defender for an attacker 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.090
 responsible 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.900
 so accompany him over the whole field if necessary 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.570
 An additional free man secures the deep space in the middle 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.060
 s because the quarterback's love then wins the devastating consequences of the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.800
 Ball is way the opponent is in attack 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.950
 we recommend to recess again 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.950
 our website 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.510
 with Braun cover defenders are evenly distributed 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.910
 for the direct opponent is now not a single responsible but 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.310
 the entire defense 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.220
 two safety are low and on both sides of the field against depth 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.179
 Basses off 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.849
 no attacker will pass you by 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.709
 between the front defenders with a little more space 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.269
 Although the offense can attack easier but deep basses are not possible 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:20.530
 In addition, all zones defenders look at the ball 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.259
 and can running game goat like that 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.259
 recognize very quickly 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.549
 so much fun playing football
