00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.740
 developer the first thing that we should 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.660
 know is that this update is 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.969
 available in beta form that is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.650
 still have errors to correct and not 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.930
 It is advisable to use it as a 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.699
 update for everyday use but 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.260
 even in the case of a beta this 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.720
 update is full of news 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.460
 and that includes from a renewed section 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.470
 of applications opened in second 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.539
 flat to the low power mode of 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.610
 the battery including also by 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.530
 course the new apple card system 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.630
 play that will allow us to connect the mobile 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.520
 directly to the car the process that you 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.710
 we are going to show to install the beta of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.239
 ios 9 does not require any knowledge 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 advanced and we will only have to 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.410
 install a file from the program 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.760
 itunes we started with the tutorial what 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.100
 first we have to do to be able to 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.660
 install the ios 9 update is 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.180
 look at the back of our 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.219
 iphone ipad or ipod there we will see a 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.930
 model word accompanied by a 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.579
 numbering it is important that we point 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.739
 that numbering since we will need you 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.120
 later now what we have to 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.710
 do is click on the link that you 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.630
 we have attached in the description of 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.070
 this video as it will take us to the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.780
 in which they are available 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.090
 all the veins of the update of 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.680
 ios 9 to download the update not 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.820
 we just have to look at that 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.950
 appear the name of our 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.539
 device but we also have to 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.610
 verify that between the parentheses 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:22.380
 appears the model number we have 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.729
 copied previously when we look at the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.960
 back of our terminal 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.520
 when we have found the 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.319
 update corresponding to our 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.179
 device we simply have to 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.369
 click on the torrent link that 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:33.450
 we'll see on the right 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.009
 will automatically start downloading 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.810
 a torrent file that will allow us 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.090
 download in our computer the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.560
 Yesterday's update is 9 in the version 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.970
 that we have selected on the page 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.590
 to be able to open this file is 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.179
 necessary that we have installed some 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.819
 torrents download program in 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.819
 our computer see for example 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:49.819
 bittorrent 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.680
 while the file is also downloaded 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.600
 we have to disable the option of 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.890
 look for my device in the terminal in 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.350
 which we are going to install this 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.820
 update before proceeding with the 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.440
 installation of the update also 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.450
 It is recommended to make a copy of 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.130
 security of our device and to 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.380
 we just open the program 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.390
 iTunes we connect our terminal and 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.380
 click on the option to perform 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.380
 copy now 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.810
 once you have finished downloading the 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.850
 torrent with the update we opened it 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.340
 and we proceed to extract the file that 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.500
 we will find inside 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.720
 when extracting this folder we will see that 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.160
 we have access to a file with a 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.780
 extension that we probably do not 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.040
 It will be very familiar but there is no 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.200
 no problem since this is the 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.730
 ios 9 update file that 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.190
 we will proceed to install in our 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.080
 device given that in the next 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.879
 step we will need to have access to this 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.980
 file to be able to install it in our 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.870
 The most advisable device is that 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.239
 we copy it on the desktop or in a 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.950
 easy access folder in these cases 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.780
 before installing the update it 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.670
 usually recommend making a 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.829
 restoration of the device that we are going to 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.599
 update that we can do from the 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:59.209
 iTunes program in the option of 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.769
 restore iphone in our case not what 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.660
 we have done and we have not had any 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.459
 problem therefore we leave in 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.799
 your hands the decision to restore 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.269
 or not our device we have already left 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.799
 behind everything that would come to be the 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.360
 preparations to install this 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.640
 update and now we 're going to get 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.950
 full with the installation taking 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.440
 our iphone ipad or ipod connected to 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.629
 computer using the usb cable we open 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.890
 the iTunes program and we navigate to the 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.140
 tab in which all the 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.730
 options of our device inside 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.620
 from this tab we have to click on 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.030
 the option to update but 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.280
 we do not do it in the conventional way 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.319
 but we have to do it by pressing the 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.909
 same time the shift key on 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.099
 the case that we use a computer 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.110
 with windows or the option key in the 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.610
 If Macs in the browser 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.200
 files that will be opened when you click 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.420
 about this option we only have left 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.370
 browse and search the file of the 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.079
 update of the 9 we have 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.610
 downloaded in the first steps and 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:51.890
 then click on the option of 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.150
 accept to finish only us 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.680
 it remains pressing on the option of 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.450
 update at the time it is 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.010
 show us a popup window to 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.569
 from here, the only thing that remains is 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.220
 have enough patience until the 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.930
 update finishes installing 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.540
 we are talking about a wait that can 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.819
 become perfectly 15 or 20 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.530
 even 25 minutes during the 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.930
 installation our device is 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.459
 will restart repeatedly as well 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.140
 that we do not have to worry if 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.090
 we see that the screen is off or in 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.680
 black or even though the bar 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.090
 advance is not moving as much 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.650
 important is that we are attentive to the 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.120
 installation as there will be a moment in 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.919
 which we will have to introduce our 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.970
 unlock code to continue 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.830
 with the process 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.720
 we also need to synchronize 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.460
 new our icloud account what is 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.470
 can translate into another wait of about 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.700
 how many minutes in summary we have to 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.950
 be calm and wait 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.750
 the update finishes installing 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.580
 we remind you that the update of 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.410
 the 9 that we have installed is a version 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.090
 in tests of form that may exist 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.800
 errors that will be corrected in the 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.450
 future in the description of the video os 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.980
 we also leave with a link of all 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.550
 the news that you will find in 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.550
 this update
