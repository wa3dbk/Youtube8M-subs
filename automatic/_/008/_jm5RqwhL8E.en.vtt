it's<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:07.049> lot<00:00:07.379> of<00:00:07.500> fun<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.799> fly<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.429> it's<00:00:08.970> built

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
it's a lot of fun to fly and it's built

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.049 
it's a lot of fun to fly and it's built
out<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.540> just<00:00:09.870> some<00:00:10.460> original<00:00:11.460> parts<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:12.030> I

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
out of just some original parts that I

different<00:00:18.630> components<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.529> I've<00:00:19.680> actually

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
different components and I've actually

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.140 
different components and I've actually
included<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.480> build<00:00:22.350> log<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.580> description

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
included a build log in the description

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.849 
included a build log in the description
it's<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.420> Google<00:00:24.750> spreadsheet<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.710> will

know - the things I just mentioned it's

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.860 
know - the things I just mentioned it's
a<00:00:47.879> pretty<00:00:48.120> good<00:00:48.980> quad<00:00:49.980> -<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.879> learn<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.600> fly

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
a pretty good quad - to learn on to fly

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.260 
a pretty good quad - to learn on to fly
to<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.289> comfortable<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.850> we'll<00:00:54.030> start

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
to get comfortable with so we'll start

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.529 
to get comfortable with so we'll start
with<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.600> frame<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.910> turnigy<00:00:56.910> Talon

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
with the frame this is a turnigy Talon

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.270 
with the frame this is a turnigy Talon
frame<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.440> believe<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.039> version

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
frame it's a I believe it's the version

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.860 
frame it's a I believe it's the version
one<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:01.070> at<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.309> time<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.210> this<00:01:03.329> video<00:01:03.690> it

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
one and at the time of this video it

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.090 
one and at the time of this video it
runs<00:01:04.229> about<00:01:05.540> $32.95<00:01:06.540> now<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.470> probably<00:01:07.950> one

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
runs about $32.95 now it's probably one

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.510 
runs about $32.95 now it's probably one
of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> more<00:01:08.490> expensive<00:01:09.380> components<00:01:10.520> for

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
of the more expensive components for

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.609 
of the more expensive components for
this<00:01:11.700> build<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.750> can<00:01:12.930> keep<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.229> mind<00:01:13.439> that

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
this build so you can keep in mind that

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.289 
this build so you can keep in mind that
you<00:01:14.159> know<00:01:14.280> if<00:01:14.369> you<00:01:14.460> want<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> build<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:15.030> own

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
you know if you want to build your own

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.120 
you know if you want to build your own
frame<00:01:15.720> or<00:01:16.020> find<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.439> cheaper<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.920> that's

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
frame or find a cheaper one that's

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.469 
frame or find a cheaper one that's
always<00:01:17.400> an<00:01:17.790> option<00:01:18.590> here<00:01:19.590> we<00:01:19.710> have<00:01:19.890> the

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
always an option here we have the

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
always an option here we have the
hobbyking<00:01:21.509> version<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.409> KK<00:01:22.740> board<00:01:23.009> it's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
hobbyking version of the KK board it's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.399 
hobbyking version of the KK board it's
the<00:01:23.240> hobbyking<00:01:24.860> 2.1<00:01:25.860> board<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.670> runs

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
the hobbyking 2.1 board and it runs

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.560 
the hobbyking 2.1 board and it runs
$12.99<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.650> that's<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.790> know<00:01:29.909> compared<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> an

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
$12.99 so that's you know compared to an

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.670 
$12.99 so that's you know compared to an
aza<00:01:30.780> or<00:01:31.140> RG<00:01:32.009> pilot<00:01:32.460> or<00:01:32.900> even<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.990> copter<00:01:34.320> control

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680

aza or RG pilot or even a copter control
some<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.950> those<00:01:35.100> higher<00:01:35.310> end<00:01:35.490> boards<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:35.970> is

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
some of those higher end boards this is

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.510 
some of those higher end boards this is
you<00:01:36.390> know<00:01:37.070> an<00:01:38.070> incredible<00:01:38.640> deal<00:01:39.829> now<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.100> you

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
you know an incredible deal now it's you

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.399 
you know an incredible deal now it's you
know<00:01:41.640> it's<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.210> said<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.689> basic<00:01:43.140> board

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
know it's like I said it's a basic board

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.999 
know it's like I said it's a basic board
and<00:01:43.790> it's<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:45.360> great<00:01:45.990> board<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.470> learn<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.799> fly

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
and it's a great board to learn to fly

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.160 
and it's a great board to learn to fly
on<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> has<00:01:47.729> three<00:01:48.860> gyros<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.130> your<00:01:51.170> pitch

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
on and it has three gyros for your pitch

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.800 
on and it has three gyros for your pitch
and<00:01:52.380> roll<00:01:52.939> so<00:01:53.939> you<00:01:53.970> could<00:01:54.270> probably<00:01:54.420> see<00:01:54.659> these

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
and roll so you could probably see these

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.289 
and roll so you could probably see these
guys<00:01:54.990> right<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:56.670> have<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.969> manually

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
guys right here and you have to manually

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.499 
guys right here and you have to manually
adjust<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.840> gains<00:01:58.170> on<00:01:59.009> those<00:01:59.280> with<00:01:59.520> your<00:01:59.729> with

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
adjust the gains on those with your with

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.280 
adjust the gains on those with your with
a<00:02:00.540> screw<00:02:00.840> driver<00:02:00.869> but<00:02:01.469> once<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.189> get<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.490> tuned

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
a screw driver but once you get it tuned

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.679 
a screw driver but once you get it tuned
fairly<00:02:04.290> well<00:02:04.469> it<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.310> thing<00:02:05.520> is<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.939> really

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
fairly well it the thing is is really

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.880 
fairly well it the thing is is really
stable<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.500> very<00:02:08.009> responsive<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.770> you<00:02:10.770> know

configuration<00:04:39.440> unless<00:04:39.800> you<00:04:41.319> get<00:04:42.319> the

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
configuration unless you get the

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.999 
configuration unless you get the
firmware<00:04:43.370> loader<00:04:44.110> so<00:04:45.110> by<00:04:45.349> default<00:04:45.830> you're

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
firmware loader so by default you're

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.580 
firmware loader so by default you're
going<00:04:46.129> to<00:04:46.190> be<00:04:46.310> flying<00:04:46.520> in<00:04:46.729> a<00:04:46.819> plus<00:04:47.229> this<00:04:48.229> is<00:04:48.470> the

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
going to be flying in a plus this is the

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.860 
going to be flying in a plus this is the
front<00:04:48.889> of<00:04:49.129> the<00:04:49.819> board<00:04:50.060> which<00:04:50.300> points<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.840> the

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
front of the board which points to the

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.350 
front of the board which points to the
front<00:04:51.169> of<00:04:51.259> the<00:04:51.319> quad<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:51.889> if<00:04:52.849> you<00:04:52.940> take<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.180> look

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
front of the quad and if you take a look

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.939 
front of the quad and if you take a look
at<00:04:53.509> the<00:04:53.629> props<00:04:54.039> and<00:04:55.039> motors<00:04:56.409> this<00:04:57.409> is<00:04:57.560> actually

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
at the props and motors this is actually

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:05.920 
at the props and motors this is actually
your<00:04:58.129> one<00:04:58.479> motor<00:04:59.479> one<00:05:02.199> motor<00:05:03.199> two<00:05:04.449> motor<00:05:05.449> three

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
your one motor one motor two motor three

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.659 
your one motor one motor two motor three
and<00:05:06.199> then<00:05:07.130> motor<00:05:07.370> four<00:05:07.699> is<00:05:07.940> your<00:05:08.180> rear<00:05:08.599> prop<00:05:09.669> so

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
and then motor four is your rear prop so

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:14.770 
and then motor four is your rear prop so
with<00:05:11.659> that<00:05:11.840> configuration<00:05:13.210> motor<00:05:14.210> one<00:05:14.539> and

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
with that configuration motor one and

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.439 
with that configuration motor one and
four<00:05:15.789> or<00:05:16.789> counterclockwise<00:05:17.919> and<00:05:19.150> then<00:05:20.150> two

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
four or counterclockwise and then two

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.309 
four or counterclockwise and then two
and<00:05:20.479> three<00:05:20.960> this<00:05:21.530> is<00:05:21.590> two<00:05:21.949> is<00:05:22.219> clockwise<00:05:22.699> and

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:23.319 
and three this is two is clockwise and

00:05:23.319 --> 00:05:25.749 
and three this is two is clockwise and
three<00:05:24.319> is<00:05:24.409> clockwise<00:05:24.710> so<00:05:25.190> just<00:05:25.400> keep<00:05:25.550> that<00:05:25.580> in

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:25.759 
three is clockwise so just keep that in

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.059 
three is clockwise so just keep that in
mind<00:05:25.940> as<00:05:26.389> you're<00:05:26.590> building<00:05:27.590> your<00:05:27.740> quad<00:05:28.039> you

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
mind as you're building your quad you

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:31.170 
mind as you're building your quad you
obviously<00:05:28.610> want<00:05:28.819> the<00:05:29.199> appropriate<00:05:30.199> props

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
obviously want the appropriate props

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.820 
obviously want the appropriate props
based<00:05:32.180> on<00:05:32.479> the<00:05:32.900> direction<00:05:33.229> your<00:05:33.530> motor<00:05:33.740> is

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
based on the direction your motor is

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.219 
based on the direction your motor is
spinning<00:05:34.210> so<00:05:35.210> that's<00:05:35.449> really<00:05:35.690> all<00:05:35.900> there<00:05:36.050> is

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:36.229 
spinning so that's really all there is

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.879 
spinning so that's really all there is
to<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.710> build<00:05:36.949> and<00:05:37.599> I'll<00:05:38.599> go<00:05:38.719> ahead<00:05:38.840> and<00:05:39.139> take

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
to the build and I'll go ahead and take

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.370 
to the build and I'll go ahead and take
it<00:05:40.069> for<00:05:40.310> a<00:05:40.340> quick<00:05:40.690> flight<00:05:41.690> just<00:05:41.930> so<00:05:42.139> you<00:05:42.199> guys

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
it for a quick flight just so you guys

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.990 
it for a quick flight just so you guys
can<00:05:42.680> see<00:05:43.389> how<00:05:44.389> it<00:05:44.539> handles<00:05:45.580> okay<00:05:46.580> so<00:05:46.639> I've

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
can see how it handles okay so I've

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.219 
can see how it handles okay so I've
already<00:05:47.770> fiddled<00:05:48.770> with<00:05:48.919> the<00:05:49.779> yaw<00:05:50.779> pitch<00:05:51.050> and

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229 
already fiddled with the yaw pitch and

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:53.170 
already fiddled with the yaw pitch and
roll<00:05:51.319> gains<00:05:51.770> to<00:05:52.159> get<00:05:52.310> everything<00:05:52.520> tuned<00:05:52.969> in

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
roll gains to get everything tuned in

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.600 
roll gains to get everything tuned in
but<00:05:53.479> as<00:05:53.690> I<00:05:53.810> mentioned<00:05:53.870> earlier<00:05:54.409> you<00:05:54.500> just<00:05:54.680> you

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
but as I mentioned earlier you just you

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.420 
but as I mentioned earlier you just you
know<00:05:55.729> use<00:05:55.880> a<00:05:55.909> little<00:05:56.500> tiny<00:05:57.500> screwdriver<00:05:57.830> to

00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:58.430 
know use a little tiny screwdriver to

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.010 
know use a little tiny screwdriver to
adjust<00:05:58.580> those<00:05:59.090> and<00:05:59.330> get<00:05:59.449> it<00:05:59.569> locked<00:05:59.719> into

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
adjust those and get it locked into

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.899 
adjust those and get it locked into
where<00:06:00.289> you<00:06:00.440> want<00:06:00.469> it<00:06:00.830> now<00:06:01.009> one<00:06:01.279> other<00:06:01.430> tip<00:06:01.699> with

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909 
where you want it now one other tip with

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.930 
where you want it now one other tip with
the<00:06:02.000> k<00:06:02.210> k<00:06:02.419> board<00:06:03.009> so<00:06:04.009> if<00:06:04.219> you<00:06:04.340> if<00:06:04.610> you<00:06:04.729> take<00:06:04.909> a

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
the k k board so if you if you take a

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.529 
the k k board so if you if you take a
look<00:06:05.090> at<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.300> board<00:06:05.770> while<00:06:06.770> I<00:06:06.800> do<00:06:06.919> this<00:06:07.539> down

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
look at the board while I do this down

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.749 
look at the board while I do this down
into<00:06:08.779> the<00:06:08.930> left<00:06:09.199> with<00:06:09.440> a<00:06:09.469> throttle<00:06:09.770> actually

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
into the left with a throttle actually

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:12.129 
into the left with a throttle actually
activates<00:06:11.270> the<00:06:11.449> board<00:06:11.690> you'll<00:06:11.900> see<00:06:12.050> the

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
activates the board you'll see the

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:14.529 
activates the board you'll see the
little<00:06:12.380> LED<00:06:12.560> come<00:06:12.979> on<00:06:13.159> and<00:06:13.400> down<00:06:14.150> into<00:06:14.360> the

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
little LED come on and down into the

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:17.740 
little LED come on and down into the
right<00:06:14.740> will<00:06:15.740> deactivate<00:06:15.979> the<00:06:16.580> ward<00:06:16.849> so<00:06:17.659> I'm

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
right will deactivate the ward so I'm

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:18.969 
right will deactivate the ward so I'm
going<00:06:17.900> to<00:06:17.930> go<00:06:18.020> ahead<00:06:18.199> and<00:06:18.349> activate<00:06:18.620> it<00:06:18.889> and

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:18.979 
going to go ahead and activate it and

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.920 
going to go ahead and activate it and
take<00:06:19.130> it<00:06:19.159> for<00:06:19.460> a<00:06:19.490> flight<00:06:19.819> so<00:06:20.270> down<00:06:20.509> into<00:06:20.810> the

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
take it for a flight so down into the

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:38.600 
take it for a flight so down into the
left<00:06:21.139> and<00:06:21.469> now<00:06:22.219> we're<00:06:22.400> ready<00:06:22.520> for<00:06:22.669> flight

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.360 

so<00:06:39.150> the<00:06:39.270> sky<00:06:39.509> flies<00:06:39.870> really<00:06:40.289> light<00:06:40.710> and<00:06:41.039> very

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
so the sky flies really light and very

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.990 
so the sky flies really light and very
responsive<00:06:43.039> if<00:06:44.039> you're<00:06:44.220> used<00:06:44.400> to<00:06:44.520> flying<00:06:44.819> the

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
responsive if you're used to flying the

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.740 
responsive if you're used to flying the
nausea<00:06:45.539> or<00:06:45.810> the<00:06:47.270> APM

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
nausea or the APM

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.600 
nausea or the APM
you'll<00:06:50.320> notice<00:06:50.530> quite<00:06:50.950> a<00:06:50.980> difference<00:06:51.430> when

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
you'll notice quite a difference when

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:58.420 
you'll notice quite a difference when
you're<00:06:51.730> flying<00:06:51.910> a<00:06:52.090> cake<00:06:52.300> a<00:06:52.480> board

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:00.870 

it<00:06:59.000> also<00:06:59.150> takes<00:06:59.510> a<00:06:59.720> little<00:06:59.840> bit<00:07:00.020> more<00:07:00.200> practice

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:00.880 
it also takes a little bit more practice

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.150 
it also takes a little bit more practice
just<00:07:01.880> because<00:07:02.240> the<00:07:02.390> leveling<00:07:02.840> is<00:07:03.020> is<00:07:03.530> just<00:07:03.920> not

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 
just because the leveling is is just not

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:23.840 
just because the leveling is is just not
as<00:07:04.370> stable<00:07:04.640> as<00:07:05.260> the<00:07:06.260> Naza<00:07:06.500> radium

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850 

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.840 

so<00:07:24.850> that's<00:07:25.060> it<00:07:25.300> for<00:07:25.479> the<00:07:25.600> KK<00:07:25.990> build<00:07:26.520> be<00:07:27.520> sure<00:07:27.699> to

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:27.850 
so that's it for the KK build be sure to

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.330 
so that's it for the KK build be sure to
check<00:07:28.060> the<00:07:28.240> spreadsheet<00:07:28.710> for<00:07:29.710> all<00:07:29.800> the<00:07:29.979> parts

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:30.340 
check the spreadsheet for all the parts

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.120 
check the spreadsheet for all the parts
and<00:07:30.520> feel<00:07:30.759> free<00:07:30.940> to<00:07:30.970> post<00:07:31.470> any<00:07:32.470> comments<00:07:32.830> if

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:33.130 
and feel free to post any comments if
