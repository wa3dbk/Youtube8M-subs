let<00:00:06.270> me<00:00:06.359> put<00:00:06.509> it<00:00:06.629> this<00:00:06.720> way<00:00:07.519> beginning<00:00:08.519> with

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
let me put it this way beginning with

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.120 
let me put it this way beginning with
our<00:00:08.790> 59<00:00:09.210> models<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.019> DeSoto<00:00:10.349> will<00:00:10.679> have<00:00:10.860> more

one<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> major<00:00:15.750> reasons<00:00:16.320> is<00:00:16.560> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
one of the major reasons is the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.160 
one of the major reasons is the
