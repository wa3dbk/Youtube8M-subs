the<00:01:33.780> Indiana<00:01:34.200> Pacers<00:01:34.470> ultimately<00:01:35.430> they're

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
the Indiana Pacers ultimately they're

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.030 
the Indiana Pacers ultimately they're
too<00:01:36.180> big<00:01:36.479> they<00:01:36.810> still<00:01:37.170> play<00:01:37.200> defense<00:01:37.860> they

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
too big they still play defense they

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.550 
too big they still play defense they
just<00:01:38.430> can't<00:01:39.030> score<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.840> still<00:01:40.200> think<00:01:40.350> they'll

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
just can't score I still think they'll

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.200
