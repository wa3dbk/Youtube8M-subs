00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:08.990
 the mother of the red car people 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:11.750
 then I could make him favorites of 2012 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.309
 therefore dop products of 2012 though 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.959
 however, it would always be a video 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.620
 very long at this point I prefer 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:21.440
 make more precise video reviews now 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.270
 let's start with the fact that in 2012 a 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.520
 product that I really liked 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.560
 so I used I used them 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.980
 especially especially during the Christmas period 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.960
 and I arrived now then in the year 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.760
 new that I want to talk to you about 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.430
 more specifically also because I don't have 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.800
 seen specific videorecections i'm 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.780
 speaking of kate moss lipsticks e 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.760
 two versions have come out this is a 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.230
 product that you can easily 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:50.150
 find in our perfumeries in the 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.649
 with soap and water and if you are 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.020
 lucky also in several supermarkets 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.579
 selling these products 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.440
 I, for example, can do a panorama 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.720
 finding them anyway is easy 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.329
 availability two lines have come out as 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.280
 you can say there is the black one and there is that one 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.079
 red first was the black one 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.240
 immediately afterwards because it was not due 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.329
 wait for the red one to come out 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.850
 the black one contains several products 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:15.770
 totally share and then they left 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.959
 these reds that are part of 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.090
 a totally matteo line yesterday I am 

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:22.909
 opaque what colorations learned that 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.920
 going to the ladder I talk to you and show you 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.139
 directly the lipsticks the first one I have 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.310
 took this was what is a 

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:34.729
 number 05 and is a beautiful old rose 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.939
 which however is slightly more polished and 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.549
 very opaque covering 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.429
 very good the shade sees immediately is 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.319
 very similar to the pencil of kiko the a310 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:47.569
 which is that then my mind the 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:51.139
 favorite for the lips is that pink 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:54.409
 very natural visible but not too much 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:56.149
 vulgar, not too young, therefore 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.340
 I highly recommend this here because it is 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.859
 a very very beautiful second color 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.540
 what i got was the 0 8 that it is 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:05.480
 another color 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.180
 as you will see is another rose 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.860
 ancient however totally extinguished therefore it is 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.690
 a cold color anyway 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.470
 I must say that I took it because it is 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.810
 really really the same shade 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.420
 apple bra is now a mood I wanted 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.300
 take because maybe like today than later 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.270
 just stay on the natural can 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.400
 apply this and I repeat being a lot 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.950
 moisturizing with pleasant to spread 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.980
 because in any case make lips really 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.440
 colorful but healthy and at the same time it is 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.790
 very soft third colloredo is taken 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.800
 it was this other one I have instead 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.030
 risky and that's what you already see me 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.680
 on 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.170
 I must say that to my dark color 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.500
 favorite of this line is the number 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:52.100
 109 and also this really beautiful 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.770
 really important is this Tues genta 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.510
 but still tending to a burgundy 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:02.830
 therefore it remains beautiful shiny and satin 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:05.450
 however it remains as you can see 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.450
 slightly dark when extending 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.850
 on the lips a real elegant effect 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.769
 I must say that it is a truly unique color 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.690
 from having to take I recommend it 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.700
 fourth color I took that was 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.440
 but of the matt line as I told you 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.400
 then soon after those came out 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.620
 dull 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.250
 it was this that the number 104 is 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.160
 the only flaw of the matt line yes 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.860
 find is practically the same mood 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.690
 of the glossy line which is the number of 0 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.850
 8 I'll show you right away that 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.280
 practically the colors are identical 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.980
 this is a clear undertone this one 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.530
 instead a dark undertone but if there 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.739
 notice the colors that are practically 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.870
 identical 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.120
 only the undertone changes, I must say 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.610
 that I was very happy to have 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.769
 finally find yourself as the last color a 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.600
 this is what the number 109 is 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.489
 you will have seen for sure why what 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.410
 wears directly kate moss and in 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.060
 I also have to say that advertising 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.480
 I liked it right away it's beautiful 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.120
 magenta color that tends totally in 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.100
 very very dark and even burgundy 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.010
 this being of the red line e 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.340
 matteo, however, I still leave that one 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.220
 slight clarity on the lips though if there is 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.720
 notice here the color was 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.150
 taken from the black line 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.850
 I thought maybe a new color 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.630
 of the line when I made myself 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:30.350
 I realize that comparing it to the number 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.140
 09 are also these identical though they have 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.360
 the same concept as the two or this one 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.330
 light undertone and this is a undertone 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.500
 dark in the end they are comfortable because 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.250
 they have two ends 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.410
 however, they are slightly different 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.010
 as shades for and against these 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.140
 lipsticks 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:50.090
 meanwhile there is to say that the cost varies to 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.610
 depending on where this is I have 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.790
 found that they started from 6 euros on 90 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.740
 up to 9 euros and 90 for the duration 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.510
 of these lipsticks is very valid for 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.040
 which last 30 months 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.950
 the quantity is that of a lipstick 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.020
 normal then four grams and how 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.940
 I've already said they see each other in these two 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.490
 lines of these and ners the team are 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.680
 doing so many pros and cons however of 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:15.290
 this line the next no how 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:18.860
 lipsticks are really fantastic 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:21.890
 gives a lips that semi effect 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:24.320
 opaque but in reality then under the light 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:26.810
 you can always see that they are still shiny 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:29.060
 frame the lips well and 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.880
 same time released not because strange 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.160
 but true are the real creamy tite reds 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:36.880
 but they do not fall apart and at the same time 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.350
 they don't go away they really last 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.020
 fantastic and I have to admit that too 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:43.910
 during meals they are really maintained 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.190
 well the cons are not there 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.620
 for those red instead as you see me 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.810
 I only have these two shades because 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.550
 I tell you in the meantime that I have no colors 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.590
 matt then I went to research 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.210
 to take these here and I was hoping to 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.940
 have the same result here with them 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.729
 that is yes that they were few but that allo 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.919
 same time hydra tavano 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.749
 there is no hydration speech 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.330
 color however remains beautiful full i 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:09.219
 our loses however there is the speech of 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.900
 hydration that offsets what 

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:15.580
 feel turn to a subspecies of 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.409
 lipstick application does not seem that 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.110
 you have a subspecies of cocoa butter 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:22.120
 as in these blacks therefore the effect is 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.039
 really different what i do true 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.469
 however, to have hydration by 

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:28.360
 these lipsticks because rightly so 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.219
 the price they did not want 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.169
 lose me before going to apply 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:34.360
 every time one of these faces 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:37.149
 a pass of cocoa butter at least three 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.189
 pass I leave that the lip balm in 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:41.529
 lips then before applying this 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:43.870
 I'm going to dab the lips to detect 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:46.059
 the butter kicks in excess and then has 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:48.550
 took this here and noticed it both 

00:06:46.059 --> 00:06:51.069
 almost the same result as these blacks 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.909
 so I recommend maybe this 

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:53.949
 method 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:56.080
 in case you don't like the feeling of 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:58.149
 these reds that I admit to me don't 

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.009
 like okay I told you everything 

00:06:58.149 --> 00:07:02.289
 these are the ones I have, I wait 

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:04.059
 to know you what you have if you are 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:06.279
 liked them if you didn't like them 

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:09.279
 as always I leave you the review of 

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:11.800
 this product in the info box because I have 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:15.419
 could charlie census on the blog and there 

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.419
 we see the next eyes hello 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:24.860

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.720
 mountain rescue 

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:39.160
 buffon 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:41.970
 word 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.970
 but he can't do it
