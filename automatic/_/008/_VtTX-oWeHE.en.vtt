master skill otherwise it's 250 a second
however<00:04:32.730> that's<00:04:33.120> still<00:04:33.480> helpful<00:04:33.840> and

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
however that's still helpful and

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.380 
however that's still helpful and
particularly<00:04:34.890> again<00:04:35.310> when<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:35.940> have<00:04:35.970> the

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
particularly again when you have the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.410 
particularly again when you have the
boss<00:04:36.600> fight<00:04:37.010> so<00:04:38.010> let's<00:04:38.280> look<00:04:38.730> at<00:04:38.910> the<00:04:39.060> stats

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
boss fight so let's look at the stats

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.530 
boss fight so let's look at the stats
and<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.720> skills<00:04:40.170> so<00:04:40.920> if<00:04:41.070> you<00:04:41.160> put<00:04:41.400> 200<00:04:42.120> points

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
and the skills so if you put 200 points

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.350 
and the skills so if you put 200 points
in<00:04:42.720> Cyrus's<00:04:43.440> shield<00:04:44.010> you'll<00:04:44.700> get<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.090> potion

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
in Cyrus's shield you'll get the potion

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.930 
in Cyrus's shield you'll get the potion
master<00:04:46.110> skill<00:04:46.560> and<00:04:46.800> your<00:04:47.010> potions<00:04:47.550> will<00:04:47.760> be

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
master skill and your potions will be

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.350 
master skill and your potions will be
massively<00:04:48.690> boosted<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:50.520> might<00:04:50.730> want<00:04:50.970> to<00:04:51.060> put

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
massively boosted you might want to put

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.540 
massively boosted you might want to put
extra<00:04:51.720> points<00:04:52.230> in<00:04:52.380> health<00:04:52.680> before<00:04:53.220> you<00:04:53.340> go<00:04:53.490> to

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
extra points in health before you go to

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.300 
extra points in health before you go to
deathless<00:04:54.210> mode<00:04:54.510> so<00:04:55.200> that<00:04:55.230> even<00:04:55.890> if<00:04:55.980> you<00:04:56.100> do

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
deathless mode so that even if you do

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.350 
deathless mode so that even if you do
get<00:04:56.490> hit<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:57.060> won't<00:04:57.300> die<00:04:57.630> straight<00:04:58.110> away<00:04:58.410> and

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
get hit you won't die straight away and

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.890 
get hit you won't die straight away and
also<00:05:00.360> essentially<00:05:01.020> put<00:05:01.790> 250<00:05:02.790> in<00:05:03.030> magic<00:05:03.660> and

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
also essentially put 250 in magic and

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.840 
also essentially put 250 in magic and
then<00:05:04.320> your<00:05:04.530> magic<00:05:04.980> will<00:05:05.190> be<00:05:05.310> 10<00:05:05.580> times

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:05.850 
then your magic will be 10 times

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.630 
then your magic will be 10 times
stronger<00:05:06.300> so<00:05:07.020> that's<00:05:07.350> really<00:05:07.710> helpful<00:05:08.130> during

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
stronger so that's really helpful during

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.180 
stronger so that's really helpful during
this<00:05:08.790> mode<00:05:09.120> so<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.080> hope<00:05:10.320> this<00:05:10.500> has<00:05:10.710> helped<00:05:11.010> you
