00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.789
 hello together today we deal 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.750
 us with an unboxing video of the ksc 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.390
 100 here we have the carton though 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.779
 directly on top of course are natural 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.789
 the whole documents because we would have the 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.700
 Instruction manual in several languages 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:35.930
 split on three small pieces 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.940
 plus a cd with the data import utility 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.219
 they would be warranty cards and one 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.280
 note on the canon professional 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:50.039
 service and the video camcorder the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:53.219
 in question come further into the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:59.820
 carton so here we have the body good 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:03.379
 wrapped in bubble wrap the device 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.909
 weighs a lot more than his dslr body 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:08.180
 and we already have that way 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.180
 out 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.759
 the body switch scans the mounted 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.530
 handles attached rear located 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:36.330
 the display works in contrast to the c 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:40.380
 300 directly on the body itself not mounted 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.210
 quite as truly free on the carton 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.390
 we have the upper handle with the 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:50.539
 audio device connects to the xlr and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.539
 the channel control eg tegel baths and 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.950
 the audio unit will be over 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:01.200
 Manufacturer specific cable on the body 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.319
 the cable has unfortunately attached very much 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.299
 small and fine pins the easy 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.630
 can bend and break and is 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.970
 on trips side firmly connected that is 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.880
 there is an error on cable break in here 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.010
 Bent or the like must the whole 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.850
 handle for repair no no 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.850
 be sent 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:39.170
 further we have a power cable there 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:41.840
 battery bp 955 the right charger and 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.939
 the power plug to so you can the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.099
 Of course, synonymous without a battery 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:46.819
 operate and directly from the mains 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.239
 Food 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.870
 Continue to be a shoulder strap 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.750
 and a little coverlet that you open 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.419
 if the right body side screws on 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.099
 you removed the handle 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.260
 For example, if the camcorder in the rack 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.329
 is installed 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:08.230
 then there is still a tripod adapter plate 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:11.599
 doing it for a quarter to screw 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.659
 That's it , here we are 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.409
 So the complete scope of delivery of esc 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:17.409
 100
