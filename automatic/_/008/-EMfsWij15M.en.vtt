too<00:03:50.850> he's<00:03:51.239> much<00:03:51.480> more<00:03:51.720> defiant<00:03:52.230> he<00:03:52.590> he<00:03:53.040> takes

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
too he's much more defiant he he takes

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.170

to that defiance a lot longer which

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.710 
to that defiance a lot longer which
creates<00:03:59.310> more<00:03:59.550> conflict<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.239> think<00:04:00.480> for<00:04:00.630> the
