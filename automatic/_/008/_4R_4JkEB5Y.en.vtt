00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
start with a small quantity remember

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.160 
start with a small quantity remember
that<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> can<00:01:02.730> always<00:01:02.910> add<00:01:03.300> but<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.899> can't

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that you can always add but you can't

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.010 
that you can always add but you can't
remove<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.589> so<00:01:05.010> add<00:01:05.220> blend<00:01:05.850> taste<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.780> add

remove it so add blend taste and add

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.300 
remove it so add blend taste and add
more<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.530> desired

more if desired
now<00:01:08.549> hummus<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> preparation<00:01:09.840> that

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
now hummus is a preparation that

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.560 
now hummus is a preparation that
contains<00:01:10.650> chickpeas<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:11.729> you'll<00:01:11.909> probably<00:01:12.180> be

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
contains chickpeas so you'll probably be

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.390 
contains chickpeas so you'll probably be
surprised<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.320> hear<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.799> good<00:01:14.010> hummus

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
surprised to hear that a good hummus

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.570 
surprised to hear that a good hummus
contains<00:01:15.060> only<00:01:15.509> 30<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.200> 40<00:01:16.560> percent<00:01:16.710> chickpeas

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
contains only 30 to 40 percent chickpeas

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.420 
contains only 30 to 40 percent chickpeas
this<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.299> exactly<00:01:18.780> why<00:01:18.990> most<00:01:19.500> fat-free<00:01:20.040> hummus

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
this is exactly why most fat-free hummus

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.609 
this is exactly why most fat-free hummus
you'll<00:01:20.670> stumble<00:01:20.909> upon<00:01:21.180> are<00:01:21.570> weird<00:01:22.080> tasting

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you'll stumble upon are weird tasting

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.469 
you'll stumble upon are weird tasting
because<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.340> completely<00:01:23.759> remove<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.299> oil

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
because if you completely remove the oil

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
because if you completely remove the oil
and<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> tahini<00:01:25.320> from<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> equation<00:01:26.280> you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and the tahini from the equation you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.609 
and the tahini from the equation you
distort<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.360> proportions<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.500> will

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
distort the proportions and you will

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.620 
distort the proportions and you will
also<00:01:29.070> obviously<00:01:29.310> end<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:30.090> with<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.420> sour

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
also obviously end up with the sour

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.319 
also obviously end up with the sour
tasting<00:01:31.170> chickpeas<00:01:31.920> base<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.490> puree<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
tasting chickpeas base the puree the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.179 
tasting chickpeas base the puree the
tahini<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.930> also<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> fundamental<00:01:34.979> piece<00:01:35.130> of

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
tahini is also a fundamental piece of

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.429 
tahini is also a fundamental piece of
the<00:01:35.460> puzzle<00:01:35.850> as<00:01:36.000> its<00:01:36.299> nutty<00:01:36.570> flavor<00:01:36.960> really

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the puzzle as its nutty flavor really

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.859 
the puzzle as its nutty flavor really
makes<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.950> difference<00:01:37.979> for<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.210> reason<00:01:39.600> we

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
makes a difference for this reason we

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.690 
makes a difference for this reason we
didn't<00:01:40.170> completely<00:01:40.560> remove<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.490> simply

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
didn't completely remove it but simply

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.550 
didn't completely remove it but simply
diminish<00:01:42.210> its<00:01:42.390> quantity<00:01:42.930> as<00:01:43.079> much<00:01:43.380> as

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
diminish its quantity as much as

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.679 
diminish its quantity as much as
