00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
I can help phase it one here and this

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.690 
I can help phase it one here and this
video<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.680> about<00:00:13.219> approaches<00:00:14.219> two<00:00:14.370> junctions

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
video is about approaches two junctions

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.769 
video is about approaches two junctions
either<00:00:15.210> major<00:00:15.389> or<00:00:15.599> minor<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:17.420> also<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.450> little

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
either major or minor and also a little

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.019 
either major or minor and also a little
bit<00:00:18.869> around<00:00:19.020> about<00:00:19.290> work<00:00:19.529> so<00:00:19.830> it's<00:00:20.730> not<00:00:20.820> that

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
bit around about work so it's not that

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.430 
bit around about work so it's not that
interesting<00:00:21.480> but<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.690> hope<00:00:21.810> people<00:00:21.960> book<00:00:22.199> to

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
interesting but I hope people book to

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.519 
interesting but I hope people book to
all<00:00:23.430> he<00:00:23.699> rides<00:00:23.939> regularly<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.689> someone<00:00:25.380> but

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
all he rides regularly and someone but

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.200 
all he rides regularly and someone but
so<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.830> just<00:00:26.039> feel<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.460> newbies<00:00:27.060> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
so this just feel like the newbies and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.500 
so this just feel like the newbies and
so<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:28.760> when<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> was<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.420> my

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
so on and when I was one of my

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.150 
so on and when I was one of my
subscribers<00:00:30.750> also<00:00:31.230> me<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.740> something<00:00:32.099> like

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
subscribers also me to do something like

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.080 
subscribers also me to do something like
this<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.989> what<00:00:33.989> I<00:00:34.019> do<00:00:34.280> what<00:00:35.280> would<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.910> the

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
this so what I do what would I do on the

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.580 
this so what I do what would I do on the
approach<00:00:36.330> to<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.690> junction<00:00:37.170> what's<00:00:37.350> one<00:00:37.559> more

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
approach to a junction what's one more

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.270 
approach to a junction what's one more
first<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.070> all<00:00:38.750> make<00:00:39.750> sure<00:00:39.829> make<00:00:40.829> him<00:00:41.010> first

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
first of all make sure make him first

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250 
first of all make sure make him first
now<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.540> general<00:00:42.840> I'll<00:00:42.930> probably<00:00:43.079> in

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
now but in general I'll probably in

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
now but in general I'll probably in
second<00:00:43.590> gear<00:00:43.770> on<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.190> approach<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
second gear on the approach that the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.959 
second gear on the approach that the
home<00:00:45.780> eight<00:00:45.930> shots<00:00:46.200> nothing<00:00:46.410> coming<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.969> think

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
home eight shots nothing coming I think

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.119 
home eight shots nothing coming I think
changed<00:00:48.300> our<00:00:48.420> last<00:00:48.750> minute<00:00:48.930> into<00:00:49.200> first<00:00:49.530> let's

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
changed our last minute into first let's

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.060 
changed our last minute into first let's
just<00:00:50.250> want<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> four<00:00:50.730> third<00:00:50.850> preference

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
just want the four third preference

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.500 
just want the four third preference
obviously<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.700> giveaway<00:00:53.969> but<00:00:54.059> because

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
obviously this is a giveaway but because

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.119 
obviously this is a giveaway but because
I<00:00:54.570> can<00:00:54.719> actually<00:00:54.840> see<00:00:55.200> behind<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.920> either

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
I can actually see behind the either

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.380 
I can actually see behind the either
these<00:00:56.280> cars<00:00:56.610> either<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> right<00:00:57.149> or<00:00:57.270> to

left on that to Streatley treat the car

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.599 
left on that to Streatley treat the car
level<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.899> outside<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.829> these<00:01:01.980> cars<00:01:02.190> as<00:01:02.399> my

they can see me again don't to put that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.260 
aware how much space you've gotten where
your<00:01:13.229> next<00:01:13.530> camp<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.920> right<00:01:14.700> nothing<00:01:15.090> coming

that's<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.750> all<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.430> forget<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.549> cancel

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
that's it and all this forget to cancel

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.850 
that's it and all this forget to cancel
your<00:01:21.170> indicator

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
your indicator

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.500 
your indicator
as<00:01:24.370> a<00:01:24.430> my<00:01:24.730> bike<00:01:24.970> it's<00:01:25.150> only<00:01:25.270> got<00:01:25.390> the<00:01:25.480> one

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 
as a my bike it's only got the one

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.320 
as a my bike it's only got the one
indica<00:01:25.900> one<00:01:26.260> indicator<00:01:26.710> so<00:01:27.030> they've<00:01:28.030> not<00:01:28.150> many

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
indica one indicator so they've not many

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.360 
indica one indicator so they've not many
vindicated<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:28.930> can't<00:01:29.140> even<00:01:29.290> tell<00:01:29.650> which

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
vindicated you can't even tell which

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.130 
vindicated you can't even tell which
ones<00:01:30.610> on<00:01:30.820> so<00:01:31.620> sometimes<00:01:32.620> I've<00:01:32.710> even<00:01:32.770> got<00:01:33.010> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
ones on so sometimes I've even got to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.290 
ones on so sometimes I've even got to
press<00:01:35.140> in<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.440> color<00:01:35.620> twice<00:01:35.980> in<00:01:36.490> it<00:01:36.730> or<00:01:36.910> you

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
press in the color twice in it or you

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.150 
press in the color twice in it or you
know<00:01:37.420> in<00:01:37.690> what<00:01:37.930> direction<00:01:38.380> make<00:01:38.770> sure<00:01:38.980> it<00:01:39.070> is

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
know in what direction make sure it is

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.010 
know in what direction make sure it is
definitely<00:01:39.610> stealing<00:01:40.330> to<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.510> right<00:01:40.660> settle

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
definitely stealing to the right settle

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.530 
definitely stealing to the right settle
left<00:01:41.260> you<00:01:41.380> know<00:01:41.470> that<00:01:41.620> sort<00:01:41.740> of<00:01:41.800> thing<00:01:42.540> anyway

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
left you know that sort of thing anyway

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.580 
left you know that sort of thing anyway
you<00:01:44.010> want<00:01:45.010> to<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.160> roundabout<00:01:46.260> I'm<00:01:47.260> going<00:01:47.500> to

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
you want to the roundabout I'm going to

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.770 
you want to the roundabout I'm going to
be<00:01:47.650> going<00:01:47.800> straight<00:01:47.920> on<00:01:48.160> this<00:01:48.310> roundabout<00:01:48.780> so

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
be going straight on this roundabout so

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.719 
be going straight on this roundabout so
the<00:01:49.900> correct<00:01:50.110> approach<00:01:50.260> should<00:01:50.710> be<00:01:50.770> in<00:01:51.130> the

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
the correct approach should be in the

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.420 
the correct approach should be in the
left-hand<00:01:52.150> Lane<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:53.220> obviously<00:01:54.220> they<00:01:54.310> want

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
left-hand Lane you obviously they want

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.410 
left-hand Lane you obviously they want
to<00:01:54.490> be<00:01:54.550> in<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.729> rightness<00:01:54.910> you're<00:01:55.210> going<00:01:55.360> to

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
to be in the rightness you're going to

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.960 
to be in the rightness you're going to
be<00:01:55.890> turning<00:01:56.890> right<00:01:57.070> kind<00:01:57.460> of<00:01:57.520> make<00:01:57.610> sense<00:01:57.850> of

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
be turning right kind of make sense of

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.640 
be turning right kind of make sense of
it<00:01:58.060> but<00:01:58.690> yeah<00:01:58.869> generally<00:01:59.140> if<00:01:59.410> you're<00:01:59.500> not

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
get to congested roundabouts as well

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:01.050 
get to congested roundabouts as well
which<00:05:59.949> you<00:05:59.979> can't<00:06:00.190> really<00:06:00.280> help<00:06:00.430> I<00:06:00.580> can't<00:06:00.789> give

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
which you can't really help I can't give

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.559 
which you can't really help I can't give
you<00:06:01.150> a<00:06:01.449> different<00:06:01.990> definitive<00:06:02.860> the<00:06:03.449> way<00:06:04.449> of

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:04.569 
you a different definitive the way of

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:06.899 
you a different definitive the way of
taking<00:06:04.720> a<00:06:04.900> particular<00:06:05.020> roundabout<00:06:05.699> but<00:06:06.699> so

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:06.909 
taking a particular roundabout but so

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:08.010 
taking a particular roundabout but so
that's<00:06:07.120> pretty<00:06:07.360> much<00:06:07.539> it

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
that's pretty much it

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.290 
that's pretty much it
I've<00:06:08.800> got<00:06:08.979> my<00:06:09.069> own<00:06:09.159> freestyle<00:06:09.729> while<00:06:09.909> doing<00:06:10.240> it

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:10.300 
I've got my own freestyle while doing it

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.559 
I've got my own freestyle while doing it
one<00:06:10.509> on<00:06:10.659> one<00:06:10.870> we<00:06:10.990> own<00:06:11.110> but<00:06:11.380> that's<00:06:12.569> probably

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:13.569 
one on one we own but that's probably

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:14.909 
one on one we own but that's probably
fun<00:06:13.840> all<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:13.990> time<00:06:14.080> you've<00:06:14.470> probably<00:06:14.530> seen<00:06:14.800> me

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 
fun all the time you've probably seen me

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:15.890 
fun all the time you've probably seen me
doing<00:06:15.039> videos<00:06:15.370> anyway

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
doing videos anyway

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.260 
doing videos anyway
yeah<00:06:16.900> how'd<00:06:17.139> that<00:06:17.289> hope<00:06:17.500> some<00:06:18.210> this<00:06:19.210> a

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
yeah how'd that hope some this a

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.149 
yeah how'd that hope some this a
scrubber<00:06:19.630> that<00:06:19.690> was<00:06:19.840> asking<00:06:20.349> for<00:06:20.380> the<00:06:20.590> tips<00:06:21.009> on

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159 
scrubber that was asking for the tips on

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.899 
scrubber that was asking for the tips on
the<00:06:21.419> how<00:06:22.419> to<00:06:22.479> approach<00:06:22.810> the<00:06:22.960> junctions<00:06:23.380> etc

00:06:23.899 --> 00:06:23.909 
the how to approach the junctions etc

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:26.459 
the how to approach the junctions etc
and<00:06:24.909> that's<00:06:25.120> late<00:06:25.270> it's<00:06:26.110> not<00:06:26.199> that

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
and that's late it's not that

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.230 
and that's late it's not that
interesting<00:06:26.710> but<00:06:27.250> it's<00:06:27.789> the<00:06:27.909> people<00:06:28.030> they've

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
interesting but it's the people they've

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.249 
interesting but it's the people they've
never<00:06:28.330> ridden<00:06:28.630> the<00:06:28.780> bike<00:06:28.870> before

00:06:29.249 --> 00:06:29.259 
never ridden the bike before

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.499 
never ridden the bike before

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:31.509 
so behind again there's anything being

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:33.270 
so behind again there's anything being
front<00:06:31.690> of<00:06:31.780> good<00:06:31.870> enough

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
front of good enough

done<00:06:46.800> a<00:06:46.950> little<00:06:47.100> bit<00:06:47.250> more<00:06:47.510> kind<00:06:48.510> of<00:06:48.660> firm<00:06:48.900> this

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:49.320 
done a little bit more kind of firm this

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.660 
done a little bit more kind of firm this
could<00:06:49.500> be<00:06:49.560> look<00:06:49.710> not<00:06:50.040> more<00:06:50.160> fun<00:06:50.310> than<00:06:50.400> this<00:06:50.490> one

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:50.670 
could be look not more fun than this one

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.830 
could be look not more fun than this one
this<00:06:51.510> could<00:06:51.690> be<00:06:51.810> more<00:06:51.960> faster<00:06:52.770> spades<00:06:53.720> not<00:06:54.720> in

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
this could be more faster spades not in

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.020 
this could be more faster spades not in
science<00:06:55.200> be<00:06:55.380> diggin<00:06:55.680> either<00:06:55.920> just<00:06:56.670> faster

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
science be diggin either just faster

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:59.150 
science be diggin either just faster
roads<00:06:57.210> and<00:06:57.530> we're<00:06:58.530> going<00:06:58.650> to<00:06:58.710> be<00:06:58.770> trying<00:06:59.010> to

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
roads and we're going to be trying to

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:01.340 
roads and we're going to be trying to
look<00:06:59.310> for<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.550> vanishing<00:06:59.880> point<00:07:00.090> so<00:07:00.990> we'll

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:01.350 
look for the vanishing point so we'll

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.120 
look for the vanishing point so we'll
have<00:07:01.470> some<00:07:01.650> fun<00:07:01.800> with<00:07:01.980> that
