00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.239

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.980
 Hunger Games but there already 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.860
 we have to get things in the 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.860
 chests look here is the portal 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:21.010
 here is the sky blot 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.220
 It is already a floating island in the middle of the 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.220
 nothing 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:32.740
 this is spam in these are 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.409
 and the place where I'm shit what the fuck 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.560
 the place where I am is the server 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.320
 main where are the portals for 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.479
 go to the other servers that is 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.700
 the list of players and all 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.710
 players that have here on the server 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.000
 remember to remember that this cd is 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.000
 for the 1.6 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:00.130
 You are my magic watch Miguel 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.130
 where are you 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.590
 these are all the players that are 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.590
 here 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.780
 look at the spam and stamp 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.349
 to that thing that gives me super speed 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.410
 odor 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.069
 here entertainment servers that is 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.180
 as I said earlier the towers 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.180
 and xv 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.420
 the sky lot the south exterior survival or 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.850
 it is a survival of fashion 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.200
 It's your life of passion 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:47.070
 and I also think that it is also pvp and not 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.170
 I had pe and there are two different worlds in 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.660
 his rival for the world to 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.500
 user that likes in the pvp that of 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.500
 that the fashion 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:02.549
 in the world I did not have that there is no third 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:05.110
 there are no plots but a block is used 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:09.520
 that is a humor 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.590
 suddenly love is already a mineral and everything 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.940
 what is to place the mineral and 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:18.000
 this mineral will protect you a certain area 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.070
 and there nothing else you alone can build 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.250
 unless I put a command and add 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.140
 tosomeone 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.850
 but I wish you liked this review 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.090
 from the server 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.090
 Give it a thumbs up , I'll leave the ip 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.320
 in the description when I entered by 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.030
 first time to the server will appear here 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.300
 and they will have to place the command 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.620
 registration and a password is 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.160
 password in the have to place 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.160
 your 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.159
 and when they enter or can register 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:57.940
 they are going to ask for this other command 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:04:03.060
 login and the password they placed 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:05.010
 and they hit enter and they will be successful 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.220
 Now what you have to do is go 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:12.190
 to any server and 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.910
 enter or enter through the portal this 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:18.510
 that are here s get into the water 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.510
 shit 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.150
 For example, right now I have entered 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.610
 exterior survival 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.070
 what is an exploding in the middle of nowhere 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.160
 and here are the two portals to go 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.000
 towards the two worlds here is the portal 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.150
 to go to the world not toy 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.120
 is a user and export to go towards 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.880
 the pvp world good hope you liked it 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.550

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.540
 I will bring more server review and now 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.200

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.200
 behind
