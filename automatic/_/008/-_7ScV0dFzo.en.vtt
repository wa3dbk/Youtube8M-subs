so<00:02:23.939> that's<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.359> the<00:02:24.780> eggshells<00:02:25.260> we<00:02:25.980> should

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
so that's it the eggshells we should

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.470 
so that's it the eggshells we should
kind<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.489> crunch<00:02:26.760> those<00:02:26.879> up<00:02:27.060> a<00:02:27.150> little<00:02:27.180> bit

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
it easier for them to eat don't need any

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:40.280 
it easier for them to eat don't need any

worms all the time now this one was done

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.599 
worms all the time now this one was done
like<00:03:51.540> two<00:03:51.719> weeks<00:03:51.900> ago<00:03:52.189> just<00:03:53.189> bed<00:03:53.370> right<00:03:53.579> here

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
right and I actually fed it some of that

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:56.990 
right and I actually fed it some of that
fresh<00:03:55.560> horse<00:03:55.859> manure<00:03:56.010> that's<00:03:56.340> why<00:03:56.489> they<00:03:56.670> saw

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
fresh horse manure that's why they saw

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.610 
fresh horse manure that's why they saw
dust<00:03:57.239> is<00:03:57.389> left<00:03:57.599> from<00:03:57.750> it<00:03:57.870> right<00:03:58.019> there<00:03:58.260> but<00:03:58.439> see

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
dust is left from it right there but see

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.709 
dust is left from it right there but see
this<00:03:59.099> here<00:03:59.340> these<00:03:59.909> are<00:04:00.060> getting<00:04:00.269> bigger<00:04:00.480> now

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:00.719 
this here these are getting bigger now

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:02.420 
this here these are getting bigger now
because<00:04:01.170> they<00:04:01.319> were<00:04:01.379> separated<00:04:02.040> like<00:04:02.129> two<00:04:02.340> or

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
because they were separated like two or

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.459 
because they were separated like two or
three<00:04:02.489> weeks<00:04:02.760> ago<00:04:03.000> so<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.629> another<00:04:04.049> week<00:04:04.290> or
