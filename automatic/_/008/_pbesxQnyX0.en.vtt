00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:15.159
 domestic family

 There are a lot of reasons, but first there are three 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.039
 MB desktops that I can 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.420

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:25.939
 desktop picture 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.119
 You can assign a visit different but 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.829
 Here for example in such a way means 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.829
 add both for example 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.190
 true 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.960
 transmitter number for example 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.260
 then something else can there for example in 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.460
 adopted under the president wish 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.890

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.960
 purpose 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.760
 switches in this way 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.750
 switching can be done quickly if 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.920
 turn off the effects so minimum 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.510
 the table seems to me a little 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.380
 blush icons which are more stylish 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.220
 we have troechk m here groups just 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.900
 look bright so ordinary 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.840
 function theme effects turn off now we 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.150
 turned off all 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.320
 effect n 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.130
 and now as you can see the switch 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.130
 desktops can can instantly 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.330
 further it is in the menu 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.670
 the role here is now on work 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.190
 the percentage on the main desktop is this 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.750
 produced 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.230
 and the second option 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.910
 means there are applications 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.230
 functions can be viewed and so you 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.910
