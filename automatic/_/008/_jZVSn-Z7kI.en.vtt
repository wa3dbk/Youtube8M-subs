00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
toolbox I mean a real screwdriver so you

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.830 
toolbox I mean a real screwdriver so you
know<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.579> hand<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:39.030> think<00:01:39.090> holding<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.689> like

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
know in hand I think holding it like

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.330 
know in hand I think holding it like
this<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.259> could<00:01:40.350> really<00:01:40.740> get<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.040> bite<00:01:41.310> on

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
this you could really get a bite on

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.719 
this you could really get a bite on
something<00:01:41.939> if<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.960> needed<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:44.360> right<00:01:45.360> here

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
something if you needed to right here

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.760 
something if you needed to right here
you<00:01:47.729> have<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:48.360> little<00:01:49.159> hook<00:01:50.960> I'm<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.320> exactly

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
you have a little hook I'm not exactly

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.710 
you have a little hook I'm not exactly
sure<00:01:53.009> what<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:53.880> I'm<00:01:54.030> guessing<00:01:54.509> it's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
sure what this is for I'm guessing it's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.170 
sure what this is for I'm guessing it's

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.720 
these usually they're kind of small and
short<00:04:08.600> but<00:04:08.840> these<00:04:09.530> are<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:09.890> little<00:04:10.310> bit<00:04:10.430> longer

short but these are a little bit longer
again<00:04:11.420> they<00:04:11.570> use<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.900> folding

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
again they use the folding

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.009 
again they use the folding
the<00:04:12.629> tool<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:14.390> so<00:04:15.390> they<00:04:15.510> work<00:04:15.660> great<00:04:15.810> this

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019
