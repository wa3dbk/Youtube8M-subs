00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.519
 Hello this is that the attempt to overcome the f with that guitar course for beginners 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:11.860
 I think I want to do with the theme 

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:16.420
 It is said that the biggest barrier for beginners f but if you practice 8 patiently 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:20.180
 It seems that you can always play , please try to play while referring to this video 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:25.910
 It is immediately, but f-hit three 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:32.989
 I would like to raise the point as the first one eye point of is a form of a wrist 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:40.170
 When you draw a eh It is Kaa had expected little say Well Tato Well leguminous wrist 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:46.880
 I'm away from Popper Ah Nigg this day, but 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:51.350
 Please hold it like this, and for that purpose, it's uh ... here's the back of the hand 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:58.490
 The point is to keep it sticking out quickly 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:01:04.220
 Such as show rather than hide against the people who are over there or anti-anti the back of the hand of here 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:06.900
 It works well if you push and hold the guitar in the image 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.340
 8 Ness first this is a nice 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:15.150
 Though it is quite good to see the wrist moon 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:20.880
 Please try this as it gets used soon 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:26.890
 It is a place that is exposed to the second point Well index finger of vision 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:32.020
 It will be the point 89 behind the surface 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:36.400
 7 surface rather than here towards the here of the side 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:40.900
 It works well if you use it to hold the strings 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.110
 Please pull f while keeping in mind to use the 9 side 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.160
 The next point is the floor and fingers 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:53.140
 If you have a neck like this with your thumb 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:56.390
 It will point to suppress tight To Gyu' and strong 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:01.610
 Where to suppress all is because Eight Valley code 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:09.800
 I have to do it, but with this finger alone that power is not enough 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.729
 So if you use the 8 thumbs and get pinched like a pair of clothespins from both 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.990
 successfully 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:18.120
 Please try again in reproduction 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:23.410
 I listen to f while paying attention to these three 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:26.190
 First, as the first something good E'Bade 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.690
 But please try to get 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:32.610
 8 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:35.750
 The arrest is this sound, but it is a race and a sound 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.750
 Went up edition 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.980
 Do you become 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:45.950
 Yeah, please this is try to be clean 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.130
 A child says 8 times many times at this time, but this pinch 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:53.550
 Power is important 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:58.080
 There YOUR after while during the day the cat Well first 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:06.510
 It is a fret, but as close as possible to the 9th fret 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:10.200
 Beautiful rear successfully and to suppress the qualification is a good way far away and would away with it towards the Koch 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.810
 Please do keep the people of here because there is not out of a sound 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.800
 And then 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.520
 Hmm 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.960
 this man 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.280
 To be able to put out 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.319
 Please practice 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:30.319
 Sone When you feel like that, next is 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:30.319
 Please pull f minor with your pinky and middle finger 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.080
 You should be able to use it 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:51.230
 When you subtract f and f minor 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:51.230
 89 middle finger Opened middle finger supports the forefinger and it works better when played 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:03.609
 And cattle and Pade to the two fingers 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:07.870
 I wonder if there is no well Ikunja because more force is likely to put in and do an image support 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:12.140
 Finally, if you can do this in the form of this f 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.380
 Hold your middle finger firmly 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.380
 ni 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:21.370
 It will be the turn of ef 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:26.800
 Well Well Kedomo I think a good pull to like this 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:31.169
 It is not a code that can be played immediately just because you said a bone 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:34.270
 8 It is not high enough to make such a beautiful sound come out suddenly 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:40.990
 8 takes time 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:43.150
 As it can draw many times Well Nantsu kana many times about it but I'm such that 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.300
 And while I watch TV 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:51.000
 chord progression with f 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:54.840
 I used to practice by pulling it over and over again 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.840
 That's how it's a song with f 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:04.920
 By repeating the code progression containing f many times over time, 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.430
 Because it sounds like a pretty sound 8 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:08.380
 practice 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:14.470
 I will repeat 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:18.250
 And Well wonder if not it good to use this kind of chord progression as an exercise method that I also was doing 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:23.220
 fg good minor a 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.220
 Chord progression is one just will continue to pull that 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.290
 me 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.290
 Yes 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:32.700
 me 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.120
 ni 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.480
 wh 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.430
 I thought it was good 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.430
 Yeah 2 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.190
 me 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:51.319
 At first it is quite f 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.319
 It is not even beautiful sound but 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:59.900
 Nea Innovation the disk by going to them doing anything times 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:04.340
 Was useless to another Matatsu in Ah was a Imai beautiful sound 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:10.770
 It feels like it gradually gradually while repeating one back and forth 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:15.389
 8 tatami mat was 2 and is to not give up and to be going person, such of the I now memory 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:21.990
 8 Repeat Iteration It is necessary to draw again and again and again and again. 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:24.300
 That way Eto somehow somehow get over the wall with code f f 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:30.569
 I would like to ask 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.760
 It's amazing when Yufu comes to play, so you can hear more songs that you can play. 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:33.350
 Oh dear 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:37.200
 That's why Ana and Maa 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:39.270
 Always or rather advanced that the can not get out 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:46.590
 A child who always hits 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:51.750
 Spotted hitting the wall of the so much beyond this wall all means Well fun key waiting in the earlier 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:54.500
 I think that I would like you to enjoy staying with this time is like this 

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.500
 Thank you very much
