00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 very nice cars, kids, welcome 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.500
 once again to my channel I am kripper and 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.270
 we are back on the beach like everyone 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.980
 today I bring you an impressive nuclea 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.929
 vector that is pretty fast nuclear 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.460
 that I liked a lot and well you go 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.080
 to see how right now I am at the point 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.150
 hot i have already got author clouds 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.830
 vital shot in response to new shot v 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.900
 I'm going to throw the orbital too because if 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.430
 I'm not going to eat it next to 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.350
 kill an enemy more as you see me go 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.109
 to give another therefore it has been two sub 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.939
 orbital state in just 15 seconds that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.099
 in the hot spot if you know how to play with 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.929
 he can get you the rats you want 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.340
 and well let's comment a little bit on 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.829
 theme of the weapon because I carry the vector 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.450
 just with guys butt before 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.980
 nothing wanted to tell you that many 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.750
 You said to take off the hilt 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.450
 in submachine guns since simply 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.890
 reduced the decline in 2% higher the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.360
 truth is that this data I do not know from where 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.800
 you have taken out guys I would like that 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.140
 someone give me the page 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.539
 white officer is 2 where where I say 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.090
 that the grip only reduces 2% already 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.770
 that I'm not a little dizzy that 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.350
 subject because to me the grip gives me very 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.109
 good results and I think that 2% 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.730
 is a 20 or a 25 therefore I would be 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.489
 eternally grateful if someone 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.439
 comments leave me to said page 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.210
 good in you say ostia crivel because 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.220
 you carry the reader only with a handle or 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.290
 be with butt and I simply carry with 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.000
 butt in this game because I was going to 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.439
 put me also the quick-drawn one 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.900
 but he started the game he did not give me 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.189
 time to put those two accessories and 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.570
 Well, the truth is that equally 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.280
 with a stock, it gave me good enough 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.590
 results and I'm pretty happy to 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.909
 this game I wanted to tell you guys that 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.350
 this morning this game is from this 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.820

 for nuclear rises and here you see the 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.610
 brutal indeed I have to climb the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.070
 nuclear 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.530

 triple low with a simple charger the 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.120
 The vector was a very critical moment in 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.740
 which I had a hard time and you see 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.290
 see how I get a triple low and it gives me 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.730
 the medal and the nuclear one a nuclear 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.930
 very fast that I loved 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.790

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.420
 right now I ran out of ammunition and I say 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.190
 yes saved the knife and the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.260
