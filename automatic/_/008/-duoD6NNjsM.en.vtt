there we can go there we can see it so

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.260 
there we can go there we can see it so
first<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.860> all<00:02:01.979> my<00:02:02.189> opinion<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:02.969> I

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
first of all my opinion on this I

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.539 
first of all my opinion on this I
actually<00:02:04.170> think<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.770> really<00:02:05.130> cool

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
actually think it's a really cool

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.490 
actually think it's a really cool
looking<00:02:06.030> little<00:02:06.479> set<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.960> think<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
looking little set I think the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.040 
looking little set I think the
Millennium<00:02:07.920> Falcon<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:09.390> scale<00:02:09.690> I'm

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
Millennium Falcon in this scale I'm

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.839 
Millennium Falcon in this scale I'm
quite<00:02:10.379> surprised<00:02:10.800> how<00:02:11.009> well<00:02:11.190> they've<00:02:11.550> done<00:02:11.580> it

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
quite surprised how well they've done it

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.340 
quite surprised how well they've done it
and<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.030> think<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.360> does<00:02:12.510> look<00:02:12.540> particularly

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
and I think it does look particularly

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.460 
and I think it does look particularly

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.640 

but<00:04:15.819> again<00:04:16.120> obviously<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:17.049> rear<00:04:17.229> shot<00:04:17.500> of<00:04:17.560> it

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
but again obviously the rear shot of it

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.590 
but again obviously the rear shot of it
there<00:04:19.049> and<00:04:20.049> there's<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.350> underside

there and there's the underside
that's<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.690> printed<00:04:24.509> brick<00:04:25.509> there<00:04:26.100> it's<00:04:27.100> like

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
that's a printed brick there it's like

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:39.749 
that's a printed brick there it's like
the<00:04:27.610> head<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.720> a<00:04:31.440> droid<00:04:35.550> okay<00:04:38.250> right<00:04:39.250> so<00:04:39.550> the

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
the head to a droid okay right so the

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:42.719 
the head to a droid okay right so the
other<00:04:39.789> thing<00:04:40.240> we<00:04:40.360> can<00:04:40.509> do<00:04:40.660> with<00:04:40.810> this<00:04:40.979> is<00:04:41.979> Han

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
other thing we can do with this is Han

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.180 
other thing we can do with this is Han
Solo<00:04:43.380> can<00:04:44.380> be<00:04:44.590> seated<00:04:45.009> on<00:04:45.130> this<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.740> there<00:04:48.070> is

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
Solo can be seated on this and there is

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.490 
Solo can be seated on this and there is
a<00:04:48.340> slot<00:04:48.699> here<00:04:49.740> he<00:04:50.740> just<00:04:51.070> simply<00:04:52.169> sits<00:04:53.169> in<00:04:53.320> there

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
a slot here he just simply sits in there

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.620 
a slot here he just simply sits in there
like<00:04:53.680> so

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
like so

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.300 
like so
so<00:04:55.630> there<00:04:55.810> we<00:04:56.020> now<00:04:56.169> have<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.740> Millennium

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
so there we now have the Millennium

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.909 
so there we now have the Millennium
Falcon<00:04:57.990> being<00:04:58.990> piloted<00:04:59.350> by<00:05:00.090> Han<00:05:01.090> Solo<00:05:01.919> but

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
Falcon being piloted by Han Solo but

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.310 
Falcon being piloted by Han Solo but
that<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.310> a<00:05:03.340> that's<00:05:03.820> pretty<00:05:03.940> much<00:05:04.180> it<00:05:04.419> I<00:05:04.600> think

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
that is a that's pretty much it I think

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.700 
that is a that's pretty much it I think
again<00:05:05.849> great<00:05:06.849> little<00:05:07.150> micro<00:05:07.449> set<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:07.930> really

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
again great little micro set I really

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:09.810 
again great little micro set I really
like<00:05:08.830> it<00:05:09.039> don't<00:05:09.160> know<00:05:09.310> what<00:05:09.520> I'm<00:05:09.580> gonna<00:05:09.729> think

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
like it don't know what I'm gonna think

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.580 
like it don't know what I'm gonna think
of<00:05:10.090> all<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.419> other<00:05:10.449> ones<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:10.840> know<00:05:10.990> I'm<00:05:11.139> yet<00:05:11.470> to

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
of all the other ones I know I'm yet to

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.719 
of all the other ones I know I'm yet to
get<00:05:11.710> those<00:05:11.919> but<00:05:12.389> first<00:05:13.389> impressions<00:05:14.729> pretty
