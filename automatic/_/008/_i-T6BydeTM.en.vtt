the<00:00:31.419> next<00:00:31.689> breeding<00:00:31.900> season<00:00:32.470> so<00:00:33.400> I<00:00:33.820> have

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
the next breeding season so I have

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.200 
the next breeding season so I have
technically<00:00:35.500> started<00:00:36.040> this<00:00:36.460> process<00:00:37.000> about

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
technically started this process about

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.470 
technically started this process about
two<00:00:37.540> weeks<00:00:37.750> ago<00:00:38.079> to<00:00:39.070> three<00:00:39.280> weeks<00:00:39.489> ago<00:00:39.640> by

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
two weeks ago to three weeks ago by

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.860 
two weeks ago to three weeks ago by
lowering<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.590> temperature<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:43.239> their<00:00:43.540> tubs

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
lowering the temperature of their tubs

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.840 
lowering the temperature of their tubs
and<00:00:44.200> by<00:00:46.350> reducing<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.890> amount<00:00:48.190> of<00:00:48.370> food<00:00:48.610> and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
and by reducing the amount of food and

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.360 
and by reducing the amount of food and
then<00:00:49.090> two<00:00:49.900> weeks<00:00:49.930> ago<00:00:50.350> I<00:00:50.590> stopped<00:00:51.040> feeding

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:51.370 
then two weeks ago I stopped feeding

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.480 
then two weeks ago I stopped feeding
them<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:52.470> reason<00:00:53.470> being<00:00:53.680> is<00:00:53.950> because<00:00:54.070> I<00:00:54.280> want

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:54.490 
them and reason being is because I want

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.190 
them and reason being is because I want
to<00:00:54.550> make<00:00:54.700> sure<00:00:54.880> that<00:00:55.030> their<00:00:55.270> digestive<00:00:55.960> tract

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.200 
to make sure that their digestive tract

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.580 
to make sure that their digestive tract
is<00:00:56.500> completely<00:00:57.160> clean<00:00:57.490> for<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:57.910> next<00:00:58.090> step

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
is completely clean for the next step

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.680 
is completely clean for the next step
because<00:00:59.590> the<00:00:59.740> next<00:01:00.040> step<00:01:00.130> is<00:01:00.490> these<00:01:01.300> guys<00:01:01.510> are

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
because the next step is these guys are

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.530 
because the next step is these guys are
going<00:01:01.810> to<00:01:01.870> be<00:01:02.020> moved<00:01:02.320> into<00:01:02.740> my<00:01:03.220> basement<00:01:03.540> where

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
going to be moved into my basement where

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.719 
going to be moved into my basement where
the<00:01:04.750> temperature<00:01:05.229> is<00:01:05.259> about<00:01:05.799> sixty<00:01:06.490> to

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
the temperature is about sixty to

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.330 
the temperature is about sixty to
sixty-five<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:07.780> that's<00:01:08.710> the<00:01:09.009> temperature

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
sixty-five and that's the temperature

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.370 
sixty-five and that's the temperature
they<00:01:09.610> will<00:01:09.640> remain<00:01:10.090> at<00:01:10.360> for<00:01:10.659> the<00:01:10.960> next<00:01:10.990> two

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
they will remain at for the next two

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.010 
they will remain at for the next two
months<00:01:11.560> so<00:01:12.520> we<00:01:12.790> do<00:01:12.909> not<00:01:13.090> want<00:01:13.329> no<00:01:13.600> food<00:01:13.840> in

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
months so we do not want no food in

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.600 
months so we do not want no food in
their<00:01:14.200> stomach<00:01:14.650> and<00:01:14.829> their<00:01:14.920> digestion

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
their stomach and their digestion

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.960 
their stomach and their digestion
digestion<00:01:16.450> track<00:01:17.040> whatsoever<00:01:18.040> because<00:01:18.430> that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
digestion track whatsoever because that

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.420 
digestion track whatsoever because that
could<00:01:19.120> rot<00:01:19.420> and<00:01:19.720> lead<00:01:20.590> to<00:01:20.770> their<00:01:20.950> death

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:21.430 
could rot and lead to their death

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.530 
could rot and lead to their death
so<00:01:22.060> I<00:01:22.800> cleaned<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:23.920> tubs<00:01:24.159> out<00:01:24.340> last<00:01:24.550> week<00:01:24.880> very

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
so I cleaned the tubs out last week very

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.250 
so I cleaned the tubs out last week very
few<00:01:25.900> of<00:01:25.960> them<00:01:26.110> had<00:01:26.320> had<00:01:27.310> any<00:01:28.050> number<00:01:29.050> two

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
few of them had had any number two

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.530 
few of them had had any number two
business<00:01:29.710> going<00:01:30.010> on<00:01:30.159> in<00:01:30.340> there<00:01:30.520> so<00:01:30.790> I'm<00:01:31.120> pretty

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
business going on in there so I'm pretty

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.570 
business going on in there so I'm pretty
confident<00:01:32.080> that<00:01:32.200> that<00:01:32.620> their<00:01:32.979> tracks<00:01:33.370> have

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:33.580 
confident that that their tracks have

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.790 
confident that that their tracks have
been<00:01:33.729> cleaned<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:34.330> we<00:01:35.050> will<00:01:35.229> be<00:01:35.350> moving<00:01:35.500> them

and the snakes on the same page is that

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.310 
and the snakes on the same page is that
we<00:02:02.530> both<00:02:02.680> understand<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.810> time<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.229> the

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
we both understand the time of the

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.869 
we both understand the time of the
season<00:02:07.679> more<00:02:08.679> ticular<00:02:09.159> like<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.759> beginning

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:09.879 
season more ticular like the beginning

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:13.170 
season more ticular like the beginning
of<00:02:10.239> breeding<00:02:10.629> season<00:02:11.110> is<00:02:11.260> is<00:02:11.530> really<00:02:12.189> the<00:02:12.909> key

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
of breeding season is is really the key

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.220 
of breeding season is is really the key
point<00:02:14.280> as<00:02:15.280> they<00:02:15.489> breed<00:02:15.760> shortly<00:02:16.180> after<00:02:16.510> coming

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
point as they breed shortly after coming

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.619 
point as they breed shortly after coming
out<00:02:17.319> of<00:02:17.470> formation<00:02:17.769> but<00:02:18.670> again<00:02:19.360> they'll<00:02:19.599> be

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
out of formation but again they'll be

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.980 
out of formation but again they'll be
future<00:02:20.470> video<00:02:20.709> when<00:02:20.890> I<00:02:20.920> bring<00:02:21.189> them<00:02:21.370> up

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
future video when I bring them up

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.330 
future video when I bring them up
so<00:02:22.740> let's<00:02:22.890> be<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.070> quick<00:02:23.940> sneak<00:02:24.270> peek<00:02:24.600> at<00:02:24.840> the
