focusing<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.370> much<00:02:16.430> on<00:02:16.670> numeracy<00:02:17.210> and

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
focusing so much on numeracy and

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.320 
focusing so much on numeracy and
literacy<00:02:17.540> that<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.830> art<00:02:19.010> sort<00:02:19.340> of<00:02:19.430> tends<00:02:20.120> to

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
literacy that the art sort of tends to

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.960 
literacy that the art sort of tends to
take<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.510> bit<00:02:20.780> of<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.960> back<00:02:21.950> step<00:02:22.280> and<00:02:22.550> that's<00:02:22.700> it

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
take a bit of a back step and that's it

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.560 
take a bit of a back step and that's it
said<00:02:23.330> because<00:02:23.770> it's<00:02:24.770> um<00:02:25.160> it's<00:02:25.910> just<00:02:26.060> great<00:02:26.390> for

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
said because it's um it's just great for

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.540 
said because it's um it's just great for
kids<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.050> everything<00:02:28.010> can<00:02:28.280> be<00:02:28.310> taught

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
kids and everything can be taught

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.030 
kids and everything can be taught
through<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:28.970> ads<00:02:29.320> numeracy<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.350> literacy<00:02:30.590> it

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
through the ads numeracy and literacy it

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.100 
through the ads numeracy and literacy it
yet<00:02:31.580> just<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.120> all-encompassing<00:02:32.300> and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
yet just is all-encompassing and

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.920 
yet just is all-encompassing and
brilliant<00:02:33.650> this<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:34.640> an<00:02:34.760> exercise<00:02:35.060> which<00:02:35.720> is

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
brilliant this is an exercise which is

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.370 
brilliant this is an exercise which is
purely<00:02:36.380> about<00:02:36.770> the<00:02:37.190> outreach<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.000> and<00:02:38.450> giving

of the ones that fund that opportunity
for<00:02:44.870> students<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.760> really<00:02:46.990> good

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
for students so it's a really good

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.670 
for students so it's a really good

working in the professional industry but
actually<00:02:56.840> at<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.200> end<00:02:57.320> of<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.470> day<00:02:57.650> there's

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
actually at the end of the day there's

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.060

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
passion and there's love and is joy

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.550 
passion and there's love and is joy
beneath<00:03:01.070> that<00:03:01.340> which<00:03:02.000> actually<00:03:02.180> feeds<00:03:02.660> that

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
beneath that which actually feeds that

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.640 
beneath that which actually feeds that
drive<00:03:03.890> and<00:03:03.920> seriousness<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:05.350> wonder<00:03:06.350> why<00:03:06.440> I<00:03:06.470> say

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
drive and seriousness I wonder why I say

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.750 
drive and seriousness I wonder why I say
the<00:03:06.770> worst<00:03:06.920> job<00:03:07.190> but<00:03:07.370> one<00:03:07.460> of<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.610> most

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
the worst job but one of the most

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.910 
the worst job but one of the most
hardest<00:03:08.090> jobs<00:03:08.270> on<00:03:08.390> this<00:03:08.540> tall<00:03:08.990> would<00:03:09.650> probably

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
hardest jobs on this tall would probably

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.620 
hardest jobs on this tall would probably
be<00:03:10.070> few<00:03:10.340> in<00:03:10.610> the<00:03:10.880> production<00:03:11.210> if<00:03:11.450> you're

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
be few in the production if you're

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.830 
be few in the production if you're
behind<00:03:12.410> the<00:03:12.680> scenes<00:03:12.950> making<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.820> set<00:03:14.090> clean

it's<00:03:20.990> not<00:03:21.170> easy<00:03:21.350> it's<00:03:21.680> probably<00:03:21.980> not<00:03:22.130> exactly

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
it's not easy it's probably not exactly

go on at all actually you know they're
just<00:03:50.000> as<00:03:50.270> important<00:03:50.690> as<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:50.900> dances<00:03:51.760> if<00:03:52.760> not

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.660 
just as important as the dances if not
more<00:03:53.209> important<00:03:53.630> sometimes<00:03:53.840> because<00:03:54.500> we<00:03:55.370> rely

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
more important sometimes because we rely

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.720 
more important sometimes because we rely

coming<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.620> gadsden<00:05:11.979> I<00:05:12.280> think<00:05:13.210> it's<00:05:13.389> the

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:13.569 
coming to gadsden I think it's the

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.390 
coming to gadsden I think it's the
narrative<00:05:14.020> story<00:05:14.349> of<00:05:14.560> Pinocchio<00:05:14.740> that's

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
narrative story of Pinocchio that's

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.300 
narrative story of Pinocchio that's
going<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:15.759> really<00:05:16.000> a<00:05:16.150> appeal<00:05:17.050> and<00:05:17.319> in<00:05:17.740> times

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
going to really a appeal and in times

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.399 
going to really a appeal and in times
like<00:05:18.520> we've<00:05:18.669> got<00:05:18.849> nail<00:05:19.090> with<00:05:19.300> is<00:05:19.419> a<00:05:19.449> recession

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:20.409 
like we've got nail with is a recession

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:22.559 
like we've got nail with is a recession
on<00:05:20.530> and<00:05:20.770> it<00:05:20.860> certainly<00:05:21.069> is<00:05:22.060> showing<00:05:22.449> its

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
on and it certainly is showing its

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.480 
on and it certainly is showing its
impact<00:05:22.990> in<00:05:23.110> bismuth<00:05:23.469> and<00:05:23.650> I<00:05:23.710> think<00:05:23.979> in<00:05:24.250> those

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
impact in bismuth and I think in those

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.350 
impact in bismuth and I think in those
times<00:05:25.180> narrative<00:05:26.020> stories<00:05:26.500> like<00:05:26.710> Pinocchio
