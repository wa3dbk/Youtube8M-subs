 you people do not care about horses 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.579
 I'm happy to meet you 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.240

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:26.439
 duty 4 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.390
 we are in team death match on 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.759
 ambush and before you start this little 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.320
 commentary I would first like to thank 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:37.239
 the cocef community channel that wanted 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.100
 I'm raining from the first episode of black 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.579
 up so I invite you to click on the 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.379
 notation 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.230
 if you have not seen this first episode 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.680
 who was on black ops 1 and so that's it 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.730
 you have stable in noticed at the beginning of 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.809
 the video there is always the introduction 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.820
 of quotas simply because I have 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.220
 tried to implode 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.769
 this second episode on on their channel 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.030
 and so here I thank you all 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.439
 particularly sluggish and ben that's a 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.479
 chain that allows me to advance on my 

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:05.950
 on youtube and so here is so 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.690
 today what everything about ambush 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.040
 on dimension 4 and 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.220
 today I have twenty small subjects 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.190
 specific to you so you grant 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.330
 I do not really talk about the gameplay 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.070
 finally me I let you watch what 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.640
 I'm going to do a little violent very 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.370
 nice 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.950
 my wife is so today I you 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.150
 talk about a subject that keeps me right 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.120
 maybe at heart because a lot 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.260
 of you may even be 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.430
 polemics still debates 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.450
 I would really like to debate with you 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.430
 about graphics on a make a 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.720
 play so I can talk about particular 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.280
 call of duty but I can talk too 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.850
 from other games because there are a lot 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.930
 to make more and more games are from 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.370
 more and more beautiful what is normal 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.100
 since we advance in technology 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.890
 in fine good short so what call of 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.520
 duty is a game that has made 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.900
 controversy 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.270
 simply because for several 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.090
 years in the game uses the same engine 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.440
 chart whether it's finally not for 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.990
 all call of duty but finally good 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:08.270
 short rumors like what the engine 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.800
 would finally change like every year 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.590
 by the way since black ops of I think 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.030
 that rumors say that cuba the 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.040
 engine will change when we change but 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.140
 soul this year the next call of 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.400
 duty that will be released in 2014 they 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.320
 would change graphic engine is what 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.870
 is true that bah we would all be entitled to 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.489
 many things besides which is 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.989
 formalized is that the next call 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.170
 of duty will not be developed by 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.330
 treyarch but well by sledgehammer ones 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.980
 who did they have that they were 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.780
 partners in quotation marks with my 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.850
 girl you see for modern warfare 3 but 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.380
 it will be fully developed by 600 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.269
 kids 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.190
 excuse me for the pronunciations but 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.890
 here 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.210
 well, well, let's go back to our subject 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.380
 on the graphics on the graphics 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.210
 it's true that many of you 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.860
 play a game maybe not for the 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:53.440
 graphics entirely but it's true 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.710
 that it contributes a lot when you 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.810
 play I think your goal is not 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.160
 to shoot disgusting characters 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.130
 like on wii for that matter it's not very 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.890
 nice but it's true that there is foot 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.140
 coating and miami given that the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.820
 console is not a game finally good brief 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.280
 I would like to debate with you on 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.710
 the usefulness of fine graphics and you 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.070
 play pretty much let's say a whole for 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.810
 percentage for what impact the 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.370
 does graphics according to you in a 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.620
 game do you play for the 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.120
 handling fa gameplay between between 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.840
 quotation marks for example here this is the 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.340
 wiimote is what controlling 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.640
 your character with your wrists and 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.940
 it's with their image or simply 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.770
 does it get better we forget the 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.680
 disgusting graphics of the wii it's 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:46.330
 true it's a little debate that deserves 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.770
 to be done finally good good it's 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.090
 true that the graphics in a game 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:54.610
 it's for me it's finally 1.1 point 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.490
 something that is rather weird on 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.650
 is that 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.390
 here I am I was all the time 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.740
 on wii before but heard i'm on 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.440
 hd consoles for several years 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.610
 now 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.060
 finally good brief 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.920
 and it's true that to move to a 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.230
 quality like that and in hd 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.810
 well, it's true that it changes 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.459
 a lot but it's true that we are 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.230
 often when we play these two 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:25.980
 versions we are not really out of place 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:26.910
 I mean it's just that and it's 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.650
 so here I really want to 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.390
 debate with you about that but me it's 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.770
 really a little debate any 1 I 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.860
 I'm not even going to throw a big 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.750
 big debate so for what's left at 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.630
 thousandth please not or already at the three 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.340
 quarters facing the other case of what I 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:45.570
 my name is Alexis I am 17 years old and I do 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.060
 damage barely a little bit of everything and 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.890
 of anything either on a system of 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.630
 retro game finally we really did 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.130
 machine is quite diverse like trick 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.830
 invite you to go see how I did 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.600
 a a presentation my channel you 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.260
 see all this in the description 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.280
 on both sides I hope that fight for that 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.170
 than what is my chain simply 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.640
 and then for that you subscribe to my 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.320
 subscribers for that subscribe next 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:11.400
 closed that banks offer gameplay 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.630
 any call of 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.160
 and then in more hungry that's it 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.480
 really young youtube who is he 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.080
 is really about helping the little tubes 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.210
 hours and so here I have a little done the 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.940
 turn of what I'm going to say is 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:27.250
 and that's just so thankfully 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:30.639
 gameplay I'm going to do a little bit of 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.630
 famsi carnage time was getting that ben 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.470
 here are the enemies were not 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:37.930
 overpowered either but but that's 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:41.710
 true that I had that I had very little 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:43.660
 played at code 4 finally y'a long done 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.220
 I did not play much side by side 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.729
 good cuba for me it's not my 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.470
 prefer 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.780
 unlike many others 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:52.240
 youtuber code 4 is a little man 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.240
 their rating their call of duty fetish game 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.740
 for me it's world at war 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.690
 given that bako of 4 finally good brief 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.150
 it's everyone and segou I want to say 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.190
 but rating 4 is not too much not really 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:07.960
 my favorite finally good I think you 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:10.389
 by doing a bit of my life and is therefore 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:15.340
 here I wanted a little you speak 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:17.380
 also the time of the end of the gameplay 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.360
 I honestly told you a little bit of 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.370
 of the killstreak system and is 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:26.340
 attributed to this call of duty so we have 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:29.349
 that three killstreaks namely the drone 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:32.530
 an airstrike and the helicopter that 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:34.840
 according to me was really just low just 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.240
 well surprisingly because self that the 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.770
 like ghost or black bath ops we have 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.740
 a lot of killstreak what's 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:43.539
 could rot the game and it's true that 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:46.570
 when we see this time there was 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:47.949
 little rage quit a woman I just 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.210
 d unlocked for the third or 

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.820
 second time I know more the choice than 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:53.340
 the third time an air strike 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:57.889
 and then besides I come from 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:00.080
 to chain on three to the second by 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:03.660
 attacked helicopter 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.910
 finally here is especially I'm going to start 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.740
 finally I'm going to finish on a score of 

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.690
 29 to 3 I still hope that this 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.699
 little gameplay you will have liked 

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:14.699
 do not hesitate to tell me in space 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.750
 comment if you liked it or not 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:16.470
 little con material this little gameplay 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.760
 in any case I tell you to very 

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:19.940
 soon for a next video by all 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.940
 the world
