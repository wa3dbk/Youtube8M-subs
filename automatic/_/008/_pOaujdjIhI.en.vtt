00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.770 
be bet more travel or better spring and
and<00:04:26.919> I<00:04:27.130> think<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.400> spring<00:04:27.669> collapsed<00:04:28.180> in<00:04:28.720> the

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
and I think the spring collapsed in the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.200 
and I think the spring collapsed in the
left<00:04:29.050> front<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:30.460> know<00:04:30.550> about<00:04:30.729> ten<00:04:30.970> laps

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
left front and you know about ten laps

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.640 
left front and you know about ten laps
in<00:04:31.419> the<00:04:31.510> race<00:04:31.539> I<00:04:31.810> can<00:04:31.960> feel<00:04:32.110> it<00:04:32.260> down<00:04:32.380> on<00:04:32.560> the

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
in the race I can feel it down on the

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.529 
in the race I can feel it down on the
left<00:04:32.830> front<00:04:32.979> real<00:04:33.190> bad<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:33.669> we'd<00:04:34.120> take<00:04:34.330> wedge

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
left front real bad and we'd take wedge

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.330 
left front real bad and we'd take wedge
out<00:04:34.810> and<00:04:35.110> it'd<00:04:35.289> get<00:04:35.440> tighter<00:04:35.710> so<00:04:35.979> I<00:04:36.010> knew<00:04:36.220> it

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
out and it'd get tighter so I knew it

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.589 
out and it'd get tighter so I knew it
was<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.610> could<00:04:36.760> feel<00:04:36.940> it<00:04:37.060> down<00:04:37.150> on<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.419> left

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
was I could feel it down on that left

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:40.140 
was I could feel it down on that left
front<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:37.960> you<00:04:38.560> know<00:04:38.650> just<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.789> can't<00:04:40.000> make

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
front and you know just you can't make

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:41.370 
front and you know just you can't make
mistakes<00:04:40.479> like<00:04:40.630> that<00:04:40.810> in<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:40.930> chase<00:04:41.139> you<00:04:41.349> know

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
mistakes like that in the chase you know

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.110 
mistakes like that in the chase you know
you<00:04:41.530> can't<00:04:41.770> make<00:04:42.190> guesses<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.760> we<00:04:42.910> made<00:04:43.090> a

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
you can't make guesses and we made a

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.969 
you can't make guesses and we made a
guess<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:43.599> two<00:04:43.990> mistakes<00:04:44.320> tonight<00:04:44.650> that<00:04:44.800> left

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
guess and two mistakes tonight that left

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.170 
guess and two mistakes tonight that left
front<00:04:45.130> spring<00:04:45.430> and<00:04:45.580> then<00:04:45.669> you<00:04:45.820> know<00:04:45.910> left<00:04:46.060> the

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
front spring and then you know left the

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.779 
front spring and then you know left the
wheel<00:04:46.330> loose<00:04:46.539> and<00:04:47.110> Greg<00:04:47.320> leaves<00:04:47.560> 122<00:04:48.400> points

out of the lead Matt in Casey Mears

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:51.960 
out of the lead Matt in Casey Mears
stayed<00:04:50.650> out<00:04:50.770> didn't<00:04:51.190> pay<00:04:51.340> your<00:04:51.550> car<00:04:51.789> seemed

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
stayed out didn't pay your car seemed

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:53.279 
stayed out didn't pay your car seemed
like<00:04:52.060> it<00:04:52.150> took<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.300> little<00:04:52.389> while<00:04:52.599> to<00:04:52.660> get<00:04:52.840> going

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:53.289 
like it took a little while to get going

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:55.260 
like it took a little while to get going
it<00:04:53.889> took<00:04:54.010> a<00:04:54.070> long<00:04:54.280> while<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.639> get<00:04:54.789> going<00:04:55.000> after

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
it took a long while to get going after

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:56.820 
it took a long while to get going after
about<00:04:55.419> 20<00:04:55.720> laps<00:04:55.840> we<00:04:56.380> were<00:04:56.440> the<00:04:56.530> fastest

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
about 20 laps we were the fastest

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.500 
about 20 laps we were the fastest
calling<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.130> track<00:04:57.340> but<00:04:57.940> they<00:04:58.120> got<00:04:58.240> the<00:04:58.389> guys

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
calling the track but they got the guys

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.850 
calling the track but they got the guys
that<00:04:58.630> stretched<00:04:58.930> out<00:04:59.080> so<00:04:59.260> far<00:04:59.470> that<00:04:59.680> took<00:04:59.830> a

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
that stretched out so far that took a

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.980 
that stretched out so far that took a
while<00:04:59.919> for<00:05:00.070> us<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.370> run<00:05:00.520> them<00:05:00.610> back<00:05:00.760> down<00:05:00.970> and<00:05:01.389> I

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
while for us to run them back down and I

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.480 
while for us to run them back down and I
guess<00:05:02.500> that<00:05:02.650> caution<00:05:02.800> came<00:05:02.979> out<00:05:03.160> there<00:05:03.340> at<00:05:03.400> the

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
guess that caution came out there at the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.890 
guess that caution came out there at the
end<00:05:03.610> I<00:05:03.729> don't<00:05:04.030> really<00:05:04.150> see<00:05:04.360> I<00:05:04.389> guess<00:05:04.720> there's

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
end I don't really see I guess there's

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.150 
end I don't really see I guess there's
some<00:05:05.110> debris<00:05:05.289> or<00:05:05.500> something<00:05:05.710> like<00:05:05.800> that<00:05:05.860> but

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
some debris or something like that but

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.040 
some debris or something like that but
if<00:05:06.910> it<00:05:07.060> wouldn't<00:05:07.270> came<00:05:07.510> out<00:05:07.660> I<00:05:07.690> think<00:05:07.900> we<00:05:07.960> would

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
if it wouldn't came out I think we would

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.170 
if it wouldn't came out I think we would
out<00:05:08.169> of<00:05:08.289> shot<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.590> win<00:05:08.740> you<00:05:09.520> know<00:05:09.639> that<00:05:09.820> the

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
out of shot the win you know that the

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.430 
out of shot the win you know that the
caller<00:05:10.570> Jenna<00:05:10.810> made<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.020> stay<00:05:11.169> out<00:05:11.289> I<00:05:11.320> think

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
caller Jenna made to stay out I think

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.170 
caller Jenna made to stay out I think
was<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.710> right<00:05:11.800> decision<00:05:11.949> just<00:05:12.789> because<00:05:13.060> we

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
was the right decision just because we

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.790 
was the right decision just because we
were<00:05:13.240> so<00:05:13.419> bad<00:05:13.570> on<00:05:13.750> these<00:05:13.900> tires<00:05:14.080> we<00:05:14.380> would<00:05:14.710> have

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:14.800 
were so bad on these tires we would have

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.560 
were so bad on these tires we would have
bump<00:05:14.949> the<00:05:15.010> brushes<00:05:15.340> up<00:05:15.460> and<00:05:15.610> tried<00:05:15.760> to<00:05:15.789> go<00:05:15.970> but

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
bump the brushes up and tried to go but

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.270 
bump the brushes up and tried to go but
we<00:05:17.020> were<00:05:17.080> just<00:05:17.199> worried<00:05:17.500> that<00:05:17.560> it<00:05:18.010> would<00:05:18.099> just

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.280 
we were just worried that it would just

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:20.010 
we were just worried that it would just
took<00:05:18.340> a<00:05:18.430> while<00:05:18.580> to<00:05:18.610> get<00:05:18.789> going<00:05:19.120> and<00:05:19.240> and<00:05:19.539> I

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
took a while to get going and and I

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.150 
took a while to get going and and I
think<00:05:20.260> it<00:05:20.320> was<00:05:20.410> right<00:05:20.500> call<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:20.740> mean<00:05:20.919> we<00:05:20.979> stayed

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
think it was right call I mean we stayed

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.589 
think it was right call I mean we stayed
out<00:05:21.250> there<00:05:21.400> we<00:05:21.490> got<00:05:21.580> a<00:05:21.610> good<00:05:21.789> finish<00:05:22.090> real

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599
