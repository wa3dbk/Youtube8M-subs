00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.010

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.050
 in scene I have let warm some 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.020

 as you will see the egg cup is coming out 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:41.619
 over medium heat I will prepare the salad 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:41.619
 to accompany the riverbank 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.680
 As you will see, the egg cups have been left 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.430
 I'm going to put out the fire to proceed to 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.850
 Plating like that has been the fried egg 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.280
 to my style 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.440
 which is served with a portion of 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.159

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.480
 lettuce salad 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.910
 and a corn 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.760
 If you can if you want you can also be with 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.120
