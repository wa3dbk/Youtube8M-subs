00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
my name I think actually what I really

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.750 
my name I think actually what I really
true<00:05:05.900> thought<00:05:06.170> before<00:05:07.100> this<00:05:07.370> whole<00:05:07.580> season

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
true thought before this whole season

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.080 
true thought before this whole season
we're<00:05:08.570> actually<00:05:08.750> working<00:05:09.110> really<00:05:09.470> hard<00:05:09.590> and

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
we're actually working really hard and

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.460 
we're actually working really hard and
you<00:05:11.090> know<00:05:11.180> I<00:05:11.240> expected<00:05:11.750> us<00:05:11.840> to<00:05:11.870> work<00:05:12.080> hard<00:05:12.290> but

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
you know I expected us to work hard but

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.490 
you know I expected us to work hard but
still<00:05:12.890> at<00:05:12.980> a<00:05:13.040> very<00:05:13.070> competitive<00:05:13.340> level<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.500> we

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
still at a very competitive level and we

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.900 
still at a very competitive level and we
don't<00:05:15.620> expect<00:05:15.980> anything<00:05:16.160> just<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.490> come<00:05:16.640> to<00:05:16.790> us

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
don't expect anything just to come to us

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.250 
don't expect anything just to come to us
and<00:05:17.060> that's<00:05:17.390> actually<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.780> uplifting

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
and that's actually the uplifting

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.350 
and that's actually the uplifting
because<00:05:18.410> I<00:05:18.470> was<00:05:18.620> kind<00:05:18.830> of<00:05:18.860> worried<00:05:19.490> about<00:05:20.300> a

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
because I was kind of worried about a

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.660 
because I was kind of worried about a
thing<00:05:20.510> too<00:05:20.720> complacent<00:05:21.080> into<00:05:21.620> now<00:05:22.280> we're

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
thing too complacent into now we're

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.130 
thing too complacent into now we're
gonna<00:05:22.790> be<00:05:22.940> good<00:05:23.150> will<00:05:23.360> be<00:05:23.480> no<00:05:23.630> laughs<00:05:23.870> many

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:24.140 
gonna be good will be no laughs many

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.300 
gonna be good will be no laughs many
players<00:05:24.290> back<00:05:24.590> but<00:05:24.800> that<00:05:24.920> really<00:05:24.980> has<00:05:25.160> been

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
players back but that really has been

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.690 
players back but that really has been
the<00:05:25.370> case

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.129 

yeah<00:05:30.630> it's<00:05:31.020> pretty<00:05:31.200> close

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:32.139 
yeah it's pretty close

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.140 
yeah it's pretty close
you<00:05:32.560> know<00:05:32.650> unfortunately<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:33.430> a<00:05:33.759> lot<00:05:33.909> of<00:05:33.999> time<00:05:34.120> I

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
you know unfortunately I a lot of time I

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.360 
you know unfortunately I a lot of time I
think<00:05:34.449> back<00:05:34.629> to<00:05:34.749> the<00:05:34.840> 05<00:05:35.169> team<00:05:35.469> and<00:05:35.710> that<00:05:36.069> still

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
think back to the 05 team and that still

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.709 
think back to the 05 team and that still
wasn't<00:05:36.520> considered<00:05:37.180> a<00:05:37.240> great<00:05:37.389> season

00:05:37.709 --> 00:05:37.719 
wasn't considered a great season

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:41.070 
wasn't considered a great season
standards<00:05:38.469> that<00:05:39.370> we<00:05:39.460> have<00:05:39.669> but<00:05:39.939> uh<00:05:39.999> it<00:05:40.870> knows<00:05:41.050> a

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
standards that we have but uh it knows a

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.719 
standards that we have but uh it knows a
good<00:05:41.319> here<00:05:41.740> in<00:05:41.889> a<00:05:42.129> beat<00:05:42.279> Notre<00:05:42.490> Dame<00:05:42.699> and

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
good here in a beat Notre Dame and

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.909 
good here in a beat Notre Dame and
festival<00:05:43.330> but<00:05:43.539> that<00:05:44.050> was<00:05:44.169> a<00:05:44.199> pretty<00:05:44.409> darn<00:05:44.680> deep

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
festival but that was a pretty darn deep

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:46.769 
festival but that was a pretty darn deep
team<00:05:45.189> as<00:05:45.370> well<00:05:45.550> you<00:05:46.389> know<00:05:46.509> from<00:05:46.689> the

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779 
team as well you know from the

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:49.140 
team as well you know from the
linebacker<00:05:47.169> spot<00:05:47.379> to<00:05:47.710> receiver<00:05:48.069> to<00:05:48.430> you<00:05:49.029> know

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
linebacker spot to receiver to you know

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.119 
linebacker spot to receiver to you know
to<00:05:49.210> the<00:05:49.360> line<00:05:49.599> things<00:05:49.960> like<00:05:50.080> that<00:05:50.259> that's<00:05:51.009> a

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:51.129 
to the line things like that that's a

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:53.129 
to the line things like that that's a
pretty<00:05:51.310> deep<00:05:51.789> team<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:52.330> I<00:05:52.360> think<00:05:52.569> that<00:05:52.749> this

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
pretty deep team and I think that this

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.469 
pretty deep team and I think that this
one<00:05:53.409> will<00:05:53.529> hopefully<00:05:53.710> will<00:05:53.919> reflect<00:05:54.240> that<00:05:55.240> one

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
one will hopefully will reflect that one

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:57.450 
one will hopefully will reflect that one
in<00:05:55.960> the<00:05:56.080> long<00:05:56.289> run<00:05:56.319> but<00:05:56.919> as<00:05:57.039> of<00:05:57.129> right<00:05:57.189> now<00:05:57.340> we

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
in the long run but as of right now we

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.519 
in the long run but as of right now we
got<00:05:57.610> to<00:05:57.669> take<00:05:57.759> care<00:05:57.789> of<00:05:57.999> our<00:05:58.150> in<00:05:58.479> a<00:05:58.629> season

00:05:59.519 --> 00:05:59.529 
got to take care of our in a season

00:05:59.529 --> 00:06:01.529 
got to take care of our in a season
first<00:05:59.770> and<00:06:00.069> you<00:06:00.879> never<00:06:01.150> know<00:06:01.270> hopefully<00:06:01.419> we

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:01.539 
first and you never know hopefully we

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.719 
first and you never know hopefully we
hoped<00:06:02.110> higher<00:06:02.349> regard<00:06:02.770> than<00:06:02.830> 05<00:06:03.279> but<00:06:03.520> that<00:06:03.610> was

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
hoped higher regard than 05 but that was

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:10.760 
hoped higher regard than 05 but that was
a<00:06:03.759> really<00:06:03.969> good<00:06:04.180> team<00:06:04.360> as<00:06:04.449> well

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.129 

I<00:06:10.849> guess<00:06:11.849> they're<00:06:12.030> still<00:06:12.569> against<00:06:12.870> there's

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:13.139 
I guess they're still against there's

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.129 
I guess they're still against there's
other<00:06:13.319> aspects<00:06:13.830> of<00:06:14.009> it<00:06:14.479> there's<00:06:15.479> there's<00:06:15.750> like

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
other aspects of it there's there's like

other aspects of it there's there's like

I said there's a lot of people out there

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.800 
I said there's a lot of people out there
that<00:06:17.520> respect<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.090> winners<00:06:18.389> there's<00:06:18.660> a<00:06:18.690> lot

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:18.810

more to it um if you throw on a

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.230 
more to it um if you throw on a

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 
different team you know unless in the

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.360 
different team you know unless in the
SEC<00:06:30.690> sometimes<00:06:31.169> I'm<00:06:31.440> sitting<00:06:31.710> in<00:06:31.800> the<00:06:31.949> pac-10

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
SEC sometimes I'm sitting in the pac-10

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.550 
SEC sometimes I'm sitting in the pac-10
or<00:06:32.699> I'm<00:06:32.789> sitting<00:06:33.120> somewhere<00:06:33.900> not<00:06:34.080> affiliated

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
or I'm sitting somewhere not affiliated

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.219 
or I'm sitting somewhere not affiliated
with<00:06:34.590> the<00:06:34.740> school<00:06:34.940> I<00:06:35.940> could<00:06:36.539> see<00:06:36.720> that<00:06:36.870> that's

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
with the school I could see that that's

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:38.540 
with the school I could see that that's
what<00:06:37.409> I<00:06:37.440> think<00:06:37.740> because<00:06:37.889> you're<00:06:38.159> always<00:06:38.280> to<00:06:38.520> a

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
what I think because you're always to a

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.010 
what I think because you're always to a
point<00:06:38.849> where<00:06:38.909> like<00:06:39.000> i'll<00:06:39.240> be<00:06:39.270> your<00:06:39.509> feet<00:06:39.659> maybe

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
point where like i'll be your feet maybe

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.629 
point where like i'll be your feet maybe
we<00:06:40.289> do<00:06:40.470> it<00:06:40.620> like<00:06:40.800> we're<00:06:40.979> like<00:06:41.039> i<00:06:41.220> will<00:06:41.370> repeat

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 
we do it like we're like i will repeat

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:43.730 
we do it like we're like i will repeat
that<00:06:41.849> we<00:06:42.030> would<00:06:42.150> beat<00:06:42.360> these<00:06:42.539> guys<00:06:42.569> and<00:06:43.349> you

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
that we would beat these guys and you

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:44.960 
that we would beat these guys and you
automatically<00:06:44.190> assume<00:06:44.520> that<00:06:44.759> you<00:06:44.909> know

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
automatically assume that you know

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:50.120 
automatically assume that you know
they're<00:06:45.630> weaker<00:06:45.990> team<00:06:46.729> so<00:06:47.729> i<00:06:48.120> think<00:06:48.720> i<00:06:49.259> can<00:06:49.830> see

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.130 
they're weaker team so i think i can see

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.409 
they're weaker team so i think i can see
myself<00:06:50.310> that<00:06:50.550> I'm<00:06:50.639> just<00:06:50.789> a<00:06:50.849> super<00:06:51.060> competitive

00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 
myself that I'm just a super competitive

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:52.580 
myself that I'm just a super competitive
guy<00:06:51.599> so<00:06:51.870> really<00:06:52.110> I<00:06:52.169> think<00:06:52.199> I've<00:06:52.470> been

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:52.590 
guy so really I think I've been

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.839 
guy so really I think I've been
everybody<00:06:52.949> else<00:06:53.159> out<00:06:53.370> there<00:06:55.520> in<00:06:56.520> the<00:06:56.639> long<00:06:56.819> run

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:56.849 
everybody else out there in the long run

00:06:56.849 --> 00:06:58.640 
everybody else out there in the long run
I<00:06:57.060> think<00:06:57.150> yeah<00:06:57.630> i<00:06:57.690> think<00:06:57.870> i<00:06:58.169> think<00:06:58.259> i<00:06:58.500> would

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
I think yeah i think i think i would

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.870 
I think yeah i think i think i would
probably<00:06:58.979> a<00:06:59.009> little<00:06:59.130> frustrated<00:06:59.639> as<00:06:59.699> well

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 
probably a little frustrated as well

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.309 
probably a little frustrated as well
because<00:07:00.240> if<00:07:00.659> you<00:07:00.810> don't<00:07:00.870> get<00:07:00.990> a<00:07:01.050> chance<00:07:01.199> to

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 
because if you don't get a chance to

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:02.540 
because if you don't get a chance to
play<00:07:01.530> us<00:07:01.710> you<00:07:01.949> think<00:07:02.190> that<00:07:02.310> you're<00:07:02.400> better

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:02.550 
play us you think that you're better

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.219 
play us you think that you're better
than<00:07:02.759> us<00:07:02.909> and<00:07:03.150> I<00:07:03.360> mean<00:07:03.569> that's<00:07:03.690> and<00:07:03.990> that's<00:07:04.050> a

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:04.229 
than us and I mean that's and that's a

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.580 
than us and I mean that's and that's a
you<00:07:04.530> should<00:07:04.740> I<00:07:04.949> mean<00:07:05.190> I<00:07:05.310> think<00:07:06.349> you<00:07:07.349> probably

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590 
you should I mean I think you probably

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.559 
you should I mean I think you probably
get<00:07:08.370> more<00:07:08.490> frustrated<00:07:09.120> in<00:07:09.180> the<00:07:09.210> sense<00:07:09.449> that

00:07:09.559 --> 00:07:09.569 
get more frustrated in the sense that

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:11.149 
get more frustrated in the sense that
guy<00:07:09.870> I<00:07:10.110> would<00:07:10.289> I<00:07:10.319> really<00:07:10.680> just<00:07:10.830> wish<00:07:10.919> I<00:07:11.039> had<00:07:11.129> a

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:11.159 
guy I would I really just wish I had a

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:12.649 
guy I would I really just wish I had a
chance<00:07:11.340> to<00:07:11.490> play<00:07:11.580> the<00:07:11.729> team<00:07:11.940> just<00:07:12.210> a<00:07:12.360> witness

00:07:12.649 --> 00:07:12.659 
chance to play the team just a witness

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:14.420 
chance to play the team just a witness
it<00:07:12.780> might<00:07:12.930> don't<00:07:13.050> myself<00:07:13.530> more<00:07:14.009> than<00:07:14.129> actually

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:14.430 
it might don't myself more than actually

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.559 
it might don't myself more than actually
mad<00:07:14.580> at<00:07:14.699> them<00:07:14.849> for<00:07:14.880> doing<00:07:15.180> what<00:07:15.389> they're<00:07:15.539> doing

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:15.569 
mad at them for doing what they're doing

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:18.140 
mad at them for doing what they're doing
you<00:07:16.530> know<00:07:16.650> if<00:07:16.710> we<00:07:16.830> are<00:07:17.490> going<00:07:17.759> back<00:07:17.849> to<00:07:17.909> another

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
you know if we are going back to another

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.999 
you know if we are going back to another
championship<00:07:18.330> year<00:07:18.960> you<00:07:19.319> know<00:07:19.409> every<00:07:19.740> year

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:20.009 
championship year you know every year

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:22.040 
championship year you know every year
because<00:07:20.430> with<00:07:20.880> one<00:07:21.120> loss<00:07:21.300> with<00:07:21.659> two<00:07:21.810> losses

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:22.050 
because with one loss with two losses

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:24.110 
because with one loss with two losses
and<00:07:22.259> that's<00:07:22.409> a<00:07:22.469> different<00:07:22.770> case<00:07:22.889> but<00:07:23.699> you<00:07:24.000> know

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
and that's a different case but you know

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.399 
and that's a different case but you know
the<00:07:24.210> going<00:07:24.419> two<00:07:24.479> feet<00:07:24.659> of<00:07:24.690> one<00:07:24.930> year<00:07:25.110> then<00:07:25.289> they

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:25.409 
the going two feet of one year then they

00:07:25.409 --> 00:07:27.920 
the going two feet of one year then they
slip<00:07:25.800> in<00:07:25.949> in<00:07:26.159> the<00:07:26.729> second<00:07:27.090> year<00:07:27.120> for<00:07:27.539> avid

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
slip in in the second year for avid

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.540 
slip in in the second year for avid
reasons<00:07:28.289> losing<00:07:28.680> people<00:07:29.039> losing<00:07:29.219> with<00:07:29.430> the

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550 
reasons losing people losing with the

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:30.620 
reasons losing people losing with the
season<00:07:29.849> I<00:07:29.969> wouldn't<00:07:30.180> get<00:07:30.300> too<00:07:30.360> frustrated

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.630 
season I wouldn't get too frustrated

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.450 
season I wouldn't get too frustrated
about<00:07:31.020> that<00:07:31.289> but<00:07:31.529> I'd<00:07:31.919> probably<00:07:32.190> more

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 
about that but I'd probably more

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.920 
about that but I'd probably more
frustrated<00:07:33.000> about<00:07:33.090> the<00:07:33.300> opportunity<00:07:33.810> not

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:33.930 
frustrated about the opportunity not

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:35.240 
frustrated about the opportunity not

being able to play that team know
