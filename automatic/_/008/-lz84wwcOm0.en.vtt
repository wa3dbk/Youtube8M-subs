00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.450
 let's prepare toasted yolk nougat 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.700
 this is a new version of nougat 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.520
 typical of toasted yolk that I already have 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.610
 presented in another video for it we go 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.240
 to need 300 grams of almond 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:29.950
 milled 300 grams of sugar 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:33.010
 three yolks a whole egg and another egg 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:36.940
 to paint at the end above the 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:40.660
 nougat in a casserole we put the 300 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:44.769
 grams of sugar the 3 yolks and one egg 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:48.100
 whole and a little squirt of water nothing a 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.870
 bullshit that is not big we put it to 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.930
 low fire and now we will go stirring 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:56.470
 constantly with a tongue so that 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:59.680
 do not stick to the bottom of the casserole 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.229
 way that everything dissolves very well a 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.010
 Once the sugar is dissolved and everything 

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:07.360
 form a cremita we will add the almond 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.070
 milled 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.430
 while d we do not see constantly 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.710
 we have to have the basic fire very 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.810
 basic since you do not have to boil in 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.750
 no time because if they would not stick 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.430
 the eggs then to very basic fire 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.620
 just to melt the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.040
 sugar 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.780
 you must be thinking 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.320
 constantly scratching well the bottom of 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.020
 the cazuelita so that it does not stick 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.720
 5 to 10 minutes until you do not 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.860
 Wait until the sugar has melted 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.550
 the sugar granite is no longer 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.490
 and especially not to boil once 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.380
 we have already dissolved the sugar and well 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.890
 mixed this for a few 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.010
 minutes let's add the almond 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.600
 ground we have been throwing almonds to 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:00.670
 low fire and we keep stirring 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.650
 until finishing all the almonds that 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.200
 we have 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.080
 to make the nougat we already have 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.880
 mixed well all the ingredients 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.540
 now we are going to line a mold 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:16.690
 rectangular what you have at home what 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.870
 We are going to cover with vegetal paper for 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.200
 pour the mixture until we have here 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.930
 and make the nougat shape 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.470
 we have already poured the dough into the mold with 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.930
 paper now helping us with the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.980
 very clean hands let's press the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:41.190
 mass to take the shape of the mold 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:44.100
 then we'll cover with the paper they have 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.770
 left over the sides and we will press 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:50.190
 well and we will even put a weight 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.530
 on top so that it is well compacted 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.890
 nougat pill I know now we're going to 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.880
 extend it so that it takes the form 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:03.330
 well then finished the step of tightening 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.410
 and on the tablet cover it with the paper and 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.860
 now we have to put it to the libera 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.290
 putting a weight on it until tomorrow 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.860
 that is from one day to the next so that 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.380
 take body and compact well 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:22.230
 After one day we have already taken 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.680
 the molds the nougat and we have 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.599
 put on the baking tray 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.870
 Now what we have to do is with 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:33.200
 a brush paint them over 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.650
 beaten egg we have here prepared already 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.260
 the egg and the brush then we go 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.139
 to paint the entire surface once 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.900
 We have painted egg I have here 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:47.650
 a mold that is a Christmas tree and 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.819
 it simply as decoration 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.819
 I push towards the bottom 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.110
 I take them out 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.060
 and I have the drawing of the little tree 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.380
 this simply because by giving it a 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.720
 christmas motif and we will only have 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.630
 sprinkle sugar on top 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:12.600
 preheat the oven to 250 degrees and 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.230
 When it's hot, we'll put the 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.320
 tray in the first height above 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.549
 until we see that we are gilded 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.190
 depend on the oven then I do not tell you 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.010
 now to minutes because according to force 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.930
 from the furnace, it will take more or less longer 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.320
 we have also put the sugar by the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.740
 surface so now to bake the 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.110
 as I said 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.690
 we have just removed the nougat from 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.440
 We've had them for about 7 minutes 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:46.150
 approximately at the first height by 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.789
 up 250 degrees and you see how it is roasted 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.650
 the top capita now you can not 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.560
 touch because they are very soft 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.620
 then once they cool down the 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.949
 we will remove the paper in which they are 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.229
 because it is burned and we will put them 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:06.590
 on another paper well capped so that 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:10.669
 do not dry out almost better film 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.220
 because it keeps a little bit more 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:15.919
 humidity but if not then in this same 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.750
 vegetable wrapping paper and masters with 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.700
 we would preserve them nougat 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:23.700
 well lidditos so they do not dry out 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:27.630
 and once cold here the 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:32.670
 yolk nougat days 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:36.800
 Here I show you the nougat cut 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:36.800
 so you can see how it is inside 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.710
 he's rich outside musician inside
