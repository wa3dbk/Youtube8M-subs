00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello everyone with you freestyle and this 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.510
 small video will be dedicated again 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.299
 Minecraft Pocket Edition Version 0 of 0 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:18.890
 alpha and this video will be about a certain bug 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:23.430
 This game is based on 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:27.590
 not clone blocks and that the game is not 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:36.450
 immediately saves all your actions 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:40.170
 let me choose my own my 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.320
 own its own shaft where tarahtenie 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.190
 let's not be more 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:52.520
 I will visually tell you about this bug and 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:59.100
 show on our mastered which we already 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.570
 shoot a long time ago and have time for 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.059
 begin what we need us 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.720
 need well let's say we have 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:12.930
 five blocks in gold ore 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:16.409
 what do we do we get up somewhere 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.720
 preferably flat surface and set 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:23.100
 blocks well we set the blocks is not simple 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.290
 the way and put the blocks on the run on the run 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.330
 but there is 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:33.119
 we clamp it like this and put blocks 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:40.920
 that is, now I will twist the case 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:45.509
 so here so here look just two 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:49.180
 eagle yes no let's all the same I first 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.600
 just tell you what the meaning sounds 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.960
 the meaning of the phrase is that the game does not have time 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:00.390
 realize that you made such blocks you 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:04.570
 set and but it saves 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.649
 blocks and your inventory and block which 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.929
 you have already set 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.940
 that is, it turns out that it is cloned into two 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:15.840
 times after you put right away 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.700
 you need to read about 10 seconds and 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.300
 then exit the application and close it 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.300
 and restart this way 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:39.150
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:46.299
 exit from application double click 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:50.140
 exit and reboot one minus of this 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:52.390
 The bug is that it sometimes does not work, but 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:59.190
 as you see at the moment he 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:03:02.350
 earned and by the way survived even that 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.220
 the torch that we saved which we 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:09.540
 set and also we have left that is 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:13.329
 in the end, we don't have 5 blocks now 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:15.310
 the golden horde is already 10 that way you can 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:19.840
 clone any block absolutely any 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.840
 block and in this way in this 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.030
 the whole tank itself is this 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.340
