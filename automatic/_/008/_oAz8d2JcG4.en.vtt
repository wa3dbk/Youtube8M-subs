00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello to all i hope you go 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.450
 well here damien of the collective that militates 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.220
 for a new photoshop tutorial 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.920
 so today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.630
 to transform your signature or your 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.940
 logo in the form of a brooch 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.920
 customized so this technique you 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.720
 will create any type 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.189
 de rush 1 for your creations 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.439
 I will teach you three methods 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.019
 so the first one where will come to recover a 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.410
 scan so of course you will have a file 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.960
 source 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.640
 we will leave in this context that I did 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.170
 for you so of course you can 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.679
 reproduce the same thing with your 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.980
 signature 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.190
 and then a second chicane or come back 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.260
 to iron also this coup signature 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.300
 with a pencil a little thicker 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.920
 will come to recover all this in photoshop 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.039
 and then we'll come clean a little 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.370
 selection for power suddenly creates 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.230
 a pin so for example here so I 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.850
 select me the pin that we have 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.710
 imported that we reworked the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.550
 first breach that I drop a little 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.520
 little its thickness 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.160
 you see that we can easily 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.680
 reproduce this signature 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.770
 second example we will leave 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.479
 actually from those of this scan number 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.229
 two and then we will come back by 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.990
 on it with his mouse or his palette 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.659
 graphic and we will come back everything 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.290
 simply create yet again a 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.820
 second pin a little bit more we'll say 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.650
 a little sharper a little more precise the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.930
 cost and finally we will come back 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.689
 the illustrator logo that we transform 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.850
 arms also in the form of pins 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.610
 so we can actually lower 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.439
 or increase its thickness and that's it 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.329
 so of course the interest of the breaches and 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.220
 that we can apply any 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.250
 color like here since it was 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.790
 white in the foreground for example if we 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.439
 specify another image etc or if 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.299
 we create a new layer we can come 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.600
 really specify a color 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.140
 different for example black and that's it 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.310
 and to put his signature easily 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.149
 I'll find you right now for 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.149
 start the tutorial
