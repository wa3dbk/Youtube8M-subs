00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
in more detail let's first talk about

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.780 
in more detail let's first talk about
playing<00:03:09.780> Agricola<00:03:10.320> first<00:03:11.040> off<00:03:11.280> we're<00:03:11.580> going

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
playing Agricola first off we're going

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.660 
playing Agricola first off we're going
to<00:03:11.910> need<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.210> big<00:03:12.570> table<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.800> as<00:03:14.040> playtime

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
to need a big table just as playtime

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.820 
to need a big table just as playtime
varies<00:03:15.060> by<00:03:15.210> the<00:03:15.270> number<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.750> players<00:03:15.990> so<00:03:16.650> does

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
varies by the number of players so does

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.800 
varies by the number of players so does
the<00:03:16.980> space<00:03:17.220> needed<00:03:17.760> because<00:03:18.240> each<00:03:18.540> player

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
the space needed because each player

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.480 
the space needed because each player
will<00:03:19.050> have<00:03:19.200> their<00:03:19.350> own<00:03:19.530> farm<00:03:19.950> in<00:03:20.130> front<00:03:20.370> of

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
will have their own farm in front of

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.030 
will have their own farm in front of
them<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:20.850> plan<00:03:21.510> accordingly<00:03:21.960> in<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.680> center

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
them so plan accordingly in the center

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.470 
them so plan accordingly in the center
of<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.190> table<00:03:23.490> we<00:03:23.580> have<00:03:23.610> the<00:03:23.760> actual<00:03:24.150> game

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
of the table we have the actual game

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.240 
of the table we have the actual game
board<00:03:24.750> curricula<00:03:25.560> is<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.680> worker<00:03:26.010> placement

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
board curricula is a worker placement

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.490 
board curricula is a worker placement
game<00:03:26.520> so<00:03:27.210> this<00:03:27.360> game<00:03:27.630> board<00:03:27.900> is<00:03:28.020> where<00:03:28.230> players

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
game so this game board is where players

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.040 
game so this game board is where players
place<00:03:28.890> their<00:03:29.130> pieces<00:03:29.340> each<00:03:29.760> turn<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.330> order<00:03:30.900> to

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
place their pieces each turn in order to

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.200 
place their pieces each turn in order to
claim<00:03:31.260> resources<00:03:31.950> like<00:03:32.160> wood<00:03:32.490> brick<00:03:32.970> and

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
claim resources like wood brick and

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.690 
claim resources like wood brick and

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.770 
bad approach the last part of gameplay
I'd<00:05:22.310> like<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.580> touch<00:05:22.700> on<00:05:22.910> is<00:05:23.090> the<00:05:23.240> scoring<00:05:23.630> a

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
I'd like to touch on is the scoring a

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.440 
I'd like to touch on is the scoring a
curricula<00:05:24.680> rewards<00:05:25.220> a<00:05:25.400> well<00:05:25.669> balanced<00:05:26.210> farm

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
curricula rewards a well balanced farm

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.260 
curricula rewards a well balanced farm
over<00:05:26.900> a<00:05:26.930> specialized<00:05:27.560> one<00:05:27.800> so<00:05:28.700> for<00:05:28.940> each<00:05:29.030> thing

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
over a specialized one so for each thing

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.969 
over a specialized one so for each thing
I<00:05:29.510> didn't<00:05:29.810> build<00:05:29.990> on<00:05:30.139> my<00:05:30.290> farm<00:05:30.590> I<00:05:30.800> will

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
I didn't build on my farm I will

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.400 
I didn't build on my farm I will
actually<00:05:31.190> lose<00:05:31.700> one<00:05:32.060> point<00:05:32.330> where<00:05:32.930> as<00:05:33.080> simply

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
actually lose one point where as simply

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.379 
actually lose one point where as simply
having<00:05:33.830> one<00:05:34.040> of<00:05:34.070> anything<00:05:34.610> Nets<00:05:34.850> me<00:05:35.030> a<00:05:35.060> point

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
having one of anything Nets me a point

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.810 
having one of anything Nets me a point
so<00:05:36.139> if<00:05:36.260> I<00:05:36.380> spend<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:36.800> entire<00:05:36.889> game<00:05:37.370> trying<00:05:37.669> to

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
so if I spend the entire game trying to

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.850 
so if I spend the entire game trying to
be<00:05:37.940> Lord<00:05:38.389> of<00:05:38.630> the<00:05:38.780> Sheep<00:05:39.050> I<00:05:39.260> will<00:05:39.680> have

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
be Lord of the Sheep I will have

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.129 
be Lord of the Sheep I will have
forgotten<00:05:40.160> too<00:05:40.430> many<00:05:40.639> scoring<00:05:40.970> categories<00:05:41.210> to

forgotten too many scoring categories to

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.290

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
have any real chance to win the game in

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.270 
have any real chance to win the game in
fact<00:05:44.690> categories<00:05:45.260> have<00:05:45.410> a<00:05:45.440> point<00:05:45.770> cap<00:05:45.979> so

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
fact categories have a point cap so

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.400 
fact categories have a point cap so
after<00:05:46.610> a<00:05:46.639> certain<00:05:46.910> number<00:05:47.210> of<00:05:47.360> resources<00:05:48.050> you

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
after a certain number of resources you

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.140 
after a certain number of resources you
just<00:05:48.650> stop<00:05:48.830> scoring<00:05:49.130> them<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.669> move<00:05:49.820> on<00:05:50.000> to

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
just stop scoring them and move on to

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:52.320 
just stop scoring them and move on to
the<00:05:50.240> next<00:05:50.479> category<00:05:51.070> variety<00:05:52.070> is<00:05:52.250> the

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
the next category variety is the

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.909 
the next category variety is the
undisputable<00:05:53.330> key<00:05:53.600> to<00:05:53.810> success<00:05:54.229> and<00:05:54.410> Agricola

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
undisputable key to success and Agricola

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:57.219 
undisputable key to success and Agricola
so<00:05:55.520> remember<00:05:56.030> to<00:05:56.120> keep<00:05:56.150> your<00:05:56.479> farm<00:05:56.780> balance

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
so remember to keep your farm balance

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.290 
so remember to keep your farm balance

our warp drive engines questions would
definitely<00:06:36.830> follow<00:06:37.070> so<00:06:37.610> by<00:06:37.820> keeping<00:06:38.120> things

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330

definitely follow so by keeping things
simple<00:06:38.600> the<00:06:38.930> game<00:06:39.139> has<00:06:39.380> taken<00:06:39.680> on<00:06:39.800> part<00:06:40.039> of<00:06:40.100> the

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:40.190 
simple the game has taken on part of the

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.040 
simple the game has taken on part of the
learning<00:06:40.520> curve<00:06:40.700> and<00:06:40.940> made<00:06:41.389> my<00:06:41.570> life<00:06:41.810> a<00:06:41.900> little
