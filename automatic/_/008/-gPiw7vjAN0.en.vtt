we're going to do is we're going to set
up<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.059> simple<00:00:54.270> scale<00:00:54.780> for<00:00:55.500> those<00:00:55.620> two<00:00:55.860> things

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
up a simple scale for those two things

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the air at all that's going to be a plus

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.429 
the air at all that's going to be a plus
if<00:01:05.400> your<00:01:05.880> club<00:01:06.119> comes<00:01:06.450> down<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.990> hits<00:01:07.200> into

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
the ground first then that's going to be

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.340 
the ground first then that's going to be
a<00:01:09.689> minus<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.880> one<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.270> want<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.810> when

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.260 
all you need to do is give yourself good
feedback<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.890> was<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.100> plus<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:30.030> was<00:01:30.240> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
feedback that was a plus that was a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.719 
feedback that was a plus that was a
minus<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.320> was<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> zero<00:01:31.799> keep<00:01:32.189> going<00:01:32.460> through

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
minus that was a zero keep going through

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.170 
minus that was a zero keep going through
it<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.060> most<00:01:33.630> importantly<00:01:34.229> don't<00:01:35.100> try<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
it and most importantly don't try to

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.450 
it and most importantly don't try to
change<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:36.689> your<00:01:37.320> subconscious<00:01:38.009> mind<00:01:38.040> will

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
change it your subconscious mind will

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.249 
change it your subconscious mind will
start<00:01:38.729> picking<00:01:38.939> out<00:01:39.299> what's<00:01:40.049> actually

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
start picking out what's actually

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.810 
start picking out what's actually
happening<00:01:40.860> what's<00:01:41.070> creating<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.549> plus

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
happening what's creating the plus

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.120 
happening what's creating the plus
what's<00:01:42.060> creating<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.450> minus<00:01:42.840> over<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.740> short

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
what's creating the minus over a short

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
what's creating the minus over a short
period<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.610> time<00:01:44.700> you'll<00:01:45.329> find<00:01:45.659> that<00:01:45.990> the

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
period of time you'll find that the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.670 
period of time you'll find that the
amount<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.460> miss<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.850> golf<00:01:48.030> ball<00:01:48.299> by

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
amount that you miss the golf ball by

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.190 
amount that you miss the golf ball by
will<00:01:49.680> get<00:01:49.920> narrower<00:01:50.509> the<00:01:51.509> more<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.960> keep

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
will get narrower the more you keep

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.560 
will get narrower the more you keep
doing<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:53.009> better<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.579> what<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.420> might

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
doing this the better and what you might

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.420 
doing this the better and what you might
even<00:01:54.810> want<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.590> give<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.799> some<00:01:56.040> numbers

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
even want to do is give it some numbers

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.219 
even want to do is give it some numbers
so<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.790> top<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.180> golf<00:01:57.360> ball<00:01:57.450> could<00:01:58.079> become

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
so the top of the golf ball could become

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.420 
so the top of the golf ball could become
plus<00:01:58.680> five<00:01:58.979> and<00:02:00.590> really<00:02:01.590> hammering<00:02:01.860> down<00:02:02.100> into

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
plus five and really hammering down into

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.760 
plus five and really hammering down into
the<00:02:02.520> map<00:02:02.700> could<00:02:03.210> be<00:02:03.360> minus<00:02:03.750> five<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.320> then

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the map could be minus five and then

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.039 
the map could be minus five and then
you're<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> find<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:06.270> bits<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.659> between

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
you're going to find the bits in between

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.419 
you're going to find the bits in between
and<00:02:07.259> fill<00:02:07.469> in<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.680> blanks<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.129> you're<00:02:08.280> going

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
and fill in the blanks so you're going

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.309 
and fill in the blanks so you're going
to<00:02:08.459> calibrate<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.239> until<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.289> start

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
to calibrate that until you start

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.380 
to calibrate that until you start
probably<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:11.310> find<00:02:11.340> out<00:02:11.760> that<00:02:11.970> plus<00:02:12.270> one

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
probably to find out that plus one

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.600 
probably to find out that plus one
zero<00:02:13.510> minus<00:02:14.260> one<00:02:14.350> is<00:02:14.980> still<00:02:15.280> going<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.490> be<00:02:15.580> a

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
zero minus one is still going to be a

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.910 
zero minus one is still going to be a
reasonable<00:02:16.150> golf<00:02:16.360> shot<00:02:16.600> your<00:02:17.140> subconscious

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
reasonable golf shot your subconscious

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.410 
reasonable golf shot your subconscious
brain<00:02:17.980> will<00:02:18.340> really<00:02:18.640> like<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:19.060> because<00:02:19.150> you're

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
brain will really like it because you're

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.570 
brain will really like it because you're
giving<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.780> good<00:02:20.020> factual<00:02:20.650> feedback<00:02:21.160> rather

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
giving a good factual feedback rather

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.390 
giving a good factual feedback rather
than<00:02:21.910> I<00:02:22.090> lifted<00:02:22.780> my<00:02:22.930> head<00:02:23.170> my<00:02:23.740> left<00:02:23.980> arm<00:02:24.190> wasn't

straight all those sorts of things so

straight all those sorts of things so
just<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.810> recap<00:02:29.070> use<00:02:30.070> that<00:02:30.310> plus<00:02:30.670> minus<00:02:31.390> and

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
hitting the golf ball improves really

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.390
