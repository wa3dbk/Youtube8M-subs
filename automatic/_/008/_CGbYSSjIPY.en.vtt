00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:17.560 
how you doing today folks a question I

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.430 
how you doing today folks a question I
get<00:00:17.740> asked<00:00:17.950> quite<00:00:18.070> a<00:00:18.340> bit<00:00:18.700> is<00:00:18.910> if<00:00:19.779> I'm<00:00:20.110> putting

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:20.440 
get asked quite a bit is if I'm putting

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.800 
get asked quite a bit is if I'm putting
mulch<00:00:20.800> down<00:00:21.130> should<00:00:21.610> I<00:00:21.700> put<00:00:21.939> landscape<00:00:22.599> fabric

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
mulch down should I put landscape fabric

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.249 
mulch down should I put landscape fabric
underneath<00:00:23.439> or<00:00:23.830> not<00:00:24.010> and<00:00:24.599> the<00:00:25.599> short<00:00:25.900> answer

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
underneath or not and the short answer

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.950 
underneath or not and the short answer
is<00:00:26.290> no<00:00:26.670> but<00:00:27.670> the<00:00:27.790> long<00:00:28.000> answer<00:00:28.270> is<00:00:28.450> I<00:00:28.720> want<00:00:28.900> to

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
is no but the long answer is I want to

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.689 
is no but the long answer is I want to
explain<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.290> you<00:00:29.560> why<00:00:29.770> it's<00:00:30.070> not<00:00:30.160> really<00:00:30.550> such

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:30.699 
explain to you why it's not really such

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.420 
explain to you why it's not really such
a<00:00:30.730> good<00:00:30.970> idea<00:00:31.390> to<00:00:32.199> lay<00:00:32.379> fabric<00:00:32.949> underneath

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
a good idea to lay fabric underneath

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.259 
a good idea to lay fabric underneath
your<00:00:33.610> mulch<00:00:34.530> what<00:00:35.530> happens<00:00:36.010> is<00:00:36.489> when<00:00:36.940> you<00:00:36.970> lay

00:00:37.259 --> 00:00:37.269 
your mulch what happens is when you lay

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:39.600 
your mulch what happens is when you lay
fabric<00:00:37.809> down<00:00:38.019> it<00:00:38.410> does<00:00:38.739> prevent<00:00:39.129> the<00:00:39.370> weeds

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
fabric down it does prevent the weeds

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.280 
fabric down it does prevent the weeds
and<00:00:39.910> it<00:00:40.000> does<00:00:40.120> a<00:00:40.150> good<00:00:40.360> job<00:00:40.420> of<00:00:40.720> doing<00:00:40.989> that<00:00:41.080> for

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
and it does a good job of doing that for

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.799 
and it does a good job of doing that for
about<00:00:41.440> three<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.710> four<00:00:41.980> years<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.690> after

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
about three to four years but after

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.630 
about three to four years but after
three<00:00:44.170> to<00:00:44.290> four<00:00:44.530> years<00:00:44.860> your<00:00:45.070> mulch<00:00:45.309> is<00:00:45.460> going

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
three to four years your mulch is going

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.670 
three to four years your mulch is going
to<00:00:45.699> start<00:00:45.940> to<00:00:46.000> break<00:00:46.329> down<00:00:46.630> and<00:00:47.050> it's<00:00:47.530> going<00:00:47.620> to

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
to start to break down and it's going to

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.090 
to start to break down and it's going to
form<00:00:47.980> this<00:00:48.130> layer<00:00:48.399> of<00:00:48.640> really<00:00:48.969> nice<00:00:49.180> soil<00:00:49.600> on

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
form this layer of really nice soil on

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.030 
form this layer of really nice soil on
top<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.430> the<00:00:51.820> fabric<00:00:52.390> and<00:00:52.629> that<00:00:53.530> really<00:00:53.829> nice

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
top of the fabric and that really nice

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.380 
top of the fabric and that really nice
soil<00:00:54.370> is<00:00:54.550> just<00:00:54.579> going<00:00:54.790> to<00:00:54.850> end<00:00:55.000> up<00:00:55.120> growing

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
soil is just going to end up growing

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.440 
soil is just going to end up growing
more<00:00:55.809> weeds<00:00:56.140> and<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:57.820> the<00:00:57.969> other<00:00:58.149> thing<00:00:58.420> that

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
more weeds and then the other thing that

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.290 
more weeds and then the other thing that
happens<00:00:59.020> is<00:00:59.320> all<00:01:00.100> that<00:01:00.460> really<00:01:00.640> nice<00:01:00.969> soil

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
happens is all that really nice soil

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.260 
happens is all that really nice soil
can't<00:01:01.899> get<00:01:02.140> through<00:01:02.379> and<00:01:02.860> mix<00:01:03.670> with<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:03.940> soil

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
can't get through and mix with the soil

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.330 
can't get through and mix with the soil
you've<00:01:04.449> already<00:01:04.600> got<00:01:04.839> there<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.800> earthworms

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
you've already got there the earthworms

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.639 
you've already got there the earthworms
in<00:01:06.550> the<00:01:06.640> process<00:01:07.119> of<00:01:07.270> eating<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.990> soil<00:01:08.259> or

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
in the process of eating the soil or

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.620 
in the process of eating the soil or
eating<00:01:08.920> the<00:01:08.950> microbes<00:01:09.369> in<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.550> soil<00:01:09.630> they

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
eating the microbes in the soil they

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.930 
eating the microbes in the soil they
will<00:01:10.840> turn<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.320> soil<00:01:11.590> for<00:01:11.920> you<00:01:12.070> but<00:01:12.640> because

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:12.940 
will turn the soil for you but because

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.359 
will turn the soil for you but because
of<00:01:12.970> that<00:01:13.180> fabric<00:01:13.539> you<00:01:14.440> can't<00:01:14.740> get<00:01:14.920> those<00:01:15.130> two

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
of that fabric you can't get those two

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.510 
of that fabric you can't get those two
soils<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:15.970> mix<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.590> that's<00:01:17.770> another<00:01:18.070> reason<00:01:18.460> I

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
soils to mix so that's another reason I

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.580 
soils to mix so that's another reason I
don't<00:01:18.549> recommend<00:01:18.970> fabrics<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:19.869> then<00:01:20.470> the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
don't recommend fabrics and then the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.520 
don't recommend fabrics and then the
third<00:01:20.830> reason<00:01:21.159> is<00:01:21.600> quite<00:01:22.600> frankly<00:01:22.869> it's<00:01:23.320> just

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
third reason is quite frankly it's just

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.070 
third reason is quite frankly it's just
a<00:01:23.650> pain<00:01:23.950> to<00:01:24.220> work<00:01:24.400> with<00:01:24.689> if<00:01:25.689> you've<00:01:25.900> ever

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
a pain to work with if you've ever

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.750 
a pain to work with if you've ever
worked<00:01:26.380> in<00:01:26.470> a<00:01:26.590> bed<00:01:26.740> that's<00:01:26.920> got<00:01:27.070> fabric<00:01:27.369> and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
worked in a bed that's got fabric and

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.730 
worked in a bed that's got fabric and
you<00:01:27.850> want<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.119> add<00:01:28.240> more<00:01:28.540> plants<00:01:29.080> or<00:01:29.500> make<00:01:29.710> a

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
you want to add more plants or make a

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.190 
you want to add more plants or make a
change<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.310> garden<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:31.420> roots<00:01:31.659> of<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.900> trees

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
change the garden the roots of the trees

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.719 
change the garden the roots of the trees
get<00:01:32.439> mixed<00:01:32.770> up<00:01:32.860> in<00:01:33.040> it<00:01:33.189> the<00:01:33.340> roots<00:01:33.549> of<00:01:33.670> the

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
get mixed up in it the roots of the

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.480 
get mixed up in it the roots of the
plants<00:01:34.060> get<00:01:34.210> mixed<00:01:34.540> in<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.780> up<00:01:34.960> in<00:01:35.229> it<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:35.490> you

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
plants get mixed in it up in it and you

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.600 
plants get mixed in it up in it and you
know<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:36.729> just<00:01:36.759> gets<00:01:37.090> messy<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:39.009> soil<00:01:39.369> over

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
know it just gets messy the soil over

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.990 
know it just gets messy the soil over
here<00:01:40.180> is<00:01:40.330> clay<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:40.990> if<00:01:41.080> you<00:01:41.380> take<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.650> look<00:01:42.000> it's

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
here is clay and if you take a look it's

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.899 
here is clay and if you take a look it's
dry<00:01:43.420> clay<00:01:43.780> right<00:01:44.049> now<00:01:44.290> so<00:01:44.799> it's<00:01:45.009> it's<00:01:45.610> very

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
dry clay right now so it's it's very

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.109 
dry clay right now so it's it's very
unforgiving<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:47.500> right<00:01:47.710> here<00:01:47.740> this<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:48.939> some

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
unforgiving but right here this is some

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.020 
unforgiving but right here this is some
fabric<00:01:49.570> that<00:01:49.689> was<00:01:49.840> installed<00:01:50.290> so<00:01:51.189> when<00:01:51.640> I<00:01:51.670> rip

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
fabric that was installed so when I rip

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.240 
fabric that was installed so when I rip
up<00:01:52.060> this<00:01:52.420> fabric<00:01:52.990> you<00:01:53.229> see<00:01:53.710> all<00:01:53.860> this<00:01:54.009> nice

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
up this fabric you see all this nice

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:01.410 
up this fabric you see all this nice
mulch<00:01:54.630> when<00:01:55.630> I<00:01:55.659> rip<00:01:55.960> up<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:56.320> fabric

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.690 

we've<00:02:02.050> got<00:02:02.229> our<00:02:02.380> earthworms<00:02:02.950> underneath<00:02:03.490> the

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
we've got our earthworms underneath the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.899 
we've got our earthworms underneath the
fabric<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:05.500> guy's<00:02:05.740> trying<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.159> get<00:02:06.280> away<00:02:06.400> and

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
fabric this guy's trying to get away and

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.449 
fabric this guy's trying to get away and
the<00:02:07.810> soil<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.350> definitely<00:02:08.740> moister

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
the soil is definitely moister

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.870 
the soil is definitely moister
but<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.569> mulch<00:02:10.869> is<00:02:11.200> it's<00:02:11.709> not<00:02:12.069> mixing<00:02:12.700> with

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
but the mulch is it's not mixing with

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.960 
but the mulch is it's not mixing with
the<00:02:12.970> soil<00:02:13.240> we've<00:02:13.480> got<00:02:13.660> here<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.730> really

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
the soil we've got here so I really

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.280 
the soil we've got here so I really
don't<00:02:16.870> recommend<00:02:17.140> fabric<00:02:18.990> now<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.050> other

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
don't recommend fabric now the other

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.449 
don't recommend fabric now the other
thing<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.590> happens<00:02:21.040> when<00:02:21.190> you've<00:02:21.310> got

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
fabric in the landscape is sometimes

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.980 
fabric in the landscape is sometimes

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
like hack away at this fabric because it

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.250 
like hack away at this fabric because it
would<00:02:40.840> get<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:41.019> few<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.830> few<00:02:42.340> cuts<00:02:43.030> in<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.570> you

would get a few a few cuts in it and you
would<00:02:44.440> just<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:45.190> was<00:02:45.370> just<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:46.480> weeds<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:47.050> the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
would just it was just the weeds and the

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
think of a time right now where I would

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.350 
think of a time right now where I would
