00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello dear friends glad 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.030
 welcome you to our channel 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.049
 in today's video I want to tell 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.570
 how to install clockworkmod recovery on 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.789
 htc desire 601 phone 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.230
 for this we need a phone with 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.300
 unlocked bootloader 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.859
 as unlock bootloader you can 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.390
 see in previous videos 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.030
 further we will need an archive with files 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.690
 under the name android besides us 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.910
 you will need the recovery and the driver 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:43.280
 Now turn on the phone go to the menu 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.350
