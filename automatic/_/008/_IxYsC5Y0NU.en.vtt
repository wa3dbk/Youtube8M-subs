00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.090 
is straight both horizontal and vertical
when<00:00:53.330> we<00:00:53.540> see<00:00:53.750> something<00:00:54.050> that's<00:00:54.470> kind<00:00:54.920> of<00:00:54.980> out

of whack like this it doesn't feel right

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.280 
of whack like this it doesn't feel right
and<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.640> distracts<00:00:59.120> from<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.510> main<00:00:59.840> purpose

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290

thirty percent so I'll put a 3-0 in
there<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.849> it's<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.090> return<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.230> gives

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
there and it's a return and that gives

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.710 
there and it's a return and that gives
me<00:02:28.470> some<00:02:28.680> extra<00:02:28.920> space<00:02:29.330> second<00:02:30.330> thing<00:02:30.480> I<00:02:30.569> want

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
me some extra space second thing I want

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.350 
me some extra space second thing I want
to<00:02:30.810> do<00:02:30.959> is<00:02:31.349> well<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.459> have<00:02:32.640> some<00:02:32.819> reference

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
to do is well I have some reference

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.539 
to do is well I have some reference
lines<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.769> be<00:02:35.040> able<00:02:35.099> to<00:02:35.220> get<00:02:35.400> those

00:02:35.539 --> 00:02:35.549 
lines and to be able to get those

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:37.820 
lines and to be able to get those
reference<00:02:36.060> lines<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.599> need<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:36.810> have<00:02:36.930> rulers

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
reference lines you need to have rulers

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.809 
reference lines you need to have rulers
on<00:02:39.200> so<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.440> gives<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.709> these<00:02:40.830> white<00:02:41.190> rulers

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
on so that gives you these white rulers

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.720 
on so that gives you these white rulers
on<00:02:42.060> here<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.510> now<00:02:43.079> if<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.349> go<00:02:43.560> and<00:02:43.769> click<00:02:44.310> and

on here and now if you go and click and
drag<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:46.470> get<00:02:46.739> a<00:02:46.769> reference<00:02:47.610> line<00:02:48.599> it<00:02:48.989> will

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
drag you get a reference line it will

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.039 
drag you get a reference line it will
make<00:02:49.319> one<00:02:49.769> that's<00:02:50.510> court<00:02:51.510> is<00:02:51.599> perfectly

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
make one that's court is perfectly

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.110 
make one that's court is perfectly
horizontal<00:02:52.370> and<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.489> will<00:02:53.579> do<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.849> same<00:02:53.879> thing

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
horizontal and it will do the same thing

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.630 
horizontal and it will do the same thing
and<00:02:54.540> will<00:02:54.629> will<00:02:55.019> get<00:02:55.200> two<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.470> them<00:02:55.769> and<00:02:56.430> we'll

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
and will will get two of them and we'll

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.619 
and will will get two of them and we'll
put<00:02:56.879> one<00:02:57.299> on<00:02:57.510> this<00:02:57.720> line<00:02:58.459> on<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.609> left<00:02:59.940> and

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
put one on this line on the left and

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.580 
put one on this line on the left and
we'll<00:03:00.810> put<00:03:01.170> one<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.680> other<00:03:01.829> line<00:03:03.260> that's<00:03:04.260> most

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
we'll put one the other line that's most

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.849 
we'll put one the other line that's most
noticeable<00:03:05.250> out<00:03:05.430> it's<00:03:05.670> right<00:03:05.879> there<00:03:06.799> okay<00:03:07.799> so

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:07.859 
noticeable out it's right there okay so

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:09.619 
noticeable out it's right there okay so
that<00:03:08.160> now<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.609> first<00:03:08.790> thing<00:03:09.150> we<00:03:09.269> want<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.450> do

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
that now the first thing we want to do

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.280 
that now the first thing we want to do
is<00:03:09.900> since<00:03:10.290> we've<00:03:10.920> got<00:03:11.180> problems<00:03:12.180> with<00:03:13.079> both

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
is since we've got problems with both

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.780 
is since we've got problems with both
the<00:03:13.500> verticals<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.010> horizontal

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
the verticals and horizontal

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.240 
the verticals and horizontal
let's<00:03:15.180> straighten<00:03:15.629> the<00:03:16.290> horizontal<00:03:16.859> first

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
let's straighten the horizontal first

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.460 
let's straighten the horizontal first
and<00:03:17.579> that's<00:03:18.120> really<00:03:18.420> easy<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.230> can't

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
and that's really easy to do you can't

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.240 
and that's really easy to do you can't
care<00:03:19.680> under<00:03:19.859> image<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:21.120> rotate<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:22.250> free

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
care under image and rotate and free

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.879 
care under image and rotate and free
rotate<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.660> we're<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:24.870> going<00:03:25.200> to<00:03:25.230> rotate<00:03:25.500> the

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
rotate so we're just going to rotate the

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.309 
rotate so we're just going to rotate the
image<00:03:25.919> and<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:27.329> way<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.510> do<00:03:27.750> that<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.109> should

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
image and the way you do that you should

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.140 
image and the way you do that you should
grab<00:03:28.500> these<00:03:28.769> little<00:03:29.040> handles<00:03:29.489> these<00:03:29.849> little

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
grab these little handles these little

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.720 
grab these little handles these little
knees<00:03:30.750> on<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.200> side<00:03:31.440> here<00:03:31.799> and<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.370> just

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
knees on the side here and you just

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.539 
knees on the side here and you just
twist<00:03:33.139> and<00:03:34.139> you<00:03:34.260> twist<00:03:34.290> around<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.069> tell<00:03:35.250> it

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
twist and you twist around and tell it

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.020 
twist and you twist around and tell it
looks<00:03:37.160> pretty<00:03:38.160> straight<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.519> you<00:03:38.819> with

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
looks pretty straight to you with

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.050 
looks pretty straight to you with
respect<00:03:39.690> to<00:03:39.780> your<00:03:39.870> reference<00:03:40.319> mark<00:03:40.620> and<00:03:41.060> then

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
respect to your reference mark and then

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.319 
respect to your reference mark and then
you<00:03:42.329> hit<00:03:43.109> Enter

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
you hit Enter

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.190 
you hit Enter
okay<00:03:45.680> now<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:48.090> next<00:03:48.329> thing<00:03:48.450> we<00:03:48.599> want<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.870> do<00:03:49.049> is

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
okay now the next thing we want to do is

okay now the next thing we want to do is
I<00:03:49.230> want<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:49.560> straighten<00:03:50.310> these<00:03:50.519> these

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
I want to straighten these these

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:53.349 
I want to straighten these these
vertical<00:03:51.870> lines<00:03:51.900> out<00:03:52.319> of<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:52.530> way<00:03:52.650> we<00:03:52.799> do<00:03:52.919> that

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
vertical lines out of the way we do that

00:03:53.359 --> 00:04:00.020 
vertical lines out of the way we do that
as<00:03:54.359> I<00:03:54.419> say<00:03:54.690> image<00:03:55.310> transform<00:03:57.200> distort<00:03:59.030> there's

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
as I say image transform distort there's

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.550 
as I say image transform distort there's
a<00:04:00.090> bunch<00:04:00.269> of<00:04:00.359> ways<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.540> do<00:04:00.840> this<00:04:01.079> I<00:04:01.230> like

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
a bunch of ways to do this I like

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.849 
a bunch of ways to do this I like
transform<00:04:02.280> distort<00:04:02.599> because<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:04.650> don't

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
transform distort because you don't

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.250 
transform distort because you don't
always<00:04:05.040> know<00:04:05.310> whether<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.629> verticals<00:04:07.079> earned

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
always know whether the verticals earned

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.180 
always know whether the verticals earned
the<00:04:07.440> horizontals<00:04:08.069> are<00:04:08.849> out<00:04:09.120> and<00:04:09.629> with<00:04:10.620> distort

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
the horizontals are out and with distort

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.900 
the horizontals are out and with distort
just<00:04:11.609> love<00:04:11.849> allows<00:04:12.419> you<00:04:12.660> to<00:04:13.519> jerk<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.549> image

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
just love allows you to jerk the image

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.580 
just love allows you to jerk the image
or<00:04:15.060> run<00:04:15.180> on<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.389> way<00:04:15.510> it's<00:04:15.690> supposed<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.079> be<00:04:16.289> so

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
it's a little out so we'll grab this one

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.700 
it's a little out so we'll grab this one
and<00:04:34.860> we'll<00:04:35.430> move<00:04:35.640> it<00:04:35.940> a<00:04:36.150> little<00:04:36.300> bit<00:04:36.960> over<00:04:37.350> here

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
and we'll move it a little bit over here

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.200 
and we'll move it a little bit over here
and<00:04:40.400> depending<00:04:41.400> on<00:04:41.490> how<00:04:41.610> much<00:04:41.730> you<00:04:41.880> do<00:04:42.030> this

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
and depending on how much you do this

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.090 
and depending on how much you do this
you<00:04:42.390> might<00:04:42.570> have<00:04:42.780> to<00:04:42.990> is<00:04:43.140> you<00:04:43.320> do<00:04:43.470> one<00:04:43.680> side<00:04:43.890> you

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
you might have to is you do one side you

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.070 
you might have to is you do one side you
may<00:04:44.220> have<00:04:44.310> to<00:04:44.430> come<00:04:44.610> back<00:04:44.640> and<00:04:45.240> tune<00:04:45.750> up<00:04:45.870> to<00:04:45.930> the

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
may have to come back and tune up to the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.770 
may have to come back and tune up to the
other<00:04:46.230> side<00:04:46.520> so<00:04:47.520> that<00:04:47.730> looks<00:04:47.970> pretty<00:04:48.150> good

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
other side so that looks pretty good

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.410 
other side so that looks pretty good
now<00:04:49.110> you'll<00:04:49.470> notice<00:04:49.710> we<00:04:50.010> because<00:04:50.520> we've<00:04:50.700> you

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
now you'll notice we because we've you

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.520 
now you'll notice we because we've you
know<00:04:51.510> we<00:04:51.990> have<00:04:52.110> to<00:04:52.260> remember<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.680> hit<00:04:52.860> enter

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
know we have to remember to hit enter

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.190 
know we have to remember to hit enter
until<00:04:55.530> these<00:04:55.710> little<00:04:56.520> handles<00:04:56.850> go<00:04:57.120> away<00:04:57.360> okay

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
until these little handles go away okay

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.500 
until these little handles go away okay
now<00:04:58.350> we<00:04:59.190> did<00:04:59.340> some<00:04:59.550> stuff<00:04:59.790> but<00:04:59.940> you<00:05:00.210> know<00:05:00.300> we

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
now we did some stuff but you know we

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.400 
now we did some stuff but you know we
moved<00:05:01.350> it<00:05:01.560> around<00:05:02.480> and<00:05:03.480> what<00:05:03.900> we<00:05:04.050> have<00:05:04.260> to

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
moved it around and what we have to

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.830 
moved it around and what we have to
recrawl<00:05:04.830> the<00:05:05.070> image<00:05:05.400> so<00:05:06.120> what<00:05:06.210> we<00:05:06.330> do<00:05:06.540> is<00:05:06.690> we

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
recrawl the image so what we do is we

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.870 
recrawl the image so what we do is we
use<00:05:06.990> the<00:05:07.170> crop<00:05:07.410> tool<00:05:07.440> you<00:05:08.370> click<00:05:08.610> when<00:05:08.760> you

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
use the crop tool you click when you

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.450 
use the crop tool you click when you
click<00:05:09.060> on<00:05:09.180> the<00:05:09.330> crop<00:05:09.510> tool<00:05:09.780> there's<00:05:10.020> a<00:05:10.460> there's

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
click on the crop tool there's a there's

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.730 
click on the crop tool there's a there's
an<00:05:11.610> aspect<00:05:12.030> ratio<00:05:12.180> setting<00:05:13.140> up<00:05:13.380> there<00:05:13.590> and

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
an aspect ratio setting up there and

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.760 
an aspect ratio setting up there and
you'll<00:05:13.860> notice<00:05:14.190> that<00:05:14.340> it<00:05:14.490> says<00:05:15.320> use<00:05:16.320> photo

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
you'll notice that it says use photo

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.160 
you'll notice that it says use photo
ratio<00:05:17.460> that<00:05:17.730> is<00:05:17.790> it's<00:05:18.090> going<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.390> use<00:05:18.630> the<00:05:18.900> same

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
ratio that is it's going to use the same

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.550 
ratio that is it's going to use the same
aspect<00:05:19.890> ratio<00:05:20.060> that<00:05:21.060> the<00:05:21.240> photo<00:05:21.660> originally

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
aspect ratio that the photo originally

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.230 
aspect ratio that the photo originally
was<00:05:24.710> so<00:05:25.710> what<00:05:26.040> you<00:05:26.160> do<00:05:26.340> is<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:26.640> just<00:05:26.820> put<00:05:27.060> that

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
was so what you do is you just put that

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.040 
was so what you do is you just put that
crop<00:05:27.540> tool<00:05:27.810> up<00:05:28.320> there<00:05:28.710> and<00:05:28.890> drag<00:05:29.100> it<00:05:29.250> across

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
crop tool up there and drag it across

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:38.270 
crop tool up there and drag it across
and<00:05:33.590> that<00:05:34.590> looks<00:05:34.980> about<00:05:35.220> right<00:05:36.650> when<00:05:37.650> this<00:05:38.040> hit

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
and that looks about right when this hit

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.400 
and that looks about right when this hit
this<00:05:38.520> will<00:05:38.700> have<00:05:38.850> to<00:05:39.000> be<00:05:39.150> down<00:05:39.690> a<00:05:39.720> little<00:05:40.140> bit

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
this will have to be down a little bit

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.470 
this will have to be down a little bit
because<00:05:40.620> we<00:05:40.920> didn't<00:05:41.220> get<00:05:41.400> it<00:05:41.490> right<00:05:42.090> on<00:05:42.270> top

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 
because we didn't get it right on top

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.920 
because we didn't get it right on top
and<00:05:43.350> then<00:05:43.800> when<00:05:43.920> you<00:05:44.040> get<00:05:44.300> enter<00:05:45.890> it<00:05:46.890> crops<00:05:47.250> it

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
and then when you get enter it crops it

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:54.200 
and then when you get enter it crops it
and<00:05:49.640> that<00:05:50.640> looks<00:05:50.880> pretty<00:05:51.120> good<00:05:51.920> so<00:05:53.060> that's<00:05:54.060> how

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
and that looks pretty good so that's how

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.330 
and that looks pretty good so that's how
you<00:05:54.270> do<00:05:54.570> it<00:05:54.720> and<00:05:55.170> it's<00:05:55.440> really<00:05:55.740> important<00:05:56.250> to

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
you do it and it's really important to

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.120 
you do it and it's really important to
do<00:05:56.460> this<00:05:56.640> stuff<00:05:57.170> even<00:05:58.170> if<00:05:58.410> it's<00:05:58.590> just<00:05:58.860> a<00:05:58.980> little

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
do this stuff even if it's just a little

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.300 
do this stuff even if it's just a little
bit<00:05:59.340> it's<00:05:59.520> just<00:05:59.730> amazing<00:06:00.480> how<00:06:01.200> the<00:06:01.260> I<00:06:01.470> can<00:06:02.070> pick

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
bit it's just amazing how the I can pick

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.660 
bit it's just amazing how the I can pick
up<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.960> slightest<00:06:03.960> bit<00:06:04.200> of<00:06:04.400> vertical<00:06:05.400> line

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
up the slightest bit of vertical line

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.900 
up the slightest bit of vertical line
being<00:06:06.060> out<00:06:06.330> of<00:06:06.360> whack<00:06:06.690> so<00:06:07.530> turn<00:06:08.400> them<00:06:08.580> up<00:06:08.670> and

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
being out of whack so turn them up and

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.170 
being out of whack so turn them up and
make<00:06:09.180> them<00:06:09.330> perfectly<00:06:09.780> straight
