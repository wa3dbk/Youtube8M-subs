little bit different that's because this

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.690 
little bit different that's because this

a<00:02:35.799> US<00:02:36.159> release<00:02:36.340> I<00:02:36.840> purchased<00:02:37.840> these<00:02:37.930> from

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
a US release I purchased these from

starch and figures that good at UK and

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.059 
starch and figures that good at UK and
I'm<00:02:41.019> assuming<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.470> they<00:02:41.680> were<00:02:41.739> imported

to<00:05:00.580> this<00:05:00.729> particular<00:05:01.060> figure<00:05:01.569> and<00:05:01.780> it's<00:05:01.930> not<00:05:02.080> a

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
to this particular figure and it's not a

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.719 
to this particular figure and it's not a
major<00:05:02.289> deal-breaker<00:05:02.650> but<00:05:03.280> it<00:05:03.490> would<00:05:03.639> have

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
major deal-breaker but it would have

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:05.999 
major deal-breaker but it would have
been<00:05:03.909> nice<00:05:04.120> if<00:05:04.150> it<00:05:04.509> didn't<00:05:04.810> happen<00:05:05.020> is<00:05:05.349> the

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
been nice if it didn't happen is the

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.540 
been nice if it didn't happen is the
fact<00:05:06.280> that<00:05:06.400> when<00:05:06.729> you<00:05:06.879> try<00:05:07.360> to<00:05:07.419> turn<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.020> head

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
fact that when you try to turn the head

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.529 
fact that when you try to turn the head
it<00:05:09.550> only<00:05:09.759> goes<00:05:09.969> so<00:05:10.000> far

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
it only goes so far

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.279 
it only goes so far
and<00:05:11.050> that's<00:05:11.229> obviously<00:05:11.379> due<00:05:11.919> to<00:05:12.280> the

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
and that's obviously due to the

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.779 
and that's obviously due to the
breathing<00:05:14.289> apparatus<00:05:14.500> that's<00:05:15.340> attached<00:05:15.669> to

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:19.569 
front of the figure now the chest box

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.809 
front of the figure now the chest box
itself<00:05:19.930> isn't<00:05:20.440> removable<00:05:20.830> and<00:05:21.219> unlike

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:21.819 
itself isn't removable and unlike

00:05:21.819 --> 00:05:23.580 
itself isn't removable and unlike

to the helmet can't be removed either so

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.390 
to the helmet can't be removed either so
we're<00:05:27.310> stuck<00:05:27.580> with<00:05:27.699> this<00:05:27.849> sort<00:05:28.120> of<00:05:28.199> static

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
we're stuck with this sort of static

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.850 
we're stuck with this sort of static
movement<00:05:30.400> in<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:30.969> head<00:05:31.150> you<00:05:31.930> know<00:05:31.960> for<00:05:32.620> which

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
movement in the head you know for which

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.200 
movement in the head you know for which
for<00:05:33.039> a<00:05:33.099> figure<00:05:33.279> with<00:05:33.460> only<00:05:33.610> five<00:05:33.819> points<00:05:34.029> of

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
for a figure with only five points of

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.409 
for a figure with only five points of
articulation<00:05:34.360> as<00:05:35.020> it<00:05:35.139> is<00:05:35.289> isn't<00:05:36.219> so<00:05:36.849> great<00:05:37.060> you

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:37.419 
articulation as it is isn't so great you

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.629 
articulation as it is isn't so great you
know<00:05:37.569> basically<00:05:38.529> down<00:05:38.830> grazers<00:05:39.219> figure<00:05:39.490> to<00:05:39.610> a

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 
know basically down grazers figure to a

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.719 
know basically down grazers figure to a
four<00:05:39.940> point<00:05:40.210> of<00:05:40.330> articulation<00:05:40.569> figure<00:05:41.380> which

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
four point of articulation figure which

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:44.309 
four point of articulation figure which
again<00:05:42.729> it's<00:05:43.029> never<00:05:43.270> much<00:05:43.509> of<00:05:43.539> an<00:05:43.750> issue<00:05:43.840> for<00:05:44.020> me

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
again it's never much of an issue for me

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:45.930 
again it's never much of an issue for me
as<00:05:44.409> long<00:05:44.560> as<00:05:44.590> the<00:05:44.800> sculpts<00:05:45.279> are<00:05:45.400> good<00:05:45.580> but

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
as long as the sculpts are good but

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.790 
as long as the sculpts are good but
obviously<00:05:46.509> for<00:05:46.990> many<00:05:47.080> people<00:05:47.529> it<00:05:47.650> will

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
obviously for many people it will

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.339 
obviously for many people it will
probably<00:05:48.099> put<00:05:48.400> them<00:05:48.520> off<00:05:48.960> in<00:05:49.960> terms<00:05:50.169> of

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:50.349 
probably put them off in terms of

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.749 
probably put them off in terms of
articulation<00:05:50.949> on<00:05:51.039> the<00:05:51.130> rest<00:05:51.279> of<00:05:51.430> the<00:05:51.490> figure

00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 
articulation on the rest of the figure

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.580 
articulation on the rest of the figure
he<00:05:52.210> does<00:05:52.419> feature<00:05:52.629> the<00:05:52.840> usual<00:05:53.259> swivel

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
he does feature the usual swivel

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.920 
he does feature the usual swivel
shoulders<00:05:54.039> and<00:05:54.279> swivel<00:05:54.759> hips<00:05:54.969> and<00:05:55.330> obviously

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
shoulders and swivel hips and obviously

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.480 
shoulders and swivel hips and obviously
he's<00:05:56.110> got<00:05:56.259> that<00:05:56.379> movement<00:05:56.860> in<00:05:57.009> the<00:05:57.159> head<00:05:57.340> as

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:57.490 
he's got that movement in the head as

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.450 
he's got that movement in the head as
well<00:05:57.669> I'll<00:05:58.509> be<00:05:58.719> it<00:05:58.840> a<00:05:58.870> very<00:05:59.680> small<00:06:00.009> range<00:06:00.250> of

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
well I'll be it a very small range of

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.809 
well I'll be it a very small range of
movement<00:06:01.319> in<00:06:02.319> terms<00:06:02.529> of<00:06:02.650> overall<00:06:02.740> scope<00:06:03.219> as<00:06:03.699> I

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:03.819 
movement in terms of overall scope as I

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:06.600 
movement in terms of overall scope as I
said<00:06:04.000> this<00:06:04.240> guy<00:06:04.500> absolutely<00:06:05.500> flawless<00:06:06.039> really

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
really loved this figure and if I was

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.100 
really loved this figure and if I was
still<00:06:09.400> army<00:06:09.669> building<00:06:10.029> I've<00:06:10.569> definitely<00:06:10.779> been

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:11.110 
still army building I've definitely been

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.860 
still army building I've definitely been
picking<00:06:11.409> up<00:06:11.469> a<00:06:11.620> few<00:06:11.770> of<00:06:11.889> these<00:06:12.009> but<00:06:12.909> I'm<00:06:13.569> trying

picking up a few of these but I'm trying

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.570 
picking up a few of these but I'm trying
to<00:06:13.990> limit<00:06:14.229> myself<00:06:14.379> to<00:06:14.650> one<00:06:14.830> of<00:06:15.129> each<00:06:15.250> figure

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
to limit myself to one of each figure

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.339 
to limit myself to one of each figure
from<00:06:15.699> now<00:06:15.909> on<00:06:16.120> and<00:06:16.330> obviously<00:06:16.719> Star<00:06:17.199> Wars
