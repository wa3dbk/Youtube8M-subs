00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.639
 in this video we will introduce you to the fact that 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.559
 Behind the scenes the whole process 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.879
 create 3d animation based on 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.879
 cartoon serial larry 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.790
 the idea begins everyone sat under which 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.890
 script is written and storyboard is drawn 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.590
 concept is the design direction and 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.599
 image style whose purpose is 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.330
 creating new visualizations for 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.760
 incarnation in the project the artist creates 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.699
 external image and headings that will 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.770
 presented to viewers 

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:42.050
 storyboard storyboard or storyboard 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.629
 This is a very long and complicated process. 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.160
 she creates a preliminary visualization 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.199
 frame picture sequence 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.570
 aids in 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.160
 making cartoon movies promotional 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.700
 rollers modeling most 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.160
 models 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.760
 even the most difficult begin with simple 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.920
 of objects 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.440
 for example scuba which is under the action 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.119
 various tools and fantasies 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.880
 creators turn into different 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.220
 Heroes in addition to the cube that belong to 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.259
 polygonal modeling exist 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.720
 and other techniques with which you 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:19.340
 can create a realistic environment for 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.560
 cartoon texturing 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.509
 material assignment implies 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.770
 assigning the object visible when 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.789
 rendering the color of the relief transparency 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.679
 mirror ruble and other 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:35.509
 surface characteristics of rige ng 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.579
 so our hero is created how to make 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.409
 his move for this is created 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.479
 the character's skeleton and is added 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.500
 controllers allowing you to control the hero 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.500
 as in a puppet theater 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.780
 animation with ready-made characters from the price 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.420
 you can already start working on the script 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.009
 in 3d editors, animation is done 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.439
 on cadre asking certain 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.599
 space on kei frame using 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.670
 controllers we force characters 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:07.340
 act according to 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.959
 storyline rendering process rendering 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.640
 image building is called 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.579
 rendering is done by 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.290
 rendering pipeline will remind the conveyor 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.290
 multi-step process 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.799
 compositing 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.640
 The final version of the cartoon depends on 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.109
 compositing 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.630
 which includes processing 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:31.850
 total frames add effects 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.130
 color correction and and we apply when 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.489
 replace any color do 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.959
 the image is cold or warm 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.459
 discolored or do the opposite 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.459
 expressive and rich 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.730
 rubbed
