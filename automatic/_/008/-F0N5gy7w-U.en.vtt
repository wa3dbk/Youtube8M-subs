believe<00:05:02.780> that's<00:05:02.930> it<00:05:03.140> now<00:05:03.350> do<00:05:04.100> we<00:05:04.220> get<00:05:04.310> this

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
believe that's it now do we get this

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.870 
believe that's it now do we get this
nope<00:05:05.000> there<00:05:05.750> we<00:05:05.870> go<00:05:06.100> now<00:05:07.100> he's<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.340> completed

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
nope there we go now he's a completed

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.450 
nope there we go now he's a completed
elephant<00:05:08.330> and<00:05:08.620> is<00:05:09.620> awesome

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
elephant and is awesome

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:12.100 
elephant and is awesome
you<00:05:10.820> could<00:05:10.940> probably<00:05:11.060> enlarge<00:05:11.570> it<00:05:11.780> maybe<00:05:11.960> if

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
you could probably enlarge it maybe if

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.840 
you could probably enlarge it maybe if
you<00:05:12.200> if<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.620> wanted<00:05:12.830> like<00:05:13.010> larger<00:05:13.430> size<00:05:13.610> it

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
you if you wanted like larger size it

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.850 
you if you wanted like larger size it
probably<00:05:14.090> would<00:05:14.180> be<00:05:14.300> hard<00:05:14.479> to<00:05:14.680> fine-tune<00:05:15.680> this

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
probably would be hard to fine-tune this

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.890 
probably would be hard to fine-tune this
and<00:05:16.160> maybe<00:05:16.340> even<00:05:16.640> slightly<00:05:16.850> smaller<00:05:17.390> one<00:05:17.630> so

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
and maybe even slightly smaller one so

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.750 
and maybe even slightly smaller one so
this<00:05:18.590> should<00:05:18.740> definitely<00:05:18.830> help<00:05:19.160> out<00:05:19.280> any<00:05:19.490> zoo

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.760 
this should definitely help out any zoo

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.690 
this should definitely help out any zoo
or<00:05:20.090> Wildlife<00:05:20.960> or<00:05:21.260> like<00:05:21.770> circus<00:05:22.250> type<00:05:22.460> thing

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
or Wildlife or like circus type thing
