00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.090
 at the current rate is very round 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.570
 amount let's see what we can 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.940
 offer for the money first 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.530
 This design looks like a clock 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.899
 pleasant impressions 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.590
 curved screen covered with glass resistant 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.450

 strap with the rest of the latch word 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.300
 design for the night one of the most 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.609
 expressive among watches of this class 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.289
 now tee round dial and but 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.719
 it does not interfere with the option of standing 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.489
 looks quite nicely charged 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.350
 clock with a small stand 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.989
 made of rubberized plastic 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.150
 amid neat and well-collected 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.280
 the watch case itself is a stand with 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.860
 uneven tailored shlomi looks 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.350
 very strange dignity for the night you can 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.170
 include protection from moisture and dust factor 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.360
 ip55 protection ensure that after 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.490
 swimming with the clock nothing will happen 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.560
 full charge is enough for about one 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.630
 work day basically if you turn off 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.430
 automatic screen backlighting and lead 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.590
 not very active life social networks then 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.810
 watches can hold around 200 ok 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.820
 by modern standards it is very good 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.890
 figure by the way to full charge 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.690
 device will take about an hour and a half 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.250
 brightness sensor is not here that is 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.740
 automatically adapt to 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.240
 the setting clock does not know how 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.400
 what need this parameter 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.230
 I have to manually change the anti-glare 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.880
 quality data on the screen is good 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.130
 seen in a variety of conditions 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.200
 corners claims survey is not there 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.240
 but there are complaints about the frame around the screen 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.010
 they are pretty wide black stripe 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.430
 which docks with metal 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.320
 the finish is strongly striking 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.270
 working hours running popular 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.100
 google shell android in that is 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.140
 traditionally able to show current 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.119
 which data is generated by Google 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.039
 also notification of new developments in

 Missed messages and calls except 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.000
 the clock can play the role of the remote 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.709

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.930
 distance count calories 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.849
 set the alarm to show the pulse and 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.200
 perform other useful activities 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.420
 and unlike many others 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.190
 models with android shell in hours. 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.410
 a package of proprietary applications from 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.520
 asus which increases the opportunity 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.620
 accessory summarize the official 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.480
 Russian prices are not yet in the corporate 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.000
 the asus germany store watch is already 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.069
 sold for 229 euros watch price 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.230
 got modern stuffing hidden 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.459
 in a beautiful shell is very good here 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.680
 trade-off between design and 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.930
 characteristics of the watch is not like 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.819
 Dikovskiy option and in theory can become 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.569
 universal solution for a variety of 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.250
 users 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.380
 but despite the highly technological 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.910
 company performance is worth more 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.280
 work carefully on the software 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.910
 improvements require accuracy readings 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.670
 pedometer 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.680
 and the heart rate sensor is also worth 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.720
 pay attention to how it works 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.730
 screen backlight in the clock often for 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.650
 turning on the screen will be enough 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.540
 just one sharp movement review
