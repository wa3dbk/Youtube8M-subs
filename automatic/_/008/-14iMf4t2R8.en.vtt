towards<00:00:16.919> that<00:00:17.009> exact<00:00:17.310> point<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.669> shot<00:00:17.910> up<00:00:18.089> and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
towards that exact point I shot up and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.999 
towards that exact point I shot up and
then<00:00:18.779> as<00:00:18.960> soon<00:00:19.199> as<00:00:19.349> you<00:00:19.439> start<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.769> walk<00:00:19.890> but

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
then as soon as you start to walk but

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.609 
then as soon as you start to walk but
you're<00:00:20.160> going<00:00:20.249> to<00:00:20.310> sprint<00:00:20.669> forward<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.619> hold

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619

you're going to sprint forward and hold
down<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.919> angst<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.400> push<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:23.579> forward

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
down the angst can push it forward

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.079 
down the angst can push it forward
there's<00:00:25.230> three<00:00:25.439> variations<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.189> if<00:00:26.460> you

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.089 
there's three variations of this if you

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.579 
there's three variations of this if you
do<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.300> like<00:00:27.329> I<00:00:27.509> did<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.689> then<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.230> sprint

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:28.589 
do it like I did just then and sprint

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:29.960 
do it like I did just then and sprint
towards<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> corner<00:00:29.310> as<00:00:29.550> soon<00:00:29.669> as<00:00:29.759> you<00:00:29.820> will

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
towards the corner as soon as you will

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.460 
towards the corner as soon as you will
breach<00:00:30.150> you'll<00:00:30.659> fall<00:00:30.869> completely<00:00:31.019> under<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
breach you'll fall completely under the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.890 
breach you'll fall completely under the
map<00:00:31.619> where<00:00:31.890> you'll<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.130> okay<00:00:32.430> you'll<00:00:32.610> land<00:00:32.900> you

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
map where you'll be okay you'll land you

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.720 
map where you'll be okay you'll land you
can't<00:00:34.170> move<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.560> can't<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.950> anywhere<00:00:35.160> but

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
can't move you can't get anywhere but

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.830 
can't move you can't get anywhere but
it's<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.910> pretty<00:00:36.030> cool<00:00:36.270> spot<00:00:36.510> you're<00:00:36.660> under<00:00:36.810> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
it's a pretty cool spot you're under the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.000 
it's a pretty cool spot you're under the
map<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.080> can<00:00:37.320> look<00:00:37.470> above<00:00:37.650> and<00:00:37.830> see<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
map you can look above and see the

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.860 
map you can look above and see the
people<00:00:38.160> up<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:38.520> without<00:00:39.150> your<00:00:39.300> sniper<00:00:39.540> take

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
three variations of that stat first

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.250 
three variations of that stat first
wanted<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> get<00:00:44.790> under<00:00:45.060> the<00:00:45.150> map<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.870> second

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
wanted to get under the map the second

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.340 
wanted to get under the map the second
one's<00:00:46.380> a<00:00:46.530> slight<00:00:46.860> wallbreach<00:00:48.230> where<00:00:49.230> you're

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
one's a slight wallbreach where you're

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.990 
one's a slight wallbreach where you're
just<00:00:49.560> sort<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.740> sticking<00:00:49.980> out<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.220> wall<00:00:50.430> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
just sort of sticking out the wall you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.310 
just sort of sticking out the wall you
can't<00:00:51.300> move<00:00:51.480> again<00:00:51.720> I'll<00:00:51.870> show<00:00:52.020> you<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.230> a

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
can't move again I'll show you that in a

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.530 
can't move again I'll show you that in a
second<00:00:52.650> and<00:00:52.830> finally<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> third<00:00:54.030> one<00:00:54.300> which

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
second and finally the third one which

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.760 
second and finally the third one which
is<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.750> best<00:00:54.960> one<00:00:55.110> which<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.470> one<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> get

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
is the best one which is the one to get

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.800 
is the best one which is the one to get
outside<00:00:56.100> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.310> map<00:00:56.450> similar<00:00:57.450> to<00:00:57.540> the<00:00:57.600> video

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
outside of the map similar to the video

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.030 
outside of the map similar to the video
that<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.050> showed<00:00:58.290> you<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.440> couple<00:00:58.650> of<00:00:58.680> days<00:00:58.830> ago

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
that I showed you a couple of days ago

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.070 
that I showed you a couple of days ago
it's<00:01:00.030> quite<00:01:00.240> difficult<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.660> get<00:01:00.810> the<00:01:00.870> hang<00:01:00.990> of

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.080 
it's quite difficult to get the hang of

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.740 
it's quite difficult to get the hang of
this<00:01:01.170> double<00:01:01.500> jump<00:01:02.030> what<00:01:03.030> I'd<00:01:03.150> recommend<00:01:03.300> is

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
this double jump what I'd recommend is

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.410 
this double jump what I'd recommend is
you<00:01:04.049> want<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.320> press<00:01:04.589> jump<00:01:04.920> once<00:01:05.390> straight<00:01:06.390> up

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you want to press jump once straight up

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.569 
you want to press jump once straight up
in<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.630> air<00:01:06.719> and<00:01:06.929> then<00:01:07.320> hold<00:01:07.679> forward<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:08.579 
in the air and then hold forward for the

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:10.940 
in the air and then hold forward for the
second<00:01:08.909> jump<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:10.229> as<00:01:10.350> soon<00:01:10.560> as<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:10.799> will

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
second jump and as soon as you will

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.859 
second jump and as soon as you will
reach<00:01:11.130> your<00:01:11.159> sprint<00:01:11.520> forward<00:01:11.850> if<00:01:12.600> you<00:01:12.689> don't

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
reach your sprint forward if you don't

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.149 
reach your sprint forward if you don't
go<00:01:12.960> under<00:01:13.079> the<00:01:13.200> map<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.469> might<00:01:13.710> land<00:01:13.920> here

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
go under the map you might land here

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.649 
go under the map you might land here
which<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> semi<00:01:14.789> sort<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.090> wall<00:01:15.270> breach<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
which is a semi sort of wall breach you

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.929 
which is a semi sort of wall breach you
sort<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> half<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> wall<00:01:16.469> half<00:01:16.679> not<00:01:16.939> again

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
sort of half in the wall half not again

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.029 
sort of half in the wall half not again
it's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> pretty<00:01:18.270> cool<00:01:18.479> spot<00:01:18.780> but<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.859> thing

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
it's a pretty cool spot but the thing

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:22.340 
it's a pretty cool spot but the thing
you<00:01:20.130> want<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.060> best<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:22.020> best<00:01:22.049> thing

buildings take some people out you can
also<00:01:56.279> get<00:01:56.459> under<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> map<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.270> way<00:01:57.450> if<00:01:57.539> you

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
also get under the map this way if you

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.449 
also get under the map this way if you
just<00:01:57.810> fall<00:01:57.959> down<00:01:57.990> go<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.979> explore<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.340> big

00:01:59.449 --> 00:01:59.459 
just fall down go and explore the big

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.879 
just fall down go and explore the big
red<00:01:59.670> bridge<00:01:59.909> in<00:02:00.029> the<00:02:00.119> distance<00:02:00.649> it's<00:02:01.649> quite

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:01.889 
red bridge in the distance it's quite

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.529 
red bridge in the distance it's quite
it's<00:02:02.159> quite<00:02:02.579> easy<00:02:02.789> to<00:02:03.029> do<00:02:03.179> once<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.389> get<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
it's quite easy to do once you get the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:04.730 
it's quite easy to do once you get the
hang<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.779> it<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.170> might<00:02:04.289> take<00:02:04.499> a<00:02:04.529> bit<00:02:04.619> of

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
hang of it but it might take a bit of

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.050 
hang of it but it might take a bit of
practicing<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.459> you<00:02:05.549> want<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> try<00:02:05.909> out<00:02:05.999> a

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
practicing so if you want to try out a

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.449 
practicing so if you want to try out a
private<00:02:06.359> match<00:02:06.630> first<00:02:06.869> I'd<00:02:06.990> recommend<00:02:07.259> it<00:02:07.590> but

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
private match first I'd recommend it but

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:09.320 
private match first I'd recommend it but
once<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:08.700> got<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.849> hang<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.209> fine

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
once you got the hang of it it's fine

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.820 
once you got the hang of it it's fine
like<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.840> said<00:02:10.019> my<00:02:10.110> number<00:02:10.319> one<00:02:10.439> tip<00:02:10.470> would<00:02:10.769> be

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
like I said my number one tip would be

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.030 
like I said my number one tip would be
to<00:02:11.420> jump<00:02:12.420> once<00:02:12.750> straight<00:02:13.379> up<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.769> then

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
to jump once straight up and then

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.119 
to jump once straight up and then
when<00:02:14.099> you<00:02:14.189> press<00:02:14.430> X<00:02:14.700> again<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.719> jump<00:02:15.989> hold<00:02:16.890> down

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
when you press X again to jump hold down

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.369 
when you press X again to jump hold down
forward<00:02:17.689> and<00:02:18.689> that<00:02:18.780> will<00:02:18.870> get<00:02:18.989> you<00:02:19.079> into<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
forward and that will get you into the

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.720 
forward and that will get you into the
wall<00:02:19.500> breach<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:20.010> then<00:02:20.159> depending<00:02:20.489> on<00:02:20.609> what

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
wall breach and then depending on what

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.800 
wall breach and then depending on what
you<00:02:20.790> want<00:02:20.939> to<00:02:20.969> do<00:02:21.090> you<00:02:21.239> either<00:02:21.329> sprint<00:02:21.659> into

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
get the thermal vision it's incredibly

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.759 
get the thermal vision it's incredibly
easy<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.720> do<00:03:00.870> that<00:03:00.989> was<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.139> very<00:03:01.290> first<00:03:01.590> time<00:03:01.739> I

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
easy to do that was a very first time I

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.110 
easy to do that was a very first time I
tried<00:03:02.099> it<00:03:02.189> and<00:03:02.220> I<00:03:02.310> got<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.459> on<00:03:02.579> my<00:03:02.669> third<00:03:02.849> goal

tried it and I got it on my third goal

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.659 
tried it and I got it on my third goal
so<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:04.560> timing<00:03:04.769> needs<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.159> be<00:03:05.250> good<00:03:05.430> but<00:03:05.579> it

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:05.669 
so the timing needs to be good but it

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.069 
so the timing needs to be good but it
doesn't<00:03:06.120> need<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.299> be<00:03:06.359> perfect<00:03:06.389> so<00:03:06.900> it's<00:03:06.989> very

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
doesn't need to be perfect so it's very

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.720 
doesn't need to be perfect so it's very
easy<00:03:07.169> to<00:03:07.379> do<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.709> can<00:03:08.220> see<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.430> thermal

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
easy to do you can see the thermal

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.240 
easy to do you can see the thermal
vision<00:03:08.849> here<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.389> also<00:03:09.859> enemies<00:03:10.859> will<00:03:10.980> show<00:03:11.129> up

vision here it also enemies will show up

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.050 
vision here it also enemies will show up
in<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.430> red<00:03:11.879> sort<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.510> diamond<00:03:12.900> as<00:03:13.019> well<00:03:13.939> so<00:03:14.939> it's

in a red sort of diamond as well so it's

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.309 
in a red sort of diamond as well so it's
really<00:03:15.209> cool<00:03:15.359> glitch<00:03:15.569> it<00:03:15.840> will<00:03:15.989> last<00:03:16.109> for<00:03:16.260> the

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
again basically in very very quick

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:03.710 
again basically in very very quick
succession<00:04:02.699> but<00:04:03.180> it's<00:04:03.329> actually<00:04:03.419> I<00:04:03.629> think

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
succession but it's actually I think

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.110 
succession but it's actually I think
it's<00:04:04.049> quite<00:04:04.500> easy<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.769> do<00:04:04.979> might<00:04:05.879> take<00:04:06.000> a<00:04:06.030> bit

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
it's quite easy to do might take a bit

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.479 
it's quite easy to do might take a bit
of<00:04:06.239> practicing<00:04:06.689> that<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:07.109> again<00:04:08.040> this<00:04:08.189> is<00:04:08.400> the
