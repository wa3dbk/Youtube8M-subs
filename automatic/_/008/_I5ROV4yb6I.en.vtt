number<00:02:26.940> two<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.540> to<00:02:27.690> increase<00:02:28.020> your<00:02:28.080> protein

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
number two is to increase your protein

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.350 
number two is to increase your protein
intake<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.220> once<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.520> go<00:02:29.670> into<00:02:29.790> a<00:02:29.940> caloric

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
intake so once you go into a caloric

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.180 
intake so once you go into a caloric
deficit<00:02:30.870> your<00:02:31.320> muscle<00:02:31.680> becomes<00:02:31.920> slightly

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
deficit your muscle becomes slightly

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.580

endurance<00:03:13.710> runners<00:03:14.010> whatever<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.430> will

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
endurance runners whatever you will

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.030 
endurance runners whatever you will
number<00:03:15.270> three<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.780> to<00:03:15.810> start<00:03:16.200> with<00:03:16.350> a<00:03:16.590> minimum

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
number three is to start with a minimum

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.640 
number three is to start with a minimum
amount<00:03:17.460> of<00:03:17.760> cardio<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:19.050> what<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.530> minimum

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
amount of cardio so what is the minimum

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.040 
amount of cardio so what is the minimum
amount<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.250> cardio<00:03:20.610> look<00:03:20.790> like<00:03:20.970> one<00:03:21.510> day<00:03:21.780> per

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
amount of cardio look like one day per

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.860 
amount of cardio look like one day per
week<00:03:22.080> so<00:03:23.070> if<00:03:23.130> you<00:03:23.250> want<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.670> lose<00:03:23.850> fat<00:03:23.880> this<00:03:24.810> is

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
week so if you want to lose fat this is

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.540 
week so if you want to lose fat this is
kind<00:03:25.230> of<00:03:25.290> counterintuitive<00:03:25.650> because<00:03:26.190> people

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
kind of counterintuitive because people

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.220 
kind of counterintuitive because people
are<00:03:26.610> like<00:03:26.700> I<00:03:26.910> want<00:03:27.300> to<00:03:27.390> lose<00:03:27.540> fat<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.020> I'm<00:03:28.110> going

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
you do too much too soon then you've got

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.840 
you do too much too soon then you've got
nowhere<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.340> go

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850

progressive approach and if you give
yourself<00:04:04.920> enough<00:04:05.040> time<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:06.090> will<00:04:06.900> work

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110

that they have no intensity to train in
the<00:04:25.020> gym<00:04:25.050> so<00:04:25.740> they're<00:04:25.890> like<00:04:26.039> starving<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.789> fat

the<00:04:35.520> importance<00:04:36.210> of<00:04:36.419> this<00:04:36.660> concept<00:04:36.930> and<00:04:37.440> they

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
the importance of this concept and they

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.100 
the importance of this concept and they
only<00:04:38.160> add<00:04:38.280> in<00:04:38.490> as<00:04:38.610> much<00:04:38.789> cardio<00:04:39.330> as<00:04:39.449> necessary

a<00:04:43.199> lot<00:04:43.349> of<00:04:43.380> cardio<00:04:43.650> because<00:04:44.009> it's<00:04:44.130> catabolic

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
a lot of cardio because it's catabolic

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.879 
a lot of cardio because it's catabolic
it<00:04:44.940> strips<00:04:45.240> off<00:04:45.419> their<00:04:45.599> muscle<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.110> strips<00:04:46.680> off

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:46.889 
it strips off their muscle it strips off
