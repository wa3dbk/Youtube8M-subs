the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.030 
the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
it's<00:01:03.420> pretty<00:01:03.629> early<00:01:03.840> early<00:01:04.320> prototype<00:01:04.830> days

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
it's pretty early early prototype days

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.280 
it's pretty early early prototype days
but<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.400> idea<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.780> phone<00:01:07.049> on

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
but the idea is that it's your phone on

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.100 
but the idea is that it's your phone on
your<00:01:07.920> watch<00:01:08.189> now<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.790> there's<00:01:09.180> no<00:01:09.330> keypad<00:01:09.810> so

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
your watch now you there's no keypad so

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.300 
your watch now you there's no keypad so
that<00:01:10.140> we've<00:01:10.560> been<00:01:10.650> told<00:01:10.890> that<00:01:11.100> there's<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
that we've been told that there's a

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.219 
that we've been told that there's a
little<00:01:11.430> scroll<00:01:11.909> wheel<00:01:12.090> at<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.299> bottom<00:01:12.630> allows

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
little scroll wheel at the bottom allows

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.750 
little scroll wheel at the bottom allows
you<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.560> scroll<00:01:13.890> through<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.189> numbers<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
you to scroll through the numbers and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.890 
you to scroll through the numbers and
you<00:01:14.909> obviously<00:01:15.000> talk<00:01:15.390> for<00:01:15.600> our<00:01:15.720> Bluetooth
