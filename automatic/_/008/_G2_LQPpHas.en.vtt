Israeli offensive is designed to bring

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.850 
Israeli offensive is designed to bring
down<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.840> Hamas<00:00:13.080> government<00:00:13.230> do<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.679> agree

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
down the Hamas government do you agree

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.109 
down the Hamas government do you agree
with<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.299> I<00:00:15.299> think<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.010> may<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.039> yes<00:00:17.699> I<00:00:17.940> mean

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
with that I think it may be yes I mean

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.859 
with that I think it may be yes I mean
it's<00:00:18.270> certainly<00:00:18.650> targeted<00:00:19.650> at<00:00:19.830> at<00:00:20.640> Hamas<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
it's certainly targeted at at Hamas in a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.750 
it's certainly targeted at at Hamas in a
way<00:00:22.140> but<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.619> think<00:00:22.980> there's<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.220> broader<00:00:23.519> agenda

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
way but I think there's a broader agenda

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.720 
way but I think there's a broader agenda
here<00:00:24.269> which<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:25.140> Israel's<00:00:26.070> reaction<00:00:26.550> to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
here which is that Israel's reaction to

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.790 
here which is that Israel's reaction to
the<00:00:26.849> election<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.269> Hamas<00:00:27.599> generally<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.289> to

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the election of Hamas generally and to

the election of Hamas generally and to
everything<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.310> hasn't<00:00:29.670> liked<00:00:29.820> in<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> past

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
everything it hasn't liked in the past

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.389 
everything it hasn't liked in the past
has<00:00:30.510> been<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:31.410> target<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> Palestinian

more<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.930> same<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.590> think<00:00:44.280> though<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690

think<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.559> step<00:00:46.770> back<00:00:46.800> a<00:00:46.980> little<00:00:47.280> bit<00:00:47.610> and

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
think have to step back a little bit and

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.690 
think have to step back a little bit and
ask<00:00:48.899> yourself<00:00:49.440> what<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:50.250> people<00:00:50.399> who

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
ask yourself what the people who

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.819 
ask yourself what the people who
launched<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> raid<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:52.020> keeping<00:00:52.289> the

soldier wanted to achieve could they

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.950 
soldier wanted to achieve could they
have<00:00:55.500> expected<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.309> different<00:00:56.420> response<00:00:57.420> from

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
have expected a different response from

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.049 
have expected a different response from
Israel<00:00:58.440> when<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> Israeli<00:00:59.760> pattern

deciding<00:01:51.060> how<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.210> move<00:01:51.450> forward<00:01:51.770> well<00:01:52.770> that's

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
deciding how to move forward well that's

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.260 
deciding how to move forward well that's
exactly<00:01:53.100> what<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.549> was<00:01:53.640> coming<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.060> think

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
exactly what I was coming to I think

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.179 
exactly what I was coming to I think
it's<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.630> it's<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.320> absolutely<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:55.979> right

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it's a it's it's absolutely the right

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.859 
it's a it's it's absolutely the right
question<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.640> think<00:01:56.670> there's<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> clear<00:01:57.509> split

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
question I think there's a clear split

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.410 
question I think there's a clear split
along<00:01:58.770> at<00:01:59.040> least<00:01:59.369> two<00:01:59.579> different<00:01:59.759> lines<00:02:00.119> i

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
along at least two different lines i

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.060 
along at least two different lines i
mean<00:02:00.600> i<00:02:00.689> think<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.930> there's<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.259> group<00:02:01.560> which

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
mean i think that there's a group which

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.399 
mean i think that there's a group which
looks<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> me<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.270> more<00:02:03.479> nationalistic<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
looks to me to be more nationalistic and

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.499 
looks to me to be more nationalistic and
it<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.920> interested<00:02:05.610> therefore<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.119> making<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
it is interested therefore in making a

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.229 
it is interested therefore in making a
deal<00:02:06.689> first<00:02:07.380> with<00:02:07.530> feta<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.220> then<00:02:08.849> with<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
deal first with feta and then with the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.029 
deal first with feta and then with the
other<00:02:09.420> Arabs<00:02:09.780> and

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
other Arabs and

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.250 
other Arabs and
have<00:02:10.189> you<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:11.000> ultimately<00:02:11.260> probably

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
have you and ultimately probably

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.080 
have you and ultimately probably
amenable<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:12.769> doing<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:13.159> deal<00:02:13.340> with<00:02:13.519> Israel<00:02:13.909> and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
amenable to doing a deal with Israel and

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.849 
amenable to doing a deal with Israel and
I<00:02:14.480> think<00:02:14.540> there's<00:02:14.870> another<00:02:15.170> group<00:02:15.379> many<00:02:15.680> of

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:15.859 
I think there's another group many of

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:18.250 
I think there's another group many of
whose<00:02:16.099> leaders<00:02:17.030> are<00:02:17.269> based<00:02:17.480> outside<00:02:17.750> of

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
whose leaders are based outside of

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.220 
whose leaders are based outside of
Palestine<00:02:18.829> who<00:02:19.579> seem<00:02:19.909> to<00:02:19.939> be<00:02:20.239> more<00:02:20.510> interested

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
Palestine who seem to be more interested

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.729 
Palestine who seem to be more interested
in<00:02:22.359> Palestine<00:02:23.359> as<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.599> symbol<00:02:24.019> as<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.230> cause<00:02:24.500> as

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
in Palestine as a symbol as a cause as

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.130 
in Palestine as a symbol as a cause as
an<00:02:24.859> issue<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.819> who<00:02:26.120> take<00:02:26.329> a<00:02:26.359> very<00:02:26.659> hard<00:02:26.930> line

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
an issue and who take a very hard line

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.679 
an issue and who take a very hard line
that<00:02:27.620> precludes<00:02:28.159> in<00:02:28.459> effect<00:02:28.790> negotiations

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
that precludes in effect negotiations

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.500 
that precludes in effect negotiations
and<00:02:29.840> precludes<00:02:30.260> being<00:02:31.189> a<00:02:31.250> working<00:02:31.640> towards<00:02:32.060> an

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
and precludes being a working towards an

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.690 
and precludes being a working towards an
independent<00:02:33.140> state<00:02:33.349> so<00:02:33.590> i<00:02:33.620> think<00:02:33.769> the<00:02:34.280> split

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
independent state so i think the split

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.300 
independent state so i think the split
it<00:02:35.569> sit<00:02:35.840> there<00:02:35.870> there<00:02:36.500> these<00:02:36.709> two<00:02:36.920> tendencies

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
it sit there there these two tendencies

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.940 
it sit there there these two tendencies
were<00:02:37.639> sort<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.030> juggled<00:02:38.480> by<00:02:38.689> hamas<00:02:39.049> fairly

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
were sort of juggled by hamas fairly

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.679 
were sort of juggled by hamas fairly
well<00:02:40.219> when<00:02:40.519> they<00:02:40.639> were<00:02:40.700> out<00:02:40.790> of<00:02:40.939> power<00:02:41.180> but<00:02:41.480> now

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
well when they were out of power but now

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:43.420 
well when they were out of power but now
that<00:02:41.870> they've<00:02:42.019> been<00:02:42.049> elected<00:02:42.620> and<00:02:42.799> now<00:02:43.220> that

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
that they've been elected and now that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.940 
that they've been elected and now that
they<00:02:43.579> run<00:02:44.150> part<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.629> government<00:02:45.079> I<00:02:45.439> think

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
they run part of the government I think

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.159 
they run part of the government I think
it's<00:02:46.310> become<00:02:46.670> clearer<00:02:46.939> and<00:02:47.120> clearer<00:02:47.389> Hussein

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:48.169 
it's become clearer and clearer Hussein

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:49.569 
it's become clearer and clearer Hussein
