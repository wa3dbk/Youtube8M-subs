00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.899
 hi what's up with such people here that I 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.609
 they comment again and I extract another 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.620
 white gameplay 2 this time is the 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.210
 root map and it's team duel like that 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.360
 which is a fairly short game is already 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.860
 a little more than 4 minutes and nothing 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.410
 I wanted to give advice about 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.110
 sniper good as you are seeing 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.119
 on this map it 's super easy to make yourself 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.440
 several casualties with the franc because of a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.060
 side to another even going through 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.590
 walls or you can shoot through 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.770
 from the wall as you will see the odd 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.900
 low 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.250
 and the truth is that you're going to kill yourself but 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.400
 good to be such a short gameplay 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.290
 I wanted to deepen a little bit 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.750
 and give a few tips about the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.250
 sniper is worth first as 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.710
 I would take it the sniper or how 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.620
 I wear it in this gameplay because first 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.860
 place I take the laser sight as 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.800
 sniper accessories 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.190
 and the pp or ballistics that is so that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.420
 Avoid the swing at the time of aiming 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.970
 as you are seeing for me the best 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.310
 sniper there is the one of cr though 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.540
 it takes a little longer to aim but not 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.450
 I usually do almost no brand is 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.670
 generally then it goes pretty well 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.590
 so 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.780
 that's like the accessories that it would take 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.619
 then more first- advantage things 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:15.710
 you can choose to take what you want 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.840
 both that lightweight and 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.540
 bulletproof vest as a ghost what 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.649
 more radios but good that's already yours 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.630
 choice but what it is 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.850
 fundamentally worth carrying is hardness in 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.200
 this case because if they are shooting you 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.930
 let's say that at the time of aiming it is not 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.430
 the shot goes so much and since you have a 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.119
 bullet then you have to try to secure it 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.830
 to the best possible and that in the second 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.819
 advantage and the third advantage both 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.760
 dexterity as extreme conditioning or 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:45.060
 whatever is 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.820
 tactical mask 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.310
 I do not know what you want but above all 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.130
 skill why then because if you go 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.200
 running to the enemy 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.630
 let's say we aim much much more 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.530
 fast that if you take any 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.060
 another advantage plus things how would the 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.119
 way sky to play the sniper 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.069
 ok with the franc can follow a 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.860
 staying as I am seeing right now 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.930
 in the video from one side to the other and 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.700
 waiting for it to happen or shoot them and 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.769
 send them or try to mark them in this 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.299
 case or go more to sack with the 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.650
 sniper and try to find you 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.110
 the people in front and try to do 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.480
 some quick or some scope and try 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.220
 kill you read or risk there is more but 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.370
 well, let's say it's one more way 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.870
 more fun in so to speak of 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.299
 to play with a sniper 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.950
 how are you going to see in the employment of both 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:39.250
 one way how another is valid so I can 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.709
 explain how a way is made and from 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.590
 another if you are from afar as I am 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.290
 seeing now equal point and shoot or 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.510
 be not do not clicks not good if you yes 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.450
 he gives you very well he could do it and such but 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.069
 my advice is to note or try 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.629
 aim as best as possible and shoot 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.810
 because since you have a bullet try 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:03:02.049
 give it and then since then if you go in 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.640
 contact with the enemy of a front if 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.120
 we have if you are going to meet face to face 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.250
 and such several tips first of all if 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.109
 you're running, stop running when you turn 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.060
 a corner or if you know that it's going to 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.829
 there is a guy is like the 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.830
 submachine guns but let's say more 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.170
 more pronounced marked 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.640
 if I found you is a guy you have to 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.290
 know since there's going to be a guy there 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.690
 example now you are going to see a double low 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.910
 if you notice now he stopped running and 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.280
 I'm half aiming some quick and I do 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.570
 another one and I charge both of you then you have 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.060
 to go very carefully knowing that 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.610
 they will be there and stop running in the 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.500
 corners and start already let's say not point 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.620
 but already if with the finger very marked for 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.390
 say I'm going to try to shoot him the earlier 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.920
 possible and even if they carry a sub-machine gun or 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.840
 they placed them faster than a 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.450
 you're going to kill them, even though I already 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.220
 I say that he has a submachine gun or any 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.630
 another weapon is going to be faster 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.850
 sniper because you're going to have only 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.890
 a bullet and good and basically those are 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.450
 the sniper's advice is a 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.950
 part quite normal and it's nothing 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.170
 from the other world 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.209
 ended with a 22 7 came from pearls 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.220
 to explain it and not to vote 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.780
 favorites tell me if you want more 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.190
 advice about other weapons since I 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.830
 you asked for a lot is the sniper 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.930
 and this in my advice today and nothing and we 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.340
 we see in the next video and if not

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.959
