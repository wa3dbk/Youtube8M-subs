over<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:44.820> real<00:00:45.660> skateboard<00:00:48.110> maybe<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.170> should

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
over here real skateboard maybe I should

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.569 
over here real skateboard maybe I should
take<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.500> board<00:00:49.710> out<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.950> box<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.550> that

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
take the board out of the box so that

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.470 
take the board out of the box so that
this<00:00:50.850> actually<00:00:51.239> is<00:00:51.270> meaning<00:00:51.750> I<00:00:53.390> would<00:00:54.390> have

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
this actually is meaning I would have

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.569 
this actually is meaning I would have
put<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:55.860> piece<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.399> have<00:00:56.520> to

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
put in like one piece if you have to

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.119 
put in like one piece if you have to
assembly<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.500> think<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.559> he<00:00:58.680> had<00:00:58.710> had<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.039> be

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
assembly I think if he had had to be

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.319 
assembly I think if he had had to be
assembled<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> box<00:00:59.760> would<00:00:59.910> be<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> different

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
assembled the box would be a different

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.970 
assembled the box would be a different
size<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.750> shape<00:01:01.050> because<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.680> kind<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:01.890> a

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
size and shape because this is kind of a

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:14.679 
size and shape because this is kind of a
weird<00:01:02.190> thing<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.719> ship<00:01:03.719> right<00:01:03.960> sure<00:01:04.650> okay<00:01:05.040> so

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.139 

day<00:01:15.530> we<00:01:15.770> got<00:01:15.890> Tony<00:01:16.070> Hawk<00:01:16.310> ride<00:01:16.549> it's<00:01:16.789> Tony<00:01:16.969> Hawk

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
you have a board across Times Square in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.959

the<00:01:26.390> future<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:27.170> got<00:01:27.289> to<00:01:27.380> have<00:01:27.469> power<00:01:33.969> break

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
the future you got to have power break

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:38.709 
the future you got to have power break
my<00:01:35.119> laptop<00:01:35.569> so<00:01:35.959> exciting<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:36.649> alright<00:01:37.630> now<00:01:38.630> we

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:38.719 
my laptop so exciting so alright now we

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:40.949 
my laptop so exciting so alright now we
can<00:01:38.899> do<00:01:38.959> this<00:01:39.140> comparison<00:01:39.409> a<00:01:39.679> little<00:01:39.859> bit<00:01:39.979> more

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:40.959 
can do this comparison a little bit more

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.889 
can do this comparison a little bit more
so<00:01:43.060> it's<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.090> little<00:01:44.179> bit<00:01:44.329> shorter<00:01:44.630> a<00:01:44.659> couple

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
so it's a little bit shorter a couple

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.089 
so it's a little bit shorter a couple
inches<00:01:45.020> size<00:01:45.530> but<00:01:45.950> it's<00:01:46.099> you<00:01:46.399> know<00:01:46.490> thicker

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
inches size but it's you know thicker

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:52.119 
inches size but it's you know thicker
obviously<00:01:49.099> and<00:01:49.670> then<00:01:50.619> get<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:51.709> close<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.069> all

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:52.129 
obviously and then get it close to all

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:58.419 
obviously and then get it close to all
these<00:01:52.989> buttons<00:01:57.009> there's<00:01:58.009> all<00:01:58.129> sorts<00:01:58.369> of

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429 
these buttons there's all sorts of

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:00.069 
these buttons there's all sorts of
nonsense<00:01:58.610> over<00:01:59.000> here<00:01:59.119> a<00:01:59.239> lot<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.539> Technology

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
nonsense over here a lot of Technology

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.300 
nonsense over here a lot of Technology
