actually use your movement keys whatever
they<00:01:39.960> may<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.369> was<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.390> WASD<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.829> your

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
they may be was is the WASD is your

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.490 
they may be was is the WASD is your
default<00:01:44.939> keys<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:45.659> I've<00:01:45.780> actually<00:01:45.960> rebound

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
default keys but I've actually rebound

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.130 
default keys but I've actually rebound
mine<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:47.009> so<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.240> object<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.750> keep<00:01:48.960> that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
mine and so the object is to keep that

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.920 
mine and so the object is to keep that
recta<00:01:49.470> cool<00:01:49.680> inside<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> circle<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
recta cool inside the circle on the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.889 
recta cool inside the circle on the
right<00:01:51.960> hand<00:01:52.470> side<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.040> will<00:01:53.070> see<00:01:53.369> like<00:01:53.549> a

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
right hand side you will see like a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.709 
right hand side you will see like a
thing<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.930> will<00:01:55.229> slowly<00:01:55.680> climb<00:01:56.310> red<00:01:57.299> or<00:01:57.570> and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
thing that will slowly climb red or and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.870 
thing that will slowly climb red or and
redder<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.110> redder<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.649> it<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.860> 100%<00:01:59.670> red

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
redder and redder when it is 100% red

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.100 
redder and redder when it is 100% red
this<00:02:00.119> dragon<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.689> yours

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
this dragon is yours

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.490 
this dragon is yours
it<00:02:01.649> will<00:02:02.100> only<00:02:02.219> climb<00:02:02.700> however<00:02:03.570> while<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
it will only climb however while the

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.039 
it will only climb however while the
recta<00:02:04.770> Kuehl<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.130> inside<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.850> circle<00:02:06.000> alright

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
recta Kuehl is inside the circle alright

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.630 
recta Kuehl is inside the circle alright
so<00:02:07.619> that's<00:02:07.829> what<00:02:08.039> you're<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.459> seeing

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
so that's what you're going to be seeing

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.550 
so that's what you're going to be seeing
and<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:09.119> obviously<00:02:09.270> if<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.959> rec<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.200> go<00:02:10.349> goes

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
and then obviously if the rec to go goes

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.320 
and then obviously if the rec to go goes
way<00:02:10.679> outside<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.160> circle<00:02:11.340> nothing<00:02:12.000> can<00:02:12.180> come

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
way outside the circle nothing can come

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.400 
way outside the circle nothing can come
up<00:02:12.450> red<00:02:12.690> and<00:02:12.930> then<00:02:13.020> event

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
up red and then event

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.500 
up red and then event
the<00:02:13.740> dragon<00:02:14.160> will<00:02:14.310> buck<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.730> off<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.270> then

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
the dragon will buck you off and then

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.860 
the dragon will buck you off and then
attack<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.770> if<00:02:17.310> you're<00:02:17.940> going<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.450> do<00:02:18.630> this
