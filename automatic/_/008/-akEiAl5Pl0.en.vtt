00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
of the best Town Hall level 7 base

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.560 
of the best Town Hall level 7 base
designs<00:00:09.929> ever<00:00:10.880> though<00:00:11.880> Leary's<00:00:12.150> i<00:00:12.269> keep<00:00:12.480> on

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
designs ever though Leary's i keep on

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:19.300 
designs ever though Leary's i keep on
want<00:00:12.750> best<00:00:13.200> is<00:00:13.440> because<00:00:14.240> it's<00:00:15.410> my<00:00:16.410> base<00:00:17.180> and<00:00:18.180> i

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
want best is because it's my base and i

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.210 
want best is because it's my base and i
just<00:00:20.310> created<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.230> trophy<00:00:22.230> hunting<00:00:22.949> base

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
just created this trophy hunting base

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.220 
just created this trophy hunting base
kind<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:23.970> like<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.150> hypertrophic<00:00:24.869> on<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> base

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
kind of like a hypertrophic on the base

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.970 
kind of like a hypertrophic on the base
because<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.859> can<00:00:25.980> still<00:00:26.160> kinda<00:00:26.460> see<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.210> can

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
because you can still kinda see you can

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.230 
because you can still kinda see you can
protect<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.160> gold<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.609> everything<00:00:30.090> an

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
protect the gold and everything an

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.479 
protect the gold and everything an
elixir<00:00:30.570> but<00:00:31.940> let's<00:00:32.940> turn<00:00:33.120> this<00:00:33.239> down<00:00:33.770> yeah<00:00:34.770> but

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
elixir but let's turn this down yeah but

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.459 
elixir but let's turn this down yeah but
yeah<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:36.090> is<00:00:36.360> my<00:00:37.730> new<00:00:38.730> base<00:00:39.000> design<00:00:39.390> i<00:00:39.690> will

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
yeah this is my new base design i will

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.389 
yeah this is my new base design i will
be<00:00:40.559> using<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.489> try<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.090> get<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.960> highest

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
be using it to try to get to the highest

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.740 
be using it to try to get to the highest
trophy<00:00:44.399> league<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.910> possible<00:00:45.480> i'm<00:00:45.600> actually

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
trophy league as possible i'm actually

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.220 
trophy league as possible i'm actually
going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.110> try<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> make<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:47.539> crystal<00:00:48.539> three

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
going to try to make it to crystal three

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.080 
going to try to make it to crystal three
and<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.559> i<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.829> go<00:00:49.920> past<00:00:50.250> crystalline<00:00:50.789> i'll<00:00:50.910> be

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and if i can go past crystalline i'll be

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.689 
and if i can go past crystalline i'll be
just<00:00:51.300> amazing<00:00:51.719> um<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.920> angles<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.489> till<00:00:53.610> at

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
just amazing um I'm angles just till at

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.369 
just amazing um I'm angles just till at
least<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.239> track<00:00:54.420> gets<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> crystal

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
least get to the track gets a crystal

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.910 
least get to the track gets a crystal
three<00:00:55.730> and<00:00:56.730> yeah<00:00:57.510> hopefully<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.350> can<00:00:58.590> get

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
three and yeah hopefully I can get

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.430 
three and yeah hopefully I can get
always<00:00:59.280> crucially<00:00:59.789> with<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.180> sick<00:01:00.570> base

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
always crucially with this sick base

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.570 
always crucially with this sick base
design<00:01:02.750> let<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:04.129> let<00:01:05.129> me<00:01:05.189> give<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
design let go let me give you the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.660 
design let go let me give you the
run-through<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.479> base<00:01:07.110> design<00:01:07.670> well

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
run-through of this base design well

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.789 
run-through of this base design well
first<00:01:09.000> of<00:01:09.150> all<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.720> my<00:01:09.960> more<00:01:10.500> than<00:01:10.710> a

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
first of all I have my more than a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.980 
first of all I have my more than a
triangle<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.850> them<00:01:12.030> set<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.510> just

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
triangle so I have them set so just

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
triangle so I have them set so just
about<00:01:13.080> everywhere<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.860> base<00:01:14.010> my<00:01:14.729> motors

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
about everywhere in the base my motors

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.070 
about everywhere in the base my motors
are<00:01:15.530> can<00:01:16.530> shoot<00:01:16.799> at<00:01:16.950> them<00:01:17.689> see<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.780> look<00:01:18.930> you

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
are can shoot at them see you look you

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.490 
are can shoot at them see you look you
cover<00:01:19.409> all<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.799> all<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.320> can<00:01:22.320> cover

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
cover all that all that you can cover

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.600 
cover all that all that you can cover
all<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:23.040> down<00:01:23.220> there<00:01:23.659> another<00:01:24.659> thing<00:01:24.960> is<00:01:25.259> i

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
all that down there another thing is i

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.429 
all that down there another thing is i
have<00:01:26.610> my<00:01:26.939> wizard<00:01:27.330> towers<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.810> Tesla's<00:01:28.229> and

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
have my wizard towers and Tesla's and

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.130 
have my wizard towers and Tesla's and
one<00:01:29.369> air<00:01:29.520> defense<00:01:29.850> right<00:01:30.210> next<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.630> my<00:01:30.720> channel

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
one air defense right next to my channel

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.410 
one air defense right next to my channel
I<00:01:31.320> also<00:01:32.100> have<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.610> strongest<00:01:32.970> walls<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.390> can

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
I also have the strongest walls you can

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.600 
I also have the strongest walls you can
get<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.810> town<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.140> little<00:01:34.380> seven<00:01:34.740> guarding<00:01:35.579> that

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
get a town a little seven guarding that

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.310 
get a town a little seven guarding that
so<00:01:36.530> that<00:01:38.240> usually<00:01:39.240> people<00:01:39.570> would<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.079> would<00:01:40.170> be

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
so that usually people would it would be

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.410 
so that usually people would it would be
smarter<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.829> put<00:01:41.100> your<00:01:41.220> tittle<00:01:41.909> unless<00:01:42.329> you

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
smarter to put your tittle unless you

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.020 
smarter to put your tittle unless you
have<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:43.009> fence<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.250> right<00:01:44.610> next<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.880> your

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
have the fence is right next to your

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.030 
have the fence is right next to your
town<00:01:45.119> hall<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.320> your<00:01:46.530> strongest

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
town hall and you have your strongest

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.700 
town hall and you have your strongest
walls<00:01:47.369> covering<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.930> usually<00:01:49.110> should

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
walls covering that you usually should

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.039 
walls covering that you usually should
have<00:01:49.950> your<00:01:50.100> walls<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.329> outside<00:01:51.869> of<00:01:51.899> your

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
have your walls on the outside of your

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.200 
have your walls on the outside of your
base<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.860> walbridge<00:01:53.430> would<00:01:53.670> go<00:01:53.759> from<00:01:53.939> first

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
base so walbridge would go from first

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.080 
base so walbridge would go from first
and<00:01:54.479> no<00:01:54.630> kind<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.619> people<00:01:56.610> would<00:01:56.759> waste

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
and no kind of so the people would waste

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.700 
and no kind of so the people would waste
some<00:01:57.240> war<00:01:57.420> workers<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.990> outside<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
some war workers on the outside of the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.810 
some war workers on the outside of the
base<00:01:58.799> so<00:01:59.040> they<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.399> have<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> other

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
base so they have to have the other

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.990 
base so they have to have the other
stuff<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:01.159> but<00:02:02.159> I'm<00:02:02.250> doing<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:02.820> you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
stuff go in but I'm doing so that you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.590 
stuff go in but I'm doing so that you
have<00:02:03.180> defenses<00:02:04.520> inside<00:02:05.520> all<00:02:05.850> my<00:02:06.210> strongest

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
have defenses inside all my strongest

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.040 
have defenses inside all my strongest
walls<00:02:06.869> I'm<00:02:07.530> actually<00:02:07.829> going<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.220> have<00:02:09.050> Archie

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
walls I'm actually going to have Archie

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.130 
walls I'm actually going to have Archie
don't<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.890> my<00:02:11.129> structural<00:02:11.670> so<00:02:12.270> I'm<00:02:12.480> hoping

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
don't have my structural so I'm hoping

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.870 
don't have my structural so I'm hoping
my<00:02:13.319> plan<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:14.100> is<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:16.440> that<00:02:16.800> when<00:02:17.520> someone

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
my plan of that is so that when someone

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.520 
my plan of that is so that when someone
uses<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.300> wall<00:02:18.540> breakers<00:02:18.990> like<00:02:19.200> they<00:02:19.350> said

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
uses the wall breakers like they said

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.410 
uses the wall breakers like they said
them<00:02:19.709> in<00:02:19.800> from<00:02:19.980> somewhere<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:21.000> they<00:02:21.240> just

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
them in from somewhere that they just

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.150 
them in from somewhere that they just
send<00:02:22.260> them<00:02:22.319> in<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.650> waste<00:02:22.950> all<00:02:23.069> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
send them in the waste all the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
to put your wall breakers and have it go

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.530 
to put your wall breakers and have it go
through<00:02:48.030> all<00:02:48.390> other<00:02:48.959> walls<00:02:49.820> and<00:02:50.820> so<00:02:51.360> yeah

defense gets destroyed I have like
another<00:04:18.720> one<00:04:18.930> backing<00:04:19.229> up<00:04:19.560> from<00:04:20.340> another

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
another one backing up from another

has been hit on I have these two backing

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.090 
has been hit on I have these two backing
it<00:04:25.140> up<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.590> these<00:04:26.010> two<00:04:26.340> back<00:04:26.669> in<00:04:26.820> it

and<00:04:27.520> if<00:04:28.030> these<00:04:28.180> two<00:04:28.360> start<00:04:28.540> getting<00:04:28.900> destroyed

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
and if these two start getting destroyed

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.890 
and if these two start getting destroyed
I<00:04:29.740> have<00:04:30.070> my<00:04:30.190> mortars<00:04:30.700> backing<00:04:31.270> those<00:04:31.390> up<00:04:31.600> in<00:04:31.780> my

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
I have my mortars backing those up in my

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.020 
I have my mortars backing those up in my
Archer<00:04:32.200> towers<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.710> stuff<00:04:32.920> so<00:04:33.160> everything

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
Archer towers and stuff so everything

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.790 
Archer towers and stuff so everything
has<00:04:34.180> like<00:04:34.330> all<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:35.140> fences<00:04:35.350> have<00:04:35.620> each

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
has like all the fences have each

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.850 
has like all the fences have each
other's<00:04:36.100> back<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:36.700> guess<00:04:36.970> kind<00:04:37.420> of<00:04:37.480> funny

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
other's back I guess kind of funny

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.280 
other's back I guess kind of funny
nothing<00:04:38.860> like<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.070> real<00:04:39.100> people<00:04:39.430> but<00:04:39.730> though

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
nothing like the real people but though

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.170 
nothing like the real people but though
yeah<00:04:41.290> and<00:04:41.560> what<00:04:42.310> my<00:04:42.490> favorite<00:04:42.820> thing<00:04:43.000> about

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
yeah and what my favorite thing about

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.380 
yeah and what my favorite thing about
this<00:04:43.450> entire<00:04:43.780> base<00:04:43.990> by<00:04:44.290> far<00:04:44.650> is<00:04:45.390> its

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
this entire base by far is its

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.210 
this entire base by far is its
symmetrical<00:04:47.110> everything<00:04:47.800> and<00:04:47.950> even

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
symmetrical everything and even

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.570 
symmetrical everything and even
everything's<00:04:48.820> nice<00:04:49.060> I<00:04:49.300> am<00:04:49.570> really<00:04:50.380> OCD<00:04:51.100> about

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
everything's nice I am really OCD about

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.530 
everything's nice I am really OCD about
how<00:04:52.180> am<00:04:52.300> I<00:04:52.360> base<00:04:52.540> is<00:04:52.750> symmetrical<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:54.540> am

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
how am I base is symmetrical and I am

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.480 
how am I base is symmetrical and I am
that's<00:04:56.530> my<00:04:56.770> favorite<00:04:57.040> part<00:04:57.070> about<00:04:57.190> how

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
that's my favorite part about how

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.710 
that's my favorite part about how
everything<00:04:57.910> is<00:04:58.000> symmetrical<00:04:58.510> so<00:04:59.910> if<00:05:00.910> I<00:05:01.180> think

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
everything is symmetrical so if I think

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.330 
everything is symmetrical so if I think
that's<00:05:01.900> pretty<00:05:02.260> much<00:05:02.470> gonna<00:05:02.650> wrap<00:05:02.830> it<00:05:02.950> up<00:05:03.100> oh

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
that's pretty much gonna wrap it up oh

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.990 
that's pretty much gonna wrap it up oh
and<00:05:03.910> guys<00:05:04.060> if<00:05:04.360> you<00:05:05.170> want<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:06.130> move<00:05:06.760> stuff

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
and guys if you want to move stuff

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.460 
and guys if you want to move stuff
around<00:05:07.090> like<00:05:07.390> if<00:05:07.540> you<00:05:07.690> care<00:05:07.960> about<00:05:08.050> your<00:05:08.170> dark

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
around like if you care about your dark

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.950 
around like if you care about your dark
looks<00:05:08.710> are<00:05:08.860> more<00:05:09.040> than<00:05:09.280> your<00:05:09.750> goal<00:05:10.750> or

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
looks are more than your goal or

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.390 
looks are more than your goal or
something<00:05:11.260> you<00:05:11.320> can<00:05:11.470> like<00:05:11.590> switch<00:05:11.890> it<00:05:12.070> out<00:05:12.220> or

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
something you can like switch it out or

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
have some ideas of your own of a base i

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.070 
have some ideas of your own of a base i
think<00:05:45.820> pretty<00:05:46.180> soon<00:05:46.300> i'm<00:05:46.630> going<00:05:46.690> to<00:05:46.870> be<00:05:46.930> doing
