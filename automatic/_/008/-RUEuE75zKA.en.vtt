and we're going to color them bright
blue<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:43.860> here's<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.789> parameter<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
blue but here's the parameter for the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:54.590 
blue but here's the parameter for the
cone<00:00:48.890> here's<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> first<00:00:50.430> earset<00:00:51.739> and<00:00:53.600> here's

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
cone here's the first earset and here's

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.640 
cone here's the first earset and here's
the<00:00:54.780> second<00:00:55.199> gear<00:00:55.410> set

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.140 

four<00:01:02.340> colors<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.440> think<00:01:04.610> 269<00:01:05.610> might<00:01:05.970> be<00:01:06.120> a

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
four colors I think 269 might be a

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.090 
four colors I think 269 might be a
little<00:01:06.390> too<00:01:06.510> dark<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.080> use<00:01:07.710> something<00:01:08.070> like

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
little too dark so use something like

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.130 
little too dark so use something like
263<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> probably<00:01:09.480> looks<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.780> little<00:01:09.960> more

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
263 that probably looks a little more

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.690 
263 that probably looks a little more
