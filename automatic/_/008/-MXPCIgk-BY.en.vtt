00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
to go out of frame mode because it's

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.090

easier and I want to be cheap like that
so<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:42.180> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.360> go<00:00:42.480> over<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.230> don't

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
so I'm going to go over and you don't

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.690 
so I'm going to go over and you don't
have<00:00:43.469> cliff<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.860> trade<00:00:44.100> stuff<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.489> them<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
have cliff to trade stuff with them you

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
have cliff to trade stuff with them you
can<00:00:44.850> just<00:00:45.030> kill<00:00:45.239> them<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.510> steal<00:00:45.930> stuff<00:00:46.110> so

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
can just kill them and steal stuff so

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.779 
can just kill them and steal stuff so
it's<00:00:46.620> pretty<00:00:46.770> much<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.219> mob<00:00:47.399> that<00:00:47.579> drops

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.729 
it's pretty much like a mob that drops
emeralds<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.629> kind<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.260> like<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.410> think<00:00:49.649> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
emeralds but I kind of like to think of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.209 
emeralds but I kind of like to think of
it<00:00:49.829> as<00:00:49.950> minecraft<00:00:50.520> auto<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:52.219> trade

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
it as minecraft auto you can just trade

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.069 
it as minecraft auto you can just trade
stuff<00:00:53.430> with<00:00:53.610> them<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.120> kind<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.989> like

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
stuff with them and then kind of like

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.930 
stuff with them and then kind of like
the<00:00:55.170> hookers<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.559> Minecraft<00:00:55.980> better<00:00:56.219> grand

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
the hookers in Minecraft better grand

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.500 
the hookers in Minecraft better grand
theft<00:00:57.000> auto<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.960> can<00:00:58.730> kill<00:00:59.730> them<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.239> you

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
theft auto you can kill them when you

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.290 
theft auto you can kill them when you
you<00:01:01.350> know<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:02.370> them<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.850> then<00:01:03.059> when<00:01:03.210> you're

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
you know get them and then when you're

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.929 
you know get them and then when you're
done<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.750> take<00:01:03.960> your<00:01:04.049> money<00:01:04.199> back<00:01:04.409> and

that's<00:01:05.939> always<00:01:06.090> fun<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.720> that's<00:01:07.170> something<00:01:07.380> I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
that's always fun so that's something I

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.679 
that's always fun so that's something I
enjoyed<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.040> game<00:01:08.220> but<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.570> know

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
enjoyed in that game but you know

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.840 
enjoyed in that game but you know
everyone<00:01:10.200> knows<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.670> villagers<00:01:11.670> love

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
everyone knows that villagers love

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.920 
everyone knows that villagers love
emeralds<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.330> that's<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.570> only<00:01:12.689> thing<00:01:12.810> they

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
emeralds and that's the only thing they

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.160 
emeralds and that's the only thing they
trade<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.439> pretty<00:01:13.680> much<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.750> it's<00:01:15.750> just<00:01:16.020> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
trade for pretty much so it's just a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.960 
trade for pretty much so it's just a
cool<00:01:16.350> thing<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.979> how<00:01:17.159> they<00:01:17.340> drop<00:01:17.549> emeralds

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
cool thing I like how they drop emeralds

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.820 
cool thing I like how they drop emeralds
now<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.299> think<00:01:18.630> not<00:01:19.080> should<00:01:19.320> put<00:01:19.470> this<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.740> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
now I think not should put this in the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.590 
now I think not should put this in the
game<00:01:19.979> if<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.310> trade<00:01:20.729> emeralds<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.299> them<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
game if you trade emeralds with them and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.530 
game if you trade emeralds with them and
then<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:23.070> kill<00:01:23.670> them<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.000> should<00:01:24.270> drop<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
then you kill them I should drop the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.420 
then you kill them I should drop the
Emerald<00:01:24.780> again<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.229> don't<00:01:26.159> think<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.400> should

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
Emerald again I don't think we should

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.620 
Emerald again I don't think we should
just<00:01:26.549> drop<00:01:26.880> our<00:01:27.030> molds<00:01:27.299> normally<00:01:27.720> and

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
just drop our molds normally and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.440 
just drop our molds normally and
now<00:01:29.430> altec<00:01:30.430> I've<00:01:30.549> stated<00:01:30.759> the<00:01:30.969> statute<00:01:31.329> these

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
now altec I've stated the statute these

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.529 
now altec I've stated the statute these
these<00:01:31.810> guys<00:01:32.350> drop<00:01:32.680> anywhere<00:01:32.979> from<00:01:33.130> zero<00:01:33.399> to

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
these guys drop anywhere from zero to

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.889 
these guys drop anywhere from zero to
emerils<00:01:34.539> there's<00:01:34.810> no<00:01:34.960> real<00:01:35.229> stats<00:01:35.829> on<00:01:36.100> the

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
emerils there's no real stats on the

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:39.660 
emerils there's no real stats on the
probability<00:01:37.899> but<00:01:38.049> it's<00:01:38.829> pretty<00:01:39.310> sure<00:01:39.520> it's

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
probability but it's pretty sure it's

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.020 
probability but it's pretty sure it's
like<00:01:39.820> even<00:01:40.329> chance<00:01:40.539> of<00:01:40.750> getting<00:01:40.990> either<00:01:41.140> one<00:01:41.439> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
like even chance of getting either one I

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.520 
like even chance of getting either one I
sometimes<00:01:43.030> get<00:01:43.479> like<00:01:43.689> five<00:01:43.990> villagers<00:01:44.409> in<00:01:44.500> a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
sometimes get like five villagers in a

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.230 
sometimes get like five villagers in a
row<00:01:44.679> with<00:01:44.710> no<00:01:44.890> time<00:01:45.549> Lopes<00:01:45.729> like<00:01:45.880> that<00:01:46.060> guy

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
row with no time Lopes like that guy
