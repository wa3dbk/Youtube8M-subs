this<00:01:38.340> has<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.450> think<00:01:39.990> they're<00:01:40.110> calling<00:01:40.320> this

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
this has a I think they're calling this

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.030 
this has a I think they're calling this
a<00:01:40.740> faux<00:01:41.340> ray<00:01:41.579> skin<00:01:41.970> paracord<00:01:42.689> wrap<00:01:42.930> has<00:01:43.770> some

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
a faux ray skin paracord wrap has some

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.940 
a faux ray skin paracord wrap has some
really<00:01:44.369> nice<00:01:44.640> grip<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.329> um<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.530> think<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
really nice grip to it um you think you

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.440 
really nice grip to it um you think you
would<00:01:47.070> think<00:01:47.189> because<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.700> design<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.299> so

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
would think because the design is so

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.179 
would think because the design is so
straight<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.049> slim<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.740> wouldn't<00:01:49.950> grip

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
straight and slim that it wouldn't grip

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.270 
straight and slim that it wouldn't grip
but<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.570> handles<00:01:52.079> very<00:01:52.409> very<00:01:52.740> nice<00:01:55.159> see<00:01:56.159> the

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
but the handles very very nice see the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.289 
but the handles very very nice see the
blade<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.759> CRKT<00:01:57.509> logo<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.860> then<00:01:59.850> on<00:02:00.180> the

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
blade there CRKT logo and then on the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.389 
blade there CRKT logo and then on the
back<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.780> name<00:02:00.960> of<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.140> blade<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:01.950> kind

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
back the name of the blade you can kind
