hi<00:00:06.330> in<00:00:06.509> this<00:00:06.600> video<00:00:06.779> we<00:00:07.020> are<00:00:07.109> going<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.529> use<00:00:07.560> our

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
hi in this video we are going to use our

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.669 
hi in this video we are going to use our
previously<00:00:08.820> created<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.780> origin<00:00:10.139> agent<00:00:10.500> and

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
previously created the origin agent and

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.740 
previously created the origin agent and
create<00:00:11.130> and<00:00:12.019> refine<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.530> make<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.130> our

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
create and refine it and make it our

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.540 
create and refine it and make it our
origination<00:00:15.750> looks<00:00:16.109> better<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.460> may

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
origination looks better so you may

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.220 
origination looks better so you may
notice<00:00:17.820> that<00:00:17.850> when<00:00:18.210> we<00:00:18.330> created<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:19.020> there's

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
notice that when we created that there's

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.189 
notice that when we created that there's
a<00:00:19.410> lot<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.890> bone<00:00:20.250> shape<00:00:20.580> here<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.199> you've

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
a lot of the bone shape here and you've

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.939 
a lot of the bone shape here and you've
noticed<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:23.090> we<00:00:24.090> create<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.949> placement

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
noticed that we create in the placement

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.359 
noticed that we create in the placement
node<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.340> generate<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.689> agent<00:00:28.590> from<00:00:28.920> these

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
node and generate the agent from these

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.359 
node and generate the agent from these
original<00:00:30.210> agent<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.769> notice<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.070> this

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
original agent and we notice that this

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.729 
original agent and we notice that this
is<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> exactly<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.300> same<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.140> our<00:00:34.170> origin

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
is the exactly the same as to our origin

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.410 
is the exactly the same as to our origin
agent<00:00:35.010> but<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.219> may<00:00:35.460> notice<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:36.090> cannot

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
agent but you may notice that you cannot

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.020 
agent but you may notice that you cannot
select<00:00:36.809> them<00:00:37.129> because<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.309> bonnie<00:00:38.520> box<00:00:38.760> is

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
select them because the bonnie box is

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.569 
select them because the bonnie box is
not<00:00:39.239> being<00:00:39.480> optimized<00:00:39.989> it<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:41.100> we're<00:00:41.340> going<00:00:41.430> to

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
not being optimized it so we're going to

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.479 
not being optimized it so we're going to
let<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.270> scale<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.200> they<00:00:44.129> put<00:00:44.370> in

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
let they scale that up and they put in

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.990 
let they scale that up and they put in
there<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:45.770> roughly<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.160> bond<00:00:47.370> this<00:00:47.579> agent

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
there just roughly the bond this agent

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.189 
there just roughly the bond this agent
is<00:00:48.239> ok<00:00:48.780> no<00:00:49.050> matter<00:00:50.300> just<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.480> roughly<00:00:51.870> bond<00:00:52.050> this

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
is ok no matter just a roughly bond this

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.439 
is ok no matter just a roughly bond this
is<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.350> very<00:00:52.590> important<00:00:53.250> for<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> OpenGL

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
is a very important for the OpenGL

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.660 
is a very important for the OpenGL

the<00:00:57.300> render<00:00:57.750> features<00:00:58.489> so<00:00:59.489> please<00:00:59.789> give<00:01:00.239> them

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
the render features so please give them

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.869 
the render features so please give them
up<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.230> bond<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.710> agent<00:01:02.039> when

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
up and it just a bond it's agent when

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.870 
up and it just a bond it's agent when
you<00:01:03.000> place<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.420> agents<00:01:03.780> out<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.610> even<00:01:05.610> notice

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
you place the agents out and even notice

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240 
you place the agents out and even notice
that<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.330> bullship<00:01:06.930> on<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> agent<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
that the bullship on the agent is the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
that the bullship on the agent is the
same<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.140> origin<00:01:10.140> agent<00:01:12.110> mean<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.260> that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
same as the origin agent mean is that

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.609 
same as the origin agent mean is that
the<00:01:13.590> bone<00:01:13.740> shape<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.189> just<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.030> same

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
the bone shape it is just like the same

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.590 
the bone shape it is just like the same
exactly<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> same<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.369> there<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.330> not

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
exactly the same and there is this not

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.600 
exactly the same and there is this not
the<00:01:18.900> looks<00:01:19.830> like<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.310> geometry<00:01:21.920> so<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.400> have

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
the looks like the geometry so we have

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.060 
the looks like the geometry so we have
to<00:01:23.850> detect<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.659> ship<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.110> bone<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.890> mega

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
to detect the ship the bone and the mega

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.969 
to detect the ship the bone and the mega
dad<00:01:26.280> looks<00:01:26.610> like<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.240> similar<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.979> also

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
dad looks like this similar and also

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.600 
dad looks like this similar and also
that<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> very<00:01:30.689> good<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.740> dynamic

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that is a very good for the dynamic

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.960 
that is a very good for the dynamic
simulation<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:34.290> example<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> head<00:01:35.009> Medusa's

that<00:01:36.150> is<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> totally<00:01:37.350> different<00:01:37.740> shape<00:01:38.360> Saudi

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that is a totally different shape Saudi
