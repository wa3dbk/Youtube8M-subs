00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello dear viewers today 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.540
 I want to show you the tank, he is pretty 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.700
 strange I discovered it the other day this 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.889
 a bug with something like flying si4 only 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.960
 together the place where I did 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.450
 It is close to. and all this is mine 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.130
 grab for the appearance of btr if 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.500
 To put it more clearly, tobacco looks like 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.080
 as follows you hang your 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.660
 bmp on any ledge so that the wheels do not 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.310
 touched the ground your bmp stuck in this 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.349
 the moment you push the gas with acceleration 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.539
 and the covenant of his friend so he pushed with 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.059
 any technique in my case is jack and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.770
 helicopter please note that the continuation 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.660
 speeding up your bmp will depend on 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.860
 time which was respected on gas to 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.750
 tank turned out as possible to improve 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.969
 try to beat him in the middle right in 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.980
 side best i got re 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.140
 The station on the right is also at this time. 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.879
 at this frenzied speed va pretty 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.160
 you can confidently control the turns 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.930
 despite the wild drift perfect 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.329
 fly away will receive then when you fly away to 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.890
 river and bounce summer my record itself 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.379
