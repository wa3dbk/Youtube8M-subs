degrees and that will dissolve all of
the<00:01:46.240> sugar<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:46.600> will<00:01:46.990> turn<00:01:47.350> into<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.650> syrup

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the sugar and will turn into a syrup

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.859 
the sugar and will turn into a syrup
voluminous<00:01:50.020> fat<00:01:50.470> speak<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:52.240> if<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.659> are

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
voluminous fat speak to and if you are

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.040 
voluminous fat speak to and if you are
using<00:01:53.530> your<00:01:53.979> double<00:01:54.640> boiler<00:01:54.790> just<00:01:55.509> continue

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
using your double boiler just continue

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.950 
using your double boiler just continue
to<00:01:56.080> stir<00:01:57.119> that's<00:01:58.119> the<00:01:58.240> best<00:01:58.450> thing<00:01:58.630> so<00:01:58.810> that<00:01:58.930> it

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
to stir that's the best thing so that it

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.480 
to stir that's the best thing so that it
doesn't<00:01:59.320> burn<00:01:59.440> it<00:01:59.649> shouldn't<00:02:00.040> on<00:02:00.159> a<00:02:00.190> double

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
doesn't burn it shouldn't on a double

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.920 
doesn't burn it shouldn't on a double
