now<00:00:00.210> I'd<00:00:00.359> like<00:00:00.510> to<00:00:00.659> show<00:00:00.840> you<00:00:00.870> a<00:00:01.020> little<00:00:01.199> bit

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:01.410 
now I'd like to show you a little bit

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.679 
now I'd like to show you a little bit
about<00:00:01.650> water<00:00:02.010> testing<00:00:02.700> what<00:00:03.030> I'm<00:00:03.120> gonna<00:00:03.240> do<00:00:03.510> is

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
about water testing what I'm gonna do is

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.050 
about water testing what I'm gonna do is
take<00:00:03.899> five<00:00:04.200> mils<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.859> water<00:00:04.920> ordinary<00:00:05.790> tap

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
take five mils of water ordinary tap

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.570 
take five mils of water ordinary tap
water<00:00:06.089> put<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.049> container<00:00:07.529> we<00:00:08.340> put<00:00:08.550> a

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
water put it in this container we put a

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.430 
water put it in this container we put a
hardness<00:00:09.120> agent<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.660> there<00:00:09.870> this<00:00:10.050> is<00:00:10.230> how<00:00:10.380> the

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
hardness agent in there this is how the

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.470 
hardness agent in there this is how the
US<00:00:10.860> Department<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.429> Interior<00:00:11.820> measures

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
US Department of Interior measures

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.200 
US Department of Interior measures
hardness<00:00:13.139> in<00:00:13.349> what's<00:00:13.620> called<00:00:13.860> grains<00:00:14.730> per

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
hardness in what's called grains per

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.660 
hardness in what's called grains per
gallon<00:00:15.500> now<00:00:16.500> when<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:16.830> turns<00:00:17.039> out<00:00:17.279> reddish

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
gallon now when it turns out reddish

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.609 
gallon now when it turns out reddish
pink<00:00:18.029> color<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:19.109> means<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.590> have

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
pink color like that that means you have

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.769 
pink color like that that means you have
hard<00:00:20.130> water<00:00:20.250> but<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.939> doesn't<00:00:21.330> tell<00:00:21.480> me<00:00:21.510> how

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
hard water but that doesn't tell me how

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.740 
hard water but that doesn't tell me how
hard<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:22.320> they<00:00:23.160> use<00:00:23.340> titrant<00:00:23.910> solution<00:00:24.510> for

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
hard it is they use titrant solution for

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.660 
hard it is they use titrant solution for
that<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.109> every<00:00:25.320> drop<00:00:25.590> represents<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.400> grain

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
that and every drop represents a grain

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.460 
that and every drop represents a grain
and<00:00:27.000> we<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.269> keep<00:00:27.449> adding<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.930> drops<00:00:28.199> until

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
and we just keep adding the drops until

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.880 
and we just keep adding the drops until
it<00:00:28.769> actually<00:00:28.800> turns<00:00:29.429> blue<00:00:29.939> that's<00:00:30.330> four<00:00:30.929> five

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
it actually turns blue that's four five

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.470 
it actually turns blue that's four five
six<00:00:33.440> seven<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:35.250> that's<00:00:35.399> hard<00:00:35.730> water<00:00:36.090> there

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
six seven so that's hard water there

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.270 
six seven so that's hard water there
because<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.020> still<00:00:37.260> pink<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:38.040> still

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
because it's still pink and it still

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.840 
because it's still pink and it still
hasn't<00:00:38.489> turned<00:00:38.790> blue<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.420> we'll<00:00:39.660> keep<00:00:39.809> going

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
hasn't turned blue so we'll keep going

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:54.920 
hasn't turned blue so we'll keep going
that's<00:00:41.850> 9<00:00:44.539> 11<00:00:45.539> 12<00:00:46.910> 13<00:00:48.110> 14<00:00:51.079> 15<00:00:53.270> and<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.629> kind<00:00:54.840> of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that's 9 11 12 13 14 15 and it's kind of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.319 
that's 9 11 12 13 14 15 and it's kind of
a<00:00:55.050> purple<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.829> looks<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.340> about<00:00:56.460> 15

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
a purple so it looks like it's about 15

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.900 
a purple so it looks like it's about 15
definitely<00:00:58.260> blue<00:00:58.500> now<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:58.980> you're<00:00:59.129> about<00:00:59.340> 15

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
definitely blue now so you're about 15

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.020 
definitely blue now so you're about 15
or<00:01:00.090> 16<00:01:00.329> grains<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.320> hardness<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:02.219> at<00:01:02.760> this

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
or 16 grains of hardness here at this

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.390 
or 16 grains of hardness here at this
area<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.750> home<00:01:04.019> which<00:01:04.680> means<00:01:04.920> that<00:01:05.159> water

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
area in this home which means that water

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.660 
area in this home which means that water
is<00:01:05.549> extremely<00:01:06.030> hard<00:01:06.540> water<00:01:07.100> now<00:01:08.100> I'm<00:01:08.280> gonna<00:01:08.430> do

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
is extremely hard water now I'm gonna do

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.600 
is extremely hard water now I'm gonna do
a<00:01:08.700> pH<00:01:09.330> test<00:01:09.360> or<00:01:09.960> potential<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.650> hydrogen<00:01:10.860> this

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
a pH test or potential of hydrogen this

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.310 
a pH test or potential of hydrogen this
is<00:01:11.670> done<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.299> what's<00:01:12.540> called<00:01:12.750> phenom<00:01:13.170> all

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
is done with what's called phenom all

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.649 
is done with what's called phenom all
red<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.760> add<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> few<00:01:15.180> drops<00:01:15.540> 5<00:01:16.049> drops<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
red you just add a few drops 5 drops and

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.770 
red you just add a few drops 5 drops and
shake<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.189> it<00:01:20.189> will<00:01:20.340> give<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.479> color

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
shake it and it will give you the color

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.660 
shake it and it will give you the color
in<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.140> case<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.830> see<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.189> closest

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
in this case you can see it closest

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.609 
in this case you can see it closest
lines<00:01:23.939> up<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.600> second<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.170> from<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
lines up with the second one from the

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.920 
lines up with the second one from the
top<00:01:25.830> which<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.130> 7<00:01:26.640> point<00:01:26.939> 8<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.570> means<00:01:27.750> this

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
top which is 7 point 8 that means this

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.490 
top which is 7 point 8 that means this
water<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.470> alkaline<00:01:29.070> water<00:01:29.310> at<00:01:29.670> 7<00:01:30.150> point<00:01:30.479> 8<00:01:30.659> and

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
water is alkaline water at 7 point 8 and

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.289 
water is alkaline water at 7 point 8 and
then<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.310> other<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.820> I'm<00:01:32.939> going<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.119> do

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
then the other one that I'm going to do

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.230 
then the other one that I'm going to do
for<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.409> chlorine<00:01:35.000> this<00:01:36.000> will

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
for you this is on chlorine this will

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
for you this is on chlorine this will
tell<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.600> how<00:01:36.810> much<00:01:36.990> chlorine<00:01:37.409> is<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.829> the

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
tell you how much chlorine is in the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.410 
tell you how much chlorine is in the
water<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.400> add<00:01:38.579> OTO<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:43.700> then<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.149> kind

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
water we add OTO and then you can kind

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.719 
water we add OTO and then you can kind
of<00:01:45.509> see<00:01:45.780> that<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.829> you<00:01:46.950> look<00:01:47.189> at<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.460> back<00:01:47.700> of

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
of see that if you look at the back of

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.550 
of see that if you look at the back of
this<00:01:48.090> from<00:01:48.420> something<00:01:48.810> that's<00:01:48.930> white<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.409> can

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
this from something that's white you can

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.130 
this from something that's white you can
see<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.920> it's<00:01:50.070> actually<00:01:50.250> turned<00:01:50.850> yellow<00:01:51.450> in

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
see that it's actually turned yellow in

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.590 
see that it's actually turned yellow in
this<00:01:52.439> case<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.189> chlorine<00:01:53.640> content<00:01:54.000> is

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
this case the chlorine content is

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.870 
this case the chlorine content is
actually<00:01:55.530> about<00:01:56.869> 1.0<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.040> 1.5<00:01:59.040> right<00:01:59.549> in<00:01:59.729> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
actually about 1.0 to 1.5 right in that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.030 
actually about 1.0 to 1.5 right in that
range<00:02:00.149> which<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.659> actually<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.619> about

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
range which is actually just about

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.280 
range which is actually just about
perfect<00:02:02.549> swimming<00:02:02.909> pool<00:02:03.180> water<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:03.930> pool

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
perfect swimming pool water because pool

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.009 
perfect swimming pool water because pool
water<00:02:04.590> is<00:02:04.890> 1.0<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.850> 1.5<00:02:06.689> in<00:02:06.990> chlorine<00:02:07.290> content
