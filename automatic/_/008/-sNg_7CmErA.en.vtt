the third-largest category is those

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.379 
the third-largest category is those
variants<00:00:12.070> that<00:00:12.160> are<00:00:12.340> meaningful<00:00:13.240> they

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
variants that are meaningful they

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.150 
variants that are meaningful they
actually<00:00:13.750> do<00:00:14.050> change<00:00:14.080> the<00:00:14.740> meaning<00:00:14.980> of<00:00:15.010> the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160

actually do change the meaning of the
text<00:00:15.790> but<00:00:16.689> they're<00:00:16.810> not<00:00:16.930> viable<00:00:17.200> that<00:00:17.920> is

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
text but they're not viable that is

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.720 
text but they're not viable that is
they're<00:00:18.520> found<00:00:18.820> in<00:00:18.939> one<00:00:19.270> late<00:00:19.599> manuscript<00:00:20.439> and

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
they're found in one late manuscript and

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.800 
they're found in one late manuscript and
that<00:00:21.730> manuscript<00:00:23.190> it<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:25.300> doesn't<00:00:25.539> have<00:00:25.630> any

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
that manuscript it it doesn't have any

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:27.150 
that manuscript it it doesn't have any
possibility<00:00:26.350> of<00:00:26.380> really<00:00:26.590> going<00:00:26.770> back<00:00:26.890> to<00:00:27.070> the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
possibility of really going back to the

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.099 
possibility of really going back to the
original<00:00:27.220> some<00:00:28.210> of<00:00:28.300> these<00:00:28.390> can<00:00:28.750> be<00:00:28.779> actually

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
original some of these can be actually

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.540 
original some of these can be actually
quite<00:00:29.230> funny<00:00:29.590> I<00:00:29.680> mean<00:00:29.740> they're<00:00:29.980> meaningful<00:00:30.400> in

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
quite funny I mean they're meaningful in

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.130 
quite funny I mean they're meaningful in
one<00:00:30.820> sense<00:00:31.090> but<00:00:31.269> in<00:00:31.390> another<00:00:31.480> they're<00:00:31.960> not

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
one sense but in another they're not

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.290 
one sense but in another they're not
like<00:00:32.860> in<00:00:33.160> first<00:00:33.970> Thessalonians<00:00:35.670> 2:7<00:00:36.670> there's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
like in first Thessalonians 2:7 there's

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.470 
like in first Thessalonians 2:7 there's
a<00:00:37.390> major<00:00:37.809> textual<00:00:38.380> problem<00:00:38.500> where<00:00:38.770> Paul<00:00:39.040> says

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
a major textual problem where Paul says

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.130 
a major textual problem where Paul says
that<00:00:40.480> he<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.290> Silas<00:00:41.559> became<00:00:42.489> either<00:00:43.270> gentle

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
that he and Silas became either gentle

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.979 
that he and Silas became either gentle
among<00:00:44.649> the<00:00:44.829> Thessalonians<00:00:45.460> or<00:00:46.239> they<00:00:46.660> became

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
among the Thessalonians or they became

think<00:01:13.930> it<00:01:14.140> was<00:01:14.200> on<00:01:14.350> purpose<00:01:14.530> but<00:01:14.890> it<00:01:15.010> ends<00:01:15.189> up

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
think it was on purpose but it ends up

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.060 
think it was on purpose but it ends up
being<00:01:15.430> a<00:01:15.580> meaningful<00:01:16.510> variant<00:01:17.170> that<00:01:17.200> is<00:01:17.530> so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
being a meaningful variant that is so

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.740 
being a meaningful variant that is so
meaningful<00:01:18.340> it<00:01:18.520> becomes<00:01:18.850> stupid<00:01:19.030> I<00:01:19.240> mean<00:01:19.390> it's

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
meaningful it becomes stupid I mean it's

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.090 
meaningful it becomes stupid I mean it's
it's<00:01:19.960> silly<00:01:20.140> but<00:01:20.229> that's<00:01:20.500> still<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:20.830> kind<00:01:21.040> of

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
it's silly but that's still that kind of

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.490 
so I guess Jesus is a phantom after all
you<00:01:54.009> know<00:01:54.159> but<00:01:54.939> you<00:01:55.210> know<00:01:55.329> those<00:01:55.509> it's<00:01:56.229> kind<00:01:56.439> of

you know but you know those it's kind of

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.960 
you know but you know those it's kind of
a<00:01:56.560> meaningful<00:01:56.860> very<00:01:57.130> but<00:01:57.310> also<00:01:57.490> kind<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.909> a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
a meaningful very but also kind of a

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.219

of<00:03:26.610> hearing<00:03:27.030> from<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.420> very<00:03:27.840> very<00:03:27.930> early<00:03:28.170> scribe

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
of hearing from a very very early scribe

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.030

who<00:03:28.830> misheard<00:03:29.220> what<00:03:29.310> Paul<00:03:29.610> said<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.770> in<00:03:31.770> fact

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
who misheard what Paul said and in fact

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.620 
who misheard what Paul said and in fact
I<00:03:32.130> think<00:03:32.190> it's<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.580> scribe<00:03:33.000> who<00:03:33.180> made<00:03:33.480> that

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
I think it's that scribe who made that

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.180 
I think it's that scribe who made that
mistake<00:03:33.720> originally<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:34.709> Paul<00:03:35.010> would<00:03:35.160> have

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
mistake originally but Paul would have

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.430 
mistake originally but Paul would have
corrected<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.670> but<00:03:35.820> nevertheless<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.989> point

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
corrected it but nevertheless the point

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.080 
corrected it but nevertheless the point
is<00:03:37.590> that<00:03:37.860> there's<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.250> thing<00:03:38.580> that<00:03:38.610> that's<00:03:38.880> a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
is that there's a thing that that's a

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.420 
is that there's a thing that that's a

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
meaningful and viable variant and yet

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.960 
meaningful and viable variant and yet
what<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.300> effect<00:03:42.630> does<00:03:43.590> Paul<00:03:43.920> ever<00:03:44.250> say<00:03:44.610> we

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
what is it effect does Paul ever say we

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.240

have peace with God as a statement of
our<00:03:47.510> position<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.720> heaven<00:03:49.050> right<00:03:49.200> now<00:03:49.380> yes<00:03:49.800> he

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
says that kind of thing in many places

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.260 
says that kind of thing in many places
does<00:03:52.650> he<00:03:52.830> say<00:03:53.100> in<00:03:53.280> other<00:03:53.400> places<00:03:53.700> Christians

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
does he say in other places Christians

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:56.000 
does he say in other places Christians
be<00:03:54.420> reconciled<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.020> God<00:03:55.230> like<00:03:55.440> he<00:03:55.560> does<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.920> the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
be reconciled to God like he does to the

be reconciled to God like he does to the
Corinthians<00:03:56.430> yes<00:03:56.940> he<00:03:57.180> does<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.570> so<00:03:58.260> in<00:03:58.500> both

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
Corinthians yes he does and so in both

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.580 
Corinthians yes he does and so in both
senses<00:03:59.570> Paul<00:04:00.570> could<00:04:00.840> make<00:04:01.020> that<00:04:01.170> kind<00:04:01.230> of<00:04:01.530> a

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
senses Paul could make that kind of a

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.770 
senses Paul could make that kind of a
statement<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.760> question<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.510> we're<00:04:03.630> asking

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
statement the question that we're asking

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.080 
statement the question that we're asking
is<00:04:04.140> not<00:04:04.350> which<00:04:04.920> one<00:04:05.160> fits<00:04:05.400> into<00:04:05.700> Paul<00:04:05.910> line

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
is not which one fits into Paul line

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.300 
is not which one fits into Paul line
theology<00:04:06.630> but<00:04:07.200> which<00:04:07.440> one<00:04:07.650> fits<00:04:07.890> into<00:04:08.130> that

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
theology but which one fits into that

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.940 
theology but which one fits into that
passage<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.239> so<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.080> value<00:04:10.620> of<00:04:10.770> knowing

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
passage and so the value of knowing

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.949 
passage and so the value of knowing
about<00:04:11.250> these<00:04:11.400> textual<00:04:11.790> variants<00:04:12.180> is<00:04:12.330> how<00:04:12.690> they

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
about these textual variants is how they

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.960 
about these textual variants is how they
affect<00:04:13.290> our<00:04:13.440> exegesis<00:04:14.040> in<00:04:14.459> our<00:04:14.580> exposition

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
affect our exegesis in our exposition

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.190 
affect our exegesis in our exposition
not<00:04:15.959> how<00:04:16.230> they<00:04:16.410> affect<00:04:16.709> our<00:04:16.830> theology<00:04:17.600> so<00:04:18.600> to

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
not how they affect our theology so to

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.400 
not how they affect our theology so to
me<00:04:19.380> it's<00:04:19.739> significant<00:04:20.489> that<00:04:20.660> less<00:04:21.660> than<00:04:21.690> 1%<00:04:22.049> of

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
me it's significant that less than 1% of

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.960 
me it's significant that less than 1% of
all<00:04:22.620> these<00:04:22.890> textual<00:04:23.250> variants<00:04:23.640> are<00:04:23.730> really

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
all these textual variants are really

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.190 
all these textual variants are really
meaningful<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.390> viable<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:24.840> that's<00:04:24.960> what<00:04:25.140> the

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
meaningful a viable and that's what the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.110 
meaningful a viable and that's what the
whole<00:04:25.380> debate<00:04:25.650> is<00:04:25.800> over<00:04:25.890> and<00:04:26.160> again<00:04:27.000> in

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
whole debate is over and again in

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.640 
whole debate is over and again in
misquoting<00:04:27.570> Jesus<00:04:27.660> sermon<00:04:28.289> gives<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
misquoting Jesus sermon gives the

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.710 
misquoting Jesus sermon gives the
impression<00:04:28.830> over<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:29.580> over<00:04:29.760> again<00:04:29.880> that

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
impression over and over again that

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.180 
impression over and over again that
we've<00:04:30.840> got<00:04:31.050> these<00:04:31.410> hundreds<00:04:31.979> of

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
we've got these hundreds of

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.100 
we've got these hundreds of
thousands<00:04:32.520> of<00:04:32.580> variants<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.120> at<00:04:33.720> one<00:04:33.900> place

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
thousands of variants and at one place

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.930 
thousands of variants and at one place
he<00:04:34.290> says<00:04:34.470> we<00:04:34.770> could<00:04:34.920> go<00:04:35.100> on<00:04:35.130> practically

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
he says we could go on practically

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.430 
he says we could go on practically
forever<00:04:36.180> talking<00:04:36.600> about<00:04:36.960> these<00:04:37.140> variants

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
forever talking about these variants

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.840 
forever talking about these variants
well<00:04:37.860> sure<00:04:38.100> if<00:04:38.310> you're<00:04:38.430> going<00:04:38.520> to<00:04:38.610> talk<00:04:38.700> about

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
well sure if you're going to talk about

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.190 
well sure if you're going to talk about
all<00:04:39.090> four<00:04:39.270> hundred<00:04:39.540> thousand<00:04:39.930> and<00:04:40.080> you're

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
all four hundred thousand and you're

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.200 
all four hundred thousand and you're
gonna<00:04:40.290> put<00:04:40.620> everybody<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.250> sleep<00:04:41.280> but<00:04:42.120> if

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
gonna put everybody to sleep but if

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.400 
gonna put everybody to sleep but if
you're<00:04:42.330> talking<00:04:42.450> about<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.870> meaningful<00:04:43.170> one

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
you're talking about the meaningful one

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.380 
you're talking about the meaningful one
that's<00:04:43.590> a<00:04:43.680> limited<00:04:44.040> discussion<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:45.270> it

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
that's a limited discussion and so it

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.840 
that's a limited discussion and so it
gives<00:04:45.630> an<00:04:45.750> impression<00:04:45.810> that<00:04:46.500> the<00:04:47.340> the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
gives an impression that the the

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.430 
gives an impression that the the
meaningful<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.420> viable<00:04:48.750> variants<00:04:49.080> are<00:04:49.170> every

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
meaningful and viable variants are every

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:50.930 
meaningful and viable variants are every
bit<00:04:49.470> as<00:04:49.620> common<00:04:50.070> as<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.430> ones<00:04:50.670> that<00:04:50.850> are

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
bit as common as the ones that are

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.470 
bit as common as the ones that are
neither<00:04:51.120> meaningful<00:04:51.630> nor<00:04:51.780> nor<00:04:52.080> viable
