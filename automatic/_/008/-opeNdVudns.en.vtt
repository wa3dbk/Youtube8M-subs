 the patties are very, very tasty for this 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.470

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.549
 small dice all mixed here such 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.699
 we stuffed turned out very fragrant 

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:53.600
 Now we will do the test do brew 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.600
 for this yeast and sugar 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:01:01.400
 knead until the yeast becomes liquid 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.400
 Now add vanilla sugar 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:24.450
 add warm water and 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.880
 send in a warm place for 15 minutes 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.859
 until the thick hat comes up 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.649
 couple here add half the flour and 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.789
 starting to knead 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.749
 we stir and when already a little 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:44.369
 grabbed see you became thicker 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:46.740
 pour sunflower oil here and again 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.670

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.670
 little flour 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.479
 knead the dough and make sure 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.200
 so she was softly elastic 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.450
 but not sticky to the hands poured the dough on 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.960
 the table here is much lighter than him 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.670
 stir this dough turned out and 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.119
 Immediately we will not sculpt from it 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.810
 leave it for no time 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.489
 now we have to take the balls out of it 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.560
 as little as possible to get us 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.540
 little buns and divide all those became 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.360
 such balls leave a piece for 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.550

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.870
 good good especially if the berries juice 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.350
 it was necessary to close 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.120
 counted and now this ball 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:10.680
 spread on a baking sheet in the form of 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.870
