00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.160
 one of the machetes that I had from 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.290
 long ago you want to have and to 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.629
 try is the pac now the pac now is 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.180
 a machete canel in other words is the 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.670
 tool that is used for cutting 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.550
 manual of sugarcane the cane by 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.890
 course it is a highly fibrous plant 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.560
 so it requires a design of a 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.910
 tool that allows two things the 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.340
 first of course is to have 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.960
 enough mass to generate 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.910
 the force needed to cut 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.760
 easily and at the same time be 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.559
 light enough to be able to use it 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.710
 throughout the work day 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.940
 generally the vaccines have 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.129
 complemented in the back with 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.460
 a hook that is also used to 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.260
 cane handle when it shortens the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.159
 pac now that we see here is a bal 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.800
 of tramontina made in Brazil has a 

00:00:56.159 --> 00:01:01.979
 13-inch long blade with a sharp edge 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.530
 10 handy the handle is 11 and a half 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:06.590
 inches and one of the features 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.350
 more particular of it 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.200
 the thickness of the blade that is a bit 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:15.020
 less than one-sixteenth of an inch is 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.030
 something like 1.3 millimeters thick 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.819
 between the particular characteristics 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.770
 because at this point there may be 

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:24.799
 made an analogy with him many manpad 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.929
 there is the one that is sharp to the point 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.840
 as you can see in the video which 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.240
 allows a very good maneuverability the 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.819
 Mango material is not discussed by 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.649
 the manufacturer however the finished 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:38.840
 it's pretty good 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.909
 I found also how they saw it in 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.599
 some parts of the video that is very 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:47.899
 easy to go from having a very grip 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:50.149
 close to the blade to a very grip 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.810
 close to the heel increasing 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.149
 significantly the reach of the pac 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.569
 now and at the same time giving the 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.939
 possibility of detailed management 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:03.469
 at first I was not very 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:06.140
 excited by the thickness of the sheet and 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.070
 the flexibility because I thought I could 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.399
 Y 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.740
 to the situations of use however 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.650
 when I started the test I realized 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.220
 that versatility like machete of the 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.140
 pac is now quite broad perhaps the 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.360
 the only modification I would make to 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.550
 design would extend a little more the 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.010
 edge and could build a small 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.380
 handguards to give security to the 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.780
 hand preventing it from sliding towards the 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.480
 side the hook as expected 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.580
 works perfectly and between 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.610
 advantages of having an invoice or a 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.459
 machete anyone with a handle of 11 and 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.150
 half inches is the one that is increased 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.540
 significantly the reach of the hand 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.670
 and allows to handle of course 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.670
 vegetation when it has thorns avoiding 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.340
 what 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.610
 at risk of course at hand when 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.870
 he is not on the walk 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:06.010
 the construction with four rivets of 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.400
 the blade on the handle is very very reliable 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.610
 in the cut both in the magazine of a 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.760
 centimeter like in the wood of the pallet 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.370
 He behaved perfectly and 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.670
 definitely the maneuverability of the 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:26.700
 invoice is unequaled in the world of 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:30.129
 machetes that I have tried until the newspaper 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.489
 unfortunately the steel in which it is 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:36.489
 I found that it does not have a 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.030
 adequate heat treatment as they can 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.739
 see in the video the edge was only 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.370
 with the cutting test they finished 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.860
 see supremely abused and showed 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.670
 all the features that one 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.569
 pretend to avoid in 10 with a good time 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:59.349
 especially in the machetes and is the one 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.650
 break or roll in this 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:05.440
 case I found that not only did they show up 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.069
 both as is evident in the images 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.489
 that it has but also in some 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:14.680
 points was divided and rolled up for me 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:18.880
 the performance of steel is quite poor 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.700
 but I'd like to try doing a re 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.940
 profiling of the edge with such a stone 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.220
 once with a sharper bit more serious and 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.500
 I think that maybe they get better 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.930
 results because although the final 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:35.500
 factory is moderately good 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:39.100
 performance result he 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.920
 I found it very unsatisfactory and 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.610
 so far it has been the worst of all 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.610
 what have i tried
