00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
find ourselves the aircraft has several

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.050 
find ourselves the aircraft has several
good<00:02:10.440> options<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:11.070> it's<00:02:11.280> got<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> long<00:02:11.730> wing

good options on it's got the long wing

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.730 
good options on it's got the long wing
is<00:02:12.240> one<00:02:12.390> thing<00:02:12.600> when<00:02:12.780> I<00:02:12.810> when<00:02:13.200> I<00:02:13.230> started<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
is one thing when I when I started to

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.350 
is one thing when I when I started to
look<00:02:13.950> for<00:02:14.010> aircraft<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:14.880> one<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> long

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
look for aircraft so one of the long

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.000 
look for aircraft so one of the long
wing<00:02:15.630> because<00:02:15.810> it<00:02:15.930> gave<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.320> higher

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
wing because it gave you the higher

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.300 
wing because it gave you the higher
gross<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:18.060> 12,500<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:19.740> really<00:02:20.160> was<00:02:20.280> a

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
gross of 12,500 that really was a

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.100 
gross of 12,500 that really was a
benefit<00:02:20.790> to<00:02:21.000> us<00:02:21.030> because<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.720> makes<00:02:21.959> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
benefit to us because it makes the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.840 
benefit to us because it makes the
airplane<00:02:22.440> handle<00:02:22.830> a<00:02:22.920> lot<00:02:23.130> better<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.760> know

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
airplane handle a lot better you know

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.000 
airplane handle a lot better you know
it'll<00:02:24.030> slow<00:02:24.300> down<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:25.050> your<00:02:25.290> approaches<00:02:25.800> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
it'll slow down on your approaches and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.590 
it'll slow down on your approaches and
it<00:02:26.070> helps<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.340> climb<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.850> gives<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.240> lot

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
it helps you climb it gives you a lot

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.080 
it helps you climb it gives you a lot
more<00:02:27.660> fuel<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.800> benefit<00:02:29.280> of<00:02:29.310> a<00:02:29.580> single<00:02:29.910> pilot

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
more fuel the benefit of a single pilot

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.760 
more fuel the benefit of a single pilot
they<00:02:30.420> went<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.780> sea<00:02:30.959> air<00:02:31.110> got<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.470> single

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
they went to sea air got the single

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.040 
they went to sea air got the single
pilot<00:02:31.950> added<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.850> as<00:02:32.970> an<00:02:33.420> aircraft<00:02:33.600> owner

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
pilot added to it as an aircraft owner

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.199 
pilot added to it as an aircraft owner
that<00:02:34.410> is<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.280> big<00:02:35.550> things<00:02:35.910> that<00:02:36.000> I've

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
that is one of the big things that I've

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.030 
that is one of the big things that I've
considered<00:02:36.600> is<00:02:37.020> how<00:02:37.230> many<00:02:37.410> pilots<00:02:37.650> are<00:02:37.980> going

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
considered is how many pilots are going

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.770 
considered is how many pilots are going
to<00:02:38.220> take<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.520> operate<00:02:38.850> my<00:02:39.000> aircraft<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.750> have

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
to take to operate my aircraft you have

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.330 
to take to operate my aircraft you have
to<00:02:39.959> pay<00:02:40.110> for<00:02:40.260> those<00:02:40.350> guys<00:02:40.590> instead<00:02:40.920> of<00:02:40.980> hotel

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
to pay for those guys instead of hotel

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.640 
to pay for those guys instead of hotel
rooms<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.880> cars<00:02:42.330> and<00:02:42.720> two<00:02:42.930> pilots<00:02:43.140> it<00:02:43.470> takes

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
rooms and cars and two pilots it takes

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.790 
rooms and cars and two pilots it takes
twice<00:02:43.860> as<00:02:43.920> much<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.790> single<00:02:45.090> pilot<00:02:45.269> also<00:02:45.800> one

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
twice as much the single pilot also one

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.710 
twice as much the single pilot also one
thing<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.100> does<00:02:47.280> is<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.790> frees<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:48.239> one<00:02:48.390> extra

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
thing it does is it frees that one extra

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.780 
thing it does is it frees that one extra
seat<00:02:48.930> for<00:02:49.140> an<00:02:49.230> additional<00:02:49.560> passenger<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.580> it

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
flown this aircraft personally myself

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.430 
flown this aircraft personally myself
and<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.830> flies<00:02:59.100> just<00:02:59.160> like<00:02:59.670> a<00:02:59.700> 172<00:03:00.540> with<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> lot

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
and it flies just like a 172 with a lot

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.949 
and it flies just like a 172 with a lot
more<00:03:01.620> power<00:03:01.860> and<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.790> sounds<00:03:03.150> twice<00:03:03.450> as<00:03:03.780> cold

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
more power and it sounds twice as cold

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.720 
more power and it sounds twice as cold
when<00:03:04.170> you<00:03:04.260> start<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.620> up<00:03:04.739> one<00:03:05.280> of<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.459> things

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
when you start it up one of the things

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.039 
when you start it up one of the things
we<00:03:05.910> considered<00:03:06.510> when<00:03:06.630> we<00:03:06.720> bought<00:03:06.900> this

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
we considered when we bought this

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.440 
we considered when we bought this
aircraft<00:03:07.560> was<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.160> acquisition<00:03:08.790> cost<00:03:08.940> of

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
aircraft was the acquisition cost of

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.180 
aircraft was the acquisition cost of
some<00:03:09.840> of<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:09.989> other<00:03:10.019> aircraft<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.010> were

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
some of the other aircraft that were

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.150 
some of the other aircraft that were
coming<00:03:11.400> out<00:03:11.580> to<00:03:11.940> do<00:03:12.269> my<00:03:12.450> mission<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:13.049> needed<00:03:13.830> cj2

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
coming out to do my mission I needed cj2

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.030 
coming out to do my mission I needed cj2
and<00:03:14.580> that's<00:03:14.730> what<00:03:14.850> I<00:03:14.880> looked<00:03:15.120> at<00:03:15.920> you<00:03:16.920> know<00:03:16.980> I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
like to see j2 because it had also that

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.940 
like to see j2 because it had also that
single<00:03:19.530> pilot

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
single pilot

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.690 
single pilot
you<00:03:20.760> know<00:03:20.850> operation<00:03:21.590> but<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:23.459> know<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.670> the

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
you know operation but you know the the

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.789 
you know operation but you know the the
main<00:03:24.180> thing<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:24.630> is<00:03:24.840> it<00:03:25.019> was<00:03:25.140> costing<00:03:25.500> me<00:03:25.620> over

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
main thing is is it was costing me over

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.979 
main thing is is it was costing me over
two<00:03:25.950> million<00:03:26.160> dollars<00:03:26.459> on<00:03:26.640> my<00:03:26.760> aircraft<00:03:26.959> yeah

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
two million dollars on my aircraft yeah

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.930 
two million dollars on my aircraft yeah
plus<00:03:28.410> insurance<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:29.100> plus<00:03:29.250> expenses<00:03:29.790> for

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
plus insurance and plus expenses for

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.820 
plus insurance and plus expenses for
that<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.330> looked<00:03:30.870> at<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.110> aircraft<00:03:31.590> which<00:03:31.799> is

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
that I looked at this aircraft which is

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.259 
that I looked at this aircraft which is
equivalent<00:03:32.459> to<00:03:32.549> the<00:03:32.730> cj2

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
equivalent to the cj2

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.590 
equivalent to the cj2
and<00:03:33.709> you<00:03:34.709> know<00:03:34.830> this<00:03:35.130> thing<00:03:35.370> does<00:03:35.640> everything

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
and you know this thing does everything

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.770 
and you know this thing does everything
just<00:03:36.900> as<00:03:37.110> well<00:03:37.350> at<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.070> much<00:03:38.580> lower<00:03:38.790> cost<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.540> so

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
just as well at a much lower cost and so

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.800 
just as well at a much lower cost and so
I<00:03:39.810> could<00:03:40.260> not<00:03:40.290> make<00:03:40.790> make<00:03:41.790> myself<00:03:42.030> justify<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
I could not make make myself justify the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.350 
I could not make make myself justify the
additional<00:03:43.500> capital<00:03:43.739> that<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.580> took<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.970> take

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
additional capital that it took to take

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.360 
additional capital that it took to take
that<00:03:45.600> aircraft<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.290> put<00:03:46.440> it<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.620> my<00:03:46.650> inventory

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
that aircraft and put it in my inventory

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.509 
that aircraft and put it in my inventory
and<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.690> ensure<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.410> could<00:03:49.709> do<00:03:49.859> this<00:03:50.010> for<00:03:50.250> much

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
and in ensure I could do this for much

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.280 
and in ensure I could do this for much
less<00:03:50.730> cost<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.389> that's<00:03:51.480> what<00:03:51.720> we<00:03:51.840> elected<00:03:52.230> to

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
less cost and that's what we elected to

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.970 
less cost and that's what we elected to
do

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
do

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.979 
do
I<00:03:53.010> looked<00:03:53.430> at<00:03:53.610> it<00:03:53.760> and<00:03:53.970> said<00:03:54.150> ok<00:03:54.480> this<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:54.810> low

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
I looked at it and said ok this is a low

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.600 
I looked at it and said ok this is a low
time<00:03:55.200> airframe<00:03:55.680> so<00:03:55.860> I<00:03:55.890> don't<00:03:56.099> have<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.370> do<00:03:56.489> the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
time airframe so I don't have to do the

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.520 
time airframe so I don't have to do the
10,000<00:03:57.150> hour<00:03:57.269> inspection<00:03:57.720> for<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:57.959> long<00:03:58.260> long

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
10,000 hour inspection for a long long

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:59.839 
10,000 hour inspection for a long long
time<00:03:58.739> I<00:03:58.800> still<00:03:59.040> got<00:03:59.129> to<00:03:59.190> change<00:03:59.400> the<00:03:59.550> Indians

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
time I still got to change the Indians

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.030 
time I still got to change the Indians
before<00:04:00.000> do<00:04:00.300> that<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:01.319> aircraft<00:04:01.800> is<00:04:01.890> a

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040
