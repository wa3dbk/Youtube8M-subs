00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 jean says 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.600
 but I believe it, he said 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.210
 live the city 10 years ago we have a restless person who does not speak much sleep 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.159
 some tapas 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:12.059
 and like his mother 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.239
 the mayor 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.439
 and decide what is its particularity 

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:16.980
 it's a football player 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.169
 but made a great man 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.479
 so little to play football but also to do a lot of things on the way 

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:24.819
 of which 30 programs that's why it's so far very 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:28.140
 interesting for universities the researchers 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.140
 who 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.440
 and being able to do a good state of things not bad and on the internet this 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.670
 quartet to see his blog site 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.160
 he wants to trust that's why he wrote m he loses all alone 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.690
 there are some had maybe been buried in the 50s 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.889
 jpn ducati the year 2050 

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:52.949
 we go well before their employees from 2032 and 35% 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.780
 there it took a team of robots to beat the football team certainly 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.430
 according to me 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.519
 but to paris in the air as he had one on the only chess 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.070
 until then and who has been someone to win it must not be limited to a 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.939
 robot football player it's really not that 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.139
 his recovery of the physical capacities of movements were terra of agility 

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:12.439
 can fall and get up in all directions but especially it is programmed to 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.539
 have a lot of functions of interaction clegg not understand 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.709
 when you speak talk station he is able to know where it comes from he is 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:22.170
 is able to detect faces so you can tell him there we come 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.179
 here notice to many people he hears noises have caused glass breakage 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.380
 and stones we are drinking shots on the turn of e and suddenly 

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:32.030
 it will automatically plug on ea song whip download interval 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.810
 he tells the valve in the first phase to afp he has a capacity 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.310
 interaction of understanding of one's environment and especially the incapacity 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.920
 programs and very easily everywhere in the world even by roux it's 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.499
 sure lake that gives us the opportunity to do all that rage face 

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.969
 to the capacity of the football world cup and adheres at least once 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:48.320
 year 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.840
 once a year crowd motions k350 research labs 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.270
 who competes against each other is full of categories and all 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.729
 who have handsome rolls on a table of big little robot 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.410
 he plays on a tennis court and then to seeds that is blacklisted 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.320
 houllier competitors do not have the right to touch the hardware 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.030
 they all have a robot or the official robot that is ours 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.169
 So go everyone compete 4 2 euros against 4 euros 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.429
 so what differentiates teams side the robots are identical 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:14.349
 past the hour 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.520
 the beautiful the programming of image processing of 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.939
 for cooperation between the robots there 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.669
 way of walking we can make it work so jerky have done 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.480
 dam was walking way very fluid and very fast made fast 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.320
 but in this case it may be less stable 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.170
 so here he says the strategy you choose the tactics you 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.880
 choose alain bué% and score goals we do not go faster 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.880
 that on the ball 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.249
 next to the real differences 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.869
 it's almost programmers are press coaches yes it's not 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:42.309
 so that's a thing 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:45.529
 so the relationship with the animals and the tooth 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:49.120
 regarding setting 6th in this optics there he is goalkeeper 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.510
 so if we put a bullet in the street and mancini will detect at bali he has 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.599
 kept some country haggard on which side the ball and then their kids 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.599
 on the back of the side puts his hands in this direction 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.769
 it was limited to another time there 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.819
 coppola value but it's just a demonstration we did here to 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.939
 illustrate this 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.749
 what to do with doing a lot of other things but then we tried to 

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:13.629
 do something quite ardennes 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:17.259
 the map 100 km from the market and may stay for three months 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.079
 the accused of this winter absolutely the people that after will get bored bike for 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.719
 go to sleep it will not be funny for people a little paradoxical when we can 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.859
 imagine marketed to the general public 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:30.129
 in how long how many years is it already marketed today 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:31.659
 for having searched for them 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.389
 a first batch will be the same for the general public in April 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.709
 not having very very long April 2009 and commercial entered 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.379
 in the seat fall back to 2010 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:41.849
 surprise at this report 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.550
 for having approached him at $ 100 for 10,000 euros hailed for a bit of 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.270
 % of options modules was rails for the general public that will depend 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.260
 gays of the volumes 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:51.319
 not able to do 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.330
 we'll divide around three crows 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.219
 during this year's greatness, it will depend on savannah volumes by the afp 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.899
 the facade will be able to lower the production price 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:02.229
 a child we will be a continuation ouattara face this tension details 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:06.169
 techniques on sensors the brains of this rare that we show you a 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:08.109
 a bit 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:09.419
 until then nothing 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:10.699
 why he was so proud 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.499
 that's what you show inside many of course 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:17.070
 e beland that will come in europe 5 degrees various t25 engine 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.300
 so we also see the forces against the current the alabama is able or 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.959
 not to close your hands to move your hands 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.350
 and then to all the articulations of the peace of the brave 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.050
 there are ultrasonic sensors there are two cameras not in the head he has some 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.800
 infrared systems that makes it capable remote-controlled TV 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.430
 pouliquen have recorded in the month such chain alone he is able 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.860
 to do it we were forced to memorize the 200 pages of the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.330
 how to use your system of millions 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:42.659
 Tuesday on the feet 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:44.370
 the unloved on prices 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.930
 the student had to fix the decentralization is reduced to 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.050
 position sensors in each joint 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.289
 to know exactly which movement is doing these tests 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.740
 there is a lot of electronics 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.809
 Germany is at a standstill 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:05:00.169
 he can by the 23 members and the ability to paris 23 languages ​​he is 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.830
 comes standard with one language 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.460
 but then we can add as much to myself 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.460
 we spoke, he admits, decorating himself 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.529
 thank you very much thank you 

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:12.749
