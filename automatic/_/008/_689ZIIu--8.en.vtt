00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.590
 classics there in my opinion of the forums 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.300
 more gta forums that exist in 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.269
 internet portal 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.370
 Miss mysterious darling psychopath

 famous talk about the possible 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.569
 her human identity by saying that 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.459
 Greeks and Caroline Assistant of what I saw 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.200
 johnson does not even appear in the game 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.970
 another famous theory of games is a 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.650
 woman tied up enslaved 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.299
 image the body of this woman 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.250
 The next video on theories I said 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.440
 I further deepen the theories about gay 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.780
 two half life 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.090
 if there's one thing barbie knows how to do 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.340
 get the imagination of the galley to behave 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:58.190
 a game full of half-life theories then 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.500
 90% of it revolves around the character 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.079
 no one knows for sure who 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.970
 It's me and if no one knows that it 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.890
 It is obvious that theories of the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.420
 know about it being a being. 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.299

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.670
 the more theory franchise arise about the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.290
 link day 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.690
 there is a consensus on the internet that is 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.810
 best- known incredible theory of zelda 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.790
 is the five stages of game mourning 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.470
 more hours since this video is a 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.109
 list of games in the next video 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.660
 of game theories I speak deep 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:38.209
 This is a fucking theory for you. 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.489

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.109
 plumber fine people are many since 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.940
 That theory that I already told you 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:46.340
 about the game will only be a performance until 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.930
 plumber's universe theories with others 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.030
 nintendo games but it is not exactly 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.950
 a franchise of mysterious games but 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.690
 some things like renewable ones fall 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.849
 trick I already talked here on the South 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.799
 video about mysteries made imagination 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.590
 Go to the Heights 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.880

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.349
 it's so damn good 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.790
 the theory of war that I showed here 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.739
 in the channel is one of the most 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.480
 but there are many other 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.430
 as theories trying to explain the origin 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.169
 some pokémons saying that 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.150
 kaufman is an item are fruits of 

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.889
 experiments of the rocket team or about the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.570
 who choke that good and have some kind 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.900
 some kinship 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.910
 do not warn me good if pokémon game 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.650
 susceptible to theories with so much pokémon is 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.830
 logical that he will be on this list 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.720
 shadow of the colossus the shape of landes 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.580

 kill them and save your loved one is a place 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.070
 very mysterious not much is known about 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.720
 the history of the place since the game does not 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.910
 we know only that it is a 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.740
 prohibited place as the name says and which 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.970
 Vander should not be there. 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.100
 of course a place as mysterious as 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.840
 demanded theories on the internet many 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.600
 trying to prove one of the legends 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.240
 most famous of the game besides the black bird 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:57.200
