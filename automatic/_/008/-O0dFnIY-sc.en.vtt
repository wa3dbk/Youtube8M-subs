I cleaned it right before I did this

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.310 
I cleaned it right before I did this
video<00:01:46.740> anyway<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.790> looks<00:01:48.180> clean<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.479> me<00:01:48.630> but

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
video anyway so looks clean to me but

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.639 
video anyway so looks clean to me but
you<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.829> get<00:01:50.430> these<00:01:50.610> smudges<00:01:51.390> all<00:01:52.049> over<00:01:52.110> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
you just get these smudges all over the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.770 
you just get these smudges all over the
place<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.100> really<00:01:53.369> annoying<00:01:53.729> versus<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.600> one

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
place is really annoying versus this one

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.749 
place is really annoying versus this one
so<00:01:54.990> far<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:55.530> gotten<00:01:55.979> smudges<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.490> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
so far I have not gotten smudges on it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.630 
so far I have not gotten smudges on it
and<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.689> know<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.380> great<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.340> is

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and you know it's great that that is

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.230 
and you know it's great that that is
almost<00:02:00.390> much<00:02:00.899> proof<00:02:01.229> so<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.560> speak<00:02:01.829> okay<00:02:02.670> so

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
almost much proof so to speak okay so

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.179 
almost much proof so to speak okay so
moving<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.840> next<00:02:04.140> big<00:02:04.409> feature<00:02:04.680> here

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
moving on to the next big feature here

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.850 
moving on to the next big feature here
and<00:02:05.340> or<00:02:05.939> i<00:02:06.180> should<00:02:06.240> say<00:02:06.450> difference<00:02:07.079> between

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
and or i should say difference between

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.020 
and or i should say difference between
the<00:02:08.250> 900<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.830> 920<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.340> placement<00:02:11.910> of

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
the 900 and the 920 is the placement of

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.670 
the 900 and the 920 is the placement of
the<00:02:12.239> front<00:02:12.569> facing<00:02:13.110> camera

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
the front facing camera

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.429 
the front facing camera
so<00:02:14.189> you<00:02:14.280> can<00:02:14.400> see<00:02:14.579> here<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:14.939> is<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.390> both<00:02:15.959> now<00:02:16.409> I

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
so you can see here it is on both now I

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.380 
so you can see here it is on both now I
say<00:02:16.799> this<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.519> a<00:02:17.549> big<00:02:17.790> improvement<00:02:18.090> because

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
say this is a big improvement because

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.809 
say this is a big improvement because

front-facing<00:02:29.879> picture<00:02:30.480> or<00:02:30.659> photo<00:02:30.689> you're

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
front-facing picture or photo you're

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.449 
front-facing picture or photo you're
more<00:02:31.409> than<00:02:31.500> likely<00:02:31.560> going<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:31.980> be<00:02:32.040> holding<00:02:32.280> it

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
more than likely going to be holding it

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.979 
more than likely going to be holding it
like<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.849> as<00:02:33.060> well<00:02:33.180> with<00:02:33.389> the<00:02:33.480> buttons<00:02:33.780> on

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
like this as well with the buttons on

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.679 
like this as well with the buttons on
upwards<00:02:34.859> and<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.909> problem<00:02:36.209> with<00:02:36.329> that<00:02:36.359> though

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689 
upwards and the problem with that though

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.349 
upwards and the problem with that though
is<00:02:36.870> that<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.530> camera<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.519> located<00:02:38.909> right<00:02:39.180> here

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
is that the camera is located right here

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.929 
is that the camera is located right here
where<00:02:39.870> your<00:02:40.049> left<00:02:40.290> thumb<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.950> basically<00:02:41.819> going

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
where your left thumb is basically going

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.270 
where your left thumb is basically going
to<00:02:42.030> be<00:02:42.090> covering<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.629> up<00:02:42.689> or<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.379> way<00:02:43.620> so

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
to be covering it up or in the way so

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.500 
to be covering it up or in the way so
you're<00:02:44.430> going<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.790> have<00:02:44.879> to<00:02:45.120> hold<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.359> with

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
you're going to have to hold it with

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.500 
you're going to have to hold it with
your<00:02:45.569> right<00:02:46.109> thumb<00:02:46.379> in<00:02:47.159> order<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:48.030> get<00:02:48.239> the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
your right thumb in order to get the

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.050 
your right thumb in order to get the
video<00:02:48.810> or<00:02:49.139> photo<00:02:49.590> but<00:02:50.250> it's<00:02:50.370> like<00:02:50.519> this<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:50.879> so

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
video or photo but it's like this is so

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.780 
video or photo but it's like this is so
unstable<00:02:51.780> because<00:02:52.349> again<00:02:52.799> of<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.549> issue

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
unstable because again of this issue

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.940 
unstable because again of this issue
there's<00:02:54.090> no<00:02:54.269> black<00:02:54.569> space<00:02:54.900> here<00:02:55.169> right<00:02:55.409> so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
there's no black space here right so

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.830 
there's no black space here right so
your<00:02:56.129> thumb<00:02:56.370> is<00:02:56.639> just<00:02:57.030> you<00:02:57.209> know<00:02:57.329> not<00:02:57.510> getting

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
your thumb is just you know not getting

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.259 
your thumb is just you know not getting
that<00:02:57.989> extra<00:02:58.230> grip<00:02:58.590> that<00:02:58.799> needs<00:02:59.069> so<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.519> attend

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
that extra grip that needs so I attend

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.599 
that extra grip that needs so I attend
to<00:03:00.450> hold<00:03:00.659> my<00:03:00.840> camera<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:01.379> this<00:03:01.409> but<00:03:01.859> even<00:03:02.459> at

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
to hold my camera like this but even at

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:04.520 
to hold my camera like this but even at
that<00:03:02.639> it's<00:03:03.030> kind<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.299> just<00:03:03.480> annoying<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.379> have

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
that it's kind of just annoying to have

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.089 
that it's kind of just annoying to have
to<00:03:04.590> force<00:03:05.310> your<00:03:05.579> way<00:03:05.760> into<00:03:06.260> controlling<00:03:07.260> the

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
to force your way into controlling the

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.300 
to force your way into controlling the
camera<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.750> this<00:03:10.319> one<00:03:10.650> gives<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.159> that

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
camera so this one gives you that

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.220 
camera so this one gives you that
freedom<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:12.030> however<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.659> want<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.959> do<00:03:13.079> it

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
freedom of however you want to do it

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.720 
freedom of however you want to do it
just<00:03:13.500> go<00:03:13.620> ahead<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.859> do<00:03:14.099> it<00:03:14.219> and<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.519> really

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
just go ahead and do it and it really

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.550 
just go ahead and do it and it really
fixes<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.329> problem<00:03:15.689> because<00:03:15.930> they<00:03:16.049> move<00:03:16.260> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
fixes the problem because they move the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.759 
fixes the problem because they move the
camera<00:03:17.310> upwards<00:03:17.909> so<00:03:18.720> you'll<00:03:19.290> be<00:03:19.530> able<00:03:19.650> to

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
camera upwards so you'll be able to

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.500 
camera upwards so you'll be able to
place<00:03:20.010> your<00:03:20.190> thumb<00:03:20.489> where<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.120> want<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.419> place

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
place your thumb where you want to place

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.240 
place your thumb where you want to place
it<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.019> be<00:03:22.260> able<00:03:22.409> to<00:03:22.530> get<00:03:22.680> that<00:03:22.799> stability

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
it and be able to get that stability

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.159 
it and be able to get that stability
that<00:03:23.609> you<00:03:23.760> wanted<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.389> first<00:03:24.419> place<00:03:24.720> and

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
that you wanted in the first place and

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.199 
that you wanted in the first place and
again<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:25.709> could<00:03:25.889> hold<00:03:26.099> it<00:03:26.190> like<00:03:26.340> this<00:03:26.370> or<00:03:27.090> you

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
again you could hold it like this or you

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.580 
again you could hold it like this or you
could<00:03:27.359> hold<00:03:27.569> it<00:03:27.659> like<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.079> you<00:03:28.379> still

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
could hold it like this and you still

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.409 
could hold it like this and you still
have<00:03:28.739> more<00:03:28.979> stability<00:03:29.280> because<00:03:29.879> your<00:03:30.180> thumb

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
have more stability because your thumb

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.750 
have more stability because your thumb
has<00:03:30.599> that<00:03:30.840> extra<00:03:31.139> space<00:03:31.379> so<00:03:31.709> anyway<00:03:32.370> it's

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
has that extra space so anyway it's

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.580 
has that extra space so anyway it's
really<00:03:33.060> a<00:03:33.090> smart<00:03:33.629> move<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.109> they<00:03:34.229> moved<00:03:34.439> it

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
really a smart move that they moved it

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.909 
really a smart move that they moved it
on<00:03:34.680> up<00:03:34.889> here<00:03:35.189> and<00:03:35.720> as<00:03:36.720> we<00:03:36.930> kind<00:03:37.109> of<00:03:37.229> continue<00:03:37.799> on

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
on up here and as we kind of continue on

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.030 
on up here and as we kind of continue on
over<00:03:38.310> just<00:03:38.790> some<00:03:38.939> minor<00:03:39.090> differences<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:40.349> USB

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
over just some minor differences the USB

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.759 
over just some minor differences the USB
cord<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:42.060> located<00:03:42.840> right<00:03:43.019> here<00:03:43.079> or<00:03:43.500> at<00:03:43.620> least

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
cord is located right here or at least

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.069 
cord is located right here or at least
support<00:03:44.189> and<00:03:44.370> then<00:03:44.790> on<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.120> bottom<00:03:45.299> side<00:03:45.750> of

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
support and then on the bottom side of

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.099 
support and then on the bottom side of
the<00:03:46.199> 920<00:03:47.069> you'll<00:03:47.250> find<00:03:47.519> the<00:03:47.669> USB<00:03:48.000> cord<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:49.079> the

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
the 920 you'll find the USB cord and the

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.599 
the 920 you'll find the USB cord and the
speaker's<00:03:49.799> themselves<00:03:49.949> are<00:03:50.340> slightly

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
speaker's themselves are slightly

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.699 
speaker's themselves are slightly
different<00:03:50.849> there<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.720> side<00:03:51.959> you'll<00:03:52.620> see

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
different there on the side you'll see

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.890 
different there on the side you'll see
that<00:03:53.069> this<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.549> the<00:03:53.849> volume<00:03:54.269> buttons<00:03:54.659> right

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
that this is the volume buttons right

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.749 
that this is the volume buttons right
here<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.409> there's<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.769> small<00:03:56.370> indentation

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:56.759 
here and there's a small indentation

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:58.759 
here and there's a small indentation
right<00:03:57.209> here<00:03:57.419> between<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.139> volume<00:03:58.439> buttons

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
right here between the volume buttons

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.390 
right here between the volume buttons
this<00:03:58.919> one's<00:03:59.159> just<00:03:59.250> some<00:03:59.549> long<00:04:00.470> line<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.829> that

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
this one's just some long line and that

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.449 
this one's just some long line and that
is<00:04:02.669> basically<00:04:02.939> it<00:04:03.629> as<00:04:04.199> far<00:04:04.799> as<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.280> difference

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
is basically it as far as the difference

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.399 
is basically it as far as the difference
is<00:04:05.790> they're<00:04:06.000> moving<00:04:06.689> on<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.989> back<00:04:07.139> side

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
is they're moving on the back side

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:09.499 
is they're moving on the back side
you'll<00:04:07.859> see<00:04:07.889> the<00:04:08.189> texture<00:04:08.639> is<00:04:08.759> different<00:04:08.879> so

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:09.509 
you'll see the texture is different so

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:11.539 
you'll see the texture is different so
this<00:04:09.659> one<00:04:09.870> is<00:04:09.989> rough<00:04:10.290> versus<00:04:11.040> this<00:04:11.159> one<00:04:11.400> is

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
this one is rough versus this one is

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.390 
this one is rough versus this one is
smooth<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:13.169> again<00:04:13.680> that's<00:04:13.829> personal

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
smooth so again that's personal

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.729 
smooth so again that's personal
preference<00:04:14.879> as<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.599> whether<00:04:16.199> or<00:04:16.349> not<00:04:16.440> you<00:04:16.560> like

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
preference as to whether or not you like

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.939 
preference as to whether or not you like
it<00:04:16.919> rough<00:04:17.190> or<00:04:17.459> smooth<00:04:17.880> and<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:19.049> is<00:04:19.229> it<00:04:19.440> as<00:04:19.620> far

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
it rough or smooth and that is it as far

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:23.830 
it rough or smooth and that is it as far
as<00:04:20.220> you<00:04:20.940> know<00:04:21.060> my<00:04:21.539> basic<00:04:22.760> difference

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
as you know my basic difference

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.770 
as you know my basic difference

909<00:04:27.780> 20<00:04:28.380> and<00:04:28.650> the<00:04:29.400> software<00:04:29.790> obviously<00:04:30.390> is

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
909 20 and the software obviously is

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.170 
909 20 and the software obviously is
something<00:04:31.020> to<00:04:31.140> talk<00:04:31.320> about<00:04:31.380> on<00:04:31.770> its<00:04:32.100> own<00:04:32.280> so

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
something to talk about on its own so
