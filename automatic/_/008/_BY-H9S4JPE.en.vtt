do if the dwarf

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.480 
do if the dwarf
if<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.830> cars<00:02:42.400> are<00:02:42.640> not<00:02:43.470> alert<00:02:44.470> yet<00:02:44.770> so<00:02:45.280> right

if the cars are not alert yet so right

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.790 
if the cars are not alert yet so right
there<00:02:45.670> there<00:02:45.880> are<00:02:46.140> guards<00:02:47.200> if<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:47.470> try<00:02:47.770> to

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
there there are guards if you try to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.250 
there there are guards if you try to
paper<00:02:48.370> get<00:02:48.580> a<00:02:48.790> trader<00:02:49.239> you<00:02:49.510> will<00:02:49.630> get<00:02:49.780> attacked

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
paper get a trader you will get attacked

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.110 
paper get a trader you will get attacked
so<00:02:50.890> what<00:02:51.040> you<00:02:51.130> need<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.459> is<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.730> alert<00:02:51.910> them

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
so what you need to do is to alert them

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.979 
so what you need to do is to alert them
it's<00:02:52.540> very<00:02:52.840> easy<00:02:53.110> simply<00:02:53.680> attack<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:55.690> four

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
it's very easy simply attack the four

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.350 
it's very easy simply attack the four
guards<00:02:56.410> to<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.860> north<00:02:57.220> and<00:02:57.520> then<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.030> want<00:02:58.270> to

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
guards to the north and then you want to

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.680 
guards to the north and then you want to
go<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:59.260> open<00:02:59.709> the<00:02:59.860> door<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.459> north<00:03:00.670> west<00:03:01.209> so

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
go to open the door to the north west so

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.570 
go to open the door to the north west so
it's<00:03:01.810> very<00:03:01.930> important<00:03:02.440> to<00:03:02.530> use<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:02.890> northwest

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
it's very important to use the northwest

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.000 
it's very important to use the northwest
section<00:03:04.150> if<00:03:04.570> you<00:03:04.930> go<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.320> northeast<00:03:05.770> it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
section if you go to the northeast it

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.300 
section if you go to the northeast it
won't<00:03:06.280> work<00:03:06.520> so<00:03:06.850> luring<00:03:07.810> is<00:03:08.020> pretty<00:03:08.890> easy<00:03:09.160> you

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
won't work so luring is pretty easy you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.920 
won't work so luring is pretty easy you
just<00:03:09.640> stand<00:03:09.970> at<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.180> spot<00:03:10.540> where<00:03:10.810> I'm

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
just stand at the spot where I'm

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.949 
just stand at the spot where I'm
standing<00:03:11.230> you<00:03:12.070> move<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.730> step<00:03:13.030> close<00:03:13.570> the<00:03:13.750> door

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
standing you move to step close the door

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.510 
standing you move to step close the door
and<00:03:14.200> that's<00:03:14.950> it

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
and that's it

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.729 
and that's it
the<00:03:15.700> four<00:03:16.000> guards<00:03:16.330> or<00:03:16.450> alert<00:03:16.780> then<00:03:17.320> you<00:03:17.470> simply

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
the four guards or alert then you simply

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.130 
the four guards or alert then you simply
want<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> repeat<00:03:18.430> exactly<00:03:18.700> the<00:03:19.299> same<00:03:19.450> thing

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
want to repeat exactly the same thing

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.539 
want to repeat exactly the same thing
but<00:03:20.650> with<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.190> guards<00:03:21.549> to<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.790> south<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:23.549> the

or so don't go to the southwest it will

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.430 
or so don't go to the southwest it will
not<00:03:29.290> work<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:31.000> simply<00:03:31.299> alert<00:03:31.510> them<00:03:31.780> exactly

theory you should always be able to make

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.069 
theory you should always be able to make
at<00:04:08.200> least<00:04:08.230> um<00:04:08.799> two<00:04:09.489> sets<00:04:09.940> but<00:04:10.450> if<00:04:10.630> you're<00:04:10.780> fast

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
at least um two sets but if you're fast

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.340 
at least um two sets but if you're fast
enough<00:04:11.200> three<00:04:11.739> set<00:04:11.950> is<00:04:12.360> pretty<00:04:13.360> easy<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:13.959> do<00:04:14.140> um

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
enough three set is pretty easy to do um

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.240 
enough three set is pretty easy to do um
and<00:04:15.329> there's<00:04:16.329> not<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.959> much<00:04:17.260> to<00:04:17.590> say<00:04:17.769> make

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
and there's not that much to say make

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.430 
and there's not that much to say make
sure<00:04:18.459> that<00:04:18.640> you<00:04:18.930> check<00:04:19.930> your<00:04:19.959> glove<00:04:20.290> of

silence<00:04:20.890> equipped<00:04:21.390> because<00:04:22.390> they<00:04:22.810> can<00:04:22.990> get

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
silence equipped because they can get

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.800 
silence equipped because they can get
broken<00:04:23.500> so<00:04:23.890> if<00:04:24.010> they<00:04:24.190> do<00:04:24.940> then<00:04:25.120> simply<00:04:25.510> equip

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
broken so if they do then simply equip

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.270 
broken so if they do then simply equip
another<00:04:26.200> pair<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:26.800> if

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280

little<00:05:03.370> bit<00:05:03.550> lower<00:05:03.820> but<00:05:04.330> at<00:05:04.450> the<00:05:04.540> same<00:05:04.810> time

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
little bit lower but at the same time

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.080 
little bit lower but at the same time
your<00:05:05.380> fletching<00:05:05.860> experience<00:05:06.400> will<00:05:06.550> go<00:05:06.850> up

your fletching experience will go up

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
because we'll be caught more often so I

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.600 
because we'll be caught more often so I
guess<00:05:10.870> that's<00:05:11.110> pretty<00:05:11.590> much<00:05:11.710> it<00:05:12.010> about<00:05:12.160> this

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
guess that's pretty much it about this
