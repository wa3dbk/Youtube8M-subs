00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.380
 hi today's small friends 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.030
 express advice videos it's not good the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.440
 everything on a subject that is pretty 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.389
 recurring me I see in the halls 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.830
 sport we generally have a corner to dokÃ© 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.539
 monopolized all the time by the same 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.980
 people who make hundreds or even 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.330
 thousands of teens every day and 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.070
 even me as an educator I had 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.570
 members who came to see me 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.830
 regularly to tell me david 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.180
 it's been months 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.470
 hundreds of abs or even thousands 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.670
 every day there is no way 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.650
 to have the chocolate bar 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.550
 so we will start on the right foot and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 put a phrase in every beast 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.530
 head is if you want abs starts 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.510
 to stop focusing on 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.960
 abs because that's not it 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.000
 problem 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.500
 so we can first distinguish 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.600
 two categories of people the first 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.950
 category c those who think that if we 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.180
 do not see his abs it's because 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.590
 that she did not work it enough that 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.300
 teens are not his curves and do not 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.949
 are not bulky enough and we at the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.629
 second category which is said if we do not 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.010
 not see but abdou it's because I have 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.449
 a layer of fat on the abs 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.390
 between the skin and the abs and that's for 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.949
 that we do not see but even if their 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.180
 finding is different they're going to have the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.049
 same working method ie 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.280
 those who think it's not enough 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.590
 shapely they will go on like 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.090
 crazy and those who think or who make a 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.380
 finding anyway because there they 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.909
 think more they are often in the 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.049
 true that there is a layer of fat getting 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.030
 say I'm going to do a lot of abs 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.450
 to burn the fat that is on 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.130
 The belly 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.780
 so you have to understand for the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.250
 first category that bait on 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.140
 the abs to have volume it serves to 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.850
 nothing the abs just work 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.509
 two three times a week it's like 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.670
 the other muscles 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.380
 I mean here we do not fight 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.700
 it's useless at all you want 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.119
 working regularly is enough 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.470
 widely 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.939
 so if you're used to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.200
 work your abs and who are 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.369
 still not visible and yet wanted 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.990
 work two three four times 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.970
 week for three to four months 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.710
 it may be because you are in 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.619
 category 2 and there is a layer of 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.700
 fat on the belly in the same way 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.560
 often people make shortcuts and 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.090
 say good luck if I have fat on the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.770
 belly I'm going to do a lot of abs 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.990
 like that it's going to burn the gravel on the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.340
 sell gold we can not target the loss 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.750
 of fat the human body it works 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.890
 not like that the human body that 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.570
 works a lot like a balloon 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.159
 balloon or when you deflate it 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.750
 Ben it deflates so 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.189
 proportional over its entire surface 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.479
 you can not say a bob goes from 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.490
 conflicts by the first by there and then 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.170
 by that and even less choose the place 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.119
 by which he will deflate the body 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.769
 human it's the same you go 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.959
 slim down if you want to lose fat from 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.489
 proportional way we will say 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.319
 balanced on the whole body 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.940
 so it's not worth doing 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.739
 thousands of abs to lose that the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.360
 belly it will not work so you have to 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.819
 know more than when we do 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.319
 a lot of abs like that we tend 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.000
 to create an imbalance between the abs 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:28.500
 the lumbar what do I mean 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.599
 that's because the role of the abs 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.400
 it's not about flexing like that 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.780
 all day it never happens them 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.069
 only times when you use the abs 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.750
 in this situation it's when you 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.950
 get up from bed in the morning or as you 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.540
 lift the couch when you're at 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.129
 iron on it but that's the whole role 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.290
 abs is to work in 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:45.870
 synergy with lumbar to keep the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.099
 spine comes right and the 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.299
 problem of people who make hundreds 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.129
 thousands of souls every day in 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.569
 general is that they make the abs 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.879
 all day 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.079
 to summarize but it should not be 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.670
 lumbar sees people I do not see them 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:57.930
 to make 500 lambert there like to lie down 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.079
 on the belly doing some 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.640
 back extensions never so what 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.379
 often happens to them to have a 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.269
 unbalanced to be slightly hunched 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.670
 because the abs are much more 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.349
 powerful than lumbar so avoid 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.790
 you imbalances do not strive 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.049
 not on the abs wanted to work 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.470
 other times a week enough 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:14.700
 widely 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.169
 and if you want it to be 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.910
 really salient that we see them 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:18.660
 really good you do not have the six pack 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.579
 the dream thing 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.150
 well you have to go on a diet 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.480
 so just manage your consumption 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.660
 caloric 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.950
 manage your calorie expenditure try to 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.590
 to make sure that you increase the 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.819
 spending and you're lowering the number of 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.709
 calories that you consume and 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.209
 quickly you will have visible abs 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.470
 but do not worry, you're going 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.669
 create imbalances you're going to 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.530
 create problems and you go 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.609
 surely lose morale because when 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.870
 it's been months that we strive to do 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:44.250
 the same thing and we do not get 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.560
 results but we tend to go down 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.510
 arms so I hope this video 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.250
 you help and see you soon 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.840
 for new advice or 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.220
 streaks or anything on health of 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.220
 iron times make hi friends 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.200
 and
