better understanding of what they offer

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.830 
better understanding of what they offer
you<00:00:22.470> have<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> tough<00:00:22.920> watch<00:00:23.180> tough<00:00:24.180> solar<00:00:24.480> and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
you have the tough watch tough solar and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.150 
you have the tough watch tough solar and
the<00:00:25.410> solar<00:00:25.650> atomic<00:00:27.050> tough<00:00:28.050> watches<00:00:28.529> those<00:00:28.980> are

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the solar atomic tough watches those are

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.550 
the solar atomic tough watches those are
battery-powered<00:00:29.490> only<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:30.929> when<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> battery

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
battery-powered only so when the battery

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.440 
battery-powered only so when the battery
dies<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.399> watch<00:00:32.610> dies<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.149> needs<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.390> be

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
dies the watch dies it needs to be

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.260 
dies the watch dies it needs to be
replaced<00:00:33.950> those<00:00:34.950> batteries<00:00:35.370> last<00:00:35.670> usually

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
replaced those batteries last usually

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.780 
replaced those batteries last usually
around<00:00:36.480> one<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.870> two<00:00:37.020> years<00:00:37.550> tough<00:00:38.550> solar

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
around one to two years tough solar

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.270 
around one to two years tough solar
watches<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.829> addition<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.100> regular

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
watches in addition to the regular

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.119 
watches in addition to the regular
itself<00:00:41.760> watch<00:00:41.969> they<00:00:42.719> also<00:00:42.899> solar<00:00:43.290> powered<00:00:43.710> so

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
itself watch they also solar powered so

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.900 
itself watch they also solar powered so
as<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.700> can<00:00:44.820> see<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.329> watch<00:00:45.600> let<00:00:46.079> me<00:00:46.200> um<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
as you can see in this watch let me um a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.869 
as you can see in this watch let me um a
little<00:00:47.910> bit<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.230> bottom<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:50.070> section

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
little bit in that bottom right section

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.380 
little bit in that bottom right section
you<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.180> an<00:00:51.329> L<00:00:51.860> M&amp;W<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.760> indicating<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
you have an L M&amp;W just indicating the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.869 
you have an L M&amp;W just indicating the
battery<00:00:54.690> level<00:00:55.050> after<00:00:55.980> being<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.610> sun<00:00:56.850> for

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
battery level after being in the sun for

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.970 
battery level after being in the sun for
about<00:00:57.360> five<00:00:57.719> minutes<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.289> swatch<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.739> fully

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
about five minutes to swatch is fully

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.729 
about five minutes to swatch is fully
charged<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.699> off<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.750> full<00:01:00.989> charge<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.680> last

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
charged and off of a full charge it last

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.429 
charged and off of a full charge it last
up<00:01:02.309> until<00:01:02.760> eight<00:01:03.390> months<00:01:05.390> one<00:01:06.390> step<00:01:06.630> above<00:01:06.780> you

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
up until eight months one step above you

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
up until eight months one step above you
have<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.830> solar<00:01:08.040> atomic<00:01:08.220> watch<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.409> in

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
have the solar atomic watch and in

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.980 
have the solar atomic watch and in
addition<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.520> being<00:01:11.670> solar<00:01:12.090> it's<00:01:12.570> also<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
addition to being solar it's also a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.890 
addition to being solar it's also a
multiband<00:01:13.619> five<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.310> what<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.210> means<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
multiband five and what that means is it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.249 
multiband five and what that means is it
receives<00:01:16.259> automatic<00:01:16.860> time<00:01:17.130> signals<00:01:18.259> so

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
receives automatic time signals so

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.710 
receives automatic time signals so
basically<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.310> never<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.880> manually<00:01:21.180> set

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
basically you never have to manually set

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.469 
basically you never have to manually set
the<00:01:21.750> time<00:01:22.880> going<00:01:23.880> over<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.180> different

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
the time going over the different

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.780 
the time going over the different
screens<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> watch<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.369> home<00:01:26.580> screen

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
exact wording for it but basically if

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.020 
exact wording for it but basically if

you were to tilt your wrist then it

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.939 
you were to tilt your wrist then it
would<00:04:43.210> do<00:04:43.449> that<00:04:43.569> same<00:04:43.870> feature<00:04:44.229> without<00:04:44.620> you

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:44.949 
would do that same feature without you

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.439 
would do that same feature without you
having<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.250> actually<00:04:45.430> press<00:04:45.849> the<00:04:46.000> button<00:04:46.300> so
