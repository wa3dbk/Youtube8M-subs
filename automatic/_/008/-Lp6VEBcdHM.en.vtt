00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
only is that the only one that's

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.600 
only is that the only one that's
legitimately<00:02:27.050> good<00:02:27.470> it's<00:02:27.950> actually<00:02:28.430> one<00:02:28.580> of

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
you'd expect from a game like this you

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.949 
you'd expect from a game like this you
mash<00:02:49.100> buttons<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.700> attack<00:02:50.030> your<00:02:50.209> enemies<00:02:50.570> with

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
moves that look a lot flash here than

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.090 
moves that look a lot flash here than
they<00:02:53.209> really<00:02:53.600> are<00:02:53.780> but<00:02:54.260> again<00:02:54.560> like<00:02:54.769> the<00:02:54.950> Wii

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
they really are but again like the Wii

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
version there's a bit of complexity to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.199 
version there's a bit of complexity to
the<00:02:57.440> controls<00:02:57.860> as<00:02:58.040> well<00:02:58.280> there<00:02:58.730> are<00:02:58.820> lots<00:02:59.000> of

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
button combinations for some pretty

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.790 
button combinations for some pretty
elaborate<00:03:01.910> moves<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:02.450> Thor<00:03:03.019> also<00:03:03.410> has<00:03:03.590> the

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
elaborate moves and Thor also has the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.280 
elaborate moves and Thor also has the
ability<00:03:03.890> to<00:03:04.370> cast<00:03:04.580> attack<00:03:05.120> spells<00:03:05.540> using

lightning wind and thunder to his
immortal<00:03:09.560> advantage<00:03:10.100> but<00:03:10.850> this<00:03:10.970> adds<00:03:11.180> some

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
immortal advantage but this adds some

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.479 
immortal advantage but this adds some
variety<00:03:11.959> to<00:03:11.989> what<00:03:12.319> would<00:03:12.470> otherwise<00:03:12.709> be<00:03:12.860> lots

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
variety to what would otherwise be lots

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.550 
variety to what would otherwise be lots
of<00:03:13.610> button<00:03:14.000> mashing<00:03:14.030> but<00:03:14.900> even<00:03:15.140> that<00:03:15.290> doesn't

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
of button mashing but even that doesn't

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.370 
of button mashing but even that doesn't
