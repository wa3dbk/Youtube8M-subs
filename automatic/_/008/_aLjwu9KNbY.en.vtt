00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.929
 hello dear friends with you elena 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.000
 Krasovskaya 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:15.630
 I want to answer today the questions of one 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.460
 my readers, too, by the way elena by 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.109
 about 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.580
 calculation of the consumption of fabric for children's ball 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.000
 dress dress looks in top of about 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.000
 in this way 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.850
 Liv Rukovchik narrow and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.110
 wide enough skirt fluffy 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.989
 I think the type of skirt the sun is made out 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:47.129
 and 2 or is there a little more from your 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.399
 desires under the nylon under skirts 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.719
 also here the shuttlecock comes from the extra 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.120
 fabric on the sleeve let's see how 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.270
 way you can easily calculate the flow 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.820
 fabrics for this dress and accordingly it 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.489
 the rule is valid calculation rule 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.950
 act on very many celia therefore 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.530
 you can easily use it when 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.420
 calculating the consumption of fabric for its products 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.840
 in order to calculate the amount 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.880
 fabric need for dress 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.890
 first need to know the width of the material 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.650
 that is, choose a material 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.799
 according to the desired width, I take 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.490
 standard width meter fifty and 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.950
 also but we need to know the length of the product 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:39.150
 If cutting a dress like this case, 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:43.409
 bodice means you need to know the length and length 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.540
 bodice and skirt length separately if it is 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.360
 single cut that is not from carved something 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.820
 need to fully know the length of the product and 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.390
 also sleeve length somewhere around 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.259
 height i take forty-two meter and girth 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.450
 chest and 72 centimeters product length 84 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.950
 I am taking about is just offhand 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.160
 also start the back length we will have 34 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.800
 cm sleeve length 35 centimeters 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.480
 look at chest circumference 72 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.400
 centimeter we see that the details of the back and 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.370
 before 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.840
 runs across the width of the fabric and still here 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.210
 can put 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.140
 sleeve detail i also go through 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.620
 sleeve detail 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.080
 72 centimeters fabric already folded 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.190
 I can see up to 75 centimeters 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:38.930
 and the back is placed here in front 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.740
 they become sleeves respectively on the details 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:45.060
 bodice dresses 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.920
 let's take 36 centimeters on liv 36 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.830
 see now skirt 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.130
 if we have a sun skirt say length 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.960
 50 centimeters to the sun skirt to cut out 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.450
 we have from the square to 50 where is the side 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.750
 will be equal to 5 50 centimeters skirt length 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.620
 and waist circumference here we have one 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.470
 fourth waist circumference will be 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:15.840
 for example on chest 72 for example on almost 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.500
 10 meters means 15 to 50 plus 15 75 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.530
 centimeters 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.450
 I repeat the length of the skirt itself 50 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:28.170
 centimeters and this one is the rest where 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:31.620
 we cut out this semicircle on the waist 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:34.430
 we take it about 15cm but it needs 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.140
 count by skirt if you want 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.209
 to build just such a skirt in my 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.959
 the blog has an article skirt-sun skirt 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:42.150
 half sun 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.890
 everything is told there in the most detailed way 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.080
 how it is constructed from pattern 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.070
 we get on the skirt square with 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.350
 sides 75 centimeters and 75 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.470
 respectively 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.580
 width of the cloth it passes again in 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.950
 bent see 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.930
 material that is 75 centimeters here 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.410
 seventy five ten centimeters 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.810
 meter ten we need to dress and plus 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:10.830
 allowances for seams but somewhere we take 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.630
 5 centimeters long skidochku to have 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.700
 Do not miss can be a little more 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.220
 want to add something 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.910
 Maybe you want to search if the train 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.190
 accordingly, it will be necessary to supplement 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.980
 for example centimeters 10 to if you 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:30.150
 train 6 centimeters there 5 you need 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.820
 will be 10 centimeters in length add 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:38.740
 take without a belt now meter ten with us 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:41.800
 length of bodice and length of skirt plus allowances 5 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.170
 centimeters meter 15 so here 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.750
 this particular dress model is needed 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:49.540
 meter 15 fabrics per girl growth hundred 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:50.650
 forty two centimeters respectively on 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.840
 petticoats 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.250
 if you want to add more pomp 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:05:00.340
 volume you take extra fabric 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:04.150
 if you want by the same pattern 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:07.600
 do then take 75 centimeters to plus 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.080
 5 80 centimeters for one skirt 80 on 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.490
 to a friend if it's from the same fabric 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.980
 for example from capron meter sixty 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.440
 take on the underskirt so that you have 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:20.050
 here in these skirts if you want a skirt 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.460
 make one half bottom yes just with 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:27.190
 then take the length accordingly 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.919
 this cloth but it will probably 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.400
 about 50 centimeters 50 if 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.260
 kapron chick looks out 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.950
 under the skirt will need to be 60 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.430
 centimeters 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:42.220
 how to calculate this assembly if you 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.220
 Do you want a petticoat for example with an assembly 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:45.990
 pick one girth 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:50.050
 hips 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:52.320
 so for example 172 well, for example, let 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:56.320
 eighty girth we will have and 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:06:00.100
 multiply by 2 if you want not 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.440
 strong build 82 meter sixty you 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:05.650
 will need in length and width 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.320
 cloth, respectively, the length of 50 cm 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:10.129
 if you want to god build more luxuriously then 

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.669
 multiply by 380 mm 

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:17.119
 inside it turns out 240 that is 240 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:19.939
 accordingly, this does not work with us 

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:24.949
 one width of fabric take two lengths on 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:26.739
 This skirt 50 50 or 60 how many we 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:29.899
 you take that is it turns out 

00:06:26.739 --> 00:06:33.199
 meter twenty on the underskirt will need 

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:34.129
 just a panel for assembly and plus 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:36.939
 allowances 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:40.339
 our thus can be calculated to on 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:43.789
 any product based on 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:45.559
 fabric width per product length 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:48.080
 sleeves and respectively on 

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:53.110
 additional details which you want 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:56.149
 add to your product hope that 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:59.300
 calculation of fabric consumption will not be for you 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:07:01.360
 too complicated all the best for 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.360
 dating 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.280
 but
