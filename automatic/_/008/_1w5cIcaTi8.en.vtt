to keep in mind is remember there are

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.610 
to keep in mind is remember there are
five<00:00:10.620> parts<00:00:11.570> there's<00:00:12.570> three<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.349> upper

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
five parts there's three to the upper

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.880 
five parts there's three to the upper
lip<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:13.830> two<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.639> bottom<00:00:15.030> lip<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.890> it's

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
lip and two to the bottom lip and it's

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.380 
lip and two to the bottom lip and it's
one<00:00:17.699> oval<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.300> then<00:00:19.050> maybe<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.380> smaller

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
one oval and then maybe a smaller

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.810 
one oval and then maybe a smaller
flatter<00:00:21.590> section<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.769> then<00:00:23.070> another<00:00:23.400> oval

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
flatter section and then another oval

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.439 
flatter section and then another oval
repeating<00:00:24.330> what<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.539> just<00:00:24.689> did<00:00:24.869> over<00:00:25.140> there

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:26.449 
repeating what you just did over there

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.679 
repeating what you just did over there
ok<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.689> then<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.220> top<00:00:29.429> lip<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:29.939> then

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
ok and then that's the top lip and then

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.630 
ok and then that's the top lip and then
for<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> bottom<00:00:31.260> lip<00:00:31.439> we<00:00:31.619> want<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.920> do<00:00:32.070> two

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
for the bottom lip we want to do two

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.620 
for the bottom lip we want to do two
ovals<00:00:33.059> maybe<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:34.020> bit<00:00:34.200> smaller<00:00:34.469> than

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
ovals maybe a little bit smaller than

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.150 
ovals maybe a little bit smaller than
the<00:00:36.630> two<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.469> top<00:00:39.350> and<00:00:40.350> we<00:00:40.710> place<00:00:40.950> those

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the two on the top and we place those

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.280 
the two on the top and we place those
there<00:00:41.460> now<00:00:41.670> what<00:00:42.000> happens<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.600> we<00:00:42.840> put<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> line

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
there now what happens is we put a line

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.340 
there now what happens is we put a line
between<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.770> two<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.420> then<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.989> these<00:00:46.320> are

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
between the two and then this these are

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.709 
between the two and then this these are
sketched<00:00:46.770> in<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.129> course<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.640> now<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.450> start

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
sketched in of course and now you start

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.430 
sketched in of course and now you start
drawing<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.289> your<00:00:49.469> heavier<00:00:49.829> lines<00:00:50.719> ok<00:00:51.719> we've

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
drawing in your heavier lines ok we've

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.160 
drawing in your heavier lines ok we've
drawn<00:00:52.739> over<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.699> top<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.210> one<00:00:54.360> in<00:00:54.570> kind

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
drawn over the top of that one in kind

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.069 
drawn over the top of that one in kind
of<00:00:55.199> a<00:00:55.320> curve<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:56.730> dip<00:00:56.940> down<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.539> top<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.870> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
of a curve and we dip down on top of the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.660 
of a curve and we dip down on top of the
smaller<00:00:58.410> one<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:58.739> drew<00:00:58.949> here<00:00:59.190> and<00:00:59.370> then<00:00:59.579> we

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
smaller one we drew here and then we

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.849 
smaller one we drew here and then we
come<00:00:59.969> back<00:01:00.000> and<00:01:00.359> finish<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.780> way<00:01:00.989> again

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
come back and finish this way again

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.539 
come back and finish this way again
repeating<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.760> line<00:01:03.260> here<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:05.129> over<00:01:05.339> here

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
repeating this line here to over here

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.020 
repeating this line here to over here
now<00:01:05.850> that's<00:01:06.060> our<00:01:06.270> top<00:01:06.540> lip<00:01:06.890> all<00:01:07.890> right<00:01:08.070> now<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
now that's our top lip all right now the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.660 
now that's our top lip all right now the
bottom<00:01:09.360> lip<00:01:09.570> will<00:01:10.470> draw<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> line<00:01:11.010> coming<00:01:11.460> down

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
bottom lip will draw a line coming down

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.020 
bottom lip will draw a line coming down
here<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.350> bump<00:01:13.350> up<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:13.860> bit<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
here and bump up a little bit in the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.940 
here and bump up a little bit in the
middle<00:01:15.150> between<00:01:15.330> between<00:01:16.049> where<00:01:16.530> these<00:01:16.680> two

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
middle between between where these two

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.670 
middle between between where these two
don't<00:01:17.189> meet<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.790> then<00:01:18.509> finish<00:01:18.840> off<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.380> what

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
don't meet and then finish off so what

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:27.999 
don't meet and then finish off so what
happens<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.659> this<00:01:21.659> lip<00:01:22.020> will<00:01:22.259> look<00:01:22.470> like<00:01:23.460> this

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.010 

right<00:01:29.009> ok<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.000> then<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.479> little<00:01:30.689> usually

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
right ok and then it's a little usually

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.170 
right ok and then it's a little usually
a<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.290> darker<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> corners<00:01:32.250> ok<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:32.970> I'm

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
a little darker in the corners ok so I'm

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.450 
a little darker in the corners ok so I'm
going<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.390> draw<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:34.100> I'm<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.310> draw

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
going to draw that in I'm going to draw

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.520 
going to draw that in I'm going to draw
the<00:01:35.520> quick<00:01:36.329> loops<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.409> quick<00:01:39.530> circles

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
the quick loops here the quick circles

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.389 
the quick loops here the quick circles
all<00:01:41.520> right<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:42.689> some<00:01:43.500> people<00:01:43.649> teach<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.189> that

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
all right and some people teach you that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.069 
all right and some people teach you that
the<00:01:44.549> corners<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.149> mouths<00:01:45.360> really<00:01:45.810> kind<00:01:46.020> of

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
the corners of the mouths really kind of

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.980 
the corners of the mouths really kind of
meet<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.439> with<00:01:46.820> the<00:01:47.820> Centers<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.420> eyes<00:01:48.659> of

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
meet up with the Centers of the eyes of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.420 
meet up with the Centers of the eyes of
course<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.619> we're<00:01:49.770> not<00:01:49.860> all<00:01:50.040> built<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
course you know we're not all built the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.280 
course you know we're not all built the
same<00:01:50.460> way<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:50.970> some<00:01:51.600> people<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.930> smaller

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
same way so some people have smaller

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.840 
same way so some people have smaller
narrower<00:01:52.740> miles<00:01:53.009> some<00:01:53.280> people<00:01:53.520> have<00:01:53.610> wider

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
narrower miles some people have wider

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.670 
narrower miles some people have wider
mouths<00:01:54.149> but<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:55.020> might<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.350> good<00:01:55.470> rule<00:01:55.649> of

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
mouths but that might be a good rule of

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.330 
mouths but that might be a good rule of
thumb<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:57.960> we<00:01:58.079> come<00:01:58.259> up<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:59.159> draw

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
thumb so you know we come up and draw

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.580 
thumb so you know we come up and draw
that<00:02:00.290> all<00:02:01.290> right<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.640> also<00:02:03.630> remember<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
that all right and also remember in the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.740 
that all right and also remember in the
drawing<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.009> lips<00:02:05.360> you<00:02:06.360> know<00:02:06.390> there<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.719> a

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
drawing the lips you know there is a

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.070 
drawing the lips you know there is a
certain<00:02:07.140> amount<00:02:07.350> of<00:02:07.530> shadow<00:02:08.429> ok<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.599> top<00:02:09.810> lip

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
certain amount of shadow ok the top lip

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.780 
certain amount of shadow ok the top lip
is<00:02:10.289> more<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.860> shadow<00:02:11.129> because<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.670> can

rest<00:04:07.480> of<00:04:07.690> the<00:04:07.750> head<00:04:07.959> you<00:04:08.410> know<00:04:08.500> we<00:04:08.680> drew<00:04:08.889> these

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
rest of the head you know we drew these

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.360 
rest of the head you know we drew these
lines<00:04:09.370> in<00:04:09.609> here<00:04:10.290> just<00:04:11.290> basically<00:04:11.680> again<00:04:12.040> you

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
lines in here just basically again you

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.659 
lines in here just basically again you
don't<00:04:12.549> carve<00:04:12.880> into<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.299> paper<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:15.370> then

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
don't carve into the paper and then

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.479 
don't carve into the paper and then
we'll<00:04:15.849> try<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:17.549> draw<00:04:18.549> in<00:04:18.609> a<00:04:18.729> nice<00:04:18.910> chin<00:04:19.329> here

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
we'll try and draw in a nice chin here

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.310 
we'll try and draw in a nice chin here
inside<00:04:21.489> of<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.760> head<00:04:21.940> come<00:04:22.270> up<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.720> finish

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
inside of the head come up and finish

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.270 
inside of the head come up and finish
off<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.650> top<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:23.890> the<00:04:24.099> skull

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
off the top of the skull

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.680 
off the top of the skull
alright<00:04:25.940> so<00:04:26.480> now<00:04:26.780> we<00:04:27.530> have<00:04:27.560> that<00:04:28.510> let's<00:04:29.510> come

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
alright so now we have that let's come

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.510 
alright so now we have that let's come
back<00:04:29.720> up<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.290> eyes<00:04:30.530> for<00:04:30.830> a<00:04:30.860> minute<00:04:30.980> we<00:04:31.160> drew

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
back up to the eyes for a minute we drew

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.840 
back up to the eyes for a minute we drew
the<00:04:31.790> iris<00:04:32.570> or<00:04:33.020> cornea<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:33.830> now<00:04:34.520> you<00:04:34.580> want<00:04:34.790> to

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
the iris or cornea and now you want to

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.050 
the iris or cornea and now you want to
put<00:04:35.000> in<00:04:35.120> a<00:04:35.180> pupil<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:36.680> pupil<00:04:37.070> is<00:04:37.250> you<00:04:37.880> know<00:04:37.940> the

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
put in a pupil the pupil is you know the

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.790 
put in a pupil the pupil is you know the
dark<00:04:38.270> spot<00:04:38.540> in<00:04:38.690> your<00:04:38.810> eye<00:04:38.840> and<00:04:39.410> you<00:04:39.530> don't<00:04:39.680> want

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
dark spot in your eye and you don't want

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.120 
dark spot in your eye and you don't want
to<00:04:39.860> necessarily<00:04:40.220> completely<00:04:41.210> darken<00:04:41.780> that<00:04:41.810> in

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
to necessarily completely darken that in

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.490 
to necessarily completely darken that in
you<00:04:43.130> know<00:04:43.250> typically<00:04:43.700> your<00:04:44.660> I<00:04:44.690> will<00:04:45.169> reflect

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
you know typically your I will reflect

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.680 
you know typically your I will reflect
some<00:04:45.889> amount<00:04:46.160> of<00:04:46.280> light<00:04:46.490> so<00:04:47.000> you<00:04:47.060> can<00:04:47.360> draw

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
some amount of light so you can draw

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.480 
some amount of light so you can draw
like<00:04:47.900> a<00:04:47.930> little<00:04:48.230> square<00:04:48.620> or<00:04:48.919> some<00:04:49.250> little

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
like a little square or some little

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.360 
like a little square or some little
sliver<00:04:49.880> in<00:04:50.060> there<00:04:50.710> to<00:04:51.710> be<00:04:51.860> that<00:04:52.130> bit<00:04:52.340> of

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
sliver in there to be that bit of

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.480 
sliver in there to be that bit of
reflected<00:04:53.000> light<00:04:53.470> and<00:04:54.610> then<00:04:55.610> the<00:04:56.090> cornea

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
reflected light and then the cornea

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.560 
reflected light and then the cornea
depending<00:04:58.490> on<00:04:58.580> whether<00:04:58.760> somebody<00:04:59.120> has<00:04:59.300> brown

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
depending on whether somebody has brown

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:01.540 
depending on whether somebody has brown
eyes<00:04:59.600> or<00:05:00.169> blue<00:05:00.500> eyes<00:05:00.710> or<00:05:00.740> lighter<00:05:01.190> colored

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
eyes or blue eyes or lighter colored

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.010 
eyes or blue eyes or lighter colored
eyes<00:05:01.700> you<00:05:01.940> know<00:05:02.030> that<00:05:02.180> doesn't<00:05:02.480> get<00:05:02.600> filled<00:05:02.840> in

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
eyes you know that doesn't get filled in

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.610 
eyes you know that doesn't get filled in
either<00:05:03.140> here<00:05:03.530> let's<00:05:03.850> try<00:05:04.850> that<00:05:05.030> again<00:05:05.620> we're

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
either here let's try that again we're

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.890 
either here let's try that again we're
going<00:05:06.740> to<00:05:06.800> draw<00:05:07.070> that<00:05:08.260> so<00:05:09.260> there's<00:05:09.530> a<00:05:09.650> pupil

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
going to draw that so there's a pupil

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.550 
going to draw that so there's a pupil
and<00:05:11.950> reflection<00:05:12.950> in<00:05:13.160> the<00:05:13.310> pupil<00:05:13.990> and<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.440> know

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:15.560 
and reflection in the pupil and you know

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.520 
and reflection in the pupil and you know
it<00:05:15.680> could<00:05:15.890> be<00:05:16.070> just<00:05:16.750> faint<00:05:17.750> like<00:05:17.960> that<00:05:18.229> now

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
it could be just faint like that now

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.060 
it could be just faint like that now
there's<00:05:18.710> somebody<00:05:19.040> with<00:05:19.190> really<00:05:19.430> blue<00:05:19.640> eyes

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
there's somebody with really blue eyes

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.650 
there's somebody with really blue eyes
eyelids<00:05:22.070> again<00:05:22.580> are<00:05:22.729> like<00:05:22.850> the<00:05:22.970> eyebrows<00:05:23.360> they

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660 
eyelids again are like the eyebrows they

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.850 
eyelids again are like the eyebrows they
can<00:05:23.840> be<00:05:24.430> very<00:05:25.430> well<00:05:26.360> defined<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:27.169> you<00:05:27.800> know

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
can be very well defined and you know

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.460 
can be very well defined and you know
you<00:05:27.950> can<00:05:28.160> see<00:05:28.430> them<00:05:28.550> very<00:05:28.760> easily<00:05:29.540> or<00:05:30.020> they

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
you can see them very easily or they

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.590 
you can see them very easily or they
might<00:05:30.650> just<00:05:30.919> be<00:05:33.490> just<00:05:34.490> kind<00:05:34.970> of<00:05:35.030> form<00:05:35.270> in<00:05:35.419> there

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
might just be just kind of form in there

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.300 
might just be just kind of form in there
with<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.870> eyebrow<00:05:36.260> even<00:05:36.650> so<00:05:38.770> and<00:05:39.770> when<00:05:40.190> we

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
with the eyebrow even so and when we

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.480 
with the eyebrow even so and when we
draw<00:05:40.550> that<00:05:40.760> eyelashes<00:05:41.660> you<00:05:42.500> know<00:05:42.620> there's

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
draw that eyelashes you know there's

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.090 
draw that eyelashes you know there's
some<00:05:43.850> amount<00:05:44.180> of<00:05:44.270> eyelash<00:05:44.780> on<00:05:45.050> men<00:05:45.620> and<00:05:45.800> women

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
some amount of eyelash on men and women

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.920 
some amount of eyelash on men and women
there<00:05:46.310> make<00:05:47.120> it<00:05:47.240> look<00:05:47.330> really<00:05:47.570> you<00:05:47.690> can<00:05:47.810> draw

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
there make it look really you can draw

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.710 
there make it look really you can draw
your<00:05:47.960> tear<00:05:48.350> ducts<00:05:48.590> in<00:05:48.770> there<00:05:49.450> okay<00:05:50.450> we<00:05:50.600> can

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
your tear ducts in there okay we can

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.870 
your tear ducts in there okay we can
draw<00:05:50.930> ears<00:05:51.350> ears<00:05:51.650> will<00:05:51.919> typically<00:05:52.280> be<00:05:52.400> between

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
draw ears ears will typically be between

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.150 
draw ears ears will typically be between
the<00:05:53.270> eyes<00:05:53.570> and<00:05:54.020> the<00:05:54.080> nose<00:05:54.350> some<00:05:54.890> you<00:05:55.039> know

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
the eyes and the nose some you know

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.800 
the eyes and the nose some you know
people<00:05:55.520> have<00:05:55.640> different<00:05:55.970> shape<00:05:56.180> ears<00:05:56.479> so

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
people have different shape ears so

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.010 
people have different shape ears so
we're<00:05:57.050> going<00:05:57.140> to<00:05:57.229> just<00:05:57.440> kind<00:05:57.979> of<00:05:58.630> plan<00:05:59.630> that<00:05:59.870> in

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
we're going to just kind of plan that in

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.529 
we're going to just kind of plan that in
there<00:06:00.289> and<00:06:01.010> then<00:06:01.220> again<00:06:01.520> we'll<00:06:01.729> come<00:06:01.940> up<00:06:01.970> here

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539 
there and then again we'll come up here

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.800 
there and then again we'll come up here
like<00:06:03.229> that<00:06:03.910> you<00:06:04.910> can<00:06:05.060> draw<00:06:05.240> a<00:06:05.270> hair<00:06:05.570> line

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
like that you can draw a hair line

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.380 
like that you can draw a hair line
coming<00:06:06.710> across<00:06:06.979> the<00:06:07.250> top<00:06:07.460> of<00:06:07.669> the<00:06:07.729> skull<00:06:08.060> and

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:08.390 
coming across the top of the skull and

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:11.890 
coming across the top of the skull and
again<00:06:09.140> here<00:06:09.410> will<00:06:09.590> come<00:06:09.770> out<00:06:10.240> over<00:06:11.240> this<00:06:11.630> line

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
again here will come out over this line

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.170 
again here will come out over this line
you've<00:06:12.140> drawn<00:06:12.500> you<00:06:12.710> sketched<00:06:13.070> in<00:06:13.340> and<00:06:16.180> zoom

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
you've drawn you sketched in and zoom

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
you've drawn you sketched in and zoom
okay<00:06:18.850> getting<00:06:19.850> back<00:06:19.940> to<00:06:20.330> the<00:06:20.419> knows<00:06:20.630> we<00:06:20.990> might

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
okay getting back to the knows we might

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
a little bit of separation between this

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.850 
a little bit of separation between this
bit<00:07:11.979> of<00:07:12.130> shadow<00:07:12.400> and<00:07:12.819> the<00:07:12.849> eyebrow<00:07:13.860> and

bit of shadow and the eyebrow and

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.469 
bit of shadow and the eyebrow and
there's<00:07:15.370> maybe<00:07:15.550> a<00:07:15.639> little<00:07:15.819> bit<00:07:16.000> more<00:07:16.120> shadow

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:16.479 
there's maybe a little bit more shadow

00:07:16.479 --> 00:07:19.260 
there's maybe a little bit more shadow
here<00:07:16.900> on<00:07:17.080> the<00:07:17.199> size<00:07:17.440> of<00:07:17.620> those<00:07:17.770> so<00:07:18.639> there<00:07:19.180> you

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270 
here on the size of those so there you

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.270 
here on the size of those so there you
got<00:07:19.389> an<00:07:19.479> idea<00:07:19.750> of<00:07:19.810> what<00:07:20.020> what<00:07:20.500> the<00:07:20.620> contrasts

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 
got an idea of what what the contrasts

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.699 
got an idea of what what the contrasts
are<00:07:21.370> going<00:07:21.490> to<00:07:21.550> look<00:07:21.669> like
