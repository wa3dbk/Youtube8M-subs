I'm reviewing the fellowes 79 ci office
paper<00:00:10.680> shredder<00:00:13.100> so<00:00:14.100> looking<00:00:14.400> at<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.580> box

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
paper shredder so looking at the box

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.970 
paper shredder so looking at the box
here<00:00:15.270> for<00:00:15.449> this<00:00:15.750> Fellowes<00:00:16.199> shredder<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.830> can

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
here for this Fellowes shredder you can

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.410 
here for this Fellowes shredder you can
see<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.369> number<00:00:17.580> one<00:00:17.730> thing<00:00:17.940> it's<00:00:18.090> trying<00:00:18.240> to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
see the number one thing it's trying to

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.509 
see the number one thing it's trying to
tap<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.529> jam<00:00:20.010> proof<00:00:20.689> it's<00:00:21.689> heavy<00:00:21.960> use

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
tap here is the jam proof it's heavy use

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:25.249 
tap here is the jam proof it's heavy use
compatible<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:23.759> it's<00:00:24.089> more<00:00:24.570> than<00:00:24.749> just<00:00:25.080> one

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
compatible so it's more than just one

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.220 
compatible so it's more than just one
person<00:00:25.679> using<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:27.210> ideal

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
person using this is ideal

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.230 
person using this is ideal
it's<00:00:28.619> professional-grade<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.970> can

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
it's professional-grade so you can

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.330 
it's professional-grade so you can
actually<00:00:30.449> shred<00:00:32.540> cards<00:00:33.540> CDs<00:00:34.190> paperclips<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
actually shred cards CDs paperclips and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.550 
actually shred cards CDs paperclips and
staples<00:00:35.430> we'll<00:00:35.970> go<00:00:36.090> through<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.560> according

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
staples we'll go through it according

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.700 
staples we'll go through it according
the<00:00:37.710> box<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.750> it's<00:00:39.750> higher<00:00:39.900> security<00:00:40.560> with

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the box here it's higher security with

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
the box here it's higher security with
its<00:00:40.740> crosscut<00:00:41.460> technology<00:00:42.150> and<00:00:43.220> its<00:00:44.220> ultra

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
its crosscut technology and its ultra

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.240 
its crosscut technology and its ultra
quiet<00:00:44.970> and<00:00:45.360> then<00:00:45.720> of<00:00:45.960> course<00:00:46.130> one<00:00:47.130> of<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
quiet and then of course one of the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.300 
quiet and then of course one of the
better<00:00:47.400> features<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:47.970> like<00:00:48.150> is<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:49.310> got

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
better features I like is that it's got

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.040 
better features I like is that it's got
advanced<00:00:50.790> safety<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.540> we're<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.810> test

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
advanced safety so we're going to test

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:00.830 
advanced safety so we're going to test
all<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.380> out<00:00:52.530> right<00:00:52.710> now

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.220 

okay<00:01:01.840> that's<00:01:02.110> the<00:01:02.260> 79<00:01:02.800> CI<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.250> new<00:01:03.610> shredder

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:04.230 
okay that's the 79 CI the new shredder

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.420 
okay that's the 79 CI the new shredder
and<00:01:05.230> this<00:01:05.350> old<00:01:05.620> shredder<00:01:05.890> is<00:01:06.010> actually<00:01:06.340> an

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
and this old shredder is actually an

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.210 
and this old shredder is actually an
older<00:01:06.850> fellows<00:01:07.420> that<00:01:07.660> I<00:01:07.720> just<00:01:07.990> had<00:01:08.170> here<00:01:08.440> we'll

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
older fellows that I just had here we'll

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.320 
older fellows that I just had here we'll
see<00:01:09.490> how<00:01:09.580> that's

most of my other sweaters I've worked
with<00:01:17.830> have<00:01:18.100> been<00:01:18.280> rated<00:01:18.759> for<00:01:19.060> about<00:01:19.090> three<00:01:19.720> to

four<00:01:20.049> sheets<00:01:20.380> at<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.710> time<00:01:20.950> this<00:01:21.729> one<00:01:22.000> is

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
four sheets at a time this one is

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.620 
four sheets at a time this one is
supposedly<00:01:22.630> rated<00:01:23.110> for<00:01:23.290> 14<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:25.090> I've<00:01:25.240> set<00:01:25.450> up<00:01:25.479> a

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
supposedly rated for 14 so I've set up a

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.910 
supposedly rated for 14 so I've set up a
couple<00:01:25.869> tests<00:01:26.200> and<00:01:26.320> we're<00:01:26.409> going<00:01:26.560> to<00:01:26.590> try<00:01:26.860> it

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
couple tests and we're going to try it

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.179 
couple tests and we're going to try it
out<00:01:27.130> you'll<00:01:28.030> see<00:01:28.119> this<00:01:28.479> meter<00:01:28.840> here<00:01:29.229> actually

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
out you'll see this meter here actually

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:33.050 
out you'll see this meter here actually
will<00:01:30.759> get<00:01:31.390> larger<00:01:31.960> with<00:01:32.200> the<00:01:32.380> amount<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.649> paper

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
will get larger with the amount of paper

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.730 
will get larger with the amount of paper
increasing<00:01:34.060> that<00:01:34.180> I<00:01:34.240> put<00:01:34.539> in<00:01:34.690> so<00:01:34.899> we'll<00:01:35.470> start

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
increasing that I put in so we'll start

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:48.920 
increasing that I put in so we'll start
small<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.369> move<00:01:37.210> our<00:01:37.390> way<00:01:37.420> up<00:01:37.890> one<00:01:38.890> sheet

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:56.930 

just<00:01:49.930> two<00:01:50.110> sheets

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:18.870 

three<00:01:57.940> sheets<00:02:01.440> ba<00:02:02.440> sheets<00:02:06.960> 10<00:02:07.960> sheets<00:02:17.880> 14

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
three sheets ba sheets 10 sheets 14

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:34.710 
three sheets ba sheets 10 sheets 14
sheets<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:31.270> says<00:02:31.540> no<00:02:31.959> go<00:02:32.170> on<00:02:32.200> 14<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:34.120> 79

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
sheets and it says no go on 14 the 79

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.190 
sheets and it says no go on 14 the 79
see<00:02:35.020> I<00:02:35.050> also<00:02:35.530> says<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.400> can<00:02:36.550> handle

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
see I also says that it can handle

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.150 
see I also says that it can handle
paperclips<00:02:38.200> right<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.620> there<00:02:38.800> so<00:02:38.950> I<00:02:38.980> don't

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
paperclips right on there so I don't

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.890 
paperclips right on there so I don't
have<00:02:39.250> to<00:02:39.370> pull<00:02:39.520> these<00:02:39.670> off<00:02:39.850> anymore

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
have to pull these off anymore

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.360 
have to pull these off anymore
and<00:02:41.260> then<00:02:41.470> also<00:02:41.709> staples<00:02:42.670> so<00:02:44.010> we'll<00:02:45.010> load<00:02:45.220> this

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
and then also staples so we'll load this

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:54.420 
and then also staples so we'll load this
up<00:02:45.430> with<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.760> few<00:02:46.030> staples<00:02:53.100> how'd<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.220> like<00:02:54.370> to

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.920 
up with a few staples how'd you like to
take<00:02:54.700> all<00:02:54.850> those<00:02:55.000> off<00:02:55.240> before<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:55.690> shred<00:02:55.900> it

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
take all those off before you shred it

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:08.030 
take all those off before you shred it
all<00:02:56.170> right<00:02:56.380> let's<00:02:56.650> try<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:56.920> out

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.050

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
cards and CDs so we're going to try both

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.470 
cards and CDs so we're going to try both
of<00:03:13.209> those<00:03:13.300> out<00:03:13.510> right<00:03:13.540> now<00:03:13.890> here's<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.980> card

actually<00:03:26.049> there's<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.850> little<00:03:27.850> gate<00:03:28.209> here<00:03:28.650> to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
actually there's a little gate here to

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.710 
actually there's a little gate here to
protect<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:30.190> from<00:03:30.400> shards<00:03:30.850> of<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.000> CD<00:03:31.420> coming
