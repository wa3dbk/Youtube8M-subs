stick it out of the way and it will
expose<00:00:17.430> all<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:19.250> tuning<00:00:20.250> pins<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
expose all of the tuning pins the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.759 
expose all of the tuning pins the
hammers<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.449> dampers<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:21.990> all<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
hammers the dampers and all that and

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.200 
hammers the dampers and all that and
we'll<00:00:22.920> go<00:00:23.010> ahead<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.279> we'll<00:00:23.430> look<00:00:23.640> into<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
we'll go ahead and we'll look into the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.830 
we'll go ahead and we'll look into the
piano<00:00:24.480> now

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.529 

okay<00:00:28.710> now<00:00:28.920> we're<00:00:29.130> actually<00:00:29.279> at<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.730> bench<00:00:30.210> at

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
okay now we're actually at the bench at

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.290 
okay now we're actually at the bench at
the<00:00:30.750> grand<00:00:31.020> piano<00:00:31.230> me<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.710> see<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> keys<00:00:32.309> we

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the grand piano me can see the keys we

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.330 
the grand piano me can see the keys we
can<00:00:33.329> see<00:00:33.629> the<00:00:33.750> keys<00:00:33.989> are<00:00:34.170> level<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.129> take<00:00:35.309> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
can see the keys are level if you take a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.869 
can see the keys are level if you take a
good<00:00:35.760> look<00:00:35.820> down<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:37.050> line<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.500> can<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:37.879> that

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
good look down the line you can see that

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.000 
good look down the line you can see that
the<00:00:39.120> keys<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.360> level<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.320> by<00:00:40.530> looking<00:00:40.860> down

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the keys are level just by looking down

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.729 
the keys are level just by looking down
here<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:42.360> that's<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.899> good<00:00:42.930> way<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.379> look<00:00:43.620> at

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
here and that's a good way to look at

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.369 
here and that's a good way to look at
the<00:00:43.920> upright<00:00:44.430> piano<00:00:44.730> -<00:00:44.940> but<00:00:45.839> now<00:00:46.080> that<00:00:46.260> we've

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
the upright piano - but now that we've

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.280 
the upright piano - but now that we've
opened<00:00:46.650> the<00:00:46.890> panel<00:00:47.070> we<00:00:47.339> can<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:48.290> everything

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
opened the panel we can see everything

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.780 
opened the panel we can see everything
in<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:49.739> see<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.040> tuning<00:00:50.339> pins<00:00:50.550> right

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
in here we see the tuning pins right

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.880 
in here we see the tuning pins right
here<00:00:51.150> we<00:00:51.629> see<00:00:51.839> all<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.079> tuning<00:00:52.379> pins<00:00:52.589> we'll

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
here we see all the tuning pins we'll

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.399 
here we see all the tuning pins we'll
make<00:00:53.040> sure<00:00:53.220> there's<00:00:53.400> no<00:00:53.610> discoloration<00:00:54.409> and

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:55.409 
make sure there's no discoloration and

00:00:55.409 --> 00:00:58.040 
make sure there's no discoloration and
on<00:00:56.159> this<00:00:56.370> piano<00:00:56.670> we'll<00:00:57.360> notice<00:00:57.659> that<00:00:57.690> these

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
on this piano we'll notice that these

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.979 
on this piano we'll notice that these
tuning<00:00:58.470> pins<00:00:58.739> are<00:00:59.070> brand-new<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.119> these

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
tuning pins are brand-new and these

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.380 
tuning pins are brand-new and these
strings<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.530> very<00:01:01.830> bright<00:01:02.190> so<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:03.030> strings

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
strings are very bright so the strings

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.690 
strings are very bright so the strings
have<00:01:03.540> been<00:01:03.600> replaced<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.470> grand<00:01:04.739> bass

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
have been replaced on the grand bass

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.940 
have been replaced on the grand bass
section<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.270> this<00:01:06.360> piano<00:01:06.630> right<00:01:06.960> here<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.530> you

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
section of this piano right here and you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.820 
section of this piano right here and you
can<00:01:08.100> tell<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:08.820> by<00:01:08.909> looking<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.830> when

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
can tell that just by looking at when

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.710 
can tell that just by looking at when
you<00:01:10.920> can<00:01:11.070> see<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.369> close<00:01:11.400> these<00:01:11.970> tuning<00:01:12.510> pins

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
you can see up close these tuning pins

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.469 
you can see up close these tuning pins
are<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> little<00:01:13.170> bit<00:01:13.320> older<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.299> then<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.390> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
are a little bit older and then if you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.940 
are a little bit older and then if you
look<00:01:15.659> over<00:01:15.869> here<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.380> these<00:01:16.530> brand-new

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
look over here you see these brand-new

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.910 
look over here you see these brand-new
shiny<00:01:17.909> tuning<00:01:18.330> pins<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.840> brand<00:01:19.439> new<00:01:19.560> strings

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
shiny tuning pins and brand new strings

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
shiny tuning pins and brand new strings
so<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.280> could<00:01:20.729> be<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.880> good<00:01:21.119> sign<00:01:21.390> somebody's

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
so that could be a good sign somebody's

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.140 
so that could be a good sign somebody's
taking<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.830> effort<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.280> restring<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:23.909> piano

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
taking the effort to restring this piano

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.840 
taking the effort to restring this piano
in<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> lower<00:01:24.689> end<00:01:25.189> these<00:01:26.189> are<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> dampers

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
in the lower end these are the dampers

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.280 
in the lower end these are the dampers
and<00:01:27.119> when<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.450> press<00:01:27.659> on<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> damper<00:01:28.259> pedal

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
and when you press on the damper pedal

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.109 
and when you press on the damper pedal
you<00:01:28.860> can<00:01:28.890> see<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.280> lift<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.000> make

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
you can see they lift you want to make

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.120 
you can see they lift you want to make
sure<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.390> all<00:01:30.509> lift<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.990> row<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.470> they<00:01:31.979> all

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
sure they all lift in a row and they all

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.469 
sure they all lift in a row and they all
sit<00:01:32.399> down<00:01:32.570> easily<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:36.060> want<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.299> make<00:01:36.450> sure

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
sit down easily you want to make sure

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.770 
sit down easily you want to make sure
that<00:01:36.810> when<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.049> play<00:01:37.289> the<00:01:37.530> key<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:39.630> the

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
that when you play the key that the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.560 
that when you play the key that the
dampers<00:01:40.170> are<00:01:40.350> moving<00:01:40.649> up<00:01:40.770> as<00:01:40.950> well<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.570> that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
dampers are moving up as well and that

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.889 
dampers are moving up as well and that
the<00:01:42.689> dampers<00:01:43.049> return<00:01:43.469> and<00:01:43.850> damp<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.689> note

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the dampers return and damp the the note

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.370 
the dampers return and damp the the note
so<00:01:46.319> there's<00:01:46.530> no<00:01:46.649> notes<00:01:47.100> ringing<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:48.380> make
