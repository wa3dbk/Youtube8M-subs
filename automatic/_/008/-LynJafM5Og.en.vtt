the<00:00:29.279> camera<00:00:29.519> housing<00:00:29.789> looks<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.090> little<00:00:30.210> bit

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
the camera housing looks a little bit

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.179 
the camera housing looks a little bit
different<00:00:30.689> that's<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.410> visual<00:00:31.710> tweak

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
different that's just a visual tweak

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.160 
different that's just a visual tweak
though<00:00:32.399> nothing<00:00:32.880> big<00:00:33.059> they're<00:00:33.329> down<00:00:34.050> on<00:00:34.110> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
though nothing big they're down on the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.810 
though nothing big they're down on the
bottom<00:00:34.260> kind<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.680> big<00:00:34.800> deal<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.190> guess<00:00:35.399> same

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
bottom kind of a big deal I guess same

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.299 
bottom kind of a big deal I guess same
FCC<00:00:36.390> ID<00:00:36.570> number<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.140> nothing<00:00:37.590> significant

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
FCC ID number so nothing significant

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.270

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
in that respect actually I take it back

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.319 
in that respect actually I take it back
the<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.770> difference<00:00:46.980> here<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.820> side<00:00:48.030> so

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
the one difference here is the side so

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
on the black one it's rubberized it's

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.410 
on the black one it's rubberized it's
that<00:00:49.920> soft<00:00:50.190> touch<00:00:50.370> coating<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.059> white<00:00:51.239> one

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
that soft touch coating the white one

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600 
that soft touch coating the white one
it's<00:00:51.660> more<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.230> matte<00:00:52.469> glossy<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:53.160> mad<00:00:53.370> are
