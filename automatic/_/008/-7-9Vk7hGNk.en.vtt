it took me 20 30 shots of the same type
before<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.100> found<00:00:47.280> one<00:00:47.489> where<00:00:47.640> he's<00:00:47.910> out<00:00:48.420> of

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
before I found one where he's out of

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.660 
before I found one where he's out of
focus<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.200> he's<00:00:49.320> not<00:00:49.440> horrible<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.430> so

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
focus here but he's not horrible and so

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.250 
focus here but he's not horrible and so
I<00:00:50.730> thought<00:00:50.910> I<00:00:50.969> was<00:00:51.149> good<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.809> other<00:00:51.930> three

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
I thought I was good the other three

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.979 
I thought I was good the other three
guys<00:00:52.640> basically<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.030> count<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.600> after

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
guys basically on the count of one after

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.959 
guys basically on the count of one after
they<00:00:55.110> heard<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> shutter<00:00:55.649> click<00:00:55.949> ran<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.670> of

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
they heard the shutter click ran out of

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.360 
they heard the shutter click ran out of
the<00:00:57.360> scene<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:58.920> creates<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the scene and that's what creates the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.119 
the scene and that's what creates the
kind<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.149> movement<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> outside

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
kind of the movement on the outside

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
kind of the movement on the outside
things<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.250> liked<00:01:02.550> about<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.059> image<00:01:03.780> were<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
things I liked about the image were the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.070 
things I liked about the image were the
lighting<00:01:05.090> coming<00:01:06.090> from<00:01:06.330> behind<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.020> just

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
it's going to take supple videos because

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.969 
it's going to take supple videos because
there's<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.400> little<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.759> editing<00:01:23.909> involved

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
there's a little bit of editing involved

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.100 
there's a little bit of editing involved
but<00:01:25.979> as<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.729> saw<00:01:26.970> i<00:01:27.500> started<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.590> raw<00:01:28.799> shooter

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
but as you saw i started in raw shooter

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.219 
but as you saw i started in raw shooter
and<00:01:31.670> what<00:01:32.670> i<00:01:32.700> did<00:01:33.000> here<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.780> really<00:01:33.930> messed

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
and what i did here is I really messed

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.100 
and what i did here is I really messed
with<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.979> mostly<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.060> contrast<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.930> did

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
with the mostly the contrast and I did

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.130 
with the mostly the contrast and I did
that<00:01:37.200> using<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:38.369> shadow<00:01:38.850> contrast<00:01:39.570> here<00:01:39.900> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
that using the shadow contrast here and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.950 
that using the shadow contrast here and
I<00:01:40.860> thought<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.460> was<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> little<00:01:41.700> overexposed<00:01:42.329> so

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
I thought it was a little overexposed so

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.490 
I thought it was a little overexposed so
I<00:01:44.180> took<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> auto<00:01:45.479> exposure<00:01:45.869> down<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
I took the auto exposure down just a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.600 
I took the auto exposure down just a
little<00:01:46.619> bit<00:01:47.390> added<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.509> little<00:01:48.750> bit<00:01:48.869> of<00:01:49.610> shadow

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
little bit added a little bit of shadow

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.660 
little bit added a little bit of shadow
contrast<00:01:52.009> until<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.040> felt<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.640> was<00:01:53.759> about<00:01:54.030> right

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
contrast until I felt it was about right

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.100 
contrast until I felt it was about right
gets<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.850> be<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> bit<00:01:57.180> too<00:01:57.360> much<00:01:57.509> gets<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> be

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
gets to be a bit too much gets to be

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.749 
gets to be a bit too much gets to be
enough<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.500> can<00:01:58.590> see<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.860> color<00:01:59.159> tones<00:01:59.490> are

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
enough you can see the color tones are

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.999 
enough you can see the color tones are
already<00:02:00.090> there<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:01.229> we're<00:02:01.350> already<00:02:01.619> starting

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
already there so we're already starting

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.420 
already there so we're already starting
to<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.840> get<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> right<00:02:04.110> color<00:02:04.290> tones<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.369> I

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
to get get the right color tones and I

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.980 
to get get the right color tones and I

count played with this a little bit and

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.779 
count played with this a little bit and
just<00:02:07.170> took<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:07.740> bit<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.399> highlight

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
just took a little bit of the highlight

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.690 
just took a little bit of the highlight
contrast<00:02:09.330> out<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:10.280> as<00:02:11.280> with<00:02:11.640> all<00:02:11.790> my<00:02:11.970> images<00:02:12.120> I

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
contrast out and as with all my images I

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.330 
contrast out and as with all my images I
I<00:02:12.730> come<00:02:12.940> over<00:02:13.030> saturated<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.319> kind<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:14.920> over

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
I come over saturated so I kind of over

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.990 
I come over saturated so I kind of over
saturated<00:02:15.970> it<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:17.760> essentially<00:02:18.760> what<00:02:18.790> i've

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
saturated it and essentially what i've

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.350

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
lens so it was just the factory 18 to 55

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.000 
lens so it was just the factory 18 to 55
that<00:02:37.690> came<00:02:37.870> with<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.140> camera<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.890> while<00:02:39.069> back

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
that came with that camera a while back

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.650 
that came with that camera a while back
raw<00:02:42.010> shooter<00:02:42.340> I've<00:02:42.459> had<00:02:42.640> for<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.180> long<00:02:43.330> long

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
raw shooter I've had for a long long

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.800 
raw shooter I've had for a long long
time<00:02:43.720> since<00:02:44.170> it<00:02:44.319> was<00:02:44.349> a<00:02:44.440> free<00:02:44.680> download<00:02:45.069> and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
time since it was a free download and

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.259 
time since it was a free download and
this<00:02:47.190> settings<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.310> think<00:02:48.519> can<00:02:48.640> be<00:02:48.730> reproduced

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
this settings I think can be reproduced

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.259 
this settings I think can be reproduced
in<00:02:49.480> several<00:02:50.080> new<00:02:50.519> software<00:02:51.519> programs<00:02:52.000> and

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
in several new software programs and

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.850 
in several new software programs and
things<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.510> are<00:02:52.660> out<00:02:52.750> there<00:02:52.780> but<00:02:53.170> this<00:02:53.650> is

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
things that are out there but this is

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.350 
things that are out there but this is
the<00:02:53.950> start<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.400> then<00:02:54.489> I<00:02:54.579> would<00:02:54.760> convert<00:02:55.150> this

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
the start and then I would convert this

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.479 
the start and then I would convert this
basically<00:02:55.870> and<00:02:56.110> open<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.500> up<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.739> photoshop<00:02:56.890> so

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
basically and open it up in photoshop so

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.360 
basically and open it up in photoshop so
my<00:02:57.670> next<00:02:57.910> tutorial<00:02:58.120> will<00:02:58.630> actually<00:02:59.049> be<00:02:59.370> this

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
my next tutorial will actually be this

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.339 
my next tutorial will actually be this
image<00:03:00.730> opened<00:03:01.269> in<00:03:01.360> Photoshop<00:03:01.870> and<00:03:02.079> you<00:03:02.170> can

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
image opened in Photoshop and you can

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.870 
image opened in Photoshop and you can
see<00:03:02.560> kind<00:03:02.769> of<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:02.980> rest<00:03:03.190> of<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.459> editing<00:03:03.790> I

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
see kind of the rest of the editing I

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.300 
see kind of the rest of the editing I
did<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:05.079> really<00:03:05.319> get<00:03:05.440> this<00:03:05.620> picture<00:03:05.920> to<00:03:06.280> look

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
did to really get this picture to look

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.750
