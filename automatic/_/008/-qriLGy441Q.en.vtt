00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
afterwards tada I just finished one side

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.669 
afterwards tada I just finished one side
so<00:02:05.360> using<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:05.990> piece<00:02:06.259> that<00:02:06.679> you<00:02:07.310> just<00:02:07.520> cut<00:02:07.729> out

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
so using the piece that you just cut out

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.400 
so using the piece that you just cut out
let's<00:02:09.679> go<00:02:09.920> here<00:02:10.220> I<00:02:10.250> go<00:02:10.310> like<00:02:11.120> this<00:02:11.200> put<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.230> on

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
let's go here I go like this put it on

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.620 
let's go here I go like this put it on
the<00:02:12.530> other<00:02:12.650> side<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.160> flip<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.610> so<00:02:14.090> go<00:02:14.450> like

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
the other side and flip it so go like

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.039 
the other side and flip it so go like
this<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:16.130> now<00:02:16.340> it's<00:02:16.519> on<00:02:16.640> that<00:02:16.790> side<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.840> you're

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
this and now it's on that side so you're

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.670 
this and now it's on that side so you're
going<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.319> cut<00:02:18.620> along<00:02:19.510> this<00:02:20.510> piece<00:02:21.290> right

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
going to cut along this piece right

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.620 
going to cut along this piece right
there<00:02:21.739> if<00:02:22.459> you'd<00:02:22.700> like<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.030> can<00:02:23.120> pin<00:02:23.480> the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
there if you'd like you can pin the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.289 
there if you'd like you can pin the
piece<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.650> doesn't<00:02:24.920> fall<00:02:25.130> off<00:02:25.340> just

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:26.299 
piece so that it doesn't fall off just

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:34.539 
piece so that it doesn't fall off just
gives<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.630> more<00:02:26.840> control<00:02:28.959> so<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:34.130> last<00:02:34.340> step

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549 
gives you more control so the last step

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.039 
gives you more control so the last step
is<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.730> cut<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.269> bottom<00:02:35.630> of<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.840> shirt

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
is to cut the bottom of the shirt

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.259 
is to cut the bottom of the shirt
depending<00:02:36.920> how<00:02:36.980> long<00:02:37.069> your<00:02:37.400> shirt<00:02:37.609> is<00:02:37.850> you<00:02:38.120> can

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
depending how long your shirt is you can

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.120 
depending how long your shirt is you can
cut<00:02:38.510> it<00:02:38.600> as<00:02:38.690> short<00:02:38.870> as<00:02:39.019> you<00:02:39.049> want<00:02:39.350> or<00:02:39.560> as<00:02:39.590> long

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
cut it as short as you want or as long

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:41.440 
cut it as short as you want or as long
as<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.430> want<00:02:40.609> right<00:02:40.760> where<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.030> seams<00:02:41.269> are

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450

way you can have a nice thickness at the
bottom<00:03:23.939> and<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.780> will<00:03:24.840> catch<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.680> fabric<00:03:26.010> on

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 
bottom and it will catch the fabric on

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.539 
bottom and it will catch the fabric on
the<00:03:26.310> back<00:03:26.489> as<00:03:26.760> well<00:03:27.769> so<00:03:28.769> for<00:03:28.920> this<00:03:29.099> T<00:03:29.280> I'm<00:03:29.370> not

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.429 
going to sew the bottom of the edges but
on<00:03:32.370> another<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.909> made<00:03:33.120> earlier<00:03:33.599> you<00:03:33.870> can<00:03:34.019> see

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
on another I made earlier you can see

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.710 
on another I made earlier you can see
the<00:03:34.590> difference<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.430> sewing<00:03:35.730> edges<00:03:36.329> it's

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
the difference of the sewing edges it's

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.319 
the difference of the sewing edges it's
very<00:03:36.959> clean<00:03:37.470> and<00:03:37.709> the<00:03:38.579> best<00:03:38.790> thing<00:03:38.939> about<00:03:38.969> this

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
very clean and the best thing about this

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.000 
very clean and the best thing about this
is<00:03:39.389> that<00:03:39.569> when<00:03:39.870> you<00:03:39.959> wash<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.469> the<00:03:40.590> ends<00:03:40.889> don't

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
is that when you wash it the ends don't

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.559 
is that when you wash it the ends don't
curl<00:03:41.310> up<00:03:41.459> and<00:03:41.670> it<00:03:41.760> just<00:03:42.030> makes<00:03:42.209> them<00:03:42.420> nice

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
curl up and it just makes them nice

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.930 
curl up and it just makes them nice
finish
