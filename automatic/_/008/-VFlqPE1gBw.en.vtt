hello<00:00:00.510> everyone<00:00:00.930> and<00:00:00.960> welcome<00:00:01.230> in<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.070> video

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
hello everyone and welcome in this video

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.889 
hello everyone and welcome in this video
I'm<00:00:02.429> going<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.580> be<00:00:02.669> explaining<00:00:02.879> camera<00:00:03.629> kits

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
I'm going to be explaining camera kits

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.470 
I'm going to be explaining camera kits
now<00:00:04.440> camera<00:00:04.920> kits<00:00:05.130> are<00:00:05.310> obviously<00:00:05.670> used<00:00:06.150> to

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
now camera kits are obviously used to

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.200 
now camera kits are obviously used to
adjust<00:00:07.020> camber<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.849> would<00:00:08.970> want<00:00:09.120> to

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
adjust camber and you would want to

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.910 
adjust camber and you would want to
adjust<00:00:09.330> your<00:00:09.570> camber<00:00:10.110> for<00:00:10.349> probably<00:00:10.740> one<00:00:10.889> of

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
adjust your camber for probably one of

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.430 
adjust your camber for probably one of
two<00:00:11.130> reasons<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.450> may<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:12.960> lowered<00:00:13.290> your

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
two reasons a you may have lowered your

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.369 
two reasons a you may have lowered your
vehicle<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.540> then<00:00:15.540> because<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> lowering

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
vehicle and then because of lowering

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.560 
vehicle and then because of lowering
your<00:00:16.560> vehicle<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.279> offsets<00:00:17.940> your<00:00:18.060> camera<00:00:18.449> or

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
your vehicle it offsets your camera or

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.240 
your vehicle it offsets your camera or
creates<00:00:18.840> negative<00:00:19.020> camber<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.010> want<00:00:20.189> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
creates negative camber so you want to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.410 
creates negative camber so you want to
put<00:00:20.400> it<00:00:20.490> back<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.939> your<00:00:21.300> original

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
put it back to your original

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.029 
put it back to your original
manufacturers<00:00:22.320> recommended<00:00:22.859> wheel

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039

alignment<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.970> other<00:00:24.119> option<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.689> may

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
alignment the other option is you may

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.019 
alignment the other option is you may
want<00:00:25.199> some<00:00:25.380> negative<00:00:25.680> camber<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.550> better

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
want some negative camber for better

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.790 
want some negative camber for better
cornering<00:00:27.510> capabilities<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.439> use<00:00:28.619> your

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
cornering capabilities if you use your

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.400 
cornering capabilities if you use your
car<00:00:29.010> for<00:00:29.039> track<00:00:29.369> use<00:00:29.869> so<00:00:30.869> here<00:00:31.170> we<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.380> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
car for track use so here we have a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.450 
car for track use so here we have a
scenario<00:00:31.859> where<00:00:31.920> we're<00:00:32.189> going<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.369> be

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
scenario where we're going to be

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.580 
scenario where we're going to be
lowering<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:33.300> vehicle<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.410> we've<00:00:34.559> got

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
lowering the vehicle so here we've got

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.620 
lowering the vehicle so here we've got
our<00:00:34.770> tire<00:00:35.160> we've<00:00:35.730> got<00:00:35.880> our<00:00:36.000> lower<00:00:36.149> controller

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
our tire we've got our lower controller

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.470 
our tire we've got our lower controller
arm<00:00:36.930> lower<00:00:37.590> our<00:00:37.890> upper<00:00:38.219> control<00:00:38.340> arm<00:00:38.760> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
arm lower our upper control arm the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.740 
arm lower our upper control arm the
knuckle<00:00:39.780> connecting<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.430> coil<00:00:42.000> over<00:00:42.360> here

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
knuckle connecting it the coil over here

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.630 
knuckle connecting it the coil over here
and<00:00:42.930> here's<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.620> body<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> vehicle<00:00:44.250> in

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
and here's the body of the vehicle in

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.610 
and here's the body of the vehicle in
green<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.539> what<00:00:45.840> we're<00:00:45.989> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.379> is

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
green so what we're going to do is

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.260 
green so what we're going to do is
adjust<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:47.129> coil<00:00:47.370> over<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.879> lower<00:00:48.059> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
adjust this coil over and lower the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.240 
adjust this coil over and lower the
vehicle<00:00:48.390> down<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.649> lower<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.100> can

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
vehicle down so as we lower it you can

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.529 
vehicle down so as we lower it you can
see<00:00:50.430> there's<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.789> small<00:00:51.030> amount<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.360> we've

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
see there's the small amount that we've

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.350 
see there's the small amount that we've
lowered<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> as<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.590> lower<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.360> forces

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
lowered it as you lower it it forces

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.720 
lowered it as you lower it it forces
this<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.140> controller<00:00:55.710> arm<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.340> this

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
this as this controller arm as this

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.630 
this as this controller arm as this
control<00:00:57.090> arm<00:00:57.270> pivots<00:00:58.050> up<00:00:58.230> it's<00:00:58.920> going<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.340> pull

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
control arm pivots up it's going to pull

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.639 
control arm pivots up it's going to pull
this<00:00:59.820> in<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:00.960> going<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> induce<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
this in and it's going to induce a

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.979 
this in and it's going to induce a
negative<00:01:01.980> camber<00:01:02.250> onto<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.270> tire<00:01:03.539> now<00:01:03.840> it's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
negative camber onto this tire now it's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.479 
negative camber onto this tire now it's
slightly<00:01:04.170> exaggerated<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.040> course<00:01:05.280> but

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
slightly exaggerated of course but

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.710 
slightly exaggerated of course but
basically<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.150> idea<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.510> what's

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
basically this is the idea of what's

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.750 
basically this is the idea of what's
happening<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.890> what<00:01:08.040> you're<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> do<00:01:08.549> is

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
happening so what you're going to do is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.039 
happening so what you're going to do is
you're<00:01:09.000> going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.150> adjust<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.659> knuckle

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
you're going to adjust this knuckle

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.750 
you're going to adjust this knuckle
where<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.260> connects<00:01:10.560> here<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.369> ball<00:01:11.520> bushing

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
where it connects here the ball bushing

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.660 
where it connects here the ball bushing
on<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.600> control<00:01:13.470> arm<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.549> you're<00:01:14.640> going

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
on the control arm so and you're going

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.760 
on the control arm so and you're going
to<00:01:14.790> push<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.180> forward<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.560> push

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
to push that forward and as you push

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.530 
to push that forward and as you push
that<00:01:16.950> forward<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.610> see<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.939> straightens

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that forward you can see it straightens

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.780 
that forward you can see it straightens
out<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:19.170> tire<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.490> lower<00:01:20.670> your

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
out the tire and so you can lower your

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.219 
out the tire and so you can lower your
vehicle<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> have<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.890> tire<00:01:23.130> at<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> same

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
vehicle and have the tire at the same

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.320 
vehicle and have the tire at the same
recommended<00:01:25.229> tire<00:01:26.100> wheel<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.369> meant<00:01:26.850> camber

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
recommended tire wheel I meant camber

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.600 
recommended tire wheel I meant camber
that<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> manufacturer<00:01:28.409> suggested<00:01:29.009> so

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
that the manufacturer suggested so

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.130 
that the manufacturer suggested so
you've<00:01:29.729> got<00:01:29.880> your<00:01:29.939> stock<00:01:30.210> vehicle<00:01:30.450> your

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
you've got your stock vehicle your

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.990 
you've got your stock vehicle your
lowered<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:31.650> negative<00:01:32.070> camber<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.640> then

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
lowered with negative camber and then

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.490 
lowered with negative camber and then
you've<00:01:33.180> repositioned<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.930> ball<00:01:34.079> joint<00:01:34.380> on

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
you've repositioned the ball joint on

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.010 
you've repositioned the ball joint on
the<00:01:34.619> control<00:01:34.979> arm<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the control arm so that you can have the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.980 
the control arm so that you can have the
stock<00:01:37.520> camber<00:01:38.520> adjustment<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.659> what<00:01:39.810> this

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
stock camber adjustment so what this

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.440 
stock camber adjustment so what this
looks<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.350> basically<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:41.880> our

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
looks like basically is here we have our

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.539 
looks like basically is here we have our
control<00:01:43.409> arm<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:43.979> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> be<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
control arm this is going to be the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.960 
control arm this is going to be the
front<00:01:44.759> control<00:01:45.390> arm<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:46.070> it's<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.310> me<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.670> has

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
front control arm and it's on me it has

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.170 
front control arm and it's on me it has
a<00:01:48.000> slide<00:01:48.450> here<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.590> bushing<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.939> ball

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
a slide here that this bushing this ball

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.889 
a slide here that this bushing this ball
bushing<00:01:51.329> can<00:01:52.399> move<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.640> slide<00:01:53.970> along<00:01:54.149> so

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
bushing can move on slide along so

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.480 
bushing can move on slide along so
that's<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:55.530> you're<00:01:55.619> going<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.770> be<00:01:55.890> adjusting

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
that's what you're going to be adjusting

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.850 
that's what you're going to be adjusting
in<00:01:56.700> order<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.329> push<00:01:57.479> that<00:01:57.659> knuckle<00:01:57.990> forward<00:01:58.439> so

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
in order to push that knuckle forward so

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.060 
in order to push that knuckle forward so
you<00:01:59.130> even<00:01:59.820> out<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.149> camber<00:02:00.630> now<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.409> reason<00:02:01.950> I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
you even out the camber now the reason I

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.859 
you even out the camber now the reason I
went<00:02:02.250> with<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.790> buddy<00:02:03.000> club<00:02:03.299> camber<00:02:03.689> kid

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
went with this buddy club camber kid

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.959 
went with this buddy club camber kid
rather<00:02:04.110> than<00:02:04.439> some<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.250> others<00:02:05.490> was

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
rather than some of the others was

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.880 
rather than some of the others was
basically<00:02:06.329> because<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.960> had<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.200> solid<00:02:07.530> metal

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
basically because it had a solid metal

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.979 
basically because it had a solid metal
in<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.879> cinah<00:02:09.090> here<00:02:09.239> some<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.599> them<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.959> a

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
in the cinah here some of them have a

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.229 
in the cinah here some of them have a
hole<00:02:10.229> cut<00:02:10.590> out<00:02:10.739> here<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.790> basically<00:02:12.060> these

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
hole cut out here and basically these

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.339 
hole cut out here and basically these
screws

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
screws

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.610 
screws
the<00:02:13.530> ball<00:02:13.680> joint<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.069> place<00:02:15.109> there<00:02:16.109> there<00:02:16.530> on

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
the ball joint in place there there on

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.289 
the ball joint in place there there on
this<00:02:16.769> very<00:02:17.010> thin<00:02:17.370> piece<00:02:17.639> of<00:02:17.670> metal<00:02:17.939> right<00:02:18.239> here

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
this very thin piece of metal right here

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.530 
this very thin piece of metal right here
you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:19.019> imagine<00:02:19.170> this<00:02:19.620> being<00:02:19.829> cut<00:02:20.249> out<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:21.480> I

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
you can imagine this being cut out and I

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.640 
you can imagine this being cut out and I
just<00:02:21.749> thought<00:02:21.930> well<00:02:22.139> if<00:02:22.290> you<00:02:22.379> get<00:02:22.499> a<00:02:22.530> high

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
just thought well if you get a high

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.929 
just thought well if you get a high
enough<00:02:22.680> stress<00:02:23.129> on<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.340> you<00:02:23.609> know<00:02:23.730> it<00:02:23.819> may

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
enough stress on that you know it may

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.449 
enough stress on that you know it may
bend<00:02:24.269> or<00:02:24.450> deform<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.499> may<00:02:25.620> not<00:02:25.829> last<00:02:26.099> for<00:02:26.430> a

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
bend or deform it may not last for a

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.970 
bend or deform it may not last for a
very<00:02:26.519> long<00:02:26.849> time<00:02:26.879> so<00:02:27.420> that's<00:02:28.139> why<00:02:28.409> I<00:02:28.469> went<00:02:28.920> with

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
very long time so that's why I went with

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.619 
very long time so that's why I went with
these<00:02:29.189> now<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.639> that<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:29.939> case<00:02:30.120> I<00:02:30.389> don't<00:02:30.540> know

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
these now is that the case I don't know

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.390 
these now is that the case I don't know
maybe<00:02:30.900> they<00:02:31.109> are<00:02:31.260> maybe<00:02:31.590> they<00:02:31.709> can<00:02:31.889> last<00:02:32.040> fine

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
maybe they are maybe they can last fine

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.039 
maybe they are maybe they can last fine
but<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.909> just<00:02:33.030> seemed<00:02:33.209> like<00:02:33.239> this<00:02:33.540> was<00:02:33.750> an

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
but it just seemed like this was an

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.770 
but it just seemed like this was an
extra<00:02:34.530> guarantee<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.540> nothing's<00:02:36.540> going<00:02:36.719> to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
extra guarantee of nothing's going to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.409 
extra guarantee of nothing's going to
basically<00:02:37.260> get<00:02:37.500> banned<00:02:37.950> or<00:02:38.159> warp<00:02:38.430> here<00:02:38.790> over

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:39.419 
basically get banned or warp here over

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.020 
basically get banned or warp here over
time<00:02:39.659> and<00:02:40.079> here<00:02:40.739> we<00:02:40.829> have<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.069> rear<00:02:41.340> camber

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
time and here we have the rear camber

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.759 
time and here we have the rear camber
kit<00:02:42.329> so<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.689> will<00:02:42.870> be<00:02:43.109> the<00:02:43.290> upper<00:02:43.680> control

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
kit so this will be the upper control

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.659 
kit so this will be the upper control
arm<00:02:44.219> for<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.609> rear<00:02:44.819> of<00:02:45.090> an<00:02:45.840> acura<00:02:46.139> integra<00:02:46.669> and

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:47.669 
arm for the rear of an acura integra and

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:49.190 
arm for the rear of an acura integra and
so<00:02:47.969> basically<00:02:48.299> it's<00:02:48.510> just<00:02:48.599> a<00:02:48.810> threaded<00:02:49.169> rod

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
so basically it's just a threaded rod

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.220 
so basically it's just a threaded rod
you<00:02:49.739> can<00:02:49.769> rotate<00:02:50.069> it<00:02:50.280> to<00:02:50.939> the<00:02:51.060> length<00:02:51.269> that<00:02:51.540> you

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
you can rotate it to the length that you

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.500 
you can rotate it to the length that you
want<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.829> set<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.069> camber<00:02:53.400> at<00:02:53.549> now<00:02:54.150> if<00:02:54.389> you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
want to set the camber at now if you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.149 
want to set the camber at now if you
lower<00:02:54.659> your<00:02:54.870> vehicle<00:02:55.230> significantly<00:02:55.829> and<00:02:56.040> you

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
lower your vehicle significantly and you

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.220 
lower your vehicle significantly and you
have<00:02:56.310> too<00:02:56.489> much<00:02:56.639> negative<00:02:57.060> camber<00:02:57.239> why<00:02:58.019> would

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
have too much negative camber why would

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.110 
have too much negative camber why would
you<00:02:58.290> want<00:02:58.469> to<00:02:58.530> get<00:02:58.620> rid<00:02:58.799> of<00:02:58.859> that<00:02:59.040> well<00:02:59.549> several

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
you want to get rid of that well several

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.970 
you want to get rid of that well several
things<00:03:00.359> if<00:03:00.599> you<00:03:00.689> have<00:03:00.719> too<00:03:00.930> much<00:03:01.079> camber<00:03:01.379> first

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
things if you have too much camber first

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.170 
things if you have too much camber first
of<00:03:02.099> all<00:03:02.189> you're<00:03:02.310> going<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.459> have<00:03:02.579> uneven<00:03:02.879> tire

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
of all you're going to have uneven tire

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.699 
of all you're going to have uneven tire
wear<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.840> since<00:03:04.109> the<00:03:04.230> tire<00:03:04.409> is<00:03:04.469> going<00:03:04.500> to<00:03:04.620> be

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
wear so since the tire is going to be

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.309 
wear so since the tire is going to be
resting<00:03:05.159> on<00:03:05.250> that<00:03:05.430> inner<00:03:05.609> edge<00:03:05.959> or<00:03:06.959> putting

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
resting on that inner edge or putting

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.259 
resting on that inner edge or putting
primarily<00:03:08.280> most<00:03:08.519> of<00:03:08.669> the<00:03:08.730> weight<00:03:08.969> on<00:03:09.120> that

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
primarily most of the weight on that

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:10.849 
primarily most of the weight on that
inner<00:03:09.449> edge<00:03:09.599> that<00:03:10.109> inner<00:03:10.319> edge<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.680> going<00:03:10.799> to

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
inner edge that inner edge is going to

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.229 
inner edge that inner edge is going to
wear<00:03:11.040> more<00:03:11.250> than<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.549> other<00:03:11.669> side<00:03:11.909> so<00:03:12.150> you'll

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
wear more than the other side so you'll

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.509 
wear more than the other side so you'll
have<00:03:12.389> uneven<00:03:12.750> tire<00:03:13.139> wear<00:03:13.199> also<00:03:13.739> you're<00:03:14.430> going

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
have uneven tire wear also you're going

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.280 
have uneven tire wear also you're going
to<00:03:14.609> have<00:03:14.669> reduced<00:03:15.000> traction<00:03:15.629> because<00:03:16.139> you're

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
to have reduced traction because you're

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.589 
to have reduced traction because you're
going<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.439> have<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.680> smaller<00:03:17.489> contact<00:03:18.060> patch<00:03:18.299> or

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
going to have a smaller contact patch or

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.199 
going to have a smaller contact patch or
more<00:03:19.259> of<00:03:19.349> your<00:03:19.470> weight<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:19.949> a<00:03:19.979> smaller<00:03:20.340> contact

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
more of your weight on a smaller contact

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.449 
more of your weight on a smaller contact
patch<00:03:21.419> on<00:03:21.689> the<00:03:22.109> ground<00:03:22.379> and<00:03:22.650> because<00:03:23.310> you've

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
patch on the ground and because you've

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.429 
patch on the ground and because you've
got<00:03:23.639> less<00:03:23.849> traction<00:03:24.449> then<00:03:24.870> you're<00:03:25.290> going<00:03:25.379> to

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:25.439 
got less traction then you're going to

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:27.559 
got less traction then you're going to
have<00:03:25.590> reduced<00:03:25.829> braking<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.579> if<00:03:27.000> your<00:03:27.120> vehicle

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
have reduced braking and if your vehicle

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.080 
have reduced braking and if your vehicle
is<00:03:27.780> traction<00:03:28.139> limited<00:03:28.620> because<00:03:29.489> your<00:03:29.790> tire

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
is traction limited because your tire

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.819 
is traction limited because your tire
spin<00:03:30.449> if<00:03:30.629> you<00:03:30.720> accelerate<00:03:31.049> then<00:03:31.560> you're<00:03:31.709> also

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
spin if you accelerate then you're also

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.969 
spin if you accelerate then you're also
going<00:03:32.009> to<00:03:32.069> reduce<00:03:32.220> your<00:03:32.669> acceleration<00:03:33.979> and

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
going to reduce your acceleration and

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:36.319 
going to reduce your acceleration and
that<00:03:35.099> one<00:03:35.250> other<00:03:35.370> thing<00:03:35.759> that<00:03:35.790> could<00:03:36.180> happen

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
that one other thing that could happen

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.599 
that one other thing that could happen
is<00:03:36.659> your<00:03:37.139> tires<00:03:37.409> who<00:03:37.650> tend<00:03:37.889> to<00:03:37.919> follow<00:03:38.099> grooves

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
is your tires who tend to follow grooves

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.640 
is your tires who tend to follow grooves
in<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.879> road<00:03:39.090> if<00:03:39.659> all<00:03:39.870> the<00:03:39.989> weights<00:03:40.169> in<00:03:40.349> one

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
in the road if all the weights in one

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.949 
in the road if all the weights in one
very<00:03:41.129> narrow<00:03:41.400> spot<00:03:41.819> it'll<00:03:42.569> just<00:03:42.750> kind<00:03:42.900> of

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
very narrow spot it'll just kind of

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.199 
very narrow spot it'll just kind of
follow<00:03:43.169> the<00:03:43.379> road<00:03:43.530> more<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.400> why<00:03:44.939> might<00:03:45.180> you

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
follow the road more so why might you

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.780 
follow the road more so why might you
want<00:03:45.359> some<00:03:46.019> negative<00:03:46.470> camber<00:03:46.709> well<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.519> can

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
want some negative camber well it can

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.119 
want some negative camber well it can
help<00:03:48.030> in<00:03:48.209> certain<00:03:48.509> situations<00:03:49.049> for<00:03:49.680> example

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
help in certain situations for example

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.309 
help in certain situations for example
for<00:03:50.579> cornering<00:03:50.970> speeds<00:03:51.329> when<00:03:51.689> you're<00:03:51.900> going

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
for cornering speeds when you're going

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.920 
for cornering speeds when you're going
all<00:03:52.530> out<00:03:52.739> in<00:03:53.370> cornering<00:03:54.209> basically<00:03:54.629> taking

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
all out in cornering basically taking

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.349 
all out in cornering basically taking
the<00:03:54.989> high<00:03:55.109> g-force<00:03:55.620> turns<00:03:55.919> so<00:03:56.579> here<00:03:57.060> we've<00:03:57.209> got

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
the high g-force turns so here we've got

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.689 
the high g-force turns so here we've got
we're<00:03:57.870> looking<00:03:58.109> at<00:03:58.229> two<00:03:58.379> tires<00:03:58.650> one<00:03:59.280> without

00:03:59.689 --> 00:03:59.699 
we're looking at two tires one without

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:01.309 
we're looking at two tires one without
any<00:03:59.909> camber<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:00.449> one<00:04:00.599> with<00:04:00.780> negative<00:04:01.109> camber

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
any camber and one with negative camber

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.110 
any camber and one with negative camber
we're<00:04:01.739> going<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:01.919> be<00:04:02.009> taking<00:04:02.250> hard<00:04:02.519> right

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
we're going to be taking hard right

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.080 
we're going to be taking hard right
turns<00:04:03.449> or<00:04:03.689> turning<00:04:04.049> this<00:04:04.109> way<00:04:04.290> really<00:04:04.469> hard

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
turns or turning this way really hard

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.039 
turns or turning this way really hard
what's<00:04:06.090> going<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.239> happen<00:04:06.540> is<00:04:06.629> we've<00:04:06.780> got<00:04:06.930> this

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
what's going to happen is we've got this

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.529 
what's going to happen is we've got this
tire<00:04:07.259> here<00:04:07.590> on<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:08.579> left<00:04:08.819> and<00:04:09.000> this<00:04:09.150> tire<00:04:09.419> is

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:09.539 
tire here on the left and this tire is

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:11.569 
tire here on the left and this tire is
going<00:04:09.599> to<00:04:09.719> deform<00:04:10.229> as<00:04:10.530> you<00:04:11.069> throw<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.430> into

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
going to deform as you throw it into

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:13.969 
going to deform as you throw it into
that<00:04:11.789> turn<00:04:12.239> do<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.959> friction<00:04:13.379> with<00:04:13.949> the

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
that turn do the friction with the

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.920 
that turn do the friction with the
contact<00:04:14.430> patch<00:04:14.579> on<00:04:14.789> the<00:04:14.879> ground<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.629> as<00:04:15.780> it

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
contact patch on the ground so as it

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.959 
contact patch on the ground so as it
deforms<00:04:16.349> it's<00:04:16.739> kind<00:04:17.159> of<00:04:17.190> cut<00:04:17.400> it's<00:04:17.729> going<00:04:17.909> to

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:17.969 
deforms it's kind of cut it's going to

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:20.420 
deforms it's kind of cut it's going to
kind<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.269> end<00:04:18.570> up<00:04:19.019> leaning<00:04:19.709> over<00:04:19.949> towards<00:04:20.280> this

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
kind of end up leaning over towards this

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.550 
kind of end up leaning over towards this
sidewall<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.690> tires<00:04:21.900> been<00:04:22.109> a<00:04:22.139> deform

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
sidewall and the tires been a deform

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.520 
sidewall and the tires been a deform
kind<00:04:22.770> of<00:04:22.830> how<00:04:22.889> I<00:04:22.919> marked<00:04:23.370> here<00:04:23.550> in<00:04:23.669> red

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
kind of how I marked here in red

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.800 
kind of how I marked here in red
and<00:04:24.920> part<00:04:25.220> of<00:04:25.250> the<00:04:25.340> contact<00:04:25.700> patch<00:04:25.880> may<00:04:26.420> even

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
and part of the contact patch may even

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.140 
and part of the contact patch may even
be<00:04:26.930> lifted<00:04:27.290> up<00:04:27.410> off<00:04:27.560> of<00:04:27.650> the<00:04:27.980> ground<00:04:28.010> if<00:04:29.000> you

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
be lifted up off of the ground if you

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.520 
be lifted up off of the ground if you
corner<00:04:29.420> hard<00:04:29.690> enough<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.080> you've<00:04:30.170> got<00:04:30.320> enough

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
corner hard enough and you've got enough

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.250 
corner hard enough and you've got enough
grip<00:04:30.910> so<00:04:31.910> obviously<00:04:32.360> you<00:04:32.780> don't<00:04:32.960> want<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.140> run

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
grip so obviously you don't want to run

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.660 
grip so obviously you don't want to run
onto<00:04:33.530> your<00:04:33.650> side<00:04:33.860> well<00:04:34.040> they<00:04:34.250> weren't<00:04:34.400> meant

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
onto your side well they weren't meant

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.060 
onto your side well they weren't meant
for<00:04:35.230> running<00:04:36.230> on<00:04:36.320> the<00:04:36.440> ground<00:04:36.650> that's<00:04:36.890> why

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
for running on the ground that's why

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.410 
for running on the ground that's why
they're<00:04:37.280> on<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.490> sides<00:04:37.730> of<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.030> tire<00:04:38.210> and

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
they're on the sides of the tire and

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.630 
they're on the sides of the tire and
also<00:04:38.990> with<00:04:39.410> a<00:04:39.440> smaller<00:04:39.710> contact<00:04:40.220> patch<00:04:40.400> you're

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
also with a smaller contact patch you're

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.990 
also with a smaller contact patch you're
going<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:40.820> have<00:04:40.940> less<00:04:41.150> grip<00:04:41.620> so<00:04:42.620> if<00:04:43.160> you<00:04:43.820> have<00:04:43.970> a

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
going to have less grip so if you have a

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.280 
going to have less grip so if you have a
negative<00:04:44.360> camber<00:04:44.600> this<00:04:44.930> is<00:04:45.050> slightly

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
negative camber this is slightly

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.680 
negative camber this is slightly
exaggerated<00:04:46.070> but<00:04:46.280> it's<00:04:46.850> just<00:04:47.030> illustrating<00:04:47.630> a

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
exaggerated but it's just illustrating a

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.300 
exaggerated but it's just illustrating a
point<00:04:47.960> if<00:04:48.200> you<00:04:48.470> have<00:04:48.560> this<00:04:48.680> negative<00:04:48.890> camber

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
point if you have this negative camber

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.100 
point if you have this negative camber
and<00:04:49.670> you<00:04:49.970> throw<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.300> into<00:04:50.420> a<00:04:50.510> hard<00:04:50.720> right<00:04:50.870> turn

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
and you throw it into a hard right turn

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.040 
and you throw it into a hard right turn
as<00:04:51.350> that<00:04:51.860> tire<00:04:52.130> deforms<00:04:52.700> it<00:04:52.910> actually<00:04:53.660> evens

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
as that tire deforms it actually evens

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.230 
as that tire deforms it actually evens
out<00:04:54.200> the<00:04:54.260> contact<00:04:54.770> patch<00:04:55.040> perfectly<00:04:56.030> with<00:04:56.180> the

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
out the contact patch perfectly with the

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.330 
out the contact patch perfectly with the
ground<00:04:56.540> so<00:04:56.990> at<00:04:57.140> a<00:04:57.170> certain<00:04:57.380> point<00:04:57.560> there's

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
ground so at a certain point there's

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.160 
ground so at a certain point there's
going<00:04:58.460> to<00:04:58.520> be<00:04:58.610> a<00:04:58.670> certain<00:04:58.940> angle<00:04:59.300> which<00:04:59.600> if<00:04:59.840> you

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
going to be a certain angle which if you

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.170 
going to be a certain angle which if you
have<00:05:00.410> go<00:05:00.710> around<00:05:00.920> the<00:05:01.010> corner<00:05:01.280> let's<00:05:01.400> say<00:05:01.640> your

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
have go around the corner let's say your

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.810 
have go around the corner let's say your
cart<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:02.480> handle<00:05:02.810> at<00:05:02.930> 1g<00:05:03.320> turn<00:05:03.650> well<00:05:04.190> at<00:05:04.340> 1g

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
cart and handle at 1g turn well at 1g

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.820 
cart and handle at 1g turn well at 1g
your<00:05:05.330> tire<00:05:05.570> will<00:05:05.930> deform<00:05:06.350> a<00:05:06.440> certain<00:05:06.710> amount

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
your tire will deform a certain amount

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.380 
your tire will deform a certain amount
and<00:05:07.040> you'll<00:05:07.130> want<00:05:07.250> to<00:05:07.340> set<00:05:07.520> your<00:05:07.610> camera<00:05:07.820> so

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:08.390 
and you'll want to set your camera so

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.690 
and you'll want to set your camera so
that<00:05:08.420> it<00:05:08.750> deforms<00:05:09.260> the<00:05:09.350> exact<00:05:09.800> amount<00:05:10.100> so<00:05:10.550> that

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
that it deforms the exact amount so that

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.220 
that it deforms the exact amount so that
doesn't<00:05:10.940> run<00:05:11.240> on<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.480> the<00:05:11.570> sidewall<00:05:11.990> at<00:05:12.110> all

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
doesn't run on to the sidewall at all

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.470 
doesn't run on to the sidewall at all
and<00:05:12.440> it<00:05:12.500> just<00:05:12.650> has<00:05:12.770> a<00:05:12.800> perfectly<00:05:13.340> flat<00:05:13.610> full

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:14.480 
and it just has a perfectly flat full

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.750 
and it just has a perfectly flat full
width<00:05:14.780> of<00:05:14.810> the<00:05:15.080> tire-contact<00:05:15.320> patch<00:05:15.680> so<00:05:16.669> you

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
width of the tire-contact patch so you

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.730 
width of the tire-contact patch so you
have<00:05:16.880> maximum<00:05:17.360> traction<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:18.020> Google<00:05:18.500> around

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
have maximum traction and Google around

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.650 
have maximum traction and Google around
the<00:05:18.830> corner<00:05:19.130> at<00:05:19.220> the<00:05:19.280> greatest<00:05:19.669> speed<00:05:19.970> now

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
the corner at the greatest speed now

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.900 
the corner at the greatest speed now
like<00:05:21.169> I<00:05:21.350> said<00:05:21.620> this<00:05:21.800> is<00:05:21.980> for<00:05:22.130> high<00:05:22.340> g-force

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
like I said this is for high g-force

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.250 
like I said this is for high g-force
turns<00:05:23.240> this<00:05:23.480> isn't<00:05:23.810> something<00:05:23.960> you're<00:05:24.140> just

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
turns this isn't something you're just

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.870 
turns this isn't something you're just
going<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:24.500> be<00:05:24.590> doing<00:05:24.860> driving<00:05:25.370> around<00:05:25.490> on<00:05:25.760> the

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:25.880 
going to be doing driving around on the

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.860 
going to be doing driving around on the
roads

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
roads

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.659 
roads
you<00:05:27.200> know<00:05:27.320> on<00:05:27.500> your<00:05:27.530> way<00:05:27.710> to<00:05:27.770> the<00:05:27.950> grocery<00:05:28.100> so
