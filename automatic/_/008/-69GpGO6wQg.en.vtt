Boston pianos of course are designed by

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.400 
Boston pianos of course are designed by
Steinway<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.219> they<00:00:52.219> contain<00:00:52.930> so<00:00:53.930> many<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.289> the

Steinway and they contain so many of the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.389 
Steinway and they contain so many of the
features<00:00:54.620> that<00:00:55.609> have<00:00:55.820> made<00:00:56.090> Steinway<00:00:56.690> an

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
features that have made Steinway an

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:06.340 
features that have made Steinway an
international<00:00:58.510> synonym<00:00:59.510> for<00:00:59.859> quality<00:01:05.350> the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
international synonym for quality the

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.380 
international synonym for quality the
sensitivity<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.310> Boston<00:01:07.730> action<00:01:08.090> is<00:01:08.210> due

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
sensitivity of the Boston action is due

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.030 
sensitivity of the Boston action is due
to<00:01:08.510> the<00:01:08.630> fact<00:01:08.870> that<00:01:08.960> they<00:01:09.170> incorporate<00:01:09.770> a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
to the fact that they incorporate a

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.060 
to the fact that they incorporate a
reciprocal<00:01:10.880> spring<00:01:11.210> and<00:01:11.630> that's<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.800> feature

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
reciprocal spring and that's a feature

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.070 
reciprocal spring and that's a feature
that<00:01:13.190> you<00:01:13.400> find<00:01:13.700> in<00:01:13.880> of<00:01:14.120> course<00:01:14.150> the<00:01:14.570> Steinway
