00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 now come to one of the most important and 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.350
 most interesting features of chessbase 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.849
 namely the batch analysis created 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.830
 There are different possibilities for you 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.410
 disposal you can whole parts 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.450
 analyze or even single position 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.130
 For example, I have one here 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.320
 called party 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.580
 and if they look more closely 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.720
 then go up to analysis 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.210
 and here you can see that you have different 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.029
 possibilities of analysis has for once 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.529
 with let's check relative analysis or 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.340
 the cloud analysis 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.110
 if you click on let's check here 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.000
 and then the one on the pc 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.160
 installed standard engine loaded that 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.469
 is here for 13 the stop right now 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.879
 examines what is more important 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.070
 this window here 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.200
 because here you can see that this position 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.910
 previously from other chess engines 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.920
 evaluated was examined 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.379
 Here you can see the deep and deep 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.629
 which sahin that is of course has the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.250
 Advantage that you will not stay here for much longer 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.930
 You can count on it 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.850
 Click the part and you can 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.549
 accordingly the rating 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.650
 the other stalls to take over what 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.210
 of course very fast a very big one 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.100
 Time saving is when I am so 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.979
 Here you continue through Clique you always see 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.750
 bottom right as the individual chess 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.229
 engines have rated this position 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.540
 and maybe someday 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.590
 point comes here as for example the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.540
 so far not a chess 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.909
 engine was tried then you can 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.720
 the once your own ratings 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.520
 take over 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.600
 this is a possibility, for example 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.920
 to examine the whole with let's check 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.360
 But there is also the possibility of 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.909
 depth analysis, I'll click now 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.360
 fritz Herzog produces chessbase here 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.750
 now a variant tree in the fritz 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.700
 13 calculates at the position and the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.040
 best trains then what filters on the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.079
 But he is always the whole man 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.079
 continue to advance into the position 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.800
 Last but not least there is the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.660
 still analyze the cloud analysis that is 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.830
 the most effective form of analysis never 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.930
 Do you have the possibility with 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.280
 different chess engines one 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:12.410
 to examine the position 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.270
 they can use engines on the one hand 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.700
 which are installed on your computer 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.950
 of course has the disadvantage that that very much 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.080
 you can devour many resources 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.550
 but engines are also using it 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.890
 different computers are installed 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.530
 or that are available on the internet 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.200
 that is best that you first the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.590
 Engines Rhine invites you to go on 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.790
 then you will be able to open cloud engines 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.340
 connected to the server click on ok and 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.990
 Here you can see the available 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.870
 standing champions 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.820
 I'll tell you this at this one 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.320
 location 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.720
 and here you can see that up here 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.550
 fastest computers are here, it is for 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.530
 for example, a decline in traffic and me 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.120
 would like to use this now around the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.840
 to analyze the position then I click 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:04.700
 but on it and practically wants the 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.650
 but it requires one engine 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.640
 certain account balance that one too 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.010
 can fill 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.090
 I click ok and now this will be 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.010
 engine reserved for me 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.030
 I'll take another one for example 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.930
 I go back to the engine on the houdini 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.060
 loading confirm with ok and this too 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.660
 or reserved and you can see them now 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.540
 below 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.980
 Houdini and decline now count 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.980
 practically already on the spot 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:39.000
 now i can analyze the cloud with the cloud 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.480
 Of course I can control both 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.250
 add a third engine and the 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.280
 third one gets the third engine 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.460
 by clicking on start and then on 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.380
 to pick up kibiz click and click 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.070
 Here you can then the on the pc locally 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.410
 click on installed fritz 13 engine 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.600
 and now you actually have three 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.710
 different engines one currently 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.110
 to calculate 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.780
 here you can still do the tasks of 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.900
 to share engines one goes to analysis 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.870
 goes on cloud analysis and looks here 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.430
 All three engines are the first to go 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.250
 example fritz 13 does the analysis 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.950
 control recalculated to candidates 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.560
 trains and udine anticipates the answers 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.960
 on it and swap these three engines 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.600
 among themselves information from that 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.230
 a very effective analysis of the position 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:34.620
 takes place so you can so games and 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.200
 analyze position in fritz in jazz 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:40.380
 Here you can still see the rating 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.210
 the analysis that has resulted is momentary 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.570
 So pretty balanced 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.820
 yes that is so far to the analysis function 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.380
 at dead space 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.660
 so we have all the important ones so far 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.520
 features and features are presented and 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:55.850
 I wish you a lot of fun with that 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.850
 program
