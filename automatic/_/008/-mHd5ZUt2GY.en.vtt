00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.230
 United States is concerned about the military technological advance of Russia 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.790
 titzina so declares a representative of the doors to elias of the country 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.039
 North American 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.560
 the official said that washinton still retains its primacy but will be 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.409
 for a short period 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.529
 also the officer who has experience piloting aranade 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.709
 Soviets assured that both Russia and China are able to create 

00:00:26.709 --> 00:00:28.399
 excellent fabian 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:32.180
 it is possible to change the distribution of military power is related to 

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:37.360
 the creation of fifth-generation fighters the Russian its rocket 50 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.210
 and Chinese eye 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.430
 in which 50 made its first flight in January 2010 is expected to be in 2015 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.650
 active part of the Russian army 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.700
 some experts believe that this Russian design could revolutionize the 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 geopolitics in the Asia-Pacific region 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.989
 the fulcrum the lieutenant general 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.490
 third market will go 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.770
 that exceeds says chief of staff of the air force 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.860
 for this operations plans and requirements 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.540
 and it was what he was referring yesterday before the congress was not specified 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.750
 that the advantage is well the judge who has had total united states 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.060
 in aircraft technology invisible to radar 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.340
 an advantage he has had since the late 70's 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.760
 you can the one that will not last p well forever 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.670
 the mji what he was saying was that so much russia 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.620
 with his humor the project of the pact 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.660
 percent is a prototype of 3 50 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.250
 and the Chinese with the chengdu are reaching is deep 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.370
 since he gave after he said he said no 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.810
 russia india india for example 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.329
 They are therefore making great strides in the development of aircraft 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.710
 contepec did not look like invisibility closes the sale of parks in invisible 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.820
 to the radar according to my studies and research 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.840
 The Russian plane seems to be very advanced even 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.280
 to be like its designers have said no to the press afterwards it could be 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.510
 be even more advanced in some aspects and at least equal to this 22 that 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.850
 the current merican fifth generation airplane pi also according to level 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.310
 technical aspirations the Chinese plane invisible to the radar has a lot of 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.390
 Russian technology actually seems that Russia has helped the Chinese be that 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.780
 plane and it will be like that no formidable plane the Chinese plane 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.140
 thanks to this Russian technology now when the Russian plane enters 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.070
 service the Chinese plane it is possible that that domain of the f 22 america does not end 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.180
 and Russia, because it would be the one that would export its model, which is going to be exported to India 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.910
 that is known I have been able to export it to other countries it for example Algeria by 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.239
 export spokesperson can export from indonesia 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.269
 that could certainly affect negatively affect for states 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.089
 united the geostrategic balance in the region
