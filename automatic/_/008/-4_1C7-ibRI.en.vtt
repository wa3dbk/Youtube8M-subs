00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.560
 You're teaching me another little model of 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.389
 I've painted these lines here with 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.309
 Peta da lapa the genius I'm going to make a 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.960
 stripped just in this line just to see you 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.420
 how does it effect 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.359
 I'll use the enamel simply help 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.949
 I'm going to use a blue flower top beauty 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:28.890
 also closed top beauty and I will use the 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:31.619
 petal I passed the enamels on the sponge 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.610
 sponge is that sponge I have in the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.829
 virtual store that is the beauty I'll do 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.030
 once again responsible when more 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:46.920
 Sometimes making the picture looks more beautiful 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.260
 I will make the ink that is blue is 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.600
 arabesque I'll teach you a 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:57.660
 A little different will only give 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.500
 pat on the nail with the sponge is 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.500
 Now I'm going to give this one a go. 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.920
 is base is the launch of the top beauty base 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920
 Matte 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.159
 I'm going to get the matt base on top while 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.630
 dry I'll do drawing in the other 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.799
 lines that I had already passed the base 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.820
 Matte 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:26.009
 here I did not blow fluff 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:28.560
 base the paintbrush will work the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.869
 three zeros brush that is the cable brush 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.229
 gray he does not need to adapt he's coming 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.380
 you do not have to cut it and the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.570
 ink and it is this here is turquoise blue is 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.369
 very beautiful color of her I put a 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.689
 little bit of ink here on paper 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.689
 butter 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.100
 have to work with a brush on pecs 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.229
 work with the brush lying on the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.390
 ranking stays clear on the nail I go 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.450
 get on top of the nail 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:59.759
 I'll start with the arabesque do not need 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.689
 stay the same as the other is doing 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.689
 different 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:13.120
 not only by my client who coughed 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.569
 goes only by splicing the other 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:24.610
 brush is done with a brush in 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:27.569
 skin looks pretty right there goes 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.569
 to be suffocated 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:41.920
 Let's go there again, continuing 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:43.780
 arabesque here I'll start up there has 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.140
 that leaving a space in this age of supposition 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.910
 that later we make leaf in them soybean 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.850
 difference of working with the brush 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.220
 standing and the brush lying down works with 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.390
 a paintbrush standing or a blue came out a blue 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:04.959
 very dark, very beautiful, here it goes. 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:07.959
 in each other and is already pulling the brush 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:10.209
 this brush 00 and it did not have as if 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.840
 had a pen in his hand he is very good 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:18.549
 to work very easy 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:20.799
 Now I'll make it here on this beautiful side. 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:25.230
 is that you do not have to do 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:28.810
 one like the other here we go only by amending 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.239
 and the detail now to make of the leaves 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.280
 I'll just do it here in the corner. 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.549
 Now I'm going to clean the ink brush and 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.280
 I'm going to take the intense blue farm that is the 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.530
 quinta da nature colors that is already 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.500
 painted here on paper and I'll do it 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.900
 leaflets can not do with a 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.850
 ranking has to be with the ink with 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.950
 she's not sure and not staying 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.019
 cute 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:04:00.400
 so between these arabesques I go 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:04:02.200
 only completing making the sheets not 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.900
 You need to fill a lot of little leaf no 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.000
 you have to do a lot 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:11.290
 I'm going to work here with the fifth 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.099
 blue just as wrong just doing the end here 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.049
 a little thicker wherever you want 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.829
 starting the arabesque 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.639
 just to be funny in points 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.770
 In this one I left ready now I 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:33.030
 I'm just going to do it here. 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.030
 the drops here 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:42.340
 here just filling it looks only effect 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.020
 beautiful, I'll make just one more 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.780
 nail to you 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:50.860
 learn a little more brush 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.520
 in the ranking after that nail that I only 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.520
 take off the excess 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:58.900
 I always start there on top of the nail 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.909
 because of that I am distributing arabesque 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.560
 I'll already have an idea how I'm going 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:07.270
 making them down and if they had not 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.219

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.680
 wake her up for ice 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:43.680
 how much more about working with a brush and 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:47.969
 the more firm it is, the more beautiful it gets here 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.969

 where you have a space that you have seen with 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.969
 a large space can be filled with 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:19.189
