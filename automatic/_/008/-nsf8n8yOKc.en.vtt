enable<00:00:02.970> Wi-Fi<00:00:03.600> tethering<00:00:04.290> on<00:00:04.940> iphone<00:00:05.940> 4s<00:00:06.420> that

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
enable Wi-Fi tethering on iphone 4s that

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.379 
enable Wi-Fi tethering on iphone 4s that
don't<00:00:07.529> allow<00:00:07.649> because<00:00:08.309> some<00:00:08.550> carriers<00:00:08.970> around

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
don't allow because some carriers around

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.839 
don't allow because some carriers around
the<00:00:09.480> world<00:00:09.800> actually<00:00:10.800> block<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.460> unless<00:00:11.670> you

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
the world actually block it unless you

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.690 
the world actually block it unless you
have<00:00:11.940> a<00:00:11.969> higher<00:00:12.269> data<00:00:12.599> plan<00:00:13.190> so<00:00:14.190> you'll<00:00:14.429> see

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
have a higher data plan so you'll see

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.609 
have a higher data plan so you'll see
when<00:00:14.880> I<00:00:14.910> go<00:00:15.120> into<00:00:15.240> settings<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.350> set<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.859> a

when I go into settings to set it up a

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.490 
when I go into settings to set it up a
general<00:00:19.619> network<00:00:22.039> and<00:00:23.039> then<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.310> click<00:00:23.550> setup

want I have a 500 megabyte data plan and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.470 
want I have a 500 megabyte data plan and
to<00:00:43.680> enable<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.309> tethering<00:00:44.730> they<00:00:45.000> actually

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
to enable the tethering they actually

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.240 
to enable the tethering they actually
want<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.020> gigabyte<00:00:46.620> data<00:00:46.980> plan

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
want you to have gigabyte data plan

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.779 
want you to have gigabyte data plan
which<00:00:47.489> actually<00:00:47.730> cost<00:00:48.120> more<00:00:49.219> so<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> easy<00:00:50.579> way

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
which actually cost more so the easy way

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.110 
which actually cost more so the easy way
to<00:00:50.850> fix<00:00:51.120> this<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.899> have<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.140> be<00:00:52.230> jailbroken

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
to fix this you have to be jailbroken

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.680 
to fix this you have to be jailbroken
you<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.390> go<00:00:54.690> into<00:00:55.020> cydia<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.329> it's<00:00:57.329> called

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
you just go into cydia and it's called

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.220 
you just go into cydia and it's called
um<00:00:58.440> tether<00:00:59.280> me<00:00:59.789> there's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.870> bunch<00:01:01.109> of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
um tether me there's a bunch of

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.779 
um tether me there's a bunch of
different<00:01:01.289> sources<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.190> get<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.609> from

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
different sources you can get it from

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.020 
different sources you can get it from
i'll<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.420> list<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:05.339> description

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
i'll just list one in the description

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.780 
i'll just list one in the description
that<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.450> use<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.680> find<00:01:08.040> tether<00:01:08.400> me

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
that you can use so you find tether me

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.280 
that you can use so you find tether me
and<00:01:10.400> just<00:01:11.400> click<00:01:11.700> on<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.860> install<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:15.290> so

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
what this does it basically takes off

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.929 
what this does it basically takes off
the<00:01:18.840> restriction<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.680> your<00:01:20.009> carrier<00:01:20.490> put<00:01:20.790> on

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
the restriction that your carrier put on

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.719 
the restriction that your carrier put on
it<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.740> you'll<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.220> you'll<00:01:23.430> lose

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729

we'll just wait for it to finish you'll
see<00:01:37.710> at<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> top<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.729> actually<00:01:39.659> lost

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
see at the top that I actually lost

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:51.620 
see at the top that I actually lost
service

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.020 

so<00:01:52.290> when<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:52.920> done<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.130> just<00:01:53.430> respraying

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
so when it's done you just respraying

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.779 
so when it's done you just respraying
and<00:01:54.329> then<00:01:54.680> basically<00:01:55.680> everything<00:01:56.490> will<00:01:56.640> be

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
and then basically everything will be

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.139 
and then basically everything will be
fine<00:01:56.969> after<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.539> so<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.610> will<00:01:59.610> show<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.909> when

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.390 

okay<00:02:12.680> so<00:02:12.850> now<00:02:13.850> if<00:02:14.210> I<00:02:14.360> go<00:02:14.390> into<00:02:14.660> settings<00:02:15.400> you

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
okay so now if I go into settings you

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.700 
okay so now if I go into settings you
just<00:02:16.640> go<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.210> bottom<00:02:17.540> where<00:02:17.690> your<00:02:18.020> jailbreak

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
just go the bottom where your jailbreak

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.910 
just go the bottom where your jailbreak
settings<00:02:19.190> usually<00:02:19.580> are<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.240> click<00:02:20.480> on

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
settings usually are and you click on

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.710 
settings usually are and you click on
the<00:02:21.920> little<00:02:22.100> tether<00:02:22.700> me<00:02:23.000> thing<00:02:23.330> you'll<00:02:23.510> only

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
the little tether me thing you'll only

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.560 
the little tether me thing you'll only
have<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.960> do<00:02:24.140> this<00:02:24.320> once<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:26.030> just<00:02:26.240> switch

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
have to do this once and you just switch

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.630 
have to do this once and you just switch
personal<00:02:27.140> hotspot<00:02:27.380> on<00:02:27.920> and<00:02:28.880> then<00:02:29.870> I<00:02:30.370> use<00:02:31.370> Wi-Fi

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
personal hotspot on and then I use Wi-Fi

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.370 
personal hotspot on and then I use Wi-Fi
because<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:32.300> easier<00:02:32.630> but<00:02:32.810> you<00:02:32.870> can<00:02:33.020> also<00:02:33.170> use

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
because it's easier but you can also use

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.800 
because it's easier but you can also use
a<00:02:33.410> cable<00:02:33.710> if<00:02:34.040> you<00:02:34.160> want<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.520> save<00:02:35.150> some<00:02:35.180> battery

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
a cable if you want to save some battery

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.530 
a cable if you want to save some battery
the<00:02:36.080> USB<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:37.550> now<00:02:37.730> you'll<00:02:37.910> always<00:02:38.210> have<00:02:38.360> this

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
the USB so now you'll always have this

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.450 
the USB so now you'll always have this
little<00:02:38.810> personal<00:02:39.440> hotspot<00:02:39.590> thing<00:02:40.100> in<00:02:40.250> here

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
little personal hotspot thing in here
