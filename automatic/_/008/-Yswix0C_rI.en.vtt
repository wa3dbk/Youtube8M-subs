00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.429
 sort of the game's secret cars 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.670
 practical way and that I can 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.170
 I have done is constant since all the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.449
 cars will start here with you 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.310
 first in the center of the west, which is a 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.300
 easy you go first thing you 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.099
 they will have to do 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.460
 look for the antennas that I think 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.809
 I can not go wrong at 56 worth every state 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:37.860
 has one down has another three try 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.460
 another another here four to five 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.800
 is this is 5 until 2005 so far goes 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.370
 appear all car parts male 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.620
 flashes on the map and it's pretty easy already 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.829
 opened then it's going to stay for me it's going to happen 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.210
 the exact location where the piece is 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.870
 I will come here just to show you 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.039
 as that is the car part outta 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.039
 come in here this is good for you 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.939
 Where are you from? Where are you from? 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.140
 put the car Midwest not me 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.140
 I remember what it is but I'm going to dock or drug 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:30.000
 in the basics that only show you 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:35.759
 for barbarian white ac do not appear is 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.229
 that the first car is not the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.640
 first car left I think this one 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.619
 first car so the piece is no longer just 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.450
 the piece that has already collected the 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.429
 piece did not push the button not 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.750
 to do anything just to get to the foot 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:53.580
 request here already was already collected the piece 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.280
 are 20 feet in each state 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.060
 It's a little long there but it's 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.920
 one quite open already you find it fast 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.649
 I'll move on to the map here for you. 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.539
 More or less, where are you? It's here. 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.810
 far I'll go closer to see 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:14.819
 once again will vote the antennas and the pieces 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:17.100
 hotel oscar inn here is the species then it is 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.709
 It's very easy in time for you to have a face. 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.310
 Walking, it will take time to accept. 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.980
 Makes you happy, will you? 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.400
 like I 'm going to have to be and do not have a face 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.139
 I'm correct, it's not something I have to 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.209
 do what it does not have an open map 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:35.459
 I'll give you an explanation here. 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.130
 Fernando was saying that he is a play 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.120
 here in the middle he placed there pick up carol 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:44.359
 fast trip as close as possible 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.359
 fast travel 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.880
 or appeared there had my map as 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.270
 it was not 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.530
 now how will it be already opened in 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.390
 return 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.000
 So go there and begging to go to 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.160
 here to get Portuguese will get is 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.370
 important to react quickly and sharply 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.820
 maps that have the privilege points 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.680
 April 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.140
 the wave of chance that will open more 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.890
 map then it means that it is more 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.780
 Easy if you do not go naked by the same blow I did 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.120
 in the beginning first thing that the end of 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.110
 game was part program I thought 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:23.019

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.720

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.980
 carrying the teleport in place will leave in 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.420
 up the cone 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.340
 The only thing you'll have to do 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.930
 walk a little bit forward 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:06.850

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:52.960
 tell if it's just the way everything goes from 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:59.389
 order that will find the car the kind of 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:03.770
