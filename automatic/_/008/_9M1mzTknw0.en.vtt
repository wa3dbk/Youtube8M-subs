00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello dear people today I introduce myself 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.349
 the question why you have two and no 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.160
 other games such as or has 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.889
 and I have to say I know both 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.350
 because I have betrayed both 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.189
 games as well because I believe in the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.949
 900 played and later also runs and 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.220
 everything and I compare it for the most part 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.380
 follower I just think that just the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:34.170
 Most of you have played this once 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.489
 was just simply known great and I 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.989
 always the same for me too 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.000
 main reason is me or two 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.540
 It's just that you want to play a lot 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.239
 have more possibilities and how 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.370
 already said comparison with lol and the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.090
 Zimmer assumed he was buying the salary as 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.980
 support award so and yes heavy 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.449
 really map control have everything and 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.149
 then you are there all the time 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.129
 Run around to the folder and can 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.449
 your part does not support it 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.309
 as well as i can for example here 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.640
 can buy word then so beautiful 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.950
 my co the opponent 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.170
 and there are two signs offered 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.210
 bring or learn from the country and the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.790
 can then put the watts where 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.159
 I bought her what a good one 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.570
 Advantage or what you also as a support 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.250
 can or generally I can 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.530
 buy healing potions and you can afterwards 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.450
 my own people are still using it 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.759
 in addition to cure 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.789
 then there's a lot more 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.680
 possibilities simply by the through 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.539
 the dealers by that just 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.619
 different abilities have to 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.450
 for example have here then yes degree death 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.789
 two participants 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.319
 he is here now two beautiful 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.229
 ability with it he throws someone 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:49.590
 Just to the opponents and does that 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.590
 make a mistake and I have to say there 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.390
 besides the big advantage that easy 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.539
 makes more fun when playing in a team 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.610
 because if you look away, for example 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.280
 the wrong you throw that alone 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.509
 already is low and so then find 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.659
 I have been there simply more fun 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.039
 one can also do more nonsense 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.479
 should not you should not 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.030
 but if the game is already over 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.599
 or something else then you can do that 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.599
 let's do it 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.230
 moment 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:26.450
 and I'm just over it two 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.799
 simply the best of both horn 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.950
 as well as from and I have to say 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.069
 i play or two rather because of me 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.879
 just way too many ups are on the way 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:46.419
 therefore must indeed equal say a 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:49.340
 barely cheaper and bargain 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:51.079
 what is or advantage is just that rolf 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.930
 Rihs are so you can from the beginning 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.750
 take any hero because I say 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.569
 Maas said it was more balanced 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.359
 I'll say so compare nicely 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.889
 you have come to viral against it has come 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:08.030
 here I have to say if you are completely on 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:13.989
 Start until she costs you 450 in game 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.989
 points equality and that of 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.040
 She compares to them first 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.110
 costs in gamepoint 450 in the basket costs 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.670
 6300 that means too 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:34.170
 damn long until you introduce yourself 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.150
 can now only be accepted as we and 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.319
 Cork simply bot lane and grab it 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.350
 at the same time 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:42.480
 make cabbage out of the individual revolutions 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.040
 so a little harm corgi presses 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.600
 just e does with it is the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.540
 I already know that to 100 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.280
 percent mark wins if you do not 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.870
 we are really good with her 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.850
 is recorded and really knows 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.980
 properly meat must go or that you 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.430
 on the one hand have to go already 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.840
 Do not say that to me 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.400
 is really balanced and what 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.980
 next to it from my side was me or 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.230
 two players are just abysmal for me 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.760
 and I want it just once is me so 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.769
 which reasons are interesting here 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.139
 From then on, I would like to be in the 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.940
 why you like the same or two 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.950
 want to play or already there to 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.950
 Play and have a nice day
