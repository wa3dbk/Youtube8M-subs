00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:03.860
 Honda and lowered to the next goal El 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.360
 he goes to the question how do we start to run when Windows 7 32 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.409
 gives the thesis are 64 bits 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:14.499
 as in my case, the only one is the PID 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:16.760
 and the Mel is in trouble 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.830
 The process to wear times Fuji stones start from the game respectively 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.849
 Hang them instead of a million tourists to speak 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.810
 the next work you can definitely do what 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.859
 Resolutions framerate 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.240
 the third work 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.950
 that the frame rate ever breaks down constantly and joined constantly 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.630
 adjusted after the game starts 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.080
 and the last one that works, not by the dew 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.270
 I've finally found you for all things for almost all things 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.710
 tih it is he Fruits because I have to say unfortunately that looks like this 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.800
 when he such 80 card fall a current ati-graphics card 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.270
 then she has detected the app at least each one so i got that 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.920
 game 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.750
 not brought to running 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.660
 I want to crash there in the start menu 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.950
 from the player himself 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.480
 stuck 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.440
 Saudi second did not run picture 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.420
 or sometimes 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.010
 start black Germany 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.730
 it looks very bad 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.720
 the citizens were to read one in the forums that is old 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.540
 to become the graphics card of the world 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.149
 it works 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.370
 However, you have a big problem 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.340
 almost no other game works anymore because most games 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.740
 but also men can operators 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.340
 In addition, York is quite risking a night shift in the crash so me 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.810
 was not very happy 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.190
 with the old three were 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.250
 He decided to record softly as the graphics card speaks out 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.330
 my laptop 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.340
 because radio, it is flawless 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.520
 are also some other solutions omega-3 and so on 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.020
 but as I said 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.160
 at mineral does not work 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.870
 should be the next that you can not make the setting 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.250
 or if you are 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.280
 stand now 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 Politically putting up emergency goes 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.940
 You can not adjust here 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.700
 including Frey World 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.319
 but you can call me at the Oakley Club's kath 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.909
 this is a relatively easy solution 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.329
 for the conversation this puts mountain service on edge 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.329
 and you can download them, for example, Vienna 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:27.229
 This succeeds in placing the four description 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.429
 there are times 

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:31.419
 at the image Stinauer 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.419
 the first, the last patches you should empty, by the way 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.779
 also the Zeitnot decided 

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:39.369
 it looks like that 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:41.079
 so that starts 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.419
 there you can adjust everything 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:47.319
 One can also save and the attentive observer will see this 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.739
 saves in systems here the return 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.429
 have on it has the graphics card 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.979
 I do not take the whole time and sometimes the door stood there it all works 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:59.330
 unfortunately not I show you the new year 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.330
 Pauli recorded everything to record 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.549
 then as it goes on, if the framerate I say that's special 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.129
 Soon, Bocholt releases starters so that you can get the frame rate with it 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.449
 good 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.939
 However, the players agree on the whole again completely adjusted 

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:21.099
 there's a solution to Arbon Worbis Basel, but I do not have to be that difficult 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:27.109
 here below dat whimsical Skylar 6 10 Belek 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.239
 because 70 percent TTL 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.329
 since Bussmann meditate so far 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.539
 As a precaution, GeForce always makes sure it makes a copy 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:40.039
 and then with the favored for the pie I will notepad ++ 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.499
 open 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:45.679
 and at this point it is at the top 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.009
 the script 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.999
 because Optics in Eat you can insert the following namely first time 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:52.909
 Performance optimist 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:55.959
 Macs RamÃ­rez 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.929
 30 for example leads 30 falls where she customer 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.929
 and if you also want to turn on Particle Fekter 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:03.540
 then 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.679
 Performance Warrants 

00:04:05.679 --> 00:04:07.989
 pa title 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.559
 1 

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:12.969
 I never want that as descriptors writer I could do the simple thing 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.859
 Copy 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.579
 Although Dorsten save the case then that's great 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.680
 And there was, in the end, the problem 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.080
 the derby makes the house so does the speech 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.949
 Not 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:31.110
 Speaking of music, the videos are running a lot of power 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.840
 for the 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.380
 when solution found him works by projecting everything was possible me 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.330
 I say that now 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.889
 which worked for me 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.010
 that was all she really was a six part 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.629
 Albrecht's war I made my own 

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:46.639
 7-seater on the shot just under presumably 

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:48.110
 Aden 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.310
 compatibility 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.930
 on 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.379
 put the XPS service pack 2 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.870
 and that should be important 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.110
 the Brickell met 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.860
 there same 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.350
 comes as Webservice Becht 2x please plug 2 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.599
 so that all problems should be solved 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.969
 if it still does not work 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.879
 Here you can write a comment 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:13.659
 maybe I still know something for you 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:14.819
 I'm gonna hurry 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:18.349
 the links to all possible sources on all the above I know in the 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:21.669
 Write comments because there could be Serbian mills there 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:25.089
 possible other solution approaches for me, as I said not 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.960
 have worked 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.389
 for me it all seems very much that i have shown myself now 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.780
 yes then i would say what is her opinion all love the good 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.060
 Until next time 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.870
