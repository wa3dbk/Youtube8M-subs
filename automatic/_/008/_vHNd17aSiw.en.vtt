I'm going to hit f9 with our

201<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:12.480> you'll<00:02:12.660> see

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
201 and you'll see

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.830 
201 and you'll see
it<00:02:14.340> renders<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:15.000> at<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.269> anti-aliasing

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
it renders it at the anti-aliasing

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.750 
it renders it at the anti-aliasing
setting<00:02:16.230> of<00:02:16.349> one<00:02:16.590> so<00:02:17.069> it's<00:02:17.220> kind<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.519> grainy

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
setting of one so it's kind of grainy

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.580 
setting of one so it's kind of grainy
and<00:02:18.180> then<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:20.090> starts<00:02:21.090> looking<00:02:21.689> at<00:02:22.049> which

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and then it starts looking at which

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.080 
and then it starts looking at which
parts<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.069> image<00:02:23.310> need<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.670> be<00:02:23.790> smoothed

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
parts of the image need to be smoothed

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.940 
parts of the image need to be smoothed
out<00:02:24.269> more<00:02:24.599> and<00:02:24.870> then<00:02:24.989> it<00:02:25.110> starts<00:02:25.500> tackling

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
out more and then it starts tackling

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.449 
out more and then it starts tackling
those<00:02:26.129> and<00:02:26.480> every<00:02:27.480> single<00:02:28.069> adaptive<00:02:29.069> sampling

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
those and every single adaptive sampling

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.880 
those and every single adaptive sampling
pass<00:02:29.670> takes<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.359> progressively<00:02:31.109> longer<00:02:31.620> amount

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.559 
pass takes a progressively longer amount
of<00:02:31.950> time<00:02:32.010> because<00:02:32.519> it's<00:02:32.730> doubling<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.329> number

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569

our scene I know I'm just reading what
it<00:03:53.909> says<00:03:54.120> on<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.449> interface<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.229> it's<00:03:55.530> you

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
it says on the interface so it's you

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.800 
it says on the interface so it's you

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.319 
set my minimum samples to 1 and my
maximum<00:04:06.599> samples<00:04:07.139> to<00:04:07.290> 1<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.799> my<00:04:08.669> shading

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
maximum samples to 1 and my shading

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.270 
maximum samples to 1 and my shading
samples<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.840> 1<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.169> my<00:04:10.229> light<00:04:10.500> samples<00:04:10.949> to<00:04:11.099> 1

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
samples to 1 and my light samples to 1

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.310 
samples to 1 and my light samples to 1
and<00:04:11.579> now<00:04:11.609> I<00:04:11.729> basically<00:04:12.299> have<00:04:13.699> no<00:04:15.019> no<00:04:16.019> shading

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
and now I basically have no no shading

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.969 
and now I basically have no no shading
going<00:04:16.680> on

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
going on

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.520 
going on
no<00:04:17.130> no<00:04:17.760> anti-aliasing<00:04:18.630> happening<00:04:19.079> at<00:04:19.349> all

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
no no anti-aliasing happening at all

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.349 
no no anti-aliasing happening at all
anywhere<00:04:20.099> in<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.459> program<00:04:20.820> so<00:04:21.000> you<00:04:21.090> can<00:04:21.209> see

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
anywhere in the program so you can see

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.870 
anywhere in the program so you can see
our<00:04:21.510> shadows<00:04:21.989> look<00:04:22.320> really<00:04:23.190> rough<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.760> our

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
our shadows look really rough and our

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.900 
our shadows look really rough and our
shading<00:04:24.330> on<00:04:24.419> our<00:04:24.539> cube<00:04:24.840> looks<00:04:25.050> really<00:04:25.380> rough

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
shading on our cube looks really rough

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.330 
shading on our cube looks really rough
and<00:04:26.000> of<00:04:26.750> course<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.290> know<00:04:27.380> our<00:04:27.680> edges<00:04:28.190> are

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
and of course you know our edges are

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.540 
and of course you know our edges are
Jaggi<00:04:28.760> but<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.120> image<00:04:29.480> is<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:30.290> noisy<00:04:30.860> we<00:04:31.310> can't

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
Jaggi but the image is so noisy we can't

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.000 
Jaggi but the image is so noisy we can't
even<00:04:31.730> tell<00:04:31.940> how<00:04:32.210> Jaggi<00:04:32.540> our<00:04:32.780> images<00:04:33.140> are<00:04:33.320> so

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
even tell how Jaggi our images are so

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.310 
even tell how Jaggi our images are so
let<00:04:34.400> me<00:04:34.490> change<00:04:34.700> my<00:04:35.000> lighting<00:04:35.540> samples<00:04:35.960> or<00:04:36.170> my

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
let me change my lighting samples or my

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.620 
let me change my lighting samples or my
shading<00:04:36.620> samples<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.160> eight<00:04:37.390> I'll<00:04:38.390> just<00:04:38.510> hit

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
shading samples to eight I'll just hit

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.790 
shading samples to eight I'll just hit
render<00:04:38.900> so<00:04:39.020> you<00:04:39.080> can<00:04:39.200> see<00:04:39.350> what<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.500> looks

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
render so you can see what that looks

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.950 
render so you can see what that looks
like<00:04:39.860> it's<00:04:40.580> grainy<00:04:41.180> but<00:04:41.510> it's<00:04:41.660> much<00:04:41.810> better

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
like it's grainy but it's much better

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.840 
like it's grainy but it's much better
than<00:04:42.170> it<00:04:42.230> was<00:04:42.350> you<00:04:42.590> can<00:04:42.710> actually<00:04:42.830> see<00:04:43.400> what's

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
than it was you can actually see what's

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.500 
than it was you can actually see what's
going<00:04:44.060> on<00:04:44.120> now

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
going on now

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.860 
going on now
let<00:04:45.110> me<00:04:45.170> change<00:04:45.320> my<00:04:45.500> light<00:04:45.740> samples<00:04:46.160> to<00:04:46.310> eight

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
let me change my light samples to eight

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.510 
let me change my light samples to eight
these<00:04:47.870> are<00:04:47.930> the<00:04:48.170> default<00:04:48.500> settings<00:04:48.560> these<00:04:49.460> are

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
these are the default settings these are

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.160 
these are the default settings these are
set<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:49.940> eight<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.330> can<00:04:50.390> see<00:04:50.630> it<00:04:50.780> looks<00:04:50.900> pretty

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.170 
set to eight you can see it looks pretty

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.700 
set to eight you can see it looks pretty
decent

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
decent

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.470 
decent
I<00:04:51.740> mean<00:04:52.070> it's<00:04:52.190> grainy<00:04:52.520> but<00:04:53.150> it's<00:04:53.300> pretty

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
I mean it's grainy but it's pretty

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.360 
I mean it's grainy but it's pretty
decent<00:04:56.200> just<00:04:57.200> notice<00:04:57.590> the<00:04:57.620> level<00:04:58.010> of

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
decent just notice the level of

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.160 
decent just notice the level of
graininess<00:04:58.820> that<00:04:59.150> there<00:04:59.330> is<00:04:59.510> right<00:04:59.780> now<00:04:59.930> I'm

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
graininess that there is right now I'm

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.630 
graininess that there is right now I'm
going<00:05:00.320> to<00:05:00.380> change<00:05:00.680> these<00:05:00.920> settings<00:05:00.980> back<00:05:01.610> to

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
going to change these settings back to

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.140 
going to change these settings back to
one<00:05:02.260> remember<00:05:03.260> that<00:05:03.380> looks<00:05:03.740> terrible<00:05:04.150> I'm

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
one remember that looks terrible I'm

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.960 
one remember that looks terrible I'm
gonna<00:05:05.360> change<00:05:05.600> my<00:05:06.550> maximum<00:05:07.550> samples<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:09.080> eight

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
gonna change my maximum samples to eight

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.100 
gonna change my maximum samples to eight
what<00:05:10.970> it's<00:05:11.090> doing<00:05:11.330> now<00:05:11.360> is<00:05:11.510> it's<00:05:11.780> going

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
what it's doing now is it's going

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.540 
what it's doing now is it's going
through<00:05:12.290> the<00:05:12.440> adaptive<00:05:12.950> sampling<00:05:13.340> process

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
through the adaptive sampling process

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.910 
through the adaptive sampling process
and<00:05:14.060> it's<00:05:14.330> bringing<00:05:14.630> all<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.350> those<00:05:15.470> noisy

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
and it's bringing all of those noisy

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.390 
and it's bringing all of those noisy
areas<00:05:16.280> up<00:05:16.460> to<00:05:16.520> a<00:05:17.090> sample<00:05:17.450> setting<00:05:17.930> of<00:05:18.110> eight

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
areas up to a sample setting of eight

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.310 
areas up to a sample setting of eight
you<00:05:19.400> know<00:05:19.490> and<00:05:19.670> making<00:05:19.850> sure<00:05:20.060> it's<00:05:20.300> sampled<00:05:21.080> to

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
you know and making sure it's sampled to

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
you know and making sure it's sampled to
eight<00:05:21.530> times<00:05:22.210> so<00:05:23.210> that<00:05:23.870> looks<00:05:24.290> pretty<00:05:24.770> similar

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
eight times so that looks pretty similar

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.430 
eight times so that looks pretty similar
to<00:05:25.700> what<00:05:26.000> we<00:05:26.390> had<00:05:26.630> here<00:05:28.450> only<00:05:29.450> now<00:05:29.630> our<00:05:29.960> edges

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 
to what we had here only now our edges

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.350 
to what we had here only now our edges
are<00:05:30.590> smooth<00:05:30.830> so<00:05:31.100> this<00:05:31.490> is<00:05:31.700> our<00:05:32.350> light<00:05:34.360> quality

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 
are smooth so this is our light quality

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.840 
are smooth so this is our light quality
setting<00:05:35.660> my<00:05:35.780> light<00:05:36.040> samples<00:05:37.040> set<00:05:37.460> to<00:05:37.670> eight

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
change my maximum samples back to one

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.810 
change my maximum samples back to one
and<00:05:56.380> I'm<00:05:57.380> gonna<00:05:57.470> set<00:05:57.650> my<00:05:57.680> minimum<00:05:58.250> samples<00:05:58.700> to

00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:58.820 
and I'm gonna set my minimum samples to

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.080 
and I'm gonna set my minimum samples to
eight<00:05:59.000> and<00:05:59.390> you'll<00:06:00.110> see<00:06:00.290> it's<00:06:00.530> pretty<00:06:00.800> much

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
eight and you'll see it's pretty much

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.320 
eight and you'll see it's pretty much
the<00:06:02.090> same<00:06:02.470> this<00:06:03.470> image<00:06:03.919> looks<00:06:04.550> the<00:06:04.850> same<00:06:05.030> as

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.840 
that image and that image looks pretty
close<00:06:08.870> to<00:06:09.080> this<00:06:09.169> image<00:06:09.470> except<00:06:09.860> now<00:06:10.130> our<00:06:10.340> with

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
close to this image except now our with

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:14.290 
close to this image except now our with
our<00:06:11.000> without<00:06:11.540> the<00:06:12.080> camera<00:06:12.830> samples<00:06:13.400> set<00:06:14.000> our

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
our without the camera samples set our

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.180 
our without the camera samples set our
edges<00:06:15.230> are<00:06:15.440> Jaggi<00:06:17.169> so<00:06:18.169> basically<00:06:18.830> the<00:06:19.070> upshot

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
edges are Jaggi so basically the upshot

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:23.220 
edges are Jaggi so basically the upshot
is<00:06:20.530> you<00:06:21.530> don't<00:06:21.710> necessarily<00:06:22.400> need<00:06:22.669> to<00:06:22.730> have

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:23.230 
is you don't necessarily need to have

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:26.909 
is you don't necessarily need to have

high<00:06:29.390> at<00:06:29.690> all<00:06:29.810> you<00:06:30.050> can<00:06:30.200> leave<00:06:30.320> them<00:06:30.470> set<00:06:30.710> to

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
high at all you can leave them set to

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.820

higher to two or three but you don't

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.230 
higher to two or three but you don't
really<00:06:36.710> need<00:06:36.919> them<00:06:37.070> at<00:06:37.190> 8<00:06:37.460> unless<00:06:37.880> you<00:06:38.030> run

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 
really need them at 8 unless you run

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.960 
really need them at 8 unless you run
into<00:06:38.390> a<00:06:38.419> particular<00:06:38.780> instance
