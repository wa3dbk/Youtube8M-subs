thing<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.730> then<00:00:33.380> I'm<00:00:34.380> gonna<00:00:34.530> draw

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
thing like that and then I'm gonna draw

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.410 
thing like that and then I'm gonna draw
the<00:00:34.829> cheeks<00:00:35.280> here<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:35.760> I'm<00:00:35.850> gonna<00:00:36.000> draw<00:00:36.210> them

the cheeks here but I'm gonna draw them
as<00:00:36.570> curly<00:00:37.020> wurly<00:00:37.410> z'<00:00:37.440> like<00:00:37.739> that<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.960> try<00:00:39.960> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
as curly wurly z' like that and try and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.209 
as curly wurly z' like that and try and
make<00:00:40.230> them<00:00:40.469> kind<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.129> similar<00:00:42.500> and<00:00:43.500> then<00:00:43.770> we'll

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
make them kind of similar and then we'll

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.709 
make them kind of similar and then we'll
draw<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.430> chin<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.489> bring<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.879> down<00:00:48.149> here

draw the chin and bring that down here

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.990 
draw the chin and bring that down here
and<00:00:48.930> again<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.160> curly<00:00:50.640> wurly

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and again to what kind of a curly wurly

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.020 
and again to what kind of a curly wurly
bear<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.940> another<00:00:54.239> curly<00:00:54.629> wurly<00:00:55.199> there<00:00:56.030> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
bear and another curly wurly there and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.229 
bear and another curly wurly there and
we<00:00:57.149> want<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.449> put<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.809> teeth<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.239> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
we want to put the teeth in here and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.549 
we want to put the teeth in here and
there's<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> really<00:01:00.539> easy<00:01:00.809> way<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.170> doing<00:01:01.440> that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
there's a really easy way of doing that

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.630 
there's a really easy way of doing that
so<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.829> draw<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> little

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
so you draw a little

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.100 
so you draw a little
it's<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.180> curved<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> line<00:01:06.110> like

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it's like curved and then a line like

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.570 
it's like curved and then a line like
that<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.710> really<00:01:07.890> want<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.340> kind<00:01:08.460> of

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that and you really want this to kind of

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.179 
that and you really want this to kind of
fit<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.030> space<00:01:09.830> and<00:01:10.830> then<00:01:12.229> draw<00:01:13.229> D<00:01:13.530> shapes<00:01:13.920> at

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
fit the space and then draw D shapes at

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.330 
fit the space and then draw D shapes at
the<00:01:14.280> end<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:16.860> shade<00:01:17.130> those

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
the end and you want to just shade those

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.550 
the end and you want to just shade those
in

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.630 

and<00:01:19.710> then<00:01:19.890> draw<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> teeth<00:01:22.159> and<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.340> can

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and then draw in the teeth and you can

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.969 
and then draw in the teeth and you can
do<00:01:25.760> them<00:01:26.760> like<00:01:26.940> that<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.420> want<00:01:27.630> or<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.530> just

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
do them like that if you want or to just

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.830 
do them like that if you want or to just
leave<00:01:29.220> them<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.580> whichever<00:01:30.330> way<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.570> want<00:01:30.780> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
leave them if whichever way you want to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.260 
leave them if whichever way you want to
do<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.610> and<00:01:32.610> then<00:01:32.759> we're<00:01:32.909> gonna<00:01:33.030> want

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
do it really and then we're gonna want

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.810 
do it really and then we're gonna want
nice<00:01:33.540> big<00:01:33.840> circles<00:01:34.350> for<00:01:34.530> eyes<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:38.550> a<00:01:38.580> kind

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
nice big circles for eyes and to a kind

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.600 
nice big circles for eyes and to a kind
of<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.970> heart<00:01:39.300> shape<00:01:39.659> for<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> nose<00:01:40.460> then<00:01:41.460> we're

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
of a heart shape for the nose then we're

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.980 
of a heart shape for the nose then we're
pretty<00:01:41.729> well<00:01:42.000> ready<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.390> start<00:01:42.600> putting<00:01:42.780> in

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
pretty well ready to start putting in

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.430 
pretty well ready to start putting in
the<00:01:43.080> pattern<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.649> what<00:01:43.799> I'm<00:01:43.890> going<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.070> do<00:01:44.250> is

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
the pattern so what I'm going to do is

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.840 
the pattern so what I'm going to do is
draw<00:01:46.440> an<00:01:46.830> in<00:01:47.070> line<00:01:47.460> there<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.630> circle<00:01:49.850> and

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
draw an in line there on that circle and

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.990 
draw an in line there on that circle and
put<00:01:51.119> lots<00:01:51.270> little<00:01:51.630> dots<00:01:51.869> all<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.380> way<00:01:52.470> around

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.310 

they're<00:01:57.000> not<00:01:57.149> gonna<00:01:57.300> fill<00:01:57.570> these<00:01:57.750> up<00:01:57.990> with

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
they're not gonna fill these up with

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.719 
they're not gonna fill these up with
stars<00:01:58.679> here<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.310> start<00:01:59.670> there<00:01:59.880> come<00:02:00.570> down<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
stars here so start there come down and

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.450 
stars here so start there come down and
straight<00:02:02.729> across<00:02:03.030> down<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.170> straight<00:02:05.159> across

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
straight across down and straight across

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.870 
straight across down and straight across
then<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> want<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.539> come<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:08.250> follow<00:02:08.640> that

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
then you want to come in and follow that

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.430 
then you want to come in and follow that
line<00:02:08.940> down<00:02:09.360> come<00:02:09.840> in<00:02:10.220> follow<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.550> line<00:02:11.819> down

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
line down come in follow that line down

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.630 
line down come in follow that line down
that<00:02:13.440> would<00:02:13.590> be<00:02:13.739> kind<00:02:14.130> of<00:02:14.160> going<00:02:14.370> straight

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
that would be kind of going straight

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.120 
that would be kind of going straight
across<00:02:14.940> there<00:02:15.420> that<00:02:16.380> will<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.680> going<00:02:16.800> straight

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
across there that will be going straight

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.949 
across there that will be going straight
across<00:02:17.280> there<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.850> fill<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.540> these<00:02:18.750> little

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
across there and fill in these little

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.780 
across there and fill in these little
spaces<00:02:21.380> then<00:02:22.380> we<00:02:22.560> come<00:02:22.769> here<00:02:23.010> we<00:02:23.220> come<00:02:23.250> down<00:02:23.610> at

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
spaces then we come here we come down at

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.270 
spaces then we come here we come down at
an<00:02:23.910> angle<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.420> straight<00:02:24.989> across<00:02:25.290> down<00:02:25.920> at<00:02:26.160> an

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
an angle and straight across down at an

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.300 
an angle and straight across down at an
angle<00:02:26.700> straight<00:02:27.420> across<00:02:27.769> and<00:02:28.769> this<00:02:28.950> will<00:02:29.100> come

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
angle straight across and this will come

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.550 
angle straight across and this will come
down<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:30.150> we<00:02:30.299> follow<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.750> line<00:02:31.170> straight

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
down and we follow that line straight

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.250 
down and we follow that line straight
down<00:02:31.590> there<00:02:32.239> we<00:02:33.239> come<00:02:33.420> down<00:02:33.630> there<00:02:33.930> follow

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
down there we come down there follow

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.800 
down there we come down there follow
that<00:02:34.530> line<00:02:34.769> down<00:02:35.040> again<00:02:35.459> follow<00:02:36.329> that<00:02:36.570> as<00:02:36.690> if

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
that line down again follow that as if

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.420 
that line down again follow that as if
it's<00:02:36.930> going<00:02:37.140> straight<00:02:37.500> across<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.950> that<00:02:38.100> point

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
it's going straight across to that point

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.920 
it's going straight across to that point
and<00:02:39.049> then<00:02:40.049> join<00:02:40.320> up<00:02:40.560> there<00:02:40.860> from<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.160> middle

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
and then join up there from the middle

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.660 
and then join up there from the middle
shade<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.079> between<00:02:46.250> you<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.400> make<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:47.640> just

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
shade in between you can make it just

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.910 
shade in between you can make it just
that<00:02:47.880> little<00:02:48.600> more<00:02:48.750> interesting<00:02:49.380> constantly

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
that little more interesting constantly

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.539 
that little more interesting constantly
adding<00:02:50.430> little<00:02:50.700> doodly<00:02:51.269> bits<00:02:51.570> by<00:02:52.549> putting

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
adding little doodly bits by putting

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.509 
adding little doodly bits by putting
little<00:02:54.470> lines<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.829> middle<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.220> star

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
little lines in the middle of the star

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.150 
little lines in the middle of the star
like<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:57.230> and<00:02:58.230> they're<00:02:58.380> not<00:02:58.470> gonna<00:02:58.650> fill<00:02:59.010> the

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
like that and they're not gonna fill the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.920 
like that and they're not gonna fill the
forehead<00:02:59.700> with<00:02:59.970> these<00:03:00.180> kind<00:03:00.480> of<00:03:00.540> star

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
forehead with these kind of star

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.630 
forehead with these kind of star
patterns<00:03:02.600> so<00:03:03.600> for<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.470> longer<00:03:04.890> line<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:05.459> then

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
patterns so for a longer line and then

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.699 
patterns so for a longer line and then
across<00:03:06.060> at<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.359> top<00:03:06.570> and<00:03:06.840> then<00:03:06.959> flick<00:03:07.350> out

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
across at the top and then flick out

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.160 
across at the top and then flick out
words<00:03:08.400> like<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.209> then<00:03:09.329> one<00:03:09.510> two<00:03:09.780> three

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
words like that and then one two three

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.120 
words like that and then one two three
four<00:03:10.560> five<00:03:10.980> six<00:03:11.340> seven<00:03:12.500> yeah<00:03:13.500> we'll<00:03:13.859> do<00:03:13.980> the

four five six seven yeah we'll do the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.170 
four five six seven yeah we'll do the
same<00:03:18.380> dot

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
same dot

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.289 
same dot
it's<00:03:21.599> another<00:03:21.810> one<00:03:21.989> in<00:03:22.140> here<00:03:22.970> they<00:03:23.970> might<00:03:24.150> need

it's another one in here they might need

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.910 
it's another one in here they might need
to<00:03:24.360> get<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.569> bit<00:03:24.780> smaller<00:03:25.140> is<00:03:25.319> he<00:03:25.439> here<00:03:25.650> around

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
to get a bit smaller is he here around

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.649 
to get a bit smaller is he here around
you<00:03:26.159> just<00:03:26.370> kind<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.700> think<00:03:27.360> that's<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.540> secret

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
you just kind of think that's the secret

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.530 
you just kind of think that's the secret
of<00:03:27.870> doodling<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.349> you<00:03:28.470> just<00:03:28.650> kind<00:03:28.799> of<00:03:28.920> fit<00:03:29.540> fit

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
of doodling is you just kind of fit fit

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.770 
of doodling is you just kind of fit fit
things<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.730> might<00:03:32.939> just<00:03:33.180> drive<00:03:33.420> fit<00:03:33.629> one

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
things in and I might just drive fit one

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.330 
things in and I might just drive fit one
in<00:03:33.930> down<00:03:34.110> here<00:03:34.409> as<00:03:34.560> well<00:03:36.110> flick-flick<00:03:37.340> another

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
in down here as well flick-flick another

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.720 
in down here as well flick-flick another
one<00:03:38.519> down<00:03:38.700> here<00:03:39.680> now<00:03:40.680> here<00:03:41.010> I'm<00:03:41.220> going<00:03:41.489> to<00:03:41.579> just

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
one down here now here I'm going to just

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.750 
one down here now here I'm going to just
go<00:03:42.689> around<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.439> outside<00:03:45.439> like<00:03:46.439> that<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.980> fill

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
go around the outside like that and fill

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.580 
go around the outside like that and fill
in<00:03:48.030> dots<00:03:48.450> again<00:03:50.780> money<00:03:51.780> what<00:03:51.989> the<00:03:52.109> beeping<00:03:52.409> is

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
in dots again money what the beeping is

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.170 
in dots again money what the beeping is
is<00:03:52.769> my<00:03:52.950> phone<00:03:54.349> and<00:03:55.400> what<00:03:56.400> can<00:03:56.670> we<00:03:56.760> do<00:03:56.909> something

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
is my phone and what can we do something

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.990 
is my phone and what can we do something
here<00:03:57.599> you<00:03:58.609> can<00:03:59.609> maybe<00:03:59.819> do<00:04:00.090> another<00:04:02.000> pattern

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
here you can maybe do another pattern

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.490 
here you can maybe do another pattern
like<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.209> maybe<00:04:03.659> make<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.049> dots<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.349> bit

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
like that maybe make the dots a bit

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.129 
like that maybe make the dots a bit
closer<00:04:04.799> around<00:04:05.069> that<00:04:05.370> one<00:04:05.579> and<00:04:06.480> then<00:04:06.720> here<00:04:07.109> I

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
closer around that one and then here I

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.059 
closer around that one and then here I
think<00:04:07.530> we<00:04:07.650> could<00:04:07.859> maybe<00:04:08.069> put<00:04:09.109> a<00:04:10.109> nice<00:04:10.379> gender

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
think we could maybe put a nice gender

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.080 
think we could maybe put a nice gender
moustache<00:04:11.670> curling<00:04:12.420> in<00:04:12.569> there<00:04:13.639> will<00:04:14.639> come<00:04:14.819> out

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
moustache curling in there will come out

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.729 
moustache curling in there will come out
that<00:04:15.359> way<00:04:16.729> and<00:04:17.729> around<00:04:18.060> there<00:04:18.389> then<00:04:19.349> I'm<00:04:19.500> going

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
that way and around there then I'm going

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.270 
that way and around there then I'm going
to<00:04:19.829> draw<00:04:20.579> an<00:04:21.209> outline<00:04:21.870> all<00:04:22.620> the<00:04:22.889> way<00:04:23.009> around

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
to draw an outline all the way around

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.409 
to draw an outline all the way around
the<00:04:23.370> outside<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:26.520> of<00:04:26.669> course<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.090> can<00:04:27.270> do

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
the outside and of course you can do

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.700 
the outside and of course you can do
whatever<00:04:27.630> pattern<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:28.410> like<00:04:28.639> with<00:04:29.639> in<00:04:29.820> here

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
whatever pattern you like with in here

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.810 
whatever pattern you like with in here
but<00:04:31.710> I'm<00:04:31.800> just<00:04:31.830> gonna<00:04:32.039> continue<00:04:32.490> with<00:04:32.729> this

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
but I'm just gonna continue with this

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.350 
but I'm just gonna continue with this
dot<00:04:33.240> kind<00:04:34.169> of<00:04:34.349> theme<00:04:34.620> because<00:04:35.550> it's<00:04:35.729> simple<00:04:36.210> I

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
dot kind of theme because it's simple I

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.420 
dot kind of theme because it's simple I
think<00:04:39.360> I'm<00:04:39.840> also<00:04:40.080> going<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.530> start<00:04:40.860> there<00:04:41.130> and

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
think I'm also going to start there and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.230 
think I'm also going to start there and
do<00:04:41.610> some<00:04:41.849> dots<00:04:42.120> in<00:04:42.539> these<00:04:42.990> spaces<00:04:44.120> and<00:04:45.120> I'm

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
do some dots in these spaces and I'm

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.760 
do some dots in these spaces and I'm
gonna<00:04:45.389> follow<00:04:45.720> that<00:04:45.990> around<00:04:46.380> there<00:04:48.440> and<00:04:49.440> bring

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
gonna follow that around there and bring

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.750 
gonna follow that around there and bring
it<00:04:49.919> down<00:04:50.159> into<00:04:51.030> these<00:04:51.389> little<00:04:51.659> curls<00:04:52.760> and

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
it down into these little curls and

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.260 
it down into these little curls and
again<00:04:54.060> started<00:04:54.570> in<00:04:54.630> the<00:04:54.690> middle<00:04:54.990> there<00:04:56.270> it's

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
again started in the middle there it's

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.760 
again started in the middle there it's
just<00:04:57.449> kind<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:57.840> making<00:04:58.199> it<00:04:58.470> a<00:04:58.560> bit<00:04:58.740> more

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
just kind of making it a bit more

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.120 
just kind of making it a bit more
interesting<00:04:59.550> I<00:05:00.409> don't<00:05:01.409> suddenly<00:05:01.590> adding

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
interesting I don't suddenly adding

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.960 
interesting I don't suddenly adding
pattern<00:05:02.699> to<00:05:02.849> it<00:05:03.740> and<00:05:04.740> then<00:05:04.949> here<00:05:05.190> again<00:05:05.460> we<00:05:05.789> can

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
pattern to it and then here again we can

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.870 
pattern to it and then here again we can
maybe<00:05:06.530> add<00:05:07.530> some<00:05:07.800> little<00:05:07.949> dots<00:05:08.250> there<00:05:08.490> it's

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
maybe add some little dots there it's

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.529 
maybe add some little dots there it's
just<00:05:09.060> kind<00:05:09.419> of<00:05:09.479> filling<00:05:09.780> in<00:05:09.990> spaces<00:05:10.620> I<00:05:11.539> can't

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
just kind of filling in spaces I can't

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.439 
just kind of filling in spaces I can't
more<00:05:12.690> interesting<00:05:13.380> so<00:05:14.159> I'm<00:05:14.400> gonna<00:05:14.610> go<00:05:14.880> and

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
more interesting so I'm gonna go and

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.700 
more interesting so I'm gonna go and
start<00:05:16.760> adding<00:05:18.199> mmm<00:05:19.199> what<00:05:19.380> would<00:05:19.470> you<00:05:19.560> call

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
start adding mmm what would you call

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.879 
start adding mmm what would you call
these<00:05:19.949> petals<00:05:20.690> lacy<00:05:21.690> bits<00:05:22.080> I<00:05:22.409> don't<00:05:22.680> know<00:05:22.740> what

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
these petals lacy bits I don't know what

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.640 
these petals lacy bits I don't know what
was<00:05:23.159> cool<00:05:23.510> and<00:05:24.510> I<00:05:24.659> think<00:05:24.900> you<00:05:25.020> can<00:05:25.199> then<00:05:25.380> just

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
was cool and I think you can then just

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.860 
was cool and I think you can then just
you<00:05:26.520> know<00:05:26.550> keep<00:05:26.940> working<00:05:27.539> your<00:05:27.690> way<00:05:27.720> around

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
you know keep working your way around

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.680 
you know keep working your way around
this<00:05:28.560> whole<00:05:29.310> shape<00:05:29.639> adding<00:05:30.180> and<00:05:30.300> adding<00:05:30.450> and

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
this whole shape adding and adding and

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.760 
this whole shape adding and adding and
let<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:30.960> expand

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.260 

and<00:05:34.770> then<00:05:36.590> I'm<00:05:37.590> gonna<00:05:37.740> put<00:05:37.979> this<00:05:38.189> sort<00:05:38.639> of<00:05:38.759> draw

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
and then I'm gonna put this sort of draw

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.179 
and then I'm gonna put this sort of draw
a<00:05:39.300> circle<00:05:39.749> and<00:05:39.840> then<00:05:40.050> kind<00:05:40.409> of<00:05:40.469> cut<00:05:40.680> in<00:05:40.830> on<00:05:41.009> it

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:41.189 
a circle and then kind of cut in on it

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:45.170 
a circle and then kind of cut in on it
and<00:05:41.370> then<00:05:41.460> that<00:05:41.639> will<00:05:42.590> add<00:05:43.590> a<00:05:43.620> bit<00:05:43.830> of<00:05:43.889> shade<00:05:44.879> on

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
and then that will add a bit of shade on

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.629 
and then that will add a bit of shade on
one<00:05:45.389> side<00:05:45.770> let's<00:05:46.770> make<00:05:46.919> it<00:05:46.949> stand<00:05:47.310> out<00:05:47.430> a<00:05:47.490> bit

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
one side let's make it stand out a bit

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.650 
one side let's make it stand out a bit
more

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.159 

and<00:05:51.660> I<00:05:51.750> think<00:05:51.990> I'm<00:05:52.139> gonna<00:05:52.289> finish<00:05:52.620> it<00:05:52.889> off<00:05:53.069> by

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
and I think I'm gonna finish it off by

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.290 
and I think I'm gonna finish it off by
continuing<00:05:55.169> this<00:05:55.440> cross<00:05:56.220> pattern<00:05:56.550> here<00:05:56.970> and

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
continuing this cross pattern here and

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.649 
continuing this cross pattern here and
I'm<00:05:57.389> gonna<00:05:57.509> go<00:05:57.720> all<00:05:57.960> the<00:05:57.990> way<00:05:58.909> I<00:05:59.909> bet<00:06:00.389> I'm<00:06:00.479> gonna

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
I'm gonna go all the way I bet I'm gonna

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:06.529 
I'm gonna go all the way I bet I'm gonna
start<00:06:00.990> on<00:06:01.259> the<00:06:02.419> outsides<00:06:03.419> them<00:06:03.599> come<00:06:03.870> in<00:06:05.539> no

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
start on the outsides them come in no

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:07.820 
start on the outsides them come in no
I'm<00:06:06.659> not<00:06:06.780> going<00:06:07.229> the<00:06:07.319> other<00:06:07.349> way

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
I'm not going the other way

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:11.480 
I'm not going the other way
hmm<00:06:09.319> so<00:06:10.319> you'll<00:06:10.530> get<00:06:10.620> a<00:06:10.680> point<00:06:10.889> there<00:06:11.250> rather

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
hmm so you'll get a point there rather

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.920 
hmm so you'll get a point there rather
than<00:06:11.669> uh<00:06:11.789> you<00:06:12.270> know<00:06:12.449> that's<00:06:12.659> the<00:06:12.720> kind<00:06:12.900> of

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
than uh you know that's the kind of

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.420 
than uh you know that's the kind of
round<00:06:13.199> end<00:06:13.440> and<00:06:13.620> when<00:06:13.710> you<00:06:13.800> flick<00:06:14.039> it<00:06:14.069> out<00:06:14.280> you

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
round end and when you flick it out you

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.920 
round end and when you flick it out you
might<00:06:14.550> get<00:06:14.699> a<00:06:14.759> point<00:06:15.060> like<00:06:15.300> I'm<00:06:15.479> getting<00:06:15.780> there

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
might get a point like I'm getting there

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.260 
might get a point like I'm getting there
but<00:06:16.050> it<00:06:16.139> doesn't<00:06:16.440> matter<00:06:16.620> and<00:06:17.400> then<00:06:17.610> I'm<00:06:18.150> gonna

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:18.270 
but it doesn't matter and then I'm gonna

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.870 
but it doesn't matter and then I'm gonna
put<00:06:18.509> a<00:06:18.539> little<00:06:18.690> cross<00:06:18.990> on<00:06:19.650> each<00:06:20.039> one<00:06:20.340> and<00:06:22.880> then

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 
put a little cross on each one and then

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.430 
put a little cross on each one and then
a<00:06:24.000> cross<00:06:24.330> inside<00:06:24.930> each<00:06:25.139> and<00:06:27.020> then<00:06:28.020> we<00:06:28.139> can<00:06:28.289> just

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
a cross inside each and then we can just

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.210 
a cross inside each and then we can just
get<00:06:28.560> a<00:06:28.620> little<00:06:29.430> dots<00:06:30.180> around<00:06:30.389> each<00:06:30.810> one<00:06:31.069> just<00:06:32.069> a

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
get a little dots around each one just a

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.640 
get a little dots around each one just a
so<00:06:32.340> kind<00:06:32.580> of<00:06:32.639> a<00:06:33.139> sparkle<00:06:34.139> I<00:06:36.380> want<00:06:37.380> to<00:06:37.470> put

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650 
so kind of a sparkle I want to put

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.320 
so kind of a sparkle I want to put
something<00:06:38.069> in<00:06:38.220> here<00:06:38.550> I<00:06:38.610> just<00:06:38.729> want<00:06:39.060> to<00:06:39.090> add

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
something in here I just want to add

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.450 
something in here I just want to add
something<00:06:39.690> I'm<00:06:39.900> just<00:06:39.930> gonna<00:06:40.169> bring<00:06:40.860> that<00:06:41.099> in<00:06:41.340> a

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
something I'm just gonna bring that in a

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:48.740 
something I'm just gonna bring that in a
bit<00:06:43.009> in<00:06:44.009> a<00:06:44.130> bit<00:06:44.310> there<00:06:45.289> and<00:06:46.289> I<00:06:47.389> didn't<00:06:48.389> make

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
bit in a bit there and I didn't make

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.779 
bit in a bit there and I didn't make
just<00:06:49.080> just<00:06:49.379> a<00:06:49.500> circle<00:06:50.129> or<00:06:50.250> something<00:06:50.639> and

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789 
just just a circle or something and

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:53.029 
just just a circle or something and
another<00:06:50.940> one<00:06:51.270> I<00:06:51.509> just<00:06:52.319> feel<00:06:52.620> it<00:06:52.740> needs<00:06:52.919> that

00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 
another one I just feel it needs that

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:55.219 
another one I just feel it needs that
little<00:06:53.129> space<00:06:53.550> filling<00:06:53.879> up<00:06:54.120> and<00:06:54.539> having<00:06:55.050> done

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:55.229 
little space filling up and having done

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:56.749 
little space filling up and having done
that<00:06:55.289> then<00:06:55.710> maybe<00:06:56.009> I<00:06:56.159> need<00:06:56.250> to<00:06:56.490> put<00:06:56.639> a<00:06:56.669> little

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 
that then maybe I need to put a little

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:00.499 
that then maybe I need to put a little
circle<00:06:57.300> there<00:06:57.330> as<00:06:57.930> well<00:06:58.169> I<00:06:58.440> take<00:06:58.650> me<00:06:58.800> a<00:06:59.509> circle

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.509 
circle there as well I take me a circle

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:03.890 
circle there as well I take me a circle
with<00:07:00.630> a<00:07:00.659> dot<00:07:00.900> in<00:07:01.139> so<00:07:01.469> this<00:07:02.069> is<00:07:02.219> just<00:07:02.900> finding

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:03.900 
with a dot in so this is just finding

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.420
