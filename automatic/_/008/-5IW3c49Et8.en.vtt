weight<00:01:17.119> just<00:01:18.119> because<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.659> wish<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.020> was<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
weight just because I wish it was a

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.719 
weight just because I wish it was a
little<00:01:19.229> more<00:01:19.680> along<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> weight<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
little more along the weight of the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.300 
little more along the weight of the
knives<00:01:21.740> themselves<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.920> way<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.159> could

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
knives themselves that way you could

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.850 
knives themselves that way you could
feel<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.700> little<00:01:23.790> more<00:01:24.090> realistic<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.990> other

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
feel a little more realistic but other

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.800 
feel a little more realistic but other

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
done I just wish the weight was a little

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.730 
done I just wish the weight was a little
more<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:58.670> line<00:01:59.000> of<00:01:59.299> as<00:01:59.509> far<00:01:59.840> even<00:01:59.990> an<00:02:00.439> actual

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
more in line of as far even an actual

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.819 
more in line of as far even an actual
knife<00:02:01.340> that<00:02:01.939> way<00:02:02.090> could<00:02:02.390> be<00:02:03.289> a<00:02:03.319> little<00:02:03.649> more

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
knife that way could be a little more

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.550 
knife that way could be a little more
realistic<00:02:04.250> but<00:02:05.149> can't<00:02:05.929> complain<00:02:06.259> too<00:02:06.530> much

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
realistic but can't complain too much
