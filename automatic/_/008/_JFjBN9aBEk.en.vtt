the curry it won't disintegrate your
curry<00:03:01.940> base<00:03:02.180> should<00:03:02.450> look<00:03:02.690> like<00:03:02.720> this<00:03:03.340> see

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340

curry base should look like this see
it's<00:03:04.940> a<00:03:05.120> red<00:03:05.510> it's<00:03:06.230> a<00:03:06.440> rich<00:03:06.709> color<00:03:07.280> not<00:03:08.150> too

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
it's a red it's a rich color not too

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.430 
it's a red it's a rich color not too
dark<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:09.769> can<00:03:10.040> see<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:11.420> curry<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:11.989> totally

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
water to it and now I'm going to let it

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.280 
water to it and now I'm going to let it
cook<00:03:24.310> once<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.519> pressure<00:03:25.790> builds<00:03:26.299> I'm<00:03:26.450> going

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
cook once the pressure builds I'm going

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.530 
cook once the pressure builds I'm going
to<00:03:27.410> put<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.769> on<00:03:28.010> medium<00:03:28.340> and<00:03:28.760> it's<00:03:29.180> going<00:03:29.420> to

to put it on medium and it's going to

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:37.280 
to put it on medium and it's going to
cook

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239
