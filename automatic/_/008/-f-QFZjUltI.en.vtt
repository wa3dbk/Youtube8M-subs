it's a large lemon you can just use half
of<00:01:31.360> a<00:01:31.450> lemon<00:01:31.630> or<00:01:31.900> if<00:01:32.020> it's<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.229> small<00:01:32.500> lemon<00:01:32.740> that

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:32.979 
of a lemon or if it's a small lemon that

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:35.670 
of a lemon or if it's a small lemon that
you<00:01:33.100> could<00:01:33.280> use<00:01:33.490> all<00:01:34.150> of<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.570> lemon<00:01:34.900> but<00:01:35.320> this

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
you could use all of the lemon but this

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.140 
you could use all of the lemon but this
seems<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:35.950> be<00:01:36.040> a<00:01:36.159> large<00:01:36.430> lemon<00:01:36.790> so<00:01:36.880> I'm<00:01:36.970> just

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
seems to be a large lemon so I'm just

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:43.980
