00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:39.370 

this<00:00:28.900> is<00:00:29.050> my<00:00:29.199> HTC<00:00:29.859> Wildfire<00:00:30.580> smartphone

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.660 

as<00:00:39.830> you<00:00:39.950> can<00:00:40.100> see<00:00:40.340> I<00:00:40.370> can<00:00:40.940> increase<00:00:41.600> the<00:00:44.020> image

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670

to<00:00:46.670> really<00:00:47.300> see<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:48.140> book

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.980 

and<00:00:58.100> what<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.130> do<00:00:59.250> like<00:00:59.640> is<00:01:00.320> it<00:01:01.320> has<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.990> option

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:03.990 
and what I do like is it has the option

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:12.950 
and what I do like is it has the option
to<00:01:06.530> go<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:10.100> further<00:01:11.100> pages<00:01:11.700> faster<00:01:12.420> it's

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
to go to further pages faster it's

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.790 
to go to further pages faster it's
actually<00:01:13.229> faster<00:01:13.710> than<00:01:13.950> my<00:01:14.220> nook<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.800> my

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
actually faster than my nook and my

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.469 
actually faster than my nook and my
other<00:01:16.979> e-readers<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.119> something

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
other e-readers and this is something

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:43.990 
other e-readers and this is something
that<00:01:21.510> my<00:01:21.810> nook<00:01:22.100> can't<00:01:23.100> do<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.580> rotates

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000
