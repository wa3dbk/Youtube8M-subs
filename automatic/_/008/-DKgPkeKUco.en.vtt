believe is going to help bring about not
only<00:02:51.250> innovation<00:02:52.000> per<00:02:52.299> se<00:02:52.540> but<00:02:53.349> it<00:02:53.709> weighs

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
only innovation per se but it weighs

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.500 
only innovation per se but it weighs
increase<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.609> world<00:02:54.760> can<00:02:55.030> actually<00:02:55.390> get

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
increase the world can actually get
