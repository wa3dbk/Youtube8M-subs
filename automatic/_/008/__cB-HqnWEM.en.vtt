five<00:00:57.390> hook<00:00:57.750> zones<00:00:58.050> five<00:00:58.440> yellow<00:00:58.649> zone<00:00:58.920> spread

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
five hook zones five yellow zone spread

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.760 
five hook zones five yellow zone spread
so<00:00:59.730> what<00:00:59.850> he's<00:00:59.969> saying<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.359> if<00:01:00.570> i<00:01:00.660> call<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.260> it's

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so what he's saying is if i call it it's

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.319 
so what he's saying is if i call it it's
gonna<00:01:01.920> look<00:01:02.010> like<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:02.730> if<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.120> call

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
gonna look like that but if I just call

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.299 
gonna look like that but if I just call
cover<00:01:03.570> two<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.780> then<00:01:03.989> i<00:01:04.019> manually<00:01:04.739> take<00:01:05.100> those

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
cover two and then i manually take those

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.770 
cover two and then i manually take those
two<00:01:05.519> flat<00:01:05.760> zones<00:01:06.000> you're<00:01:06.330> essentially<00:01:06.540> making

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
two flat zones you're essentially making

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.200 
two flat zones you're essentially making
your<00:01:07.020> own<00:01:07.049> cover<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.560> sink<00:01:08.070> which<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.060> is

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
your own cover to sink which one is

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.210 
your own cover to sink which one is
better<00:01:09.390> am<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:10.080> going<00:01:10.260> crazy<00:01:10.380> or<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.130> this

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
better am I going crazy or is this

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.960 
better am I going crazy or is this
really<00:01:11.490> happening<00:01:11.610> right<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:13.549> what<00:01:14.549> I<00:01:14.580> think

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
really happening right and what I think

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.749 
really happening right and what I think
is<00:01:15.150> with<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.689> cover<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.049> sink<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.549> I

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
is with the cover to sink you have I

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.730 
is with the cover to sink you have I
think<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.000> db's<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.720> better<00:01:19.049> chance<00:01:19.110> what

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
think the db's have a better chance what

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.469 
think the db's have a better chance what
you<00:01:19.830> saw<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.189> break<00:01:20.400> down<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.759> ball<00:01:20.970> at

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you saw there to break down the ball at

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.590 
you saw there to break down the ball at
least<00:01:21.630> from<00:01:21.750> my<00:01:21.810> experience<00:01:21.900> because<00:01:22.560> they

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
least from my experience because they

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.590 
least from my experience because they
fan<00:01:24.600> out<00:01:25.250> so<00:01:26.250> what<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.909> mean<00:01:27.000> by<00:01:27.060> fan<00:01:27.360> out<00:01:27.479> is

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
fan out so what I mean by fan out is

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.630 
fan out so what I mean by fan out is
look<00:01:27.750> at<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> look<00:01:28.799> where<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.009> hook<00:01:29.220> brings

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
look at the look where the hook brings

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.190 
look at the look where the hook brings
them<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.270> brings<00:01:30.450> them<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.689> sideline

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
them it brings them to the sideline

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.440 
them it brings them to the sideline
right<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.890> hook<00:01:32.070> brings<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.700> back<00:01:32.880> as<00:01:33.180> Blues

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
right the hook brings you back as Blues

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.780 
right the hook brings you back as Blues
Traveler<00:01:33.780> says<00:01:34.140> they<00:01:34.380> got<00:01:34.409> as<00:01:34.799> there<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.490> go<00:01:35.640> I

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
Traveler says they got as there you go I

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.120 
Traveler says they got as there you go I
like<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.119> so<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.079> see<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.409> hooks<00:01:37.619> fan

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
like that so you can see the hooks fan

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.340 
like that so you can see the hooks fan
out<00:01:38.159> where<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.090> called<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.600> cover<00:01:39.780> two<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
out where if I called the cover two and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.280 
out where if I called the cover two and
then<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.310> hot<00:01:41.579> route<00:01:41.820> them<00:01:42.000> in<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.170> see

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
then I hot route them in you can see

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.200 
then I hot route them in you can see
that<00:01:43.320> now<00:01:43.560> they<00:01:43.740> drop<00:01:44.220> straight<00:01:44.460> back<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:44.970> don't

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
that now they drop straight back I don't

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.230 
that now they drop straight back I don't
hate<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.479> but<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.840> think<00:01:46.130> in<00:01:47.130> my<00:01:47.280> studies<00:01:47.700> they

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
hate it but I think in my studies they

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.210 
hate it but I think in my studies they
have<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.390> better<00:01:48.540> chance<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:49.100> coming<00:01:50.100> down

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
have a better chance of coming down

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.490 
have a better chance of coming down
ville<00:01:50.579> he<00:01:51.180> made<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> play<00:01:51.540> there<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:51.899> he<00:01:52.380> was

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
ville he made a play there but he was

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.719 
ville he made a play there but he was
out<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.649> position<00:01:52.799> he<00:01:53.130> was<00:01:53.189> out<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.340> positions

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
out of position he was out of positions

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:54.859 
out of position he was out of positions
that<00:01:53.790> are<00:01:53.909> efficient<00:01:54.329> where<00:01:54.479> if<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.630> run<00:01:54.780> that

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
that are efficient where if you run that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.120 
that are efficient where if you run that
same<00:01:55.049> play<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.799> if<00:01:55.890> I'm<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
same play and I think if I'm in the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.380 
same play and I think if I'm in the
cover<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.460> sink<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:56.759> think<00:01:57.000> David<00:01:57.270> she's<00:01:57.360> a

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
cover to sink I think David she's a

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.639 
cover to sink I think David she's a
better<00:01:57.540> chance<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.840> breaking<00:01:58.110> down<00:01:58.409> on<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
better chance of breaking down on the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.350 
better chance of breaking down on the
ball<00:01:58.799> out<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.070> position<00:01:59.219> manitou<00:01:59.880> didn't<00:02:00.240> know

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
ball out of position manitou didn't know

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.810 
ball out of position manitou didn't know
you<00:02:00.630> got<00:02:00.750> drawn<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.829> that<00:02:01.860> well<00:02:02.340> one<00:02:02.670> thing

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
you got drawn I like that well one thing

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340 
you got drawn I like that well one thing
I<00:02:02.880> was<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.180> say<00:02:03.299> though<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.719> if<00:02:04.110> you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
I was going to say though is that if you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.880 
I was going to say though is that if you
did<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> cover<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.189> cover<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:06.060> as<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:07.710> ball

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
did do the cover to cover to as the ball

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.889 
did do the cover to cover to as the ball
takes<00:02:08.160> forever<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.459> reset<00:02:08.819> if<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.750> did<00:02:09.869> a

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
takes forever to reset if you just did a

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.530 
takes forever to reset if you just did a
rebase<00:02:10.470> line<00:02:10.770> if<00:02:11.099> you<00:02:11.910> don't<00:02:12.060> like<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.360> you

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
rebase line if you don't like that you

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.220 
rebase line if you don't like that you
could<00:02:12.660> just

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
could just

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.530 
could just
Rob<00:02:13.409> base<00:02:14.040> line<00:02:14.280> twice<00:02:14.580> it's<00:02:14.849> just<00:02:15.000> triangle

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
Rob base line twice it's just triangle

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.460 
Rob base line twice it's just triangle
and<00:02:15.659> you're<00:02:15.750> gonna<00:02:15.870> get<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.110> same<00:02:16.230> thing<00:02:16.379> as

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
and you're gonna get the same thing as

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.539 
and you're gonna get the same thing as
the<00:02:16.560> cover<00:02:16.680> to<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:16.830> triangle<00:02:17.190> left<00:02:17.370> in<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
the cover to the triangle left in the

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.110 
the cover to the triangle left in the
deep<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.819> triangle<00:02:19.190> left<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.400> d-pad<00:02:20.549> twice

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
deep a triangle left on the d-pad twice

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.809 
deep a triangle left on the d-pad twice
right<00:02:21.599> right<00:02:22.019> in<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.200> d-pad<00:02:22.440> twice<00:02:22.650> and<00:02:22.890> as

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
right right in the d-pad twice and as

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.430 
right right in the d-pad twice and as
you<00:02:24.209> see<00:02:24.360> here<00:02:24.540> this<00:02:24.629> guy<00:02:24.780> drifts<00:02:25.049> back<00:02:25.170> but

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
you see here this guy drifts back but

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.259 
you see here this guy drifts back but
generally<00:02:25.860> it's<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:26.159> to<00:02:26.220> spread<00:02:26.970> out<00:02:27.239> the

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
generally it's going to spread out the

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.360 
generally it's going to spread out the
zones<00:02:27.720> better<00:02:28.230> three<00:02:28.650> balance<00:02:29.040> down<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.280> the

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
zones better three balance down on the

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.460 
zones better three balance down on the
field<00:02:29.660> he's<00:02:30.660> actually<00:02:30.810> getting<00:02:31.019> drawn<00:02:31.349> in

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
field he's actually getting drawn in

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.070 
field he's actually getting drawn in
what<00:02:31.769> if<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:31.950> wow<00:02:32.220> he's<00:02:32.459> doing<00:02:32.910> he's<00:02:33.810> getting

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
what if I wow he's doing he's getting

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.449 
what if I wow he's doing he's getting
drum<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.349> thought<00:02:34.560> but<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:34.830> making<00:02:35.129> me<00:02:35.250> think

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
drum I thought but it's making me think

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.380 
drum I thought but it's making me think
that's<00:02:35.580> gonna<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.879> open<00:02:36.090> but<00:02:36.150> then<00:02:36.269> he's

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
that's gonna be open but then he's

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.050 
that's gonna be open but then he's
shooting<00:02:36.420> back<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.440> make<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.650> play<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.549> how

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
shooting back to make the play so how

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.460 
shooting back to make the play so how
about<00:02:39.120> that<00:02:39.239> try<00:02:39.569> that<00:02:39.720> one<00:02:39.870> again<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.260> don't

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
about that try that one again I don't

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.050 
about that try that one again I don't
think<00:02:40.650> he's<00:02:40.799> recognizing<00:02:41.190> the<00:02:41.370> flat<00:02:41.579> to<00:02:41.970> be

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
think he's recognizing the flat to be

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.539 
think he's recognizing the flat to be
honest<00:02:42.709> no<00:02:43.709> he<00:02:43.829> does<00:02:44.010> feel<00:02:44.220> like<00:02:44.340> there's<00:02:44.489> a

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
honest no he does feel like there's a

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.089 
honest no he does feel like there's a
window<00:02:44.819> where<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:44.970> can<00:02:45.150> make<00:02:45.269> the<00:02:45.420> throw<00:02:45.629> oh

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
window where I can make the throw oh

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.490 
window where I can make the throw oh
that's<00:02:47.099> interesting<00:02:47.629> it<00:02:48.629> was<00:02:48.930> like<00:02:49.079> you<00:02:49.319> think

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
that's interesting it was like you think

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.319 
that's interesting it was like you think
what<00:02:49.590> should<00:02:49.739> happen<00:02:49.890> on<00:02:50.160> on<00:02:50.430> last<00:02:50.760> gen<00:02:51.030> let<00:02:51.239> me

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
what should happen on on last gen let me

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.229 
what should happen on on last gen let me
try<00:02:51.959> look<00:02:52.170> like<00:02:52.290> cushion<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.819> think<00:02:53.819> on<00:02:53.940> next

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
try look like cushion I think on next

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.089 
try look like cushion I think on next
gen<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.599> you<00:02:54.930> want<00:02:55.230> to<00:02:55.470> you<00:02:55.739> want<00:02:55.769> the<00:02:56.069> hot

gen you you want to you want the hot
route<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.940> want<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.239> call<00:02:57.390> cover<00:02:57.599> two<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.840> hot

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
route you want to call cover two and hot

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.740 
route you want to call cover two and hot
route<00:02:58.230> absolutely<00:02:58.920> yeah<00:02:59.340> absolutely<00:02:59.970> all

routes<00:03:12.989> against<00:03:13.470> cover<00:03:13.680> too<00:03:13.890> right<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.549> don't

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
routes against cover too right I don't

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.210 
routes against cover too right I don't
say<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.780> it's<00:03:15.959> tough<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.290> beat<00:03:16.440> it's<00:03:16.980> it's

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
say it it's tough to beat it's it's

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.319 
say it it's tough to beat it's it's
super<00:03:17.549> easy<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:17.790> beat<00:03:17.910> if<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.090> know<00:03:18.209> it's

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
super easy to beat if you know it's

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.729 
super easy to beat if you know it's
covered<00:03:18.569> if<00:03:18.660> you<00:03:18.780> know<00:03:18.959> it<00:03:19.079> come<00:03:19.260> easier<00:03:19.620> it

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
covered if you know it come easier it

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.129 
covered if you know it come easier it
could<00:03:19.859> not<00:03:20.010> be<00:03:20.069> easier<00:03:20.819> right<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:21.480> if<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.900> mix

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
could not be easier right but if you mix

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.199 
could not be easier right but if you mix
it<00:03:22.230> in<00:03:22.349> but<00:03:23.040> in<00:03:23.250> with<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.549> flash<00:03:23.730> dropping

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
it in but in with the flash dropping

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:25.039 
it in but in with the flash dropping
like<00:03:24.299> we<00:03:24.450> talked<00:03:24.630> about<00:03:24.690> a<00:03:24.840> little<00:03:24.930> bit

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
like we talked about a little bit

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.349 
like we talked about a little bit
earlier<00:03:25.139> in<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.560> show<00:03:25.590> right<00:03:26.130> not<00:03:26.549> bad<00:03:26.790> right

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
earlier in the show right not bad right

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.159 
earlier in the show right not bad right
not<00:03:27.540> bad<00:03:27.599> so<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:29.579> cushion<00:03:30.419> coverage<00:03:30.690> sometimes

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
not bad so a cushion coverage sometimes

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.129 
not bad so a cushion coverage sometimes
you<00:03:31.349> know<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.500> do<00:03:32.250> things<00:03:32.459> in<00:03:32.669> a<00:03:33.139> cushion

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
you know you do things in a cushion

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.170 
you know you do things in a cushion
cover<00:03:34.349> just<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.739> makes<00:03:35.370> him<00:03:35.579> go<00:03:35.730> back<00:03:35.940> I<00:03:35.970> think

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
cover just is makes him go back I think

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.240 
cover just is makes him go back I think
whereas<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.900> another<00:03:37.829> thing<00:03:38.010> I<00:03:38.069> like<00:03:38.190> to

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
whereas like another thing I like to

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.970 
whereas like another thing I like to
about<00:03:38.579> the<00:03:38.760> hooks<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.269> would<00:03:40.260> say<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.620> if<00:03:40.859> you

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
about the hooks I would say is if you

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.759 
about the hooks I would say is if you
have<00:03:41.489> your<00:03:41.609> coverage<00:03:41.910> back<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.599> was<00:03:43.290> thinking<00:03:43.709> I

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
have your coverage back I was thinking I

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.289 
have your coverage back I was thinking I
was<00:03:43.859> gonna<00:03:43.919> happen<00:03:44.160> my<00:03:44.669> question<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.060> is<00:03:45.180> he

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
was gonna happen my question is is he

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.870 
was gonna happen my question is is he
gonna<00:03:45.419> run<00:03:45.690> in<00:03:45.930> now<00:03:46.139> and<00:03:46.380> then<00:03:46.799> go<00:03:47.220> back<00:03:47.400> no

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
gonna run in now and then go back no

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.210 
gonna run in now and then go back no
there's<00:03:48.150> no<00:03:48.900> but<00:03:49.290> then<00:03:49.410> there's<00:03:49.560> been<00:03:49.739> adrift

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
there's no but then there's been adrift

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.460 
there's no but then there's been adrift
so<00:03:50.489> let<00:03:50.639> me<00:03:50.730> see<00:03:50.880> if<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.090> hot<00:03:51.389> route<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.810> because

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
so let me see if I hot route it because

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.800 
so let me see if I hot route it because
if<00:03:52.769> I<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.340> back<00:03:53.609> them<00:03:53.790> up<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.480> see<00:03:54.660> how<00:03:54.750> the

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
if I if I back them up you see how the

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.319 
if I if I back them up you see how the
hook<00:03:55.200> everyone<00:03:55.769> wants<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.190> see<00:03:56.280> hooks<00:03:56.639> stay<00:03:57.090> in

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
hook everyone wants to see hooks stay in

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.020 
hook everyone wants to see hooks stay in
but<00:03:57.989> if<00:03:58.079> i<00:03:58.200> were<00:03:58.379> to<00:03:58.530> hot<00:03:58.859> route<00:03:59.099> them<00:03:59.310> he<00:03:59.790> kind

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
but if i were to hot route them he kind

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.360 
but if i were to hot route them he kind
of<00:04:00.120> goes<00:04:00.959> right<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.440> center<00:04:01.650> of<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.950> so<00:04:02.220> is

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
of goes right to the center of it so is

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.250 
of goes right to the center of it so is
there<00:04:02.519> a<00:04:02.549> difference<00:04:03.000> between<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.900> last<00:04:04.049> play

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
there a difference between the last play

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.599 
there a difference between the last play
in<00:04:04.379> this<00:04:04.500> play<00:04:05.569> it's<00:04:06.569> kinda<00:04:07.139> similar<00:04:07.739> similar

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
in this play it's kinda similar similar

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.819 
in this play it's kinda similar similar
they<00:04:08.849> repel<00:04:09.090> them<00:04:09.180> right<00:04:09.359> there<00:04:09.629> yeah<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:10.379> it

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
they repel them right there yeah so it

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.530 
they repel them right there yeah so it
it<00:04:11.579> doesn't<00:04:11.879> look<00:04:11.910> like<00:04:12.090> there's<00:04:12.269> much<00:04:12.299> of<00:04:12.419> a

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
it doesn't look like there's much of a

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.270 
it doesn't look like there's much of a
difference<00:04:12.930> at<00:04:13.410> least<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.739> this<00:04:13.859> next<00:04:14.069> Jenna
