we'll<00:00:08.849> work<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.630> create<00:00:09.960> procedural<00:00:10.740> shaders

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
we'll work to create procedural shaders

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.169 
we'll work to create procedural shaders
in<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.599> past<00:00:12.980> video<00:00:13.980> we<00:00:14.400> created<00:00:14.639> for

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
in the past video we created for

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.800 
in the past video we created for
citizens<00:00:16.340> some<00:00:17.340> procedural<00:00:18.000> rocks<00:00:18.390> just

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
citizens some procedural rocks just

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.200 
citizens some procedural rocks just
using<00:00:19.170> maps<00:00:19.560> as<00:00:19.939> procedural<00:00:20.939> maps

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
using maps as procedural maps

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.269 
using maps as procedural maps
displacement<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.289> something<00:00:22.650> like<00:00:22.680> that

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
displacement and something like that

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.870 
displacement and something like that
so<00:00:23.789> now<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.269> will<00:00:24.630> use<00:00:24.920> this<00:00:25.920> scene<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.640> create

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
so now we will use this scene to create

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.330 
so now we will use this scene to create
procedural<00:00:27.750> material<00:00:28.260> simulating<00:00:28.890> different

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
procedural material simulating different

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.930 
procedural material simulating different
rocks<00:00:29.640> or<00:00:31.610> fantasy<00:00:32.610> rocky<00:00:33.469> materials<00:00:34.940> we'll

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
rocks or fantasy rocky materials we'll

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.520 
rocks or fantasy rocky materials we'll
see<00:00:36.180> how<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.540> create<00:00:36.780> simple

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
see how to create simple

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.549 
see how to create simple
for<00:00:38.370> example<00:00:38.730> people<00:00:39.149> material<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.260> this

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
for example people material like this

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.760 
for example people material like this
one<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:41.520> we<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.850> some<00:00:42.210> rocky<00:00:42.930> material<00:00:43.620> like

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
one then we see some rocky material like

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.619 
one then we see some rocky material like
this<00:00:44.160> one<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.670> so<00:00:44.789> on<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.120> some<00:00:45.300> strange

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
this one and so on and some strange

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.319 
this one and so on and some strange
material<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:47.070> different<00:00:47.640> properties<00:00:48.030> like

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
material with different properties like

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.240 
material with different properties like
this<00:00:48.899> one<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.590> has<00:00:49.770> also<00:00:50.219> some<00:00:50.850> scattering

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
this one that has also some scattering

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.779 
this one that has also some scattering
properties<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.969> some<00:00:54.420> mineral<00:00:55.140> over<00:00:55.860> the

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
properties and some mineral over the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.139 
properties and some mineral over the
surface<00:00:57.260> so<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.590> obtain<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:59.039> scene<00:00:59.370> we'll<00:00:59.940> see

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
surface so to obtain the scene we'll see

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.660 
surface so to obtain the scene we'll see
step<00:01:00.510> by<00:01:00.539> step<00:01:01.050> how<00:01:01.320> to<00:01:01.350> create<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:02.160> material

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
step by step how to create this material

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.850 
step by step how to create this material
the<00:01:03.300> material<00:01:03.719> will<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.960> created<00:01:04.379> using<00:01:04.589> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the material will be created using a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.060 
the material will be created using a
v-ray<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.659> material<00:01:07.110> really<00:01:07.380> simple<00:01:07.860> so

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
v-ray but the material really simple so

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.240 
v-ray but the material really simple so
you<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.430> adapt<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.000> same<00:01:09.409> technique<00:01:10.409> also<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
you can adapt the same technique also to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.880 
you can adapt the same technique also to
human<00:01:11.790> race<00:01:12.150> combined<00:01:12.750> or<00:01:12.930> other<00:01:13.140> rendering

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
human race combined or other rendering

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.840 
human race combined or other rendering
and<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:15.290> mainly<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.500> workflow<00:01:16.920> will<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.310> basic

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and I mainly the workflow will be basic

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.929 
and I mainly the workflow will be basic
to<00:01:17.880> create<00:01:19.009> different<00:01:20.009> layers<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.430> details

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
to create different layers and details

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.480 
to create different layers and details
using<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.540> composite<00:01:21.869> map<00:01:22.290> and<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.250> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
using the composite map and all the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.310 
using the composite map and all the
other<00:01:23.640> properties<00:01:24.000> will<00:01:24.479> be<00:01:24.600> created<00:01:25.049> just

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
other properties will be created just

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.870 
other properties will be created just
using<00:01:25.909> procedural<00:01:26.909> Maps<00:01:27.180> like<00:01:28.020> noises

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
using procedural Maps like noises

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.499 
using procedural Maps like noises
cellular<00:01:29.880> or<00:01:30.320> nested<00:01:31.320> noises<00:01:31.890> with<00:01:32.880> masks<00:01:33.180> or

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
cellular or nested noises with masks or

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.050 
cellular or nested noises with masks or
without<00:01:33.840> masks<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.920> we'll<00:01:35.159> control<00:01:35.549> all<00:01:35.820> the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
without masks so we'll control all the

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.149 
without masks so we'll control all the
surface<00:01:36.540> properties<00:01:37.110> just<00:01:37.350> using<00:01:37.710> procedural

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
surface properties just using procedural

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.920 
surface properties just using procedural
maps<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:39.049> we'll<00:01:40.049> see<00:01:40.290> how<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> had<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:42.060> lot<00:01:42.750> of

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
maps and we'll see how to had a lot of

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.230 
maps and we'll see how to had a lot of
detail<00:01:43.290> our<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.950> simulate<00:01:44.220> more<00:01:44.759> complex

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
detail our to simulate more complex

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.469 
detail our to simulate more complex
material<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:46.100> this<00:01:47.100> one<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:48.000> will<00:01:48.210> use<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
material like this one that will use a

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.219 
material like this one that will use a
blend<00:01:48.899> mode<00:01:48.960> here<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.710> three<00:01:50.579> different

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
blend mode here to have three different

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.219 
blend mode here to have three different
surface<00:01:52.229> properties<00:01:53.210> inside<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.630> example<00:01:55.049> a

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
surface properties inside for example a

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.240 
surface properties inside for example a
rocky<00:01:55.560> structure<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:57.170> scattering<00:01:58.170> over<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
rocky structure a scattering over the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.719 
rocky structure a scattering over the
mesh<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.790> then<00:02:00.270> some<00:02:00.659> mineral<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:02.159> gold

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
mesh and then some mineral like a gold

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.660 
mesh and then some mineral like a gold
metal<00:02:03.000> over<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.560> surface<00:02:04.890> just<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.340> summary

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
metal over the surface just in summary

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.510 
metal over the surface just in summary
so<00:02:06.570> we've<00:02:06.899> seen<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.320> how<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.649> create<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.340> out

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
so we've seen that how to create it out

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.870 
so we've seen that how to create it out
of<00:02:08.849> control<00:02:09.800> variation<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.950> create<00:02:11.250> different

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
of control variation to create different

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.440 
of control variation to create different
rocks<00:02:13.540> with<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.230> same<00:02:14.560> material<00:02:15.160> but<00:02:15.450> with

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
rocks with the same material but with

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.160 
rocks with the same material but with
properties<00:02:17.140> variation<00:02:17.950> over<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.460> surface

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
properties variation over the surface

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.170 
properties variation over the surface
and<00:02:20.170> we'll<00:02:20.500> see<00:02:20.770> how<00:02:21.040> to<00:02:21.100> manage<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.760> workflow

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
and we'll see how to manage the workflow

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.690 
and we'll see how to manage the workflow
and<00:02:22.210> with<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.900> same<00:02:23.140> workflow<00:02:23.380> we'll<00:02:24.190> see<00:02:24.400> how

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
and with the same workflow we'll see how

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.580 
and with the same workflow we'll see how
to<00:02:24.760> create<00:02:25.060> different<00:02:25.690> kind<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.080> rocks<00:02:26.380> and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
to create different kind of rocks and

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.970 
to create different kind of rocks and
different<00:02:27.340> kind<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.880> material<00:02:28.390> or

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
different kind of material or

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.580
