it<00:02:17.940> wants<00:02:18.240> you<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.390> pick<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.780> DC<00:02:19.230> because<00:02:19.410> it

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
it wants you to pick the DC because it

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.310 
it wants you to pick the DC because it
looks<00:02:19.800> like<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.070> DC<00:02:20.340> is<00:02:20.790> where<00:02:21.090> all<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.840> all

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
looks like the DC is where all the all

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.010 
looks like the DC is where all the all
the<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.890> scuzzy<00:02:23.670> stuff<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.210> that<00:02:24.360> if<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:24.900> guys

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
the I scuzzy stuff is that if you guys

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.530 
the I scuzzy stuff is that if you guys
remember<00:02:25.350> in<00:02:25.500> an<00:02:25.680> issue<00:02:26.240> video<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.390> first

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
remember in an issue video the first

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.120 
remember in an issue video the first
part<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.990> video<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.260> show<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.530> guys<00:02:28.680> this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
part of the video I show you guys this

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.480 
part of the video I show you guys this
this<00:02:30.000> nice<00:02:30.180> little<00:02:30.540> chart<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.080> DC<00:02:31.320> is<00:02:31.860> what

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
this nice little chart in the DC is what

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.550 
this nice little chart in the DC is what
contains<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.060> virtue<00:02:33.270> I<00:02:33.390> scuzzy<00:02:33.930> San<00:02:34.320> to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
contains a virtue I scuzzy San to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.200 
contains a virtue I scuzzy San to
provide<00:02:34.860> storage<00:02:35.160> for<00:02:35.520> your<00:02:35.610> clustered<00:02:35.970> nodes

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
provide storage for your clustered nodes

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.300 
provide storage for your clustered nodes
on<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.840> storage<00:02:37.380> network<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.070> that's<00:02:38.160> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
on a storage network so that's the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.890 
on a storage network so that's the
reason<00:02:38.610> why<00:02:38.730> we<00:02:38.880> pick<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> DC<00:02:39.480> all<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.690> time

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
reason why we pick a DC all the time

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.340 
reason why we pick a DC all the time
during<00:02:40.170> this<00:02:40.320> video<00:02:40.620> series<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:41.760> see<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.690> if

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
during this video series so see and if

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.800 
during this video series so see and if
you<00:02:43.440> guys<00:02:43.590> remember<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.190> believe<00:02:44.550> in<00:02:44.940> parts

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
you guys remember I believe in parts

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.590 
you guys remember I believe in parts
mobile<00:02:46.500> him<00:02:46.620> again<00:02:46.860> my<00:02:46.980> notes<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.700> I<00:02:48.060> believe

mobile him again my notes and I believe
in<00:02:49.050> part<00:02:49.850> three<00:02:50.850> yeah<00:02:51.510> part<00:02:51.810> three<00:02:52.080> we<00:02:52.590> pick<00:02:52.830> H

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
in part three yeah part three we pick H

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.430 
in part three yeah part three we pick H
the<00:02:54.000> letter<00:02:54.180> H<00:02:54.360> right<00:02:54.840> because<00:02:55.170> that's<00:02:55.320> what

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
the letter H right because that's what

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.930

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
it user - docs and again the local path

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.280 
it user - docs and again the local path
will<00:03:15.390> be<00:03:15.510> shared<00:03:16.250> shared<00:03:17.250> x'<00:03:17.600> user<00:03:18.600> docs<00:03:18.960> and

will be shared shared x' user docs and

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.020 
will be shared shared x' user docs and
this<00:03:19.530> will<00:03:19.710> be<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:20.040> path<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.850> will

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
this will be the path that you will

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.390 
this will be the path that you will
navigate<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.290> know<00:03:22.380> whack-whack<00:03:22.710> DC

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
navigate to it you know whack-whack DC

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.690 
navigate to it you know whack-whack DC
user<00:03:23.700> docs<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.800> next<00:03:25.800> and<00:03:28.220> they<00:03:29.220> don't<00:03:29.490> really

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
user docs and next and they don't really

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.760 
user docs and next and they don't really
go<00:03:29.970> in<00:03:30.000> detail<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.720> other<00:03:30.900> settings<00:03:31.380> but<00:03:31.530> it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
go in detail and other settings but it

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.200 
go in detail and other settings but it
basically<00:03:32.010> just<00:03:32.220> tells<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.700> go<00:03:32.820> next<00:03:33.090> next

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
basically just tells you go next next

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.230 
basically just tells you go next next
next<00:03:33.360> next<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:34.530> by<00:03:34.980> default<00:03:35.490> it<00:03:35.700> does

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:36.240 
next next but by default it does

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.840 
next next but by default it does
allowing<00:03:36.960> it<00:03:37.260> allows<00:03:37.560> caching<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.490> share

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
allowing it allows caching of the share

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.790 
allowing it allows caching of the share
caching<00:03:39.420> makes<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.750> content<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.530> share

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
caching makes the content of the share

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.250 
caching makes the content of the share
available<00:03:41.490> to<00:03:41.580> offline<00:03:42.060> users<00:03:42.570> this<00:03:43.080> is

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
available to offline users this is

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.410 
available to offline users this is
really<00:03:43.650> great<00:03:44.070> especially<00:03:44.520> if<00:03:45.150> something

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
really great especially if something

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.930 
really great especially if something
happens<00:03:45.780> to<00:03:45.930> your<00:03:46.110> server<00:03:46.380> this<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.430> stuff<00:03:47.730> is

at<00:05:48.909> my<00:05:49.120> at<00:05:50.080> work<00:05:50.289> or<00:05:50.639> at<00:05:51.639> home<00:05:51.719> so<00:05:52.719> this<00:05:52.900> is<00:05:52.960> the

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
at my at work or at home so this is the

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.930 
at my at work or at home so this is the
best<00:05:53.169> time<00:05:53.409> for<00:05:53.440> me<00:05:53.710> to<00:05:54.009> play<00:05:54.400> around<00:05:54.430> and

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
best time for me to play around and

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.570 
best time for me to play around and
break<00:05:55.389> it<00:05:55.599> and<00:05:55.810> not<00:05:56.080> worry<00:05:56.529> about<00:05:56.650> it<00:05:56.949> right<00:05:57.009> I

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
break it and not worry about it right I

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.909 
break it and not worry about it right I
think<00:05:57.909> the<00:05:57.969> next<00:05:58.240> video<00:05:58.449> I'm<00:05:58.539> going<00:05:58.690> to<00:05:58.830> on<00:05:59.830> the

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
think the next video I'm going to on the

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:03.420 
think the next video I'm going to on the
next<00:06:00.219> video<00:06:00.460> on<00:06:00.520> the<00:06:00.639> next<00:06:00.849> virtual<00:06:01.419> lab<00:06:02.430> we're

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
next video on the next virtual lab we're

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:04.980 
next video on the next virtual lab we're
going<00:06:03.460> to<00:06:03.610> test<00:06:03.819> and<00:06:04.060> validate<00:06:04.539> the

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
going to test and validate the

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:06.809 
going to test and validate the
deduplication<00:06:05.860> so<00:06:06.130> that's<00:06:06.279> pretty<00:06:06.490> exciting

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819 
deduplication so that's pretty exciting

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.089 
deduplication so that's pretty exciting
I<00:06:07.150> think<00:06:07.690> it<00:06:07.960> is<00:06:08.080> going<00:06:08.289> to<00:06:08.380> consist<00:06:08.800> of<00:06:08.889> a<00:06:08.979> lot

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:09.099 
I think it is going to consist of a lot

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:10.499 
I think it is going to consist of a lot
of<00:06:09.219> PowerShell<00:06:09.639> a<00:06:09.699> lot<00:06:09.940> of<00:06:10.060> creating<00:06:10.300> folders

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:10.509 
of PowerShell a lot of creating folders

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.269 
of PowerShell a lot of creating folders
and<00:06:11.050> copying<00:06:11.409> stuff<00:06:11.620> over<00:06:11.889> so<00:06:12.009> that's<00:06:12.130> pretty

00:06:12.269 --> 00:06:12.279 
and copying stuff over so that's pretty

00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:13.920 
and copying stuff over so that's pretty
