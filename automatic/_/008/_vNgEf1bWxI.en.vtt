00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 At the end of October an epic expects us 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.879
 Vikings around her film very much 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.610
 dangerous journey across scotland 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.309
 in german cinemas that's how it works 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.309
 now at northman vikings haga 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.529
 are we real lindes driving so much 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.529
 is certain 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.980
 a king attacked by vikings 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.440
 she was captured if you 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.020
 my daughter brings back unscathed 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:01.110
 I will let you be royally successful 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:12.270
 us yes you have no idea why 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:16.320
 my father is capable of who you are not bad 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:20.660
 for a peace-loving person like that 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.660
 should rain from the sky 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.900
 then we have to stop them I will 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.900
 to stop them 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.320
 we have to go on it has to be another one 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.320
 walk away 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.659
 then we stay right here in the camp 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.640
 I can get it started who strongly 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.280
 viking time no called 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.420
 Rodney King Slayer is 97 minutes away 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.720
 released from 16 years and started 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.250
 germany from 23 october 2014 in 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.690
 the german cinemas and tells the 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.040
 story of a series of vikings the 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.000
 I am at the Scottish 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.430
 landing on the coast 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.140
 Led by us citizens are all great 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.480
 warrior and trained especially us 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.830
 authorities has a triceps and npcs up 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.030
 not to go anymore but the problem is 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.890
 that the scots are not the vikings 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.450
 just like and just now this one 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.160
 wikinger he is creating along a 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.080
 rock wall they will scramble up 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.340
 but directly attacked by Scots the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.680
 But you can escape 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.450
 succeeded in doing so to a hostage 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.100
 is not dangerous at all because it is 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.170
 the daughter of the scottish king and 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.000
 The sand around this one is supposed to be very fast 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.190
 kill vikings or at least to 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.600
 hunt and yes this hostage back to 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.710
 get in one way or another 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.750
 and wise, but then I want here 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.280
 not too much, and then you become a northerner 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.620
 vikings say pretty quotes 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.540
 easy knit films good and evil 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.890
 the viking does not gradually 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.210
 more those are who they were before and 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.160
 especially against the oh so big 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.720
 overwhelmed by sophisticated tactics 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.550
 have to fight and it has the film 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.170
 especially to offer a whole lot of advantages 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.060
 yes, that he is with a relative 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.320
 low budget therefore comes incredibly 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.880
 atmospherically retracted the 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.500
 Landscapes for the most part in 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.150
 South Africa have been filmed 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.140
 unbelievably good remember the many 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.240
 moments even and that you look 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.680
 actually to lord of the rings and have 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.510
 especially what the fight choreographer 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.560
 is a really great praise for me 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.730
 I'm almost a little bit 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.980
 bloody at one or the other 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.959
 would like to have wished but the fsk 16 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.280
 comes here to fully carry and the 97 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.870
 minutes may be to the end maybe 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.910
 even a little tick too long though 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.680
 still packed so crisp 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.240
 than that I'm relatively good at Nordmann 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.530
 look but there is also one 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.780
 A few smears that are clearly stated 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.010
 because it must be a genre mobimo say 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.660
 the genre fans would strip 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.280
 definitely should look because one 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.870
 nice change on the big one 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.070
 but canvas is normal for the otto 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.170
 KinogÃ¤nger is likely to be so relative 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.730
 quickly adjust the question where it stands 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.050
 the depth of the figures in many 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.730
 At times, you can not do it 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.380
 to capture individual characters in the 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.420
 scope of the film tell there you go 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.890
 also not quite as dramatic with if 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.690
 then somebody dies and that is one 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.640
 a shame and that for hilbert the 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.109
 one or the other light moment where 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.820
 But she also wants to play in the end 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.110
 suddenly things turn up the one 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.280
 a bit easy to get or 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.810
 if one or the other is not anymore 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.650
 been believed to have existed 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.860
 then back to the scene 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.330
 intervention 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.830
 that a bit ridiculous and there 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.479
 I have to complete the otto normal kino singer quite 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.710
 clearly say that nordmann maybe 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.539
 not the type of the first row but 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.400
 then synonymous rather on blu ray and dvd right 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:39.439
 So here are two hearts in my breast 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.030
 Genre fans do not go genre in the cinema 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:42.560
 fans maybe then rather at home 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.659
 to look at the end is called that 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.099
 Northmen waking saga with a cool one 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:47.659
 by the way, truck's tour in a ken duken 

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:49.520
 the social mobile leader among others 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:50.780
 was and as the main man because that also 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.069
 did a bit of fun 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.400
 to look more behind the scenes 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.080
 can 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.789
 from the film at the end of an atmospheric 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.550
 stripes is mine in his genre 

00:04:55.789 --> 00:05:00.800
 as a monumental viking adventure epic 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.449
 absolutely worth seven and a half out of 10 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.770
 possible points overall then gets 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:05.150
 but one or the other smeared 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.650
 altogether acceptable 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.169
 five and a half out of 10 possible points 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.759
 Overall , standards fell at this point 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.229
 from me and there I have mine 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.430
 Leave a review if I am 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:15.710
 this video made it stay that way 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.000
 if not otherwise you know that 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.590
 there are a few left and me around and 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
 tomorrow at 15 o'clock, of course, at the latest 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.740
 a new video 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.229
 until then, I hope for tomorrow again 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.229
 with of course at 3
