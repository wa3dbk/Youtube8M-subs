 I really wanted to be with everyone 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.730
 you the reason for me the real 

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:16.460
 inactivity is due to some bullshit 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.340
 the truth is that the internet service 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.170
 that I have is very bad and therefore the truth 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.910
 Believe it or not, I was there for many weeks 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.560
 without internet that was the reason 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.810
 mainly that he has not done 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.130
 videos and as you know in my last video 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.039

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.289

 have been seen on my channel 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.490
 I'm obviously talking about 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.410
 Pokemon curiosities mistakes and rarities and 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.059

 part I hope you like these 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.540
 curiosities and as a first curiosity 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.580
 I have this 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.860
 series that in the eta episode of 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.450
 mega blond pokemon and alpha sapphire when 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.430
 you speak with maximum and altaria city 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.770
 taking on your team the king of a shiny 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.600
 of event that will tell you that it reminds you of 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.260
 a battle with a boy with a shawl and 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.670
 sardi keys 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.550
 this refers to the episode 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.890
 special 2 of the mega evolution 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.010
 you know what pokemon is the smallest of all 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.050
 is baby taking only 5 centimeters of 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:37.160
 height while the biggest one is 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.960
 flight with 14.5 meters of height the most 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.910
 surprising of all this is that equal 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.009
 it is not the heaviest since the most 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.100
 heavy is the legendary pokemon degree 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.229
 weighing 950 kilograms and the most 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.350
 lightweight are flash baby and gas link that 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.910
 weigh nothing more or nothing less 0.1 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.250
 kilograms 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.590
 did you know that nippon airways an airline 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.930
 Japanese has four planes 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.540
 completely painted with characters from 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.520
 pokemon even the flight attendants look 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.200
 aprons of the same 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.690
 did you know that in the pokemon blue video 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.759
 was changed to linen nest by gigli post what 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.370
 rare of this is that there is an error since 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.690
 as we know jeep and get are immune 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.570
 each 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.240
 in an episode of the pokemon gun anime 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.130
 and he boasts his medals are you 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.050
 showing him 10 medals obviously this 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.850
 it's an animation error, like all 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.340
 we know there are only eight leaders of 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.960
 gym in each region knew is that the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.210
 pokemon to be has his eyes 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.030
 totally blank since in reality 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.010
 this one is dead the reason for which 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.010
 move is due to the fungus on your head 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.940
 who controls it at his will 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.310
 turning it into a type of zombie 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.320
 even if you do not believe it, it does not exist in the 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.720
 reality and infects all kinds of 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.450
 insects arriving to convert them up 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.970
 in cannibals in the game from the eyes 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.040
 that same one develops in humans and 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.270
 is the reason that humanity is in 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.670
 danger of extinction 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.310
 did you know that a pokémon pearl diamond the 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.770
 January 12 the snow that falls city 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.530
 a new one is brilliant because it is 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.240
 the day he meets satoshi tajiri or 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.980
 the creator of pokemon 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.960
 you know that in the beginning the plage 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.150
 I had fangs but given the image 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.790
 friendly that he had in the anime he 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.710
 decided that quest will no longer have them 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.780
 Did you know what the scarf looks like? 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.170
 graining is already really its long 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.790
 tongue wrapped around his neck 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.820
 did you know that in the stereo pokemon of 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.040
 nintendo 64 the pokemon elected bus was 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.350
 wrongly programmed with six fingers 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.660
 in each hand and the strangest thing is that the 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.120
 error remained present in stereo pokemon 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.020
 in two series that the region race of 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.430
 pokemon conquest is shaped like arzew it 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.250
 he knew is that the fastest pokemon in 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.530
 eclosionar of all is magicard 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.850
 Hatching around 100 steps 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.070
 you knew that in the manga you can see a 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.890
 tree being cut in half for fighting 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.140
 mission or greater than strong it had 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.660
 written ornate is the only pokemon that 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.880
 have about the type of flier you knew 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.950
 that the total slugging states are 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.270
 equivalent to grade stacks ni 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.730
 they want 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.960
 the semi legendary pokemon like dragon 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.510
 knight and lan and tam 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.520
 black salamis have the most states 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.440
 higher than the legendary trios of 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.540
 pokemon versions 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.090
 you knew that the first generations the 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.010
 pokédex since there is a viewer to have the 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.950
 flower that carries on his back this is not 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.750
 you can stand up even though in the spray what 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:30.190
 we have raised on his two hind legs 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.190
 as if you do not give a fuck 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:35.870
 and finally you knew that the only 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.440
 types that are super effective between 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.669
 yes they are the dragon and the ghost 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.010
 coincidentally they are the only guys who 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.920
 they had an evolutionary line in the first 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.740
 generation 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.880
