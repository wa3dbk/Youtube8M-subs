00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
that so it doesn't matter but anyway

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.039

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
basically is something I'd used for a

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.530 
basically is something I'd used for a
long<00:03:26.280> time<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:28.670> when<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:29.700> was<00:03:29.910> coming<00:03:30.269> up<00:03:30.359> with

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.430 
well although actually when I think back
on<00:03:36.120> is<00:03:36.299> really<00:03:36.450> not<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.690> different<00:03:37.139> cause<00:03:37.260> it's

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440
