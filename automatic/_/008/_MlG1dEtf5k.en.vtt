00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.200
 very good girls very good guys I am 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.500
 and how are you doing, I hope you are all 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.360
 very well today I'm going to cut to the chase because it's 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.620
 something that I was always counting on when 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.150
 we have talked about warming 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:18.420
 global or about these high temperatures 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.619
 and was going to change at some point is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.119
 this huge increase in your heat 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.130
 in general of the planet and has always 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.900
 talked about an ice age that has 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 been happening since the creation of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.290
 the earth and what's happening because it 's a 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.140
 natural cycle of the planet by the by the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.480
 sun because it is true or is not 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.050
 I'm inventing nothing, so it's 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.050
 that is true the fatigue of the sun is 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.570
 very likely that it can cause a mini 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.480
 ice age on earth in the year 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.000
 2030 is not something very far indeed 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.620
 many of us if god wants to 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.570
 we will be alive we are talking about 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.450
 in 15 years 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.329
 within the framework of the meeting that the real 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.949
 astronomical society of the united kingdom has 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.050
 been celebrating this week in Welsh 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.450
 there has been a teacher of 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.610
 Math called valentina arco 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.680
 who has been presenting a new 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.710
 model that what is going to help is to 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.420
 predict very accurately the 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.390
 irregularities within the period of 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.330
 activity of 11 years of the sun according to 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.450
 documenta have found components of 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.390
 magnetic wave that seem to appear in 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.420
 original pairs of two layers 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.160
 different in the interior of the sun both 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.979
 layers have a frequency of 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.649
 approximately 11 years although this 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.060
 frequency is slightly different and it 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:47.789
 compensate with time then during a 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.830
 during that cycle the waves what they do 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.789
 is fluctuate between the northern hemispheres 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.630
 and south of the sun when you combine these 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:00.240
 waves together and compare with the data 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.830
 real for the current solar cycle is 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.620
 find 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.840
 a eureka you will find that the 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.630
 predictions made by the 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 scientists show a precision of 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.980
 97 percent according to these estimates 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.610
 this solar activity has been reduced in 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.480
 70 % in 60%, that is, it will be reduced in 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.370
 60% during the 2030s and what 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.740
 what he's going to do is cause a new mini 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:33.510
 ice age similar to the one that started 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:35.910
 in 1645 in that period of 30 years it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.860
 known as the minimum of maunder in the 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.140
 that sunspots almost 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.650
 disappeared from the surface of the sun 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.520
 during those 70 years between the 17th centuries 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.830
 and 18 were registered in the sun about 50 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:54.140
 spots when normal would have been 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.820
 observe between 40,000 and 50,000 spots 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.140
 50 spots is very very little 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.510
 spots at that time according to what 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.600
 we have of those scriptures and according to 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.520
 historical records of those those centuries 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.940
 the intense cold 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:13.710
 froze the river thames in london and great 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.660
 part of the planet was subjected to 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.940
 conditions that have not been returned to 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.340
 experience since then so it's 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.200
 possible that in 15 years we can 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.630
 experience a mini ice age that 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.000
 maybe it can last a century like 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:32.750
 hard in those centuries between 17 and 18 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.490
 or 70 years that is almost a century so 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.230
 many of the people we think of 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.110
 this and that we have been many times 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.660
 claiming a lot of people has not 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.230
 believed in what I am saying 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:48.379
 now that scientists have shown 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.000
 that is there that besides that you can 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.470
 observe good scientists can 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.210
 observe on the topic of layers of 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.030
 ice and everything even 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.210
 pieces of or zones of stone zones 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.190
 mountains and such those layers can be 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.810
 observe when there have been those changes 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.180
 of temperature well because of the density 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.250
 of the earth for anything that is 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.320
 there has happened that there is one thing that 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.690
 it's called holocene, which is when you pass 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.150
 why this extreme heat that 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.670
 we are living now in the cold 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.530
 at that ice age that will last for that 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.620
 a very short period of time that are 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.030
 approximately between 70 and 100 years like this 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.250
 that nothing guys did not want to go to the 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.530
 bed without telling you this news that for 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.870
 I'm perfect because see if the 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.220
 it was ice right now I would be at the 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.990
 sea ​​of ​​content because I have no air 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.150
 conditioning and I'm having a hard time 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.710
 right now in summer so nothing 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.810
 guys, I hope you've been interested 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.700
 this news as much as me or a little kiss 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.980
 everyone and as always I tell you one 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.180
 lie questions a thousand truths 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.180
 until the next ciao
