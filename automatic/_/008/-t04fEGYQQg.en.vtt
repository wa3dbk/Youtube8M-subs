we<00:02:33.190> came<00:02:33.400> up<00:02:33.580> with<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.819> idea<00:02:34.180> if<00:02:34.330> we<00:02:34.510> could

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
we came up with the idea if we could

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.210 
we came up with the idea if we could
have<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> motorcycle<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.650> was<00:02:35.770> under<00:02:36.040> five

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
have a motorcycle it was under five

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.580 
have a motorcycle it was under five
thousand<00:02:36.670> dollars<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.300> kids<00:02:38.140> could<00:02:38.349> raise

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
thousand dollars that kids could raise

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.670 
thousand dollars that kids could raise
you<00:02:38.950> know<00:02:39.099> cheaply<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:40.000> so<00:02:40.750> economically<00:02:41.349> for

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
you know cheaply and so economically for

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.800 
you know cheaply and so economically for
the<00:02:41.830> parents<00:02:42.220> as<00:02:42.310> well<00:02:42.520> with<00:02:43.239> with<00:02:43.450> minimal

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
the parents as well with with minimal

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.740 
the parents as well with with minimal
maintenance<00:02:44.020> and<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:44.680> on<00:02:44.800> then<00:02:45.520> it<00:02:45.849> would<00:02:46.209> you

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
maintenance and so on then it would you

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.140 
maintenance and so on then it would you
know<00:02:46.900> attract<00:02:47.349> people<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.890> try<00:02:48.340> racing<00:02:48.819> and

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
know attract people to try racing and

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.300 
know attract people to try racing and
grow<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.569> grids<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.770> course<00:02:51.040> it's<00:02:51.250> been

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
grow the grids and of course it's been

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.059 
grow the grids and of course it's been
three<00:02:51.910> years<00:02:52.180> now<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:53.590> series<00:02:53.920> is

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
three years now and the series is

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.990 
three years now and the series is
doubled<00:02:54.400> in<00:02:54.520> size<00:02:54.959> every<00:02:55.959> year<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.640> we<00:02:57.640> expect

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
doubled in size every year and we expect

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.090 
doubled in size every year and we expect
the<00:02:58.090> final<00:02:58.480> we'll<00:02:58.600> have<00:02:58.780> thirty<00:02:59.290> people<00:02:59.560> in<00:02:59.950> it

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
the final we'll have thirty people in it

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.280 
the final we'll have thirty people in it
which<00:03:00.819> probably<00:03:01.090> makes<00:03:01.569> it<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.780> biggest<00:03:01.989> grid

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
which probably makes it the biggest grid

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.900 
which probably makes it the biggest grid
here<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.709> weekend<00:03:03.160> so<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:03.489> probably<00:03:03.760> the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
here this weekend so it's probably the

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.890 
here this weekend so it's probably the
biggest<00:03:04.060> class<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.800> motorcycle<00:03:05.800> racing<00:03:06.340> here

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
biggest class of motorcycle racing here

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.120 
biggest class of motorcycle racing here
we're<00:03:07.900> kind<00:03:08.050> of<00:03:08.170> getting<00:03:08.290> to<00:03:08.470> that<00:03:08.590> point<00:03:08.950> now

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
we're kind of getting to that point now

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.550 
we're kind of getting to that point now
where<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:10.090> grids<00:03:10.330> as<00:03:10.450> big<00:03:10.630> as<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:10.930> can<00:03:11.080> be<00:03:11.260> for

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
where the grids as big as it can be for

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.220 
where the grids as big as it can be for
for<00:03:11.799> a<00:03:11.980> single<00:03:12.430> class<00:03:12.580> so<00:03:13.540> we've<00:03:13.720> developed<00:03:13.989> a

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
for a single class so we've developed a

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.949 
for a single class so we've developed a
bit<00:03:14.350> of<00:03:14.440> a<00:03:14.500> mentorship<00:03:15.040> program<00:03:15.549> where<00:03:15.959> you

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
bit of a mentorship program where you

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.509 
bit of a mentorship program where you
know<00:03:17.080> we've<00:03:17.230> taken<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.769> kids<00:03:18.010> who<00:03:18.190> are<00:03:18.340> at<00:03:18.459> the

and<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.690> know<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.900> series<00:03:38.079> will<00:03:38.320> sort<00:03:38.500> of

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
and you know the series will sort of

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.470 
and you know the series will sort of
feed<00:03:38.799> each<00:03:38.920> other

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480

a<00:03:44.540> big<00:03:45.110> part<00:03:45.409> of<00:03:45.560> this<00:03:45.739> was<00:03:46.069> to<00:03:46.730> make<00:03:47.030> people

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
a big part of this was to make people

but<00:04:20.600> you've<00:04:20.750> got<00:04:20.900> two<00:04:21.049> riders<00:04:21.350> behind<00:04:21.530> you

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
but you've got two riders behind you

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.490 
but you've got two riders behind you
making<00:04:22.039> a<00:04:22.100> move<00:04:22.250> on<00:04:22.400> you<00:04:22.900> so<00:04:23.900> it's<00:04:24.229> a<00:04:24.289> very

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
making a move on you so it's a very

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.779 
making a move on you so it's a very
peculiar<00:04:24.800> situation<00:04:25.010> because<00:04:25.520> you<00:04:25.580> really

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
peculiar situation because you really

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.550 
peculiar situation because you really
have<00:04:25.940> no<00:04:26.060> idea<00:04:26.090> what's<00:04:26.539> going<00:04:26.780> on<00:04:26.930> certainly

the<00:04:27.650> most<00:04:27.770> fun<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.100> think<00:04:28.400> is<00:04:28.580> that<00:04:28.610> is<00:04:29.000> that<00:04:29.210> it

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
the most fun I think is that is that it

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.540 
the most fun I think is that is that it
gives<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:29.870> a<00:04:29.900> sense<00:04:30.289> at<00:04:30.440> a<00:04:30.770> speed<00:04:31.130> that<00:04:31.160> we<00:04:31.370> can

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
gives you a sense at a speed that we can

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.540 
gives you a sense at a speed that we can
handle<00:04:32.050> going<00:04:33.050> eight<00:04:33.350> riders<00:04:33.770> into<00:04:34.010> a<00:04:34.100> corner

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.710 
little bit further but it's been great
fun<00:05:47.320> and<00:05:47.760> it's<00:05:48.760> kind<00:05:49.000> of<00:05:49.030> a<00:05:49.150> shame<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:49.570> it

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
fun and it's kind of a shame that it

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.590 
fun and it's kind of a shame that it
really<00:05:49.960> is<00:05:50.080> just<00:05:50.110> for<00:05:50.470> kids<00:05:50.620> because<00:05:51.600> they

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
really is just for kids because they

00:05:52.600 --> 00:06:01.620 
really is just for kids because they
have<00:05:52.630> enough<00:05:52.930> fun

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.910 

the<00:06:02.630> talk<00:06:02.840> light<00:06:03.050> must<00:06:03.290> work<00:06:03.500> because<00:06:03.740> there's

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:03.920 
the talk light must work because there's

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.490 
the talk light must work because there's
a<00:06:03.980> really<00:06:04.250> wide<00:06:04.580> open<00:06:04.610> flowing<00:06:05.360> circus<00:06:05.810> the

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
a really wide open flowing circus the

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.050 
a really wide open flowing circus the
draft<00:06:06.800> is<00:06:07.010> really<00:06:07.250> important<00:06:07.760> because<00:06:07.820> the

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
draft is really important because the

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.260 
draft is really important because the
back<00:06:08.210> straightaway<00:06:08.630> is<00:06:09.050> so<00:06:09.920> long<00:06:10.190> that<00:06:10.270> you
