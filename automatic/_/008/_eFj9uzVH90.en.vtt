00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.390
 it's amazing that you even forward 3 with a wallet narrative due to the past 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.590
 almost unknown approach to him little - badly made by the production 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.239
 of the students 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.720
 What really matters is the enemies. 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.820
 special attacks and novelties 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.260
 in this last aspect is not much explored 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.720
 once I had the luck of m3 use of quite traditional elements 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.530
 but still 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 enough action to catch the player's attention 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.220
 you must destroy 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.420
 everything you see ahead alternating between the two pilots 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.770
 facts 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.550
 two of your opponents 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.039
 there are ten selectable characters 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.300
 in different attacks and bombs 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.850
 with the option to hold the button to 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.979
 the intensity 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.850
 in the shape of your country 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.159
 there is still a damage multiplier 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.009
 called the francis and external father activated by the use of bombs 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.320
 and mechanics that increase damage according to their ease 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.240
 authors 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.240
 giving good pictures for different strategies 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.850
 the checks did not come to impress by the visual 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.100
 but many are gigantic and creatively designed 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.970
 with very varied attack patterns 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.770
 some still have the luxury of having unexpected moments, which increases 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.770
 plus the expectation to start the meetings 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.339
 with regard to the technical aspects 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.029
 about the subject 

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.699
 almost has to do 

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:37.679
 without great excesses 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.689
 just enough to make everything nice 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.339
 there are many elements on the screen 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.129
 soon becomes full of debris and luggage 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.519
 with some very interesting special effects 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.719
 there is a balanced mix of 2d animation in the style of Minas Gerais with 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:54.189
 grace 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.480
 the three see that make up the scenarios 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.239
 in some passages by the saints due to unexpected camera movements 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.389
 but nothing that has not been done before 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.389
 the most famous games of the genre 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.139
 only 121 have given up following 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.079
 shortly after coming into force 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.979
 after I left 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:24.939
 I'm lucky to live free 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.159
 it is not a one-way game plus a regional market value 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.329
 but to do what must be done 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.760
 in intense shootings and good options to keep fans of the genre guilty 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.189
 a good time 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.409
 it's because of the scarcity of games this year 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.060
 Translation is a steal 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.050
 that the story does not have much logic 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.050
 but quality action justifies the purchase 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:22.460
 there
