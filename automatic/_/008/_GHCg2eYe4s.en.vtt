so let's check out what powers this

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.029 
so let's check out what powers this
prize<00:04:34.350> this<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.500> an<00:04:35.590> area<00:04:35.770> that<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:35.919> lot<00:04:36.009> of

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
prize this is an area that a lot of

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:37.350 
prize this is an area that a lot of
people<00:04:36.280> don't<00:04:36.370> see<00:04:36.490> here<00:04:36.789> at<00:04:36.880> Tomb<00:04:37.030> Raider<00:04:37.060> the

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
people don't see here at Tomb Raider the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.909 
people don't see here at Tomb Raider the
ride<00:04:37.539> this<00:04:37.780> is<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.020> resistor<00:04:38.440> Bank<00:04:38.650> room

ride this is the resistor Bank room

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.620 
ride this is the resistor Bank room
because<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.580> ride<00:04:39.759> requires<00:04:40.270> so<00:04:40.509> much

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
because the ride requires so much

from<00:04:55.720> head<00:04:56.199> to<00:04:56.770> toe<00:04:57.389> it<00:04:58.389> felt<00:04:58.750> unbelievable

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
from head to toe it felt unbelievable

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.140

really<00:05:05.790> different<00:05:06.030> it's<00:05:06.800> experience<00:05:07.800> it's<00:05:08.040> a

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
really different it's experience it's a
