gentlemen all that's left is Damocles
which<00:03:47.099> not<00:03:47.519> only<00:03:47.790> is<00:03:47.939> it<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.150> hardest<00:03:48.420> puzzle

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
which not only is it the hardest puzzle

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.530 
which not only is it the hardest puzzle
in<00:03:49.049> my<00:03:49.200> opinion<00:03:49.620> it's<00:03:49.799> also<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.159> hardest

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
in my opinion it's also the hardest

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.170 
in my opinion it's also the hardest
artifact<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:52.459> crappy<00:03:53.459> fake<00:03:53.790> cut<00:03:54.090> array<00:03:56.180> okay

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
artifact so crappy fake cut array okay

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.240 
artifact so crappy fake cut array okay
so<00:03:57.239> once<00:03:57.750> you<00:03:57.840> never<00:03:58.049> eat<00:03:58.290> your<00:03:58.500> way<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.709> this

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
so once you never eat your way to this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.720 
so once you never eat your way to this
part<00:03:59.790> of<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.359> Damocles<00:04:00.810> room<00:04:01.310> just<00:04:02.310> pull<00:04:02.579> this

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
part of the Damocles room just pull this

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.880 
part of the Damocles room just pull this
little<00:04:02.939> switch<00:04:03.269> here<00:04:03.439> and<00:04:04.439> that<00:04:04.620> will<00:04:04.769> make

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
little switch here and that will make

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.130 
little switch here and that will make
those<00:04:05.879> spikes<00:04:06.209> go<00:04:06.480> down<00:04:07.250> which<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.430> great<00:04:09.140> the

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
those spikes go down which is great the

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.920 
those spikes go down which is great the
fastest<00:04:10.560> way<00:04:10.709> to<00:04:10.739> get<00:04:11.129> back<00:04:12.060> to<00:04:12.359> those<00:04:12.569> spikes

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
fastest way to get back to those spikes

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.259 
fastest way to get back to those spikes
so<00:04:13.889> line<00:04:14.099> up<00:04:14.129> one<00:04:14.400> of<00:04:14.489> these<00:04:14.639> super<00:04:15.060> annoying

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
so line up one of these super annoying

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:30.909 
so line up one of these super annoying

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
I said this is the most difficult

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.230 
I said this is the most difficult
artifact<00:04:58.949> of<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.190> whole<00:05:01.550> finally<00:05:02.550> there's

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
artifact of the whole finally there's

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.790 
artifact of the whole finally there's
the<00:05:03.300> most<00:05:03.449> difficult<00:05:04.020> artifact<00:05:04.440> at<00:05:04.560> the<00:05:04.650> whole

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
the most difficult artifact at the whole

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.310 
the most difficult artifact at the whole
level<00:05:05.419> and<00:05:06.419> because<00:05:06.720> the<00:05:06.840> way<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.080> camera

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
level and because the way the camera

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.379 
level and because the way the camera
works<00:05:07.470> it's<00:05:08.130> also<00:05:08.280> in<00:05:08.550> my<00:05:08.669> opinion<00:05:09.120> the<00:05:09.270> most

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:09.389 
works it's also in my opinion the most

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.480 
works it's also in my opinion the most
difficult<00:05:10.220> the<00:05:11.220> most<00:05:11.310> difficult<00:05:11.400> puzzle

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
difficult the most difficult puzzle

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.440 
difficult the most difficult puzzle
there<00:05:14.490> it<00:05:14.639> is<00:05:14.759> that's<00:05:15.150> all<00:05:15.539> there<00:05:15.900> is<00:05:15.930> to<00:05:16.289> it
