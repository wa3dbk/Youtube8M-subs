hey guys in this video I'm gonna talk
about<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.589> LG<00:00:08.000> Sifl<00:00:09.000> which<00:00:09.269> is<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.420> smartphone

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
about the LG Sifl which is a smartphone

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.810 
about the LG Sifl which is a smartphone
that's<00:00:10.019> been<00:00:10.170> leaked<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:10.769> this<00:00:11.429> smartphone

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
that's been leaked so this smartphone

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.749 
that's been leaked so this smartphone
was<00:00:12.300> leaked<00:00:12.570> by<00:00:12.719> Japanese<00:00:13.590> telecom<00:00:14.099> KDDI<00:00:14.610> and

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
was leaked by Japanese telecom KDDI and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.800 
was leaked by Japanese telecom KDDI and
the<00:00:15.660> SI<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.830> meaning<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.609> SI<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.570> it

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
the SI the meaning of the SI is that it

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.519 
the SI the meaning of the SI is that it
is<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> carrier<00:00:19.710> named<00:00:20.430> as<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.910> s<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.410> this<00:00:22.410> is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
is a carrier named as a s so this is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.710 
is a carrier named as a s so this is
actually<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.550> carrier<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.090> will<00:00:24.210> be<00:00:24.359> used

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
actually the carrier that will be used

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.070 
actually the carrier that will be used
with<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.199> smartphone<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:26.510> first<00:00:27.510> of<00:00:27.660> all<00:00:27.840> if

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
with this smartphone so first of all if

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.230 
with this smartphone so first of all if
you<00:00:28.380> look<00:00:28.590> at<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.160> design<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.910> smartphone

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
you look at the design of the smartphone

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.040 
you look at the design of the smartphone
in<00:00:30.630> familiars<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:32.279> XS<00:00:32.640> 5<00:00:32.880> so<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.660> may<00:00:33.870> be<00:00:33.899> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
in familiars in XS 5 so it may be a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.020 
in familiars in XS 5 so it may be a
successor<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.860> Nexus<00:00:34.980> 5<00:00:35.370> meaning<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.880> may

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
successor to the Nexus 5 meaning it may

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.619 
successor to the Nexus 5 meaning it may
be<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.210> Nexus<00:00:36.690> 6<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:38.100> first<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> all<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.390> this

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
be a Nexus 6 so first of all at this

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.720 
be a Nexus 6 so first of all at this
time<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.469> not<00:00:40.649> only<00:00:40.800> leagued<00:00:41.309> with<00:00:41.430> its

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
time is it not only leagued with its

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.260 
time is it not only leagued with its
image<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.809> color<00:00:43.079> pink<00:00:43.710> color<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.280> also<00:00:44.820> lead

fingerprint scanner as you can see on
the<00:01:31.829> back<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.600> on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.630> back<00:01:33.900> below<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
the back and on the back below the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.350 
the back and on the back below the
camera<00:01:35.009> there<00:01:35.250> are<00:01:35.369> two<00:01:35.579> buttons<00:01:35.729> which<00:01:36.119> we

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
camera there are two buttons which we

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.249 
camera there are two buttons which we
can<00:01:36.570> assume<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> LG<00:01:38.310> g2<00:01:38.850> has<00:01:39.780> two

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
can assume just like the LG g2 has two

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.170 
can assume just like the LG g2 has two
buttons<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.650> its<00:01:40.799> back<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.009> it<00:01:41.430> may<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.640> an<00:01:41.790> LG

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
buttons on its back so it may be an LG

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.050 
buttons on its back so it may be an LG
g3<00:01:42.329> so<00:01:42.780> that's<00:01:43.020> why<00:01:43.229> add<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:44.159> two<00:01:44.640> buttons<00:01:44.939> on

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
g3 so that's why add the two buttons on

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
g3 so that's why add the two buttons on
the<00:01:45.090> back<00:01:45.329> volume<00:01:45.780> buttons<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.259> par<00:01:46.619> Berlin

just<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.740> get<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.280> galaxy<00:01:59.729> s5<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.299> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
just like we get on the galaxy s5 so and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.330 
just like we get on the galaxy s5 so and
of<00:02:01.110> course<00:02:01.380> take<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> as<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> grain<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.159> salt

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
of course take it as a grain of salt

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.069 
of course take it as a grain of salt

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
because it's not officially confirmed

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.880 
because it's not officially confirmed

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
but it may be a it may be a hard monitor

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.979 
but it may be a it may be a hard monitor
because<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.429> have<00:02:08.520> seen<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:08.970> s5<00:02:09.300> so<00:02:09.660> maybe

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
because we have seen on the s5 so maybe
