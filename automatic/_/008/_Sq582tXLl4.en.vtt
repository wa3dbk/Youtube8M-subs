took a way less of a jump there I mean I
jump<00:01:47.540> from<00:01:47.600> like<00:01:47.870> great<00:01:48.110> there<00:01:48.700> so<00:01:49.700> let's<00:01:49.880> see

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
jump from like great there so let's see

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.650 
jump from like great there so let's see
that's<00:01:52.940> to<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.450> water<00:01:53.690> it's<00:01:54.050> just<00:01:54.530> insane

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
that's to the water it's just insane

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.090 
that's to the water it's just insane
alright<00:01:56.660> so<00:01:57.460> that's<00:01:58.460> that<00:01:59.229> the<00:02:00.229> next<00:02:00.500> one<00:02:00.650> we

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
alright so that's that the next one we

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.150 
alright so that's that the next one we
got<00:02:01.280> is<00:02:01.340> an<00:02:02.229> uninteresting<00:02:03.229> potion<00:02:03.619> which

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
got is an uninteresting potion which

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.820 
got is an uninteresting potion which
would<00:02:04.310> be<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.640> speed<00:02:05.240> the<00:02:06.080> haste<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.649> the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
would be the speed the haste and the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.199 
would be the speed the haste and the
jump<00:02:07.070> boost<00:02:07.899> now<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:08.959> speed<00:02:09.500> or<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.520> haste<00:02:10.850> is

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
jump boost now the speed or the haste is

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.750 
jump boost now the speed or the haste is
quite<00:02:12.020> difficult<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:13.310> was<00:02:13.430> quite<00:02:13.670> difficult

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
quite difficult it was quite difficult

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.270 
quite difficult it was quite difficult
to<00:02:14.060> find<00:02:14.300> out<00:02:14.420> what<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.630> was<00:02:14.780> and<00:02:15.140> then<00:02:15.620> if<00:02:15.980> you

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.570 
to find out what it was and then if you
look<00:02:16.459> at<00:02:16.610> it<00:02:16.640> like<00:02:17.540> your<00:02:18.440> hand<00:02:18.709> swings<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.340> lot

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
faster it increases the speed of your

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.860 
faster it increases the speed of your
want<00:02:23.420> to<00:02:23.480> say<00:02:23.600> swing<00:02:23.930> or<00:02:24.650> gathering<00:02:25.160> time<00:02:25.400> I

want to say swing or gathering time I
mean<00:02:26.870> we<00:02:27.590> just<00:02:27.770> gather<00:02:27.980> stuff<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.400> lot<00:02:29.260> that's

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
mean we just gather stuff a lot that's

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.590 
mean we just gather stuff a lot that's
just<00:02:30.470> my<00:02:30.739> bare<00:02:30.950> hand<00:02:31.190> well<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:32.360> potion

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
just my bare hand well and this potion

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.620 
just my bare hand well and this potion
of<00:02:32.870> course<00:02:33.140> but<00:02:33.640> these<00:02:34.640> potions<00:02:34.850> also<00:02:35.480> do

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
of course but these potions also do

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.550 
of course but these potions also do
create<00:02:36.080> a<00:02:36.140> glass<00:02:36.380> bottle<00:02:36.799> which<00:02:37.489> I<00:02:37.989> guess<00:02:38.989> you

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
create a glass bottle which I guess you

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.060 
create a glass bottle which I guess you
can<00:02:39.709> refill<00:02:40.100> them<00:02:40.250> like<00:02:40.700> bowls<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:43.040> next

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
can refill them like bowls so the next

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.060 
can refill them like bowls so the next
one<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.700> an<00:02:43.970> invisibility<00:02:44.540> hast<00:02:45.230> night<00:02:45.680> vision

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
one is an invisibility hast night vision

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.350 
one is an invisibility hast night vision
and<00:02:46.250> it<00:02:46.370> gives<00:02:46.549> you<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.700> weakness<00:02:47.180> too<00:02:47.450> so<00:02:49.360> now

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
and it gives you a weakness too so now

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.070 
and it gives you a weakness too so now
the<00:02:50.959> weakness<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:55.730> do<00:02:55.940> I've<00:02:56.450> not<00:02:56.810> found<00:02:56.930> a

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
the weakness is to do I've not found a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.590 
the weakness is to do I've not found a
weakness<00:02:57.230> yet<00:02:57.500> but<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.250> invisibility<00:02:58.820> no<00:02:59.540> you

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
weakness yet but the invisibility no you

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.199 
weakness yet but the invisibility no you
do<00:02:59.900> not<00:02:59.930> look<00:03:00.230> invisible<00:03:00.560> but<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.489> will<00:03:01.970> be

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
do not look invisible but I will be

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.180 
do not look invisible but I will be
assuming<00:03:02.330> since<00:03:02.959> I'm<00:03:03.110> all<00:03:03.260> peaceful<00:03:03.500> at

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
assuming since I'm all peaceful at

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.650 
assuming since I'm all peaceful at
creepers<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.760> things<00:03:05.299> do<00:03:05.510> not<00:03:05.660> spot<00:03:06.049> you<00:03:06.290> and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
creepers and things do not spot you and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.210 
creepers and things do not spot you and
this<00:03:08.660> jump<00:03:08.959> which<00:03:09.170> does<00:03:09.470> do<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.739> one<00:03:10.010> and<00:03:10.100> a<00:03:10.190> half

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
this jump which does do a one and a half

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.630 
this jump which does do a one and a half
high<00:03:11.120> block<00:03:11.989> grades<00:03:12.459> greatness

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
high block grades greatness

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:22.289 
high block grades greatness
so<00:03:15.640> yeah<00:03:15.790> but<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:18.129> next<00:03:18.430> one<00:03:18.609> is<00:03:20.519> suave<00:03:21.519> potion

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
so yeah but the next one is suave potion

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:29.759 
so yeah but the next one is suave potion
which<00:03:22.599> is<00:03:22.780> speed<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.469> strength<00:03:28.769> so

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
which is speed and strength so

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:35.670 
which is speed and strength so
apparently<00:03:30.629> you<00:03:31.629> can<00:03:32.849> yeah<00:03:34.170> you<00:03:35.170> kill<00:03:35.439> things

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
apparently you can yeah you kill things

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.610 
apparently you can yeah you kill things
faster<00:03:36.129> I<00:03:37.319> guess<00:03:38.319> that<00:03:38.530> was<00:03:38.650> faster<00:03:39.900> but<00:03:40.900> the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
faster I guess that was faster but the

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.709 
faster I guess that was faster but the
strength<00:03:42.010> is<00:03:42.250> supposed<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.639> be<00:03:42.730> faster<00:03:43.150> wait<00:03:43.689> a

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:43.719 
strength is supposed to be faster wait a

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:48.750 
strength is supposed to be faster wait a
second<00:03:44.909> maybe<00:03:45.909> we<00:03:45.969> have<00:03:46.060> certain<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.609> next

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
second maybe we have certain so the next

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.259 
second maybe we have certain so the next
one<00:03:48.879> is<00:03:49.000> strength<00:03:49.420> too<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.129> it<00:03:51.129> hunger<00:03:51.760> as<00:03:51.939> you

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
one is strength too and it hunger as you

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.039 
one is strength too and it hunger as you
can<00:03:52.450> see<00:03:52.689> right<00:03:52.989> there<00:03:53.730> my<00:03:54.730> hunger<00:03:55.120> nuggets

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
can see right there my hunger nuggets

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.140 
can see right there my hunger nuggets

they are like it's almost like you're
poisoned<00:04:01.769> so<00:04:03.150> like<00:04:04.150> Oh<00:04:04.950> anybody<00:04:05.950> wanna<00:04:06.159> die

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:12.059 
poisoned so like Oh anybody wanna die
anybody<00:04:07.799> anybody<00:04:09.120> kill<00:04:10.120> me<00:04:10.299> there<00:04:10.750> we<00:04:11.069> all

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
anybody anybody kill me there we all

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:14.849 
anybody anybody kill me there we all
right<00:04:12.189> so<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.840> saw<00:04:14.019> the<00:04:14.079> last<00:04:14.260> one<00:04:14.530> took<00:04:14.650> about

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
right so you saw the last one took about

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.819 
right so you saw the last one took about
four<00:04:15.129> hits<00:04:16.380> okay<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.440> want<00:04:17.620> to<00:04:17.680> run<00:04:17.799> away

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 
four hits okay you want to run away

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.640 
four hits okay you want to run away
that's<00:04:18.220> cool<00:04:19.889> that's<00:04:20.889> two<00:04:21.609> hits<00:04:21.820> um<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.990> think

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
that's cool that's two hits um I think

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.550 
that's cool that's two hits um I think
that<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:25.000> tested<00:04:25.449> this<00:04:25.750> out<00:04:25.900> earlier<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.500> I

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
that I tested this out earlier and I

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.040 
that I tested this out earlier and I
killed<00:04:26.889> a<00:04:27.130> cow<00:04:27.849> with<00:04:27.880> one<00:04:28.360> hit<00:04:28.599> that<00:04:28.900> was<00:04:29.020> a

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
killed a cow with one hit that was a

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.469 
killed a cow with one hit that was a
critical<00:04:29.470> hit<00:04:29.590> so<00:04:30.460> I'm<00:04:30.610> guessing<00:04:30.849> if<00:04:31.180> you<00:04:31.300> want

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
critical hit so I'm guessing if you want

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.360 
critical hit so I'm guessing if you want
to<00:04:31.539> jump<00:04:31.720> and<00:04:31.870> kill<00:04:32.050> something<00:04:32.409> that<00:04:33.130> would<00:04:33.280> be

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
to jump and kill something that would be

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.339 
to jump and kill something that would be
the<00:04:33.460> best<00:04:33.610> time<00:04:34.919> so<00:04:35.919> the<00:04:36.010> next<00:04:36.130> one<00:04:36.490> is<00:04:37.349> the

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
the best time so the next one is the

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.540 
the best time so the next one is the
clear<00:04:38.590> potion<00:04:39.010> which<00:04:39.159> is<00:04:39.310> speed<00:04:39.639> and<00:04:39.760> haste<00:04:39.970> um

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
clear potion which is speed and haste um

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.510 
clear potion which is speed and haste um
yes<00:04:42.550> you<00:04:43.479> do<00:04:43.659> have<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:43.930> haste<00:04:44.289> yes<00:04:45.130> you<00:04:45.370> do

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
yes you do have the haste yes you do

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.129 
yes you do have the haste yes you do
have<00:04:45.789> what<00:04:46.510> you<00:04:46.570> don't<00:04:46.750> have<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.930> speed

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
have what you don't have the speed

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.939 
have what you don't have the speed
anymore<00:04:47.409> because<00:04:47.740> of<00:04:47.949> the<00:04:48.070> weakness<00:04:49.020> but<00:04:50.020> you

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:50.949 
anymore because of the weakness but you

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:55.469 
anymore because of the weakness but you
want<00:04:51.099> to<00:04:51.159> take<00:04:51.310> the<00:04:52.710> speed<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:54.669> speed<00:04:54.880> if<00:04:55.300> you

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
want to take the speed the speed if you

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.310 
want to take the speed the speed if you
take<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.840> speed<00:04:56.229> three<00:04:56.650> and<00:04:57.599> this<00:04:58.599> you<00:04:59.169> will

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320 
take the speed three and this you will

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.010 
take the speed three and this you will
get<00:04:59.409> the<00:04:59.560> heats<00:04:59.800> too<00:05:00.300> but<00:05:01.300> it<00:05:01.419> always<00:05:01.659> keeps

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
get the heats too but it always keeps

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.300 
get the heats too but it always keeps
the<00:05:02.320> highest<00:05:02.849> speed<00:05:03.849> or<00:05:04.780> strength<00:05:05.470> and

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
the highest speed or strength and

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.240 
the highest speed or strength and
whatnot<00:05:06.669> like<00:05:07.210> if<00:05:07.360> its<00:05:07.539> strength<00:05:07.900> three<00:05:08.250> you

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
whatnot like if its strength three you

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.950 
whatnot like if its strength three you
will<00:05:09.370> get<00:05:09.550> you<00:05:10.000> will<00:05:10.030> always<00:05:10.419> have<00:05:10.449> strength

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
will get you will always have strength
