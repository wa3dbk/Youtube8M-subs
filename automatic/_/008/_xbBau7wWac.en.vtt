00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.950
 and it is moreover I hope you 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.150
 be well 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.670
 today we find ourselves for finally 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.980
 a new video tutorial kama and 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.189
 it's a video that works very very 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.619
 well 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.630
 but I have the example I am new 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.640
 million 2,2 kama and thanks to this 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.789
 Technical I think I got to 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.410
 about 6 5724 she is very simple 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.530
 all that good farm it takes a 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.530
 basic minimum of kama but do not go 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.030
 huge than that but it depends on the days 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.660
 but you will see that she is not so 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.760
 complicated than that 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:48.570
 so a daily quest when we 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.800
 called the almanac that is to discover 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.079
 every day so a new one will say 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.670
 resources is apt to bring to a ben j 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.719
 in exchange for two different bonuses have 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.619
 to say at stake so here today it's 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.510
 a bonus brought to the area of the island of 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.360
 grubb so these two for his challenge 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.700
 increase if we bring if we do the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.210
 quest and this quest today 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:22.500
 was to report back Water 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.479
 to the forgiveness of ghosts of leeuw pardo he 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.479
 seems to me so we'll look at the prices 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.890
 they are currently at 59 kame at then 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.140
 you will tell me but yes but 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.280
 okay but what's the technique 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.680
 in all this and well the traits without 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.869
 what do you do to it while the prices 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.189
 fall so you do like me then 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.250
 either you can go drop and in the 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.470
 zone hours of both techniques in a 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.869
 in fact you can either go drop and 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.390
 ghosts areas of water in leopard 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.009
 the island of grubb so be with your team 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.210
 or friends and you sell co50 min t gold 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.219
 since two guards are needed 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.350
 100,000 kama for 2 oc is still 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.579
 pretty huge 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.740
 or just wait until you 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.290
 someone put the price broken prices 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.280
 so put your family we will tell me 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.990
 for example I bought roughly 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.110
 I think I bought some I think 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.050
 that 17 to 20 miles roughly and I 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.840
 've sold 40 so I am 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.030
 does double kamas so your 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.569
 quickly what happens iron 16 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.880
 once in 1000 it gives me three hundred 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:35.020
 twenty thousand kama and I resold them 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:38.709
 at 40000 so what makes us 16 x 48 and 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.190
 we have a kama base at the end of 640 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.130
 miles 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.959
 cama then we double our cam as for 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.060
 a technique that's pretty simple then 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.010
 you can simply go drop 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.700
 and you know how to be total benefix 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.170
 profits by us but it's more 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.550
 complicated to have a team x and has 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:59.050
 so to be aware of gal mande 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.450
 in relation to the drop 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.390
 if you have a team you can know 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.269
 to the advanced objects reported 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.530
 so you go to the little extra or 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.980
 otherwise you already have it in your 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.140
 selection so does an almanac this 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.459
 then you click on calendar that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.400
 will not open you just the jo 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.140
 green and you end up here at 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.540
 right we have a little calendar so 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.980
 today we click here and we can see 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.530
 to bring back two ghost waters 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.860
 of leonardo for February 25 is for 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.100
 tomorrow 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.489
 the 26th we will have to be clicked 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.360
 it will be necessary to recover 3 inches of mosquito a 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.840
 reported a pnj 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:42.040
 so either you buy a day in the front 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.430
 so we will look at the prices they are 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.079
 currently 14000 then you can 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.480
 buy the stock has receive emptied the 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.609
 jv and you put everything back as a 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.329
 gentleman to 40000 so you make a 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:57.310
 big sum of quadrupled kamau is worth the 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.019
 price and it's quite profitable and it goes 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.299
 of course because there are a lot of people 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.400
 who make it what they buy 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:05.019
 that's all for this technique 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.700
 kama I hope you understood it 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.890
 she is not that hard but 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.940
 frankly i think alex here at 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.440
 toulon 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.000
 on what you can tell me what 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.110
 you think by comments that this 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.209
 that it looks on our servers 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.440
 if you practice it or not but you 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.810
 can you tell me all this by comment 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.270
 the saints nike if you liked you 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.040
 subscribe so here is a small precision 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.100
 I bought myself a new microphone 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.710
 do not know if it means but in any case 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.540
 me it's already better to a high level 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.210
 to hold it and that's because the other 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.260
 was not too famous it's a microphone 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.540
 it's enough we're fine here there is 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.160
 no words here so on this I you 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.940
 wish a very good evening and 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.920
 See you soon 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.920
 it is served to all ciao
