00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
anywhere on this that's number one okay

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.130 
anywhere on this that's number one okay
so<00:03:05.739> is<00:03:05.980> it<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.400> hard<00:03:06.819> core<00:03:07.260> code<00:03:08.260> or<00:03:09.989> type<00:03:10.989> of

so is it a hard core code or type of

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.580 
so is it a hard core code or type of
situation<00:03:11.650> number<00:03:11.920> two<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:13.269> it<00:03:13.599> is<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:14.440> an

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
elaborate hoax is it all just a sham and

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.990 
elaborate hoax is it all just a sham and
gibberish<00:03:19.000> and<00:03:19.239> meaningless<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:21.430> problem

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
gibberish and meaningless the problem

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.300 
gibberish and meaningless the problem
with<00:03:22.150> that<00:03:22.180> is<00:03:22.829> nobody's<00:03:23.829> been<00:03:24.010> able<00:03:24.099> to
