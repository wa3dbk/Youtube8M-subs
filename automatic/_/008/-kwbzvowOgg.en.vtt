00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:05.100
 tired of watching numerous guides by 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.080
 dota 2 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.480
 go to this channel you will find here 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.519
 satirical trash just funny 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.150
 video for this game is a reference on the screen and 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.190
 in description 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.080
 hello gangsters panda with you honestly 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.180
 saying you ask why the challenges 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.640
 come out so rarely yes because good 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.050
 few interesting challenges 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.689
 thematic challenge i find amusing but 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.849
 not that super cool ideas 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.160
 less today is such a challenge to us 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.790
 offered to play for ice for ice 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.800
 guys well, I already thought of this brew 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.010
 the judges forced my subscribers 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.040
 opponents play fire as you see in 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.260
 our team winter returned tsmk tusk 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.300
 and less this is paris in minus team 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.340
 it begs itself all very dead 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.870
 that is, our only kid who 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.520
 can really survive and lotus car well 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.789
 this is certainly not the toughest tank in 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.489
 the game 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.379
 so I collected the bag in the tank yes no 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.020
 I'm just a moron so self-esteem there 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.039
 not that they understood them tired of that 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.149
 batch spider sit down 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:05.549
 and gather to the tank as for the heroes 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.729
 Of course we have a good mass ultimate 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.979
 and I love very much and Shindo Paris must be very 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.040
 good too lich teapot especially under 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.479
 Aganim scary and absolutely absolutely thing 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.180
 breaks all that is possible on its way and 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 makes opponents nervous 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.869
 strongly nervous that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.280
 It concerns the heroes of our opponents 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.470
 here of course a lot more 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.140
 variations here have a great design 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.450
 doom love this kid because he 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.750
 thinks and just this is just space through 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.340
 BKB breaks this very thought and 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.650
 accordingly it becomes very painful 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.100
 usually the house was on me therefore me like 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.140
 ratings had to suffer a lot 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.479
