00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:12.799 

okay<00:00:09.660> today's<00:00:10.049> obstacle<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.920> eBridge<00:00:11.809> we

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
okay today's obstacle is the eBridge we

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.280 
okay today's obstacle is the eBridge we
started<00:00:13.139> looking<00:00:13.290> at<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.740> more

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
started looking at this more

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.570 
started looking at this more
we<00:00:14.380> going<00:00:14.530> to<00:00:14.559> put<00:00:14.620> a<00:00:14.860> break<00:00:15.100> in<00:00:15.340> they've<00:00:15.550> got

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
we going to put a break in they've got

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.220 
we going to put a break in they've got
all<00:00:15.760> the<00:00:15.850> parts<00:00:16.059> in<00:00:16.240> the<00:00:16.270> bracket<00:00:16.720> so<00:00:16.900> we<00:00:16.930> start

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
all the parts in the bracket so we start

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.010 
all the parts in the bracket so we start
measuring<00:00:17.530> it<00:00:17.619> up<00:00:17.770> and<00:00:17.890> put<00:00:18.010> it<00:00:18.130> in<00:00:18.869> and<00:00:19.869> when

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
measuring it up and put it in and when

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.030 
measuring it up and put it in and when
we<00:00:20.140> get<00:00:20.290> into<00:00:20.500> come<00:00:22.020> son<00:00:23.020> has<00:00:23.680> a<00:00:23.710> little

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:24.040 
we get into come son has a little

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.630 
we get into come son has a little
problem<00:00:24.340> with<00:00:24.369> the<00:00:24.520> shifter<00:00:25.710> so<00:00:26.710> their

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
problem with the shifter so their

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.519 
problem with the shifter so their
solution<00:00:28.240> was<00:00:28.300> to<00:00:28.360> angle<00:00:28.779> it<00:00:28.840> like<00:00:28.990> this<00:00:29.259> to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
solution was to angle it like this to

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.749 
solution was to angle it like this to
get<00:00:29.619> it<00:00:29.740> away<00:00:29.800> from<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.099> shifter<00:00:30.489> we<00:00:30.610> don't

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759 
get it away from the shifter we don't

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.159 
get it away from the shifter we don't
like<00:00:30.910> that<00:00:31.090> it<00:00:31.239> looks<00:00:31.419> stupid<00:00:31.660> who<00:00:31.960> saw<00:00:32.110> an

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
like that it looks stupid who saw an

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.990 
like that it looks stupid who saw an
earache<00:00:32.470> but<00:00:32.619> a<00:00:32.649> card<00:00:32.890> once<00:00:33.100> I<00:00:33.280> played<00:00:33.489> in<00:00:33.880> the

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
earache but a card once I played in the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.040 
earache but a card once I played in the
card<00:00:34.210> alongside<00:00:34.420> buddy

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
card alongside buddy

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.660 
card alongside buddy
so<00:00:36.010> what<00:00:36.130> we<00:00:36.250> decided<00:00:36.399> to<00:00:36.760> do<00:00:36.970> is<00:00:38.489> trim<00:00:39.489> our

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
so what we decided to do is trim our

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.910 
so what we decided to do is trim our
brake<00:00:39.910> handle<00:00:40.329> here<00:00:40.989> we<00:00:41.200> got<00:00:41.320> lots<00:00:41.559> of<00:00:41.680> tab

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
brake handle here we got lots of tab

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.590 
brake handle here we got lots of tab
we're<00:00:42.250> going<00:00:42.280> to<00:00:42.460> bend<00:00:42.640> this<00:00:42.760> down<00:00:42.820> to<00:00:43.239> flatten

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
we're going to bend this down to flatten

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.000 
we're going to bend this down to flatten
it<00:00:43.660> out<00:00:43.860> we<00:00:44.860> saw<00:00:45.160> this<00:00:45.340> end<00:00:45.579> off<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:45.880> tab

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
it out we saw this end off the tab

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.330 
it out we saw this end off the tab
offset<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:48.550> whole<00:00:48.730> assembly<00:00:49.950> over<00:00:50.950> toward

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
offset the whole assembly over toward

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.010 
offset the whole assembly over toward
the<00:00:51.430> passenger<00:00:51.820> side<00:00:52.090> this<00:00:52.570> gives<00:00:52.810> us<00:00:52.930> a

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
the passenger side this gives us a

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.230 
the passenger side this gives us a
little<00:00:53.140> more<00:00:53.350> clearance<00:00:53.650> when<00:00:54.610> this<00:00:54.760> tap<00:00:55.030> goes

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.240 
little more clearance when this tap goes

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.520 
little more clearance when this tap goes
down<00:00:55.510> this<00:00:55.690> is<00:00:55.840> going<00:00:55.990> to<00:00:56.050> come<00:00:56.200> up<00:00:56.320> a<00:00:56.440> little

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
down this is going to come up a little

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.710 
down this is going to come up a little
bit<00:00:56.830> so<00:00:57.450> here<00:00:59.220> and<00:01:00.220> then<00:01:00.460> we<00:01:00.579> throw<00:01:00.760> a<00:01:00.850> look

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
bit so here and then we throw a look

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:12.719 
bit so here and then we throw a look
over<00:01:02.079> on<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.930> going<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.200> sit<00:01:11.729> approximately

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
over on it's going to sit approximately

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.490 
over on it's going to sit approximately
in<00:01:12.850> that<00:01:13.030> position<00:01:14.579> see<00:01:15.579> we<00:01:15.700> can<00:01:15.850> do

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:27.590 

this<00:01:19.500> requires<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.040> little<00:01:20.250> flattening

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:02:00.969 

yes<00:01:28.140> exactly<00:01:28.920> what<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.190> want<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:30.210> one<00:01:30.420> fall

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:15.330 

will<00:02:01.979> comprise<00:02:02.490> about<00:02:03.119> oh<00:02:03.510> yeah

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.400
