00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 what presenters for the 2010 season scatter if I also 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:04.990
 would you do 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.510
 in purity telephone 22 34 0 9 90 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.639
 when we are stranded by a mechanical malfunction we already know that a 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.630
 platform to get us cut out car and translates it to a somewhat 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.439
 but what happens when it comes to a workshop a bus 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.449
 uu 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.189
 Today we are going to show you the largest platform that exists in our country 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.510
 Pablo can write me 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.350
 how is this platform working 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.340
 good of this equipment 3 is not well known that the country is that can 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340
 sound an articulated team I'm not going 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.700
 articulated for heavy vehicle touch 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.239
 cargo trucks eight machinery 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.200
 the team 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.370
 per cent the particularity is that it is articulated until then the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.850
 ground 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.010
 already with the tandem 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.160
 reaches the ground 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
 and he has his own wenger frank that with those changes 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.090
 what kind of vehicles does this platform support 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.210
 normally we finish buses 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.440
 trucks 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.220
 and I was working the ditches 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.109
 percent light vehicles like led up to four vehicles 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.920
 other vehicles suffer from this evil 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.660
 at the same time 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.380
 what has been the biggest load they have carried 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.230
 in being 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.580
 the biggest load 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 feafes dates from more than the buses percent show it or two harvesters 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.080
 two harvesters that we moved to managua nicaragua 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.220
 and how was that trip 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.120
 the book collects the expected results 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.280
 It was very interesting because at least painful new or ovarian several 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.789
 neighborhoods 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:54.789
 several heads but we forget wolf and only this one 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.340
 it's not that it was very interesting because 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.110
 he praised them for lemon 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.280
 to managua nicaragua 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.470
 explain us 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.040
 how this crane works, they have their own system works well all 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.949
 the head depends on how it is 

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.089
 but already has its own engine 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.489
 which feeds the hydraulic pump 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.539
 it is handled rear 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.539
 completely blind a waiter as long as he takes 1200 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:25.719
 and with that it was with that 1200 engine of hears all the 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.809
 with that motive is the motor of the facts she 

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:33.389
 per cent administered to iker still and with all the equipment completely 

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:39.469
 perfect now yes explain to me then what does each of these parts serve 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.839
 that these pieces that we see here 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.929
 basically it's like 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:47.079
 Novoa banking did not start badly 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:48.729
 has its accelerator 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:51.669
 and think estva was unique to out if still 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.019
 p to compare those four motions 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.659
 it would 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.119
 the talent displacement ace the wings 

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:03.309
 the decile articulation of the 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:06.309
 of the back ramp of the front clothes 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.439
 let's go to the show 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.439
 of the capacity of the equipment by raising the heads 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.709
 all the weight of the ramp and the vehicle to be traced is supported by 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.709
 these two main roads 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.829
 when operating the lever 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.990
 the back tests if they start to rest 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.249
 towards the back of the platform 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:51.209
 this generates if the tandem 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.209
 slide over the main roads 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.639
 and that the entire technical platform 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:01.639
 he starts his life 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.880
 by actuating the next lever 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.640
 his great hobbies that move the front joint ignite 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:14.629
 and that place the vehicle in the position where it will finally be 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.629
 transported 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.509
 we really were very impressed by the load capacity and ease of 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:24.300
 operation 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.059
 of a platform of this type 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:30.349
 whose main difference with its predecessors is its ability to bend 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:31.849
 Chile 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.849
 the collection and transport of heavy vehicles 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:37.949
 We already returned with more than 2pp.
