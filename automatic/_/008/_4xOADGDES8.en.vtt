00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.200
 in the last episode of 10 things that did not 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.450
 you knew about we talked about mario the character 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.880
 most beloved of video games but to the 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.970
 shadow of this great character is his 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.340
 antagonist is going to be a giant reptile 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.320
 wanting to crush and damage everything 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.020
 that is in its path in order to abduct 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.360
 to princess peach this antihero has 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.670
 many details and curiosities but no 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.930
 they are very public that we say and because of 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.500
 that the previous video was to your liking 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.840
 today I present 10 things 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.260
 you did not know about bowser 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.300
 let's start number 10 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.730
 did you know it's going to be appeared in the 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.350
 movie of ralph the demolitioner in the 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.660
 scene where rare is being surrounded by 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.030
 many evils of video games here 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.260
 I leave the scene the truth is that it is a 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.680
 very interesting cameo 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.900
 number 9 you knew how low it was received 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.520
 changes in its appearance like 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.890
 several characters from the saga in the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.049
 first game where it's going to be debuted was 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.060
 mostly green and formed from 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.560
 pixels obviously this was the 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.200
 limitations of console hardware 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.420
 in mario bros 3 was given a change 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.670
 more aesthetic where you put hair 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.060
 fierce eyes and mouth making 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.020
 Bowser is a more intimidating opponent 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.329
 number 8 did you know that facer is inspired 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.030
 in the king of the demons jianmao of a 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.039
 Chinese tale called journey to the west 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.490
 I think that's where his form comes from so 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.930
 terrifying of a demon child fuck 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.640
 I never thought it was going to be 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.439
 inspired by a demon although if I 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.460
 it gave a little good fear of the child 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.450
 we are all very scared 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.450
 number 7 in japan the real name of 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.580
 bowser is for which it is used in 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.940
 television series in the West its 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.380
 name is going to be your last name 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.970
 curiously in super mario world the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.610
 Bowser's name can be read in the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.280
 castle in the pad and nsc versions or 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.660
 be in the versions for europe and for 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.900
 america while the versions 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.370
 Japanese can be read so weird 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.690
 that according to a region they change the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.760
 name a character not number 6 in the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.610
 year 2001 in the game of super smash bros 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.400
 I gave myself to be is modified suffers a 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.320
 new very very evil transformation 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.630
 as if I had left behind all form 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.300
 previous will be change to the degree that 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.820
 he seems possessed by some malignant entity and 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:43.120
 is that he is no longer the mocking boxer of before 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.300
 but it's a darker boxer so it's me 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.680
 I mean bowser maybe this you know 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.600
 for the eggs of smash bros but 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.000
 it really is a curious fact that is worth 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.180
 very much worth mentioning and I hope and you 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.180
 I liked it 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.560
 number 5 or theories say it's going to be 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.690
 evolved or transformed into came to 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.600
 be as a consequence of waste from 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.640
 the magic of Came Zincamex the magician who 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.260
 we saw in many previous games that 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.240
 with its great magic it made bushehr 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.610
 grow in incommensurable sizes 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.560
 other theories say that it becomes 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.360
 came to being due to rage and 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.610
 impotence he feels when he can not 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.340
 defeat our hero like this is 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.290
 to mario both theories are really very 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.520
 Interesting but not today 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.860
 know if they are 100% certain 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.390
 Did you know that the little wizard 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.090
 that we see in some games of mario 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.670
 bros as yoshi's island is the teacher and 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.470
 bowser mentor in many games what 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.510
 we have seen how I am before or that 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.650
 seeming to be under his command this is 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.450
 because he came 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.550
 due to the love that kept him to be 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.040
 he lets him do what he likes even though 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.100
 really according to the game came that is 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.960
 much stronger than pau be what it does 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.030
 a father for his son and in this case 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.660
 it would be his adoptive father since it's going to be 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.660
 our son 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.540
 number 3 there is a great rumor about the 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.580
 bowser's father although he has never 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.620
 seen nothing of him in the games or has 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.660
 talked about him there is a theory that says 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.120
 that the name of Bowser's father could 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.459
 have been called dead in guilt since 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.410
 is super mario world is nes one of the 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.900
 children or helpers of bowser has the 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.850
 name of mortal juniors cup as if 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.280
 will treat your grandfather's name as 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:35.010
 He is used to it because he is the father of 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.010
 blame it since this if you did not know 

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:40.119
 number 2 who is the mother of walser 

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:42.039
 juniors 

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:44.139
 although we have already seen the little one in 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.029
 several of the games in the saga are never 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:47.799
 has spoken of the mother of the same and is 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:50.259
 that pau be tells the little guy that the 

00:04:47.799 --> 00:04:51.759
 princess peach is her mother this could be 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.859
 he says it in order to have more 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.809
 rivalry with mario although sources do not 

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:58.479
 Nintendo officials say it's going to be 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:05:01.089
 had a wife named claudia if 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.549
 claudia with w and not claudia as is 

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:06.399
 used the same source does not reveal 

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:08.649
 but he says that claudia abandoned bowser 

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:10.419
 because he did not share his interest in 

00:05:08.649 --> 00:05:12.939
 do evil to the kingdom of ciampino 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.889
 really this curiosity I did not know 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:17.440
 and I do not know if it's real but it is 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:20.860
 interesting 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.780
 number 1 did you know that nintendo changed the 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.680
 history of the coupÃ© links follows the 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.810
 sons of bowser 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.390
 and I say change because in super mario bros 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.010
 3 will be your children but after the 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.110
 appearance of junior bowser miyamoto 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.150
 he noted that the spit the link were not 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.520
 Bowser's children this happened in the 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.220
 2012 and hence the origin of the coupons 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.110
 it was as unknown and apparently already 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.270
 the topic has never been discussed 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.280
 and well we have reached the end of this 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.140
 video which of these curiosities do not 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.830
 Did you know please tell me in the box 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.750
 comments 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.160
 also tell me which character you would like 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.530
 that we knew in this series 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.760
 for example the link if the video liked you 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.620
 please support what I like 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.390
 share it with your friends so that the 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.910
 channel can continue to grow and if you are 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:06.310
 new subscribe I have been serious 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.310
