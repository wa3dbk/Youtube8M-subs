 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.740
 I want you more video today 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.990
 like protective films for the ipad mini 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.900
 imagine these are the so-called baby 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.690
 targets protective films from the brand into the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.310
 or innovative inception 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.960
 Thanks for that the links are like 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.960
 always below in the video description 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.510
 There are two different variants of 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.579
 these films where both a big 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.500
 advantage and have a big disadvantage 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.719
 we have the crystal clear here 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.670
 Variation that means they are the whole 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.960
 normal films that one knows so well the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.280
 Display quality will not work 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.200
 impaired it really looks 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.910
 through the film as if you had none 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.370
 foil it but of course you have 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.070
 as many fingerprints on it as 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.420
 otherwise on the normal display too 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.739
 We also have the reviews 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.360
 claire variant 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.820
 that is very cool you have it clear 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.070
 less fingerprints on the display 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.809
 or on the slide 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.300
 works great but the display 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.549
 Quality is compromised because of this 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.650
 film is not very clear like this 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.299
 Variant but rather a bit 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.710
 milk I would call it that 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.470
 Packaging content is at both 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.909
 we look exactly the same 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.369
 just come in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.520
 there we have three of the respective ones 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.439
 then slide a short instruction here 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.600
 how to install the whole and in here 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.670
 are still a cleaning cloth a small card 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.439
 the blow case which admit 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.979
 to squeeze out and then we have here 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.630
 two stickers on the ipad mini 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.030
 At the moment is the crystal 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.130
 clear version of the protective film the 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.479
 is really very fitting we can 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.790
 We like that here you just from the 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.399
 see close when you look there times 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.799
 here you can see no double edges 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.680
 So that really fits pretty well 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.149
 and she was very easy to attach 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.560
 Now I have the display 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.320
 Adjusted for that , we are not like that now 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.689
 many fingerprints on it but like that 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.030
 that's the way it is now if I here the ipad 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.409
 serve then you get very much 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.860
 quickly the whole fat finger there again 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.540
 it 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.189
 unfortunately that can be done with this 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.530
 avoid film here 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.599
 but what the hell are there anti 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.080
 claire films that we want us 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.670
 attach together and before 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.360
 If we do that we will pull this one here 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:21.430
 now just off and though on the 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.830
 Protective film I say a little bit 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.140
 it was because I was there something yes 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.780
 it got've seen on here 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.420
 the display that there quite office 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.730
 So that's super clean has none 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.680
 scratches or similar the protective effect 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.660
 So it was really good 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.240
 Of course, you have to be your first 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.880
 clean the display very well with either 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.500
 the supplied or you take her 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.600
 just some detergent like 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.460
 for example, queen to go is extra for 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.600
 such purposes made that is actually 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.930
 also pretty good 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.760
 Okay then have one here now 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.459
 clean display hopefully no 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.080
 Dustkorn more is business 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.950
 Let's just have our anti 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.740
 glare foil 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.630
 Now we have two protective films 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.070
 so to speak again on the protective film 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.840
 that means we have here once the 1 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.630
 stand there on the other side 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.709
 the 2 we have to go this page first 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.709
 solve here 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.360
 to bake 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.189
 and if you go to his 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.079
 you have contributed satisfaction 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.150
 It did not work right away 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.040
 but that does not matter 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.620
 Fit now, then you just pull 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.829
 Carefully the second slide down here 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.049
 so the second protection of the 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.930
 Protective film and then we have now 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.450
 here the finished foil applied 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.709
 the installation of the film is so 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.420
 quite easy 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.879
 you just really have to watch that 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.070
 you have no dust in between me 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.720
 it happens now here in the studio unfortunately 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.519
 It was a bit difficult that too 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.260
 whole by the camera in the reason too 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.120
 because they are still in front of me 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.639
 even if I unfortunately have it here 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.410
 two three put a small dust grain 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.760
 got in between by then 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.770
 Of course, now a little bubble 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.419
 that is a pity but if you 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.400
 that really neat makes you there 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.720
 take a little rest for the display 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.580
 neatly clean then there is 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.530
 really no problems as you 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.150
 hopefully also at the crystal 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.699
 clear foil the before I wait for it 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.500
 So just deducted have seen there 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.750
 were no bubbles in it 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.460
 otherwise if still such a two blow 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.840
 there are now where anything under is where 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.849
 just not the bubble out right 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.560
 go or wait a few hours the 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:57.180
 usually pull themselves out by themselves 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.490
 and then you should be pretty 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.560
 then we have good results here 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.770
 already arrived at the conclusion the 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.340
 how many slides from the inside I like 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.349
 very well 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.360
 you can easily attach them you are 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.830
 qualitatively pretty high quality and above 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.720
 very important, of course, very much 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.190
 perfect fit so that's really real 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.800
 One hundred percent with the recesses 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.630
 and also generally with the size me 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.060
 personally like the crystal clear 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.050
 Variant much better than the reviews 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.880
 claire version 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.039
 simply because I like that one 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.810
 the protective film barely looks and that one 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.370
 she hardly feels when using the 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.260
 this is really the case here 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.120
 but of course you have the whole 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.130
 fingerprints still on it though 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.860
 not to change without protective film 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.260
 that would be just as clear as videos 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.729
 are also pretty good but i like 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.440
 this feeling does not make it from the 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:45.930
 look a bit rougher 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.460
 Basically I do not like it that way 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.690
 In addition, the screen quality is so 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.789
 a bit compromised you have 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.529
 you could feel like that 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:53.939
 a little bit more the pixels 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.619
 that can be described very badly 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.329
 if you have the opportunity look 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:58.319
 you simply times somewhere on the 

00:05:57.329 --> 00:06:00.629
 will be the best 

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.069
 but you have as good as no 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.989
 fingerprints on it and that is 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.849
 really just super cool and before 

00:06:03.989 --> 00:06:07.109
 of course very easy to do that 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:07.829
 So everyone has to do it for themselves 

00:06:07.109 --> 00:06:08.999
 decide 

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:10.709
 you are welcome in the comments 

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:12.929
 let's say what you're doing 

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:14.699
 so if he favors the whole 

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:16.529
 clear since or rather against this 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.539
 anti fingerprint slides 

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:20.489
 I would be very happy then missing 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:23.519
 only the price the crystal clear 

00:06:20.489 --> 00:06:25.949
 Foils cost about 3 pack here approximately 

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:30.089
 17 euro the videos clarify something 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:31.649
 cheaper are the prices at 14 euros 

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:32.969
 are only approximate information because I am 

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:35.009
 whole simply from another currency 

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:37.319
 but had to convert is not a problem 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:40.559
 I think the prices for a 3 Series 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.479
 pack is just fine this one 

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:44.249
 in size for the ipad mini 

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:46.229
 or for the ipad they are 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:48.929
 a bit more expensive than protective films for 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:50.219
 a cellphone but they are qualitatively as 

00:06:48.929 --> 00:06:52.289
 very high quality and do it completely 

00:06:50.219 --> 00:06:54.449
 your purpose you just have to be yourself 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:56.849
 decide which variant he is here 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:58.919
 I would rather thank you again 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:00.599
 to where we are now at the end 

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:02.399
 I hope the video has you 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:04.739
 please drop me in the 

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:06.449
 comments or thumbs up 

00:07:04.739 --> 00:07:09.679
 and then I hope that we join 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:09.679
 See you next time makes you feel good
