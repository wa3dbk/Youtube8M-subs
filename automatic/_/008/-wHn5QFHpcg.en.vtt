we're realizing that trees provide

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.210 
we're realizing that trees provide
multiple<00:00:29.749> benefits<00:00:30.289> not<00:00:30.560> just<00:00:30.829> the<00:00:30.949> shade

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
multiple benefits not just the shade

multiple benefits not just the shade
that<00:00:31.429> we<00:00:31.519> have<00:00:31.609> traditionally<00:00:32.150> planted<00:00:32.540> them

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
that we have traditionally planted them

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.360 
that we have traditionally planted them
for<00:00:32.870> in<00:00:32.960> our<00:00:33.079> cities<00:00:33.470> but<00:00:33.980> also<00:00:34.130> the

they provide trees are beautiful they

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.390 
they provide trees are beautiful they
are<00:00:38.810> niceties<00:00:39.560> but<00:00:39.770> we're<00:00:39.920> realizing<00:00:40.160> that

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
are niceties but we're realizing that

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.180 
are niceties but we're realizing that
they<00:00:40.520> are<00:00:40.550> also<00:00:40.820> necessities<00:00:41.810> trees<00:00:42.710> provide

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
they are also necessities trees provide

importantly particularly in a place like
Portland<00:00:53.480> where<00:00:53.780> we<00:00:53.870> get<00:00:53.990> a<00:00:54.020> lot<00:00:54.230> of<00:00:54.260> rain<00:00:54.590> they

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
Portland where we get a lot of rain they

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.970 
Portland where we get a lot of rain they
also<00:00:55.580> sequester<00:00:56.180> carbon<00:00:56.390> and<00:00:56.840> they<00:00:57.590> also

also sequester carbon and they also

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.010 
also sequester carbon and they also
purify<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.880> air<00:00:59.000> by<00:00:59.360> capturing<00:00:59.840> air
