00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.769
 You often ask me what I do 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.389
 your hair and bright colors 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.250
 despite the fact that I responded to these 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.330
 questions already one hundred times let one 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.710
 keep asking 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.710
 decided to end this once and for all 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.990
 how to make yourself bright hair and so 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.560
 the first thing we have to do is open 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.900
 your laptop 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.210
 open google and google color varnishes 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.180
 for hair and your city or everything is fast well 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.130
 that is, I live in Ukraine and I google 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.450
 This site mass immediately knocked that is 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.610
 it's not a problem at all 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.059
 I thought third countries also order from 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.420
 my dear sweetie so there are 12 colors 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.760
 it costs them and 12 slippers cost me 150 g 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.120
 with the commission fee cheaper but did not 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.699
 at the cheapest there are packs there 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.300
 sets of 50 which is generally like you 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.460
 want it yourself 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.190
 the second thing we need is to follow 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.920
 they write on the internet that they paint any 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.170
 hair is now even if you have blonde 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.939
 hair why you dyed checked 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.979
 the hair among you the brighter and 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.260
 you get the color that is necessary 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.930
 track hair i can advise bath 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.439
 eat if your hair is dark as 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.200
 like mine 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.450
 you will need 2 colors here is the center 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.080
 hair there is something called 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.909
 These are wonderful gloves that you can 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.830
 sneak in any supermarket highlighting and 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.810
 who in general is possible without gloves 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.200
 on just if you take a bright color 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.450
 what then you have blue and not 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.299
 difficult to wash up get ready 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.040
 that everything will be around that color in 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.159
 which will be painted if the price is 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.979
 first time so we need to choose 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.280
 colors here I certainly have not tried everything yet 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.649
 There is already a bright bright right in general very 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.090
 strongly there is pastel not on steel 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.119
 more like it so I today myself 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:57.200
 put you can mix it i will take 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.709
 blue green can be very long and 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.140
 completely with her not dripping she was 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.819
 wet empty than smelled hair than not 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.579
 will press well and contests to 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:13.040
 wet principle is it possible this glove 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:22.129
 on her left hand she suffered the most 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:23.780
 I knew how I will not steal from everyone 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.110
 the system I just worked with it 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.900
 time just turns out to share and 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.209
 forward and also see where maxim hair 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.940
 there on the stronger of not get away means more 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.280
 the night is generally very convenient to take 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.500
 sprinkle it scary 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.430
 Ukraine, take the chalk because it will 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.299
 soak only and beautiful finger paint 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.030

 this tax is not bright i can change 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.269
 show blue the very first which 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.269
 I tried it of course very much 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.030
 that is , the difference is visible such wreaths and 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.000
 cool because they are very bright but not 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:10.880
 very much can then all around have clothes 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.820
 pillow lowland you sit all add and 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.500
 not even if you then fix a varnish on 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:25.970
 apply yourself but she will dangle 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:29.150
 this is a real world with it broke no longer 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.160
 Dala served that you can thank you paint 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.940
 quite problematic for him that I 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.860
 you can't see this practice case and take 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:45.640
 green it will turn out like that 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:45.640
 mint ears green forehead this is us she 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.500
 that's all you can still lay out if 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.270
 will be if too bright color given 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:04:00.050
 any good from above is better to beat what is 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:02.390
 for the sound if you liked this video 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.560
