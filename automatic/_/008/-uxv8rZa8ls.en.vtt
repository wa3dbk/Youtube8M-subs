helps to identify the cause of that

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.240 
helps to identify the cause of that
episode<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.630> bronchiolitis<00:01:37.259> since<00:01:38.040> other

episode of bronchiolitis since other

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.350 
episode of bronchiolitis since other

viruses can cause bronchiolitis as well

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.499 
viruses can cause bronchiolitis as well
knowing<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:42.720> was<00:01:42.869> RSV<00:01:43.560> infection

knowing that it was RSV infection

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.859 
knowing that it was RSV infection
certainly<00:01:45.509> allows<00:01:46.409> us<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.310> be<00:01:47.549> prepared<00:01:48.270> for
