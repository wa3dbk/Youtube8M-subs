00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.430
 to make your gradient all 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.240
 simply chosen is the tool 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:15.580
 rectangle draw and a rectangle on 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.580
 the turn of other pieces simply 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.760
 then gradient drawing colors 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.039
 linear so here we see point 1.2 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.380
 which corresponds to the point a red color 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.029
 electric blue dots 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.780
 so we'll change the colors 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:35.659
 double click here we come on a 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.909
 color palette so a lot of 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.670
 hue so there for the example we're going 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:41.790
 leave on a blue color a little a 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 a bit 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:48.150
 electric a nice blue for the second 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.320
 doubleclick color 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.900
 we're going out on a rose a rose a 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.410
 a little dark we almost play there 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.630
 so ok so we see that the point 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.870
 1 corresponds to the color a the point 2 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:07.290
 in colors 2 so possibility of 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.570
 move the colors to make it a 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.400
 degrade angle from left to right of the 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.229
 bottom up really like you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.890
 so here for the example we are going 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.410
 do it from top to bottom and we're going 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.840
 choose blue from the top and the 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.450
 purple that end up down so 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:29.940
 just the color you put a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.680
 rise between us we see that the blue is going 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.680
 to find oneself especially from the room 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.780
 and purple on the lower part of 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.540
 the room so we go where we will put 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.240
 at the foot to see what it gives 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.360
 to have a better rendering made final 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.810
 activated button and flying you have to 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.350
 so keep it possibility also to do 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.000
 a gradient 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.159
 radiall so drawing colors at the top 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.070
 to the left 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.300
 the dgrad and radial 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.690
 we see that we kept exactly one 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.350
 color the point a while ago which 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.780
 was the point 1 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.209
 blue find themselves in the center and the 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.290
 purple on the outside so the 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:15.230
 possibility of accentuating a rapprochement 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.760
 in the second point the first 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:22.070
 color is the same for the second 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.920
 possibility also to move the 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.050
 degrade to put it in an angle 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.950
 open the edge how are we going to do for 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.650
 this example 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.390
 so here we see that the degrade not get 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.560
 find it down it makes half 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.010
 circle here or try it here for a 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.580
 best rendering always the same active and 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.580
 to degrade done
