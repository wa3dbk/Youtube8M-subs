00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
double corner now you notice that here

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.840 
double corner now you notice that here
my<00:01:03.940> opponent<00:01:04.449> black<00:01:04.860> has<00:01:05.860> access<00:01:06.460> to<00:01:06.640> both

double corners you have to force an

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.100 
double corners you have to force an
exchange<00:01:09.910> here<00:01:10.000> because<00:01:10.420> you<00:01:10.600> can't<00:01:10.810> flush

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
exchange here because you can't flush

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.290 
exchange here because you can't flush
them<00:01:11.350> both<00:01:11.530> out<00:01:11.740> at<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.040> same<00:01:12.220> time<00:01:12.250> once<00:01:13.180> you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
them both out at the same time once you

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.240

force<00:01:13.570> an<00:01:13.750> exchange

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
force an exchange

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.020 
force an exchange
it'll<00:01:15.880> be<00:01:15.970> two-on-one<00:01:16.630> and<00:01:16.870> it's<00:01:17.410> an<00:01:17.500> easy<00:01:17.650> win

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it'll be two-on-one and it's an easy win

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.460 
it'll be two-on-one and it's an easy win
so<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.150> first<00:01:19.360> move<00:01:19.660> I<00:01:19.780> make<00:01:20.020> is<00:01:20.140> I'm<00:01:20.290> going<00:01:20.380> to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
so the first move I make is I'm going to

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.860 
so the first move I make is I'm going to
take<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:20.830> middle<00:01:21.040> king<00:01:21.910> my<00:01:22.420> king<00:01:22.450> and<00:01:22.690> I'm

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
take the middle king my king and I'm

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.170 
take the middle king my king and I'm
going<00:01:22.990> to<00:01:23.050> move<00:01:23.200> him<00:01:23.380> there<00:01:23.880> that's<00:01:24.880> my<00:01:25.000> first

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
going to move him there that's my first

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.740 
going to move him there that's my first
move<00:01:25.540> now<00:01:26.230> he<00:01:26.290> only<00:01:26.830> has<00:01:27.130> one<00:01:27.160> move<00:01:27.790> for<00:01:28.180> either

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
move now he only has one move for either

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.480 
move now he only has one move for either
King<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:29.290> that<00:01:29.320> is<00:01:29.560> toward<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.100> double

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
King and that is toward the double

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.000 
King and that is toward the double
corner<00:01:31.080> because<00:01:32.080> if<00:01:32.470> he<00:01:32.560> moves<00:01:32.770> here

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
corner because if he moves here

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.530 
corner because if he moves here
obviously<00:01:33.640> he's<00:01:33.790> going<00:01:33.940> to<00:01:34.030> get<00:01:34.120> he's<00:01:34.390> going

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
obviously he's going to get he's going

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.410 
obviously he's going to get he's going
to<00:01:34.600> sacrifice<00:01:34.750> his<00:01:35.230> man<00:01:35.470> his<00:01:36.430> King<00:01:36.700> if<00:01:36.940> he

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
to sacrifice his man his King if he

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.760 
to sacrifice his man his King if he
moves<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.890> top<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:40.720> have<00:01:40.870> to<00:01:40.990> do<00:01:41.170> is<00:01:41.410> pin

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
moves to the top all I have to do is pin

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.480 
moves to the top all I have to do is pin
him<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.540> and<00:01:43.840> then<00:01:44.590> down<00:01:44.830> here<00:01:44.890> it'll

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
him like that and then down here it'll

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.460 
him like that and then down here it'll
be<00:01:45.670> two<00:01:46.120> kings<00:01:46.450> against<00:01:46.840> one<00:01:47.020> and<00:01:47.050> I'm<00:01:47.290> going

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
be two kings against one and I'm going

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.280 
be two kings against one and I'm going
to<00:01:47.560> win<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:47.890> game<00:01:48.040> and<00:01:48.310> and<00:01:49.210> he<00:01:49.420> will<00:01:49.570> take<00:01:49.810> his

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
to win the game and and he will take his

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.020 
to win the game and and he will take his
other<00:01:50.560> King<00:01:50.830> completely<00:01:51.310> out<00:01:51.460> of<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.670> picture

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
other King completely out of the picture

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.400 
other King completely out of the picture
so<00:01:52.210> in<00:01:52.690> this<00:01:52.810> position<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.590> move<00:01:54.130> here<00:01:55.170> he<00:01:56.170> has

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:56.410 
so in this position I move here he has

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.050 
so in this position I move here he has
to<00:01:56.440> move<00:01:56.830> up<00:01:57.840> my<00:01:58.840> King<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.320> closest<00:01:59.800> to<00:01:59.830> his<00:02:00.370> I'm

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
to move up my King is closest to his I'm

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.870 
to move up my King is closest to his I'm
going<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.720> move<00:02:02.220> toward<00:02:03.220> the<00:02:03.310> double<00:02:03.580> corner

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
going to move toward the double corner

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.149 
going to move toward the double corner
now<00:02:04.120> at<00:02:04.810> least<00:02:05.050> for<00:02:05.230> it<00:02:05.350> for<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.620> moment<00:02:05.830> he

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
now at least for it for the moment he

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.210 
now at least for it for the moment he
cannot<00:02:06.460> move<00:02:06.700> this<00:02:06.909> King<00:02:07.709> because<00:02:08.709> if<00:02:08.890> he<00:02:09.009> does

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
cannot move this King because if he does

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.140 
cannot move this King because if he does
at<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.550> next<00:02:09.819> move<00:02:10.030> he<00:02:10.300> moves<00:02:10.509> here<00:02:11.880> all<00:02:12.880> I

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
at the next move he moves here all I

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.980 
at the next move he moves here all I
have<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.480> do<00:02:13.630> is

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
have to do is

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.100 
have to do is
move<00:02:14.140> there<00:02:14.410> to<00:02:14.980> reinforce<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.960> forces<00:02:16.960> him

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
move there to reinforce that forces him

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.560 
move there to reinforce that forces him
to<00:02:17.140> jump<00:02:18.420> then<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.540> jump<00:02:20.820> now<00:02:21.820> it's<00:02:22.210> two-on-one

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
to jump then I jump now it's two-on-one

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.790 
to jump then I jump now it's two-on-one
and<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.740> will<00:02:23.950> win<00:02:24.390> he<00:02:25.390> cannot<00:02:25.720> move<00:02:25.990> this<00:02:26.560> guy

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
and I will win he cannot move this guy

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.420 
and I will win he cannot move this guy
right<00:02:27.130> now<00:02:27.370> he<00:02:27.970> has<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.300> move<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.660> other<00:02:28.840> guy

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.150 
right now he has to move the other guy
he's<00:02:30.430> probably<00:02:30.640> going<00:02:30.940> to<00:02:31.000> move<00:02:31.180> toward<00:02:32.160> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
he's probably going to move toward the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.850 
he's probably going to move toward the
double<00:02:33.460> corner<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:33.940> then<00:02:34.720> I'm<00:02:35.320> gonna<00:02:35.560> take
