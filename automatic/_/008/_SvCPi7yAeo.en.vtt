00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.590
 she 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.590
 and 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.850
 hi to all and to all and 98 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.160
 today we find ourselves for a tutorial 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.689
 quite simple which will actually consist 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.880
 it's for gta iv to put some 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.990
 music on independence fm but 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.550
 knowing that there are two versions 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.260
 different from gta iv 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.790
 so let's start for version 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.380
 steam that I think is the most sold 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.380
 so you have to go to documents 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.820
 then rockstar games gta iv and user 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.470
 music languages all music 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.930
 that we want then it will be enough to go 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.300
 in the game and do a refresh then 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.720
 then for the version not what they 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.890
 see the teeth at samme program files 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.480
 and but me as I have the steam version 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.790
 Normally I do not have your star game 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.890
 so you have rockstar games &amp; other 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.270
 music normally it's good but I 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.840
 do not have as I turned to on what 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.560
 would not be good so I 'm just going 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.360
 show you in play so the video will be 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.430
 very very very short it is 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.909
 a very simple tutorial so we find ourselves 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.830
 right now in game we're back for 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.840

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.900

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:35.110
 part and you forget so we the good 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.909

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.200

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.520

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.610

 it's good then 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.550
 then you go on independence fm 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:18.370

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:21.180
