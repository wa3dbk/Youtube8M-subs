just<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.930> increase<00:01:29.050> your<00:01:29.520> weapon's<00:01:30.520> damage

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.960 

right<00:01:33.910> now<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.090> do<00:01:34.650> 23k<00:01:35.650> damage<00:01:36.130> if<00:01:36.460> i<00:01:36.580> apply

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
right now I do 23k damage if i apply

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.880 
right now I do 23k damage if i apply
metric<00:01:37.390> when<00:01:37.660> it<00:01:37.750> goes<00:01:37.870> up<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:38.050> 31<00:01:38.380> so<00:01:38.680> it's<00:01:38.800> a

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
metric when it goes up to 31 so it's a

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.760 
metric when it goes up to 31 so it's a
huge<00:01:39.280> improvement<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:40.120> use<00:01:41.050> force<00:01:41.350> weapon<00:01:41.530> with

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
huge improvement I use force weapon with

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.070 
huge improvement I use force weapon with
that<00:01:41.890> obviously<00:01:42.450> energy<00:01:43.450> armor<00:01:43.660> and<00:01:43.900> I<00:01:43.960> use

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
that obviously energy armor and I use

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.180 
that obviously energy armor and I use
force<00:01:44.380> armor<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:46.390> so<00:01:46.600> that<00:01:46.900> if<00:01:47.530> you<00:01:47.800> get<00:01:47.980> hit

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:48.190 
force armor just so that if you get hit

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.460 
force armor just so that if you get hit
if<00:01:48.520> you<00:01:48.880> don't<00:01:49.060> get<00:01:49.270> one<00:01:49.600> shot<00:01:49.870> because<00:01:50.260> I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
if you don't get one shot because I

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.130 
if you don't get one shot because I
change<00:01:50.740> this<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:52.000> will<00:01:52.510> only<00:01:52.600> take<00:01:52.840> thirty

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
change this you will only take thirty

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.900 
change this you will only take thirty
five<00:01:53.320> percent<00:01:53.350> damage<00:01:53.890> but<00:01:54.310> if<00:01:54.430> you<00:01:54.520> take<00:01:54.670> if

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
five percent damage but if you take if

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.660 
five percent damage but if you take if
someone<00:01:55.660> does<00:01:55.840> like<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.080> 102<00:01:56.950> percent<00:01:57.370> of<00:01:57.490> your

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
someone does like a 102 percent of your

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.149 
someone does like a 102 percent of your
max<00:01:57.909> damage<00:01:58.150> it'll<00:01:58.810> still<00:01:59.170> one<00:01:59.380> shot<00:01:59.620> you<00:01:59.770> but

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
max damage it'll still one shot you but

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.620 
max damage it'll still one shot you but
with<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:00.460> you<00:02:00.520> only<00:02:01.000> take<00:02:01.240> thirty<00:02:01.450> five

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
with this you only take thirty five

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.690 
with this you only take thirty five
percent<00:02:01.659> damage<00:02:02.050> just<00:02:02.920> gives<00:02:03.340> you<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.460> little

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
percent damage just gives you a little

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.500 
percent damage just gives you a little
bit<00:02:03.880> more<00:02:04.030> survivability<00:02:04.600> with<00:02:04.900> that<00:02:06.510> my

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
bit more survivability with that my

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.180 
bit more survivability with that my
runes<00:02:07.750> are<00:02:07.960> glass<00:02:08.170> cannon<00:02:08.560> just<00:02:08.890> because

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
runes are glass cannon just because

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.700 
runes are glass cannon just because
either<00:02:09.399> i'm<00:02:09.610> going<00:02:09.640> to<00:02:09.940> get<00:02:10.060> one<00:02:10.240> shot<00:02:10.450> or<00:02:10.710> I'm

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:11.710 
either i'm going to get one shot or I'm

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.930 
either i'm going to get one shot or I'm
going<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.950> take<00:02:12.130> thirty<00:02:12.340> five<00:02:12.550> percent<00:02:12.580> damn

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
going to take thirty five percent damn

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.790 
going to take thirty five percent damn
so<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.480> just<00:02:16.050> take<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.379> for<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.530> increased

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
so I just take it for the increased

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.180 
so I just take it for the increased
damage<00:02:18.260> ancestral<00:02:19.260> presence<00:02:19.680> which<00:02:19.920> you

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
damage ancestral presence which you

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.800 
damage ancestral presence which you
could<00:02:20.340> change<00:02:20.519> out<00:02:20.730> with<00:02:20.849> something<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.569> just

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
could change out with something I just

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.059 
could change out with something I just
like<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:21.989> for<00:02:22.200> the<00:02:22.290> increase<00:02:22.530> arcing<00:02:22.860> powers

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
like it for the increase arcing powers

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.550 
like it for the increase arcing powers
and<00:02:23.340> get<00:02:23.489> off<00:02:23.610> a<00:02:23.720> one<00:02:24.720> more<00:02:24.870> arcane<00:02:25.230> orb<00:02:25.349> than

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
and get off a one more arcane orb than

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.580 
and get off a one more arcane orb than
usual<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:27.360> middle<00:02:27.599> temporal<00:02:27.840> flux<00:02:28.049> just<00:02:28.470> to

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
usual the middle temporal flux just to

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.020 
usual the middle temporal flux just to
give<00:02:28.769> that<00:02:28.950> slow<00:02:29.190> effect<00:02:29.519> when<00:02:29.790> I<00:02:29.819> use<00:02:30.000> my

armor<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.900> they'll<00:02:52.019> take<00:02:52.230> thirty<00:02:52.950> five

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
armor so that they'll take thirty five

and then they will have illusionist as
one<00:03:04.109> of<00:03:04.140> their<00:03:04.940> passes<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.269> so<00:03:06.890> pretty<00:03:07.890> much

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
one of their passes and so pretty much

every time you get hit you're going to

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.030 
every time you get hit you're going to

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
mirror image are reset which you would

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.629

for<00:03:17.849> a<00:03:17.880> mirror<00:03:18.120> image<00:03:18.209> because<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:18.810> still

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
for a mirror image because you still

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.890 
for a mirror image because you still
want<00:03:19.260> teleport<00:03:19.769> Hydra<00:03:20.130> arcane<00:03:20.489> orb<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.940> guess

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
want teleport Hydra arcane orb I guess

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.210 
want teleport Hydra arcane orb I guess
you<00:03:22.019> could<00:03:22.079> switch<00:03:22.290> out<00:03:22.410> metric<00:03:22.739> weapon<00:03:23.040> if

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
you could switch out metric weapon if

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.129 
you could switch out metric weapon if
you<00:03:23.310> wanted<00:03:23.730> but<00:03:24.269> it's<00:03:24.599> pretty<00:03:24.780> much<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.930> same

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
you wanted but it's pretty much the same

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.559 
you wanted but it's pretty much the same
build<00:03:25.410> but<00:03:25.680> with<00:03:25.919> mirror<00:03:26.280> image<00:03:26.519> and<00:03:26.880> teleport

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
build but with mirror image and teleport

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.569 
build but with mirror image and teleport
and<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.319> that<00:03:28.470> way<00:03:28.560> you<00:03:28.620> always<00:03:28.889> have<00:03:29.220> image

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
and so that way you always have image

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.059 
and so that way you always have image
like<00:03:30.120> a<00:03:30.359> mirror<00:03:30.780> image<00:03:30.840> up<00:03:31.169> or<00:03:31.410> child<00:03:31.680> board<00:03:31.919> up

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
like a mirror image up or child board up

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.449 
like a mirror image up or child board up
pretty<00:03:32.669> much<00:03:32.849> x<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.260> then<00:03:34.430> while<00:03:35.430> they're

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
pretty much x and then while they're

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.520 
pretty much x and then while they're
attacking<00:03:36.060> your<00:03:36.419> little<00:03:36.720> minions<00:03:37.109> so<00:03:37.380> you

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
attacking your little minions so you

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.400 
attacking your little minions so you
could<00:03:37.889> say<00:03:38.120> your<00:03:39.120> health<00:03:39.959> is<00:03:40.109> going<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.319> be

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
could say your health is going to be

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.680 
could say your health is going to be
