00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
not CGI it's all you know it's it's all

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.230 
not CGI it's all you know it's it's all
really<00:00:40.250> happening<00:00:40.760> and<00:00:40.940> so<00:00:41.030> it's<00:00:41.210> very<00:00:41.359> cool

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.910 

you<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:48.720> we're<00:00:48.870> getting<00:00:49.110> thrown<00:00:49.290> around<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
you know we're getting thrown around and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.310 
you know we're getting thrown around and
spun<00:00:50.730> around<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.330> I<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.020> looks<00:00:52.170> very

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
spun around and I think it looks very

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.310 
spun around and I think it looks very
very<00:00:52.410> realistic<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.660> the<00:00:54.660> small<00:00:54.870> amounts<00:00:55.200> of

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
very realistic so the small amounts of

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.400 
very realistic so the small amounts of
green-screen<00:00:55.860> I'm<00:00:56.520> going<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.930> attain<00:00:57.930> nicely
