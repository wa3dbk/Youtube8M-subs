00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.580
 Hello 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.860
 welcome to this new video today vi 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.540
 I show how to enlarge the lips 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.670
 in this period they are practically 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.949
 depopulating the famous lips of 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.800
 kylie jenner who is kim's half sister 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.750
 kardashian if you don't know this 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.199
 girl practically had lips 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.460
 very thin , half the half of them 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.980
 mine and now with two dinghies practically 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.620
 to the valeria marini I want to clarify 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.410
 that it's not his lips that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.250
 suddenly they are enlarged or not 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.260
 I know which cabbage of natural remedy what 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.610
 that absolutely took no need there 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.680
 compliment the surgeon who is 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.050
 was really very good snow plan 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.100
 lips with make up is absolutely 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.140
 possible 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.890
 the important thing is not to go too far 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.219
 our natural friend because anyway 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.620
 both the line that separates our lips 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.470
 from the skin of the face is a little bit more 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.020
 raised so if we tranship I love 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.510
 too much with pencil with lipstick 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.720
 when the light hits our face 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.909
 you see this line in the middle of the color 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.500
 lipstick a little bit more raised and yes 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.350
 obviously understands that we went 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.880
 out and we look like a clown and don't 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.430
 I think the effect that none of us 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.140
 want to b 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.820
 I'll tell you some tricks on how to do it 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.520
 the lips appear a little more 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.159
 the meaty makeup you're testing in 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.920
 this moment is a very easy trick 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.650
 that he did today in another video vi 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.600
 maybe I'll leave links down in the info box is 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.240
 easy to use with a few 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.250
 products and it is simply about 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.200
 how to turn into a bad day 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.360
 feeling a little bit more beautiful 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.100
 I remind you that all the products that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.229
 I will use in this video you will find them 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.670
 the infobox twins is always twins 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.740
 infobox you will find the link to mine 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.659
 facebook page and my profile of st g 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.610
 if you want to give it a try, use it 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.409
 like don't forget to leave me a mi 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.390
 like or subscribe to my channel for 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.070
 don't miss any videos like the first one 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.580
 step I advise you to put a 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.680
 lip balm because anyway 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.650
 and we're going to work with pencils and 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.010
 lipsticks a little more matt because if 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.230
 we put on a more translucent lipstick 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.750
 and softer that will tend to move 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.060
 to go away a little more easily 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.890
 therefore it will be seen however to the effect 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.650
 fake we gave to the lips 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.750
 so before you start all the makeup 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.760
 I'm going to put the lip balm on when 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:38.110
 I have to make the lips are already beautiful 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:39.940
 hydrate remove the cocoa butter with the 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.360
 pencil I go beyond my outline 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.970
 lips and I owe you that today I will overdo it 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.310
 much compared to what I could do 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.640
 normally just to make you 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.940
 see how she gets it 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.940
 that effect 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.140
 the line here at this point I do it 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.270
 slightly rounded so that the 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.090
 lips look a little bit meatier 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.090
 it must be a thing of its own 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.090
 imperceptible 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.480
 and I'm going to do the same thing under me 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.010
 under the lip slightly more fleshy 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:48.209
 of that above then in a transhipment 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:51.569
 as much as I did above also here 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.519
 below I go to make the line slightly to 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.970
 always rounded to make it look like le 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.730
 lips a little more fleshy and me 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.110
 I recommend that the lips are triggered that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.000
 upper lip with the lower one 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:05.940
 end up in the same place because 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.890
 you risk going to draw one de 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.049
 the two parts a little longer 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.340
 of the other at this moment I do 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:16.739
 just laugh but less slowly you see 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.269
 that are taking shape with the pencil 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:26.220
 who used until now I go to 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:28.229
 fill I go to blend the line a 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.590
 a little more inward and in 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.750
 fill the outer edges more often 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.590
 to give more three - dimensional from the 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.110
 our lips 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.600
 the central part leaves it a little bit 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.720
 more free because it must be longer 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.110
 it doesn't have to look more protruding than 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.110
 side parts 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:59.200
 then like a pencil a little darker 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:01.180
 I'm going to draw lines that must 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:07.750
 make your lips look even more 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:09.670
 so fleshy here practically for 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.280
 make you understand are the folds that 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.860
 angelina jolie for which she is at the lips 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:17.500
 so fleshy that they form 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.820
 some sort of jocks like us 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:30.070
 we went to recreate shadows I take a 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:33.430
 brush and helps me fade now that 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.080
 I created my base I'm going to get 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.630
 this is a color for the lips 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.170
 quite natural as color and 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.850
 wight make up artist line with and i go 

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.850
 to put it on all lips 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.400
 I'm using a dye because ea 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.139
 long hold so you don't go to 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:06.050
 move within a short time 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:08.449
 it is also because it is opaque therefore as vi 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:17.330
 I said before I don't want to highlight 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:23.080
 this morning here some lips ad 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:26.120
 learn a brown pencil 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:29.150
 quite cold so try to 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:32.630
 recreate a kind of shadows of the 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:36.410
 lips and I go here to the outer corners e 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:40.060
 lightly on the lip line 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.060
 blending it inwards 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.820
 ok this is the finished effect i am 

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.440
 I make too much laugh so you me 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:04.040
 I really feel uncomfortable with these 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:06.800
 thieves 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.960
 but I hope you have understood some 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.420
 technique to be able to enlarge and a 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.020
 little lips and it is only 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.700
 of dark and light to use products 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.160
 opaque rather than luminous products 

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:22.220
 I think she managed to get it 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:25.760
 this effect so exaggerated because 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.380
 this cartoon that I told you there is not 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.740
 he almost for nothing because these 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:33.320
 laura that as soon as you see them then 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:36.740
 practically I think she did it 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:41.720
 the tattoo and then filled it with 

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:44.450
 of silicone in short, I hope nothing 

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:47.060
 may if I have to say this video in 

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:50.240
 somehow I hope you can do it 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:51.740
 a laugh with this effect here and me 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.780
 thank you for watching the video 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.320
 see you at the next tutorial 

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.320
 Hello
