00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.080
 work on the Russian site force of Siberia 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.940
 go on schedule 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.740
 this was stated by the head of Gazprom in Beijing 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.660
 at a meeting with Chinese partners 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.700
 signed in may last year contract 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.250
 long turned Russia east because 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.529
 designed for 30 years besides delivery 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.119
 it is planned to diversify now it 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.279
 successful construction negotiations 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.769
 Western direction within the project 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.859
 Alliance with Russia at least take 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.929
 economically gas is already good 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.750
 the basis for that in perspective 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.570
 development of cooperation in other areas 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.390
 including military states which 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.629
 sell gas and which they consume 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.640
 are required to be partners but of course 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.350
 vis Iran stated desire 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.820
 join the Turkish stream 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.890
 is potential for us 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.050
 rival but his political 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.940
 cooperation for both countries is more important 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.100
 economic rivalry in 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.789
 gas's own geopolitics 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.160
 economic interest is often 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.930
 turns out to be secondary being only 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.680
 foreign policy tool 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.170
 strategies 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.210
 so the European Union even checking the number with 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.400
 washington no matter what the sanctions 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.740
 personal and corporate theme 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.110
 gas prefers not to include them and 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.090
 to more compliant on other issues because 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.890
 is the main consumer of our 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.890
 blue fuel since Soviet times 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.420
 gas contract in exchange for pipes signed 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.390
 back in 1970 was called the contract of the century 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.549
 ussr guaranteed delivery of 3 billion 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.259
 cubic meters of gas getting over a million 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.090
 tons of large diameter pipes for 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.070
 construction of the pipeline to the west 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.850
 labor loans issued 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.650
 german bank 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.990
 America tried to prevent any 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.970
 ways have been expressed versions up to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.159
 absurd if the pipe connect the Soviet 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.020
 Alliance and countries of NATO, our tanks will be able to 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.740
 a case of war refuel right out 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.350
 gas pipeline 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.600
 generally most importantly honest 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.960
 US policy outlined several months 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.060
 backwards 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.280
 George Friedman Founder and Director 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.369
 the company stratfor which is also called 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.619
 shady tsera for the united states 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.619
 the top priority is not to let 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.670
 German capital and German technology 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.700
 would connect with the Russian natural 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.860
 resources and labor in the invincible 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.050
 combination 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.460
 which the US is trying to prevent already 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.900
 the whole century is now usa especially 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.700
 concentrated their forces on 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.770
 States that may be gates 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.260
 not for the pipe from the beginning of the south and now 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.540
 turkish stream bulgaria and greece and 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.100
 Balkan countries customary methods 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.990
 economic information and 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.910
 political pressure in interest 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.950
 American geopolitics are these small 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.440
 countries are forced to abandon 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.260
 profitable economic contracts you know 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:48.530
 as for serbia sushi signal 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.700
 there is Kosovo and there it is 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.130
 most of the serbs in the north of kosovo and 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.060
 without this situation only if you are not 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:02.350
 wants and bedroom from order and states either 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:07.610
 from the European Union when there is a riot on 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:09.739
 Kosovo and he will certainly be against the Serbs 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.600
 however, experts do not exclude that Greece 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.459
 who refused to loan imf and 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.080
 prohibit taking Russian can with 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.030
 the current government to throw 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.340
 surprise west down to the exit from 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.019
 EU should not be discounted and 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.660
 Bulgaria is in my opinion more 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.459
 there are no alternatives and there are already Americans 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.620
 nothing can be invented and maybe 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.200
 even through bulgaria branch and let and now 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.690

 he can 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.550
 you will be clothed with the shape of the south and the turn 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.470
 Russia East loss for Europe 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.450
 exclusive consumer for us 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.340
 the emergence of an alternative in the coming years 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.600
 last week in china just 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.210
