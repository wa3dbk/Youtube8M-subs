plants<00:00:04.799> vs.<00:00:05.040> zombies<00:00:06.470> so<00:00:07.470> basically<00:00:08.189> if

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
plants vs. zombies so basically if

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.700 
plants vs. zombies so basically if
you're<00:00:09.150> going<00:00:09.300> to<00:00:09.480> beat<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:09.870> it's<00:00:10.260> best<00:00:10.620> to

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
you're going to beat this it's best to

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.160 
you're going to beat this it's best to
go<00:00:10.889> in<00:00:11.040> with<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> strategy<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.990> my<00:00:12.990> strategy

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
go in with a strategy and my strategy

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.090 
go in with a strategy and my strategy
partially<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.820> start<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.389> on<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.719> right

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
partially is to start in on the right

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.740 
partially is to start in on the right
because<00:00:17.100> if<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.550> break<00:00:17.850> open<00:00:18.029> zombies<00:00:18.600> it

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
because if you break open zombies it

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.080 
because if you break open zombies it
takes<00:00:18.930> longer<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.380> them<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.529> get<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.880> your

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
takes longer for them to get to your

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.900 
takes longer for them to get to your
house<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:22.800> easier<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.400> stop<00:00:23.670> them

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
house and so it's easier to stop them

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.950 
house and so it's easier to stop them
and<00:00:25.670> generally<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:26.789> well<00:00:27.000> what<00:00:27.180> I'll<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.720> I

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
and generally as well what I'll do is I

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.089 
and generally as well what I'll do is I
will<00:00:28.140> save<00:00:28.500> these<00:00:28.949> green<00:00:29.599> plant<00:00:30.599> marked<00:00:31.099> vases

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
will save these green plant marked vases

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.150 
will save these green plant marked vases
until<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.690> big<00:00:33.960> organge<00:00:34.380> win<00:00:34.590> zombie<00:00:34.950> over

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
until this big organge win zombie over

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.690 
until this big organge win zombie over
here<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.989> out<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.320> I<00:00:37.860> will<00:00:38.070> break<00:00:38.430> them<00:00:38.610> open

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
here is out and I will break them open

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.869 
here is out and I will break them open
and<00:00:38.940> hopes<00:00:39.210> up<00:00:39.480> these<00:00:39.660> squash<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:41.670> them

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
and hopes up these squash is in them

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.880 
and hopes up these squash is in them
because<00:00:42.270> that<00:00:42.420> is<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.750> best<00:00:43.320> tool<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.860> have

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
because that is the best tool you have

against them generally if you have a lot

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.560 
against them generally if you have a lot
of<00:00:49.649> bucket<00:00:50.039> heads<00:00:50.219> out<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.180> can

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
of bucket heads out like this you can

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.389 
of bucket heads out like this you can
use<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> squash<00:00:52.110> against<00:00:52.379> them<00:00:52.620> as<00:00:52.770> well<00:00:53.010> but

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.069 

again<00:01:43.860> just<00:01:44.130> saving<00:01:44.670> those<00:01:44.970> green<00:01:45.659> vases

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
again just saving those green vases

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.910 
again just saving those green vases
until<00:01:46.850> I'm<00:01:47.850> really<00:01:48.180> in<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.329> pickle<00:01:50.570> and<00:01:51.570> you

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
until I'm really in a pickle and you

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.679 
until I'm really in a pickle and you
want<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> line<00:01:53.130> up<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.490> three<00:01:53.850> peashooter<00:01:54.420> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
triple it towards the middle so you can

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.580 
triple it towards the middle so you can
cover<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.299> much<00:01:57.420> range<00:01:57.719> as<00:01:57.869> possible<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.530> not

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
cover as much range as possible and not

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.609 
cover as much range as possible and not
really<00:01:58.890> waste

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.249 

and<00:02:05.820> again<00:02:06.820> use<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.330> squash<00:02:07.600> onlooker<00:02:07.990> can't

and again use the squash onlooker can't

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.790 
and again use the squash onlooker can't
run<00:02:09.780> because<00:02:10.780> otherwise<00:02:11.080> you<00:02:11.500> will<00:02:11.650> wreck

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
run because otherwise you will wreck

run because otherwise you will wreck
your<00:02:11.950> day<00:02:16.020> even<00:02:17.020> with<00:02:17.140> the<00:02:17.260> squash<00:02:17.530> you<00:02:17.709> have

to hit them twice generally if you have
snow<00:02:21.520> pea<00:02:21.760> slowing<00:02:22.300> them<00:02:22.420> down<00:02:22.450> you're<00:02:22.959> okay

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
snow pea slowing them down you're okay

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
bucket head wouldn't have died if I

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.960 
bucket head wouldn't have died if I
didn't<00:02:46.840> use<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.140> cherry<00:02:47.410> bomb<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:48.700> want<00:02:48.880> to

the squash on the bucket heads and you
have<00:03:02.500> a<00:03:02.560> couple<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:03.040> our<00:03:03.160> Gantt<00:03:03.370> one<00:03:04.050> then<00:03:05.050> your

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
have a couple of our Gantt one then your

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.910 
have a couple of our Gantt one then your
day<00:03:05.830> is<00:03:05.890> going<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.100> be<00:03:06.190> pretty<00:03:06.459> screwed<00:03:06.790> up<00:03:06.850> and

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
day is going to be pretty screwed up and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.470 
day is going to be pretty screwed up and
what<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.220> do<00:03:09.370> between<00:03:09.519> levels<00:03:10.060> after<00:03:10.239> I've

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
what I like do between levels after I've

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.150 
what I like do between levels after I've
used<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.810> cherry<00:03:11.019> bomb<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.470> give<00:03:11.709> it<00:03:11.799> a<00:03:11.829> chance

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
used the cherry bomb is give it a chance

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.440 
used the cherry bomb is give it a chance
to<00:03:12.459> load<00:03:12.670> before<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.090> even<00:03:13.269> start<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.440> next

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
to load before I even start the next

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.699 
to load before I even start the next
that<00:03:16.450> way<00:03:16.630> if<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.840> have<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.049> use<00:03:17.200> it<00:03:17.350> again<00:03:17.590> in

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
that way if I have to use it again in

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.789 
that way if I have to use it again in
this<00:03:17.860> level<00:03:18.070> it<00:03:18.400> has<00:03:18.579> the<00:03:18.760> time<00:03:19.500> it's<00:03:20.500> already

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
this level it has the time it's already

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:29.160 
this level it has the time it's already
set<00:03:21.040> to<00:03:21.310> use<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.850> whenever<00:03:27.750> another<00:03:28.750> little

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
set to use it whenever another little

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.650 
set to use it whenever another little
trick<00:03:29.440> is<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:30.280> can<00:03:30.489> line<00:03:30.850> up<00:03:30.880> the<00:03:31.150> zombies<00:03:31.739> so

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
trick is you can line up the zombies so

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.759 
trick is you can line up the zombies so
for<00:03:34.660> instance<00:03:34.959> look<00:03:35.109> at<00:03:35.200> this<00:03:35.320> guy<00:03:35.500> on<00:03:35.650> the

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
for instance look at this guy on the

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.740 
for instance look at this guy on the
bottom<00:03:36.100> okay<00:03:36.390> and<00:03:37.390> try<00:03:37.600> to<00:03:37.690> line<00:03:37.900> them<00:03:38.079> up<00:03:38.170> here

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
bottom okay and try to line them up here

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.380 
bottom okay and try to line them up here
if<00:03:40.750> you<00:03:40.810> click<00:03:41.079> as<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.500> zombie<00:03:41.859> passes<00:03:42.250> by<00:03:42.430> hit

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
if you click as the zombie passes by hit

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.240 
if you click as the zombie passes by hit
the<00:03:43.540> squash<00:03:43.810> on<00:03:44.079> them<00:03:44.320> and<00:03:44.500> then<00:03:44.980> they're<00:03:45.130> all

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
the squash on them and then they're all

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.920 
the squash on them and then they're all
taken<00:03:45.579> care<00:03:45.609> of

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
taken care of

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.560 
taken care of
you<00:03:46.930> don't<00:03:47.109> even<00:03:47.200> have<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.470> worry<00:03:47.650> about<00:03:47.829> it

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
you don't even have to worry about it

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.740 
you don't even have to worry about it
now<00:03:49.570> once<00:03:50.230> you<00:03:50.410> hit<00:03:50.560> streak<00:03:51.370> 10<00:03:51.730> you're<00:03:52.690> going

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
now once you hit streak 10 you're going

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.240 
now once you hit streak 10 you're going
to<00:03:52.900> have<00:03:53.019> a<00:03:53.049> couple<00:03:53.380> of<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.500> gargantuan<00:03:53.890> guys

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
to have a couple of the gargantuan guys

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.240 
to have a couple of the gargantuan guys
it's<00:03:54.790> only<00:03:54.940> going<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.180> get<00:03:55.299> harder<00:03:55.630> from<00:03:55.660> here

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
it's only going to get harder from here

okay<00:04:17.320> another<00:04:17.709> neat<00:04:17.919> trick<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:18.669> put<00:04:18.940> the

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
okay another neat trick you put the

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.420 
okay another neat trick you put the
peashooter<00:04:20.530> particularly<00:04:20.980> the<00:04:21.070> ones<00:04:21.250> that

shoot backwards closer to the zombie and

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.640 
shoot backwards closer to the zombie and
it<00:04:24.850> will<00:04:24.940> kill<00:04:25.180> them<00:04:25.360> quicker<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.410> you<00:04:26.470> don't
