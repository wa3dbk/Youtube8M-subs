00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.830 
that this is the right decision that's
number<00:01:46.590> two<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.100> then<00:01:47.520> three<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:48.540> we

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
number two and then three because we

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.530 
number two and then three because we
know<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.890> facts<00:01:50.220> or<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:51.299> we've

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
know all the facts or because we've

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.210 
know all the facts or because we've
actually<00:01:51.750> thought<00:01:52.320> about<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.710> or<00:01:52.860> because

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
actually thought about it or because

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.060 
actually thought about it or because
we've<00:01:53.520> actually<00:01:53.729> taken<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.540> time<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:55.649> figure

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
we've actually taken the time to figure

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.219 
we've actually taken the time to figure
it<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.700> this<00:01:57.149> goofball<00:01:57.450> over<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.170> is

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
it out and this goofball over here is

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.350 
it out and this goofball over here is
going<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> come<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.740> he's<00:01:58.860> gonna<00:01:59.119> write<00:02:00.119> this

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
going to come and he's gonna write this

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.120 
going to come and he's gonna write this
is<00:02:00.479> where<00:02:00.659> you're<00:02:00.840> going<00:02:01.079> with<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.350> right<00:02:01.619> so

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
is where you're going with this right so

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.469 
is where you're going with this right so
you<00:02:02.189> establish<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.939> fact<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.240> you're<00:02:03.450> on

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
you establish the fact that you're on

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.660 
you establish the fact that you're on
the<00:02:03.689> same<00:02:03.930> team<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:04.860> accomplish<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the same team then we accomplish the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.160 
the same team then we accomplish the
goal<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.880> making<00:02:06.360> sure<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.540> person<00:02:06.810> knows

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
