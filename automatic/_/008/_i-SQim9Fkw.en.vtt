take<00:02:35.600> a<00:02:35.630> little<00:02:35.780> math<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:36.530> it's<00:02:36.740> not<00:02:36.920> too

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
take a little math but it's not too

inches<00:03:56.450> narrower<00:03:56.870> than<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.440> width<00:03:57.650> of<00:03:57.799> the

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
inches narrower than the width of the

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.670 
inches narrower than the width of the
joists<00:03:58.400> and<00:03:58.549> attached<00:03:59.299> it<00:03:59.450> to<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.660> face<00:03:59.930> flush

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
joists and attached it to the face flush

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.380 
joists and attached it to the face flush
with<00:04:00.829> the<00:04:00.920> decking<00:04:01.280> I'll<00:04:01.940> show<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:02.209> what<00:04:02.329> to

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
with the decking I'll show you what to

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.880 
with the decking I'll show you what to
do<00:04:02.510> with<00:04:02.630> this<00:04:02.780> space<00:04:02.900> down<00:04:03.260> here<00:04:03.530> in<00:04:03.650> just<00:04:03.769> a

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
do with this space down here in just a

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.979 
do with this space down here in just a
second<00:04:04.310> now<00:04:05.180> I've<00:04:05.269> attached<00:04:05.630> the<00:04:05.780> fascia

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
second now I've attached the fascia

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.110 
second now I've attached the fascia
board<00:04:06.110> with<00:04:06.470> screws<00:04:06.829> and<00:04:07.070> countersunk<00:04:07.940> the

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
board with screws and countersunk the

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.940 
board with screws and countersunk the
screw<00:04:08.360> heads<00:04:08.600> I<00:04:08.870> then<00:04:09.380> tapped<00:04:09.680> them<00:04:09.799> with<00:04:09.920> a

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
screw heads I then tapped them with a

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.250 
screw heads I then tapped them with a
hammer<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.519> hide<00:04:10.730> them<00:04:10.940> now<00:04:11.810> here's<00:04:12.140> where

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
hammer to hide them now here's where

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.170 
hammer to hide them now here's where
that<00:04:12.350> extra<00:04:12.680> space<00:04:12.980> under<00:04:13.459> the<00:04:13.579> fascia<00:04:13.820> board

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
that extra space under the fascia board

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.150 
that extra space under the fascia board
comes<00:04:14.420> into<00:04:14.630> play<00:04:14.840> I'm<00:04:15.350> going<00:04:15.560> to<00:04:15.620> use<00:04:15.769> that<00:04:15.950> to

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
comes into play I'm going to use that to

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.969 
comes into play I'm going to use that to
attach<00:04:16.250> lattice<00:04:16.940> to<00:04:17.269> the<00:04:17.359> rim<00:04:17.540> joist<00:04:17.829> so<00:04:18.829> I'll

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
attach lattice to the rim joist so I'll

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:21.310 
attach lattice to the rim joist so I'll
cut<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.340> lattice<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.729> fit<00:04:20.060> for<00:04:20.989> added

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
cut the lattice to fit for added

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.110 
cut the lattice to fit for added
strength<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.950> nicer<00:04:22.280> look<00:04:22.520> I'm<00:04:22.760> adding

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
strength and a nicer look I'm adding

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.030 
strength and a nicer look I'm adding
these<00:04:23.210> framing<00:04:23.690> pieces<00:04:24.110> to<00:04:24.290> fit<00:04:24.440> around<00:04:24.560> each

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
these framing pieces to fit around each

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.120 
these framing pieces to fit around each
piece<00:04:25.400> of<00:04:25.580> lattice<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:27.320> install<00:04:27.680> it<00:04:27.800> I<00:04:27.950> just

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
piece of lattice to install it I just

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.760 
piece of lattice to install it I just
hold<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.610> into<00:04:28.729> place<00:04:28.910> and<00:04:29.320> attach<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.680> with

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
hold it into place and attach it with

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.040 
hold it into place and attach it with
lattice<00:04:31.160> screws<00:04:31.599> see<00:04:32.599> looks<00:04:32.900> like<00:04:32.960> a

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
lattice screws see looks like a

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.050 
lattice screws see looks like a
completely<00:04:33.530> different<00:04:33.650> deck<00:04:34.130> so<00:04:34.880> now<00:04:35.000> to

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
completely different deck so now to

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.640 
completely different deck so now to
complete<00:04:35.479> the<00:04:35.599> look<00:04:35.750> I've<00:04:36.020> added<00:04:36.260> some<00:04:36.530> new
