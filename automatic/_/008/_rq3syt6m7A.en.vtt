don't have any outriders here but that

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.160 
don't have any outriders here but that
they'll<00:02:11.940> be<00:02:12.060> there<00:02:12.209> as<00:02:12.330> well<00:02:12.510> so<00:02:12.540> yeah

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
they'll be there as well so yeah

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.250 
they'll be there as well so yeah
that's<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.470> majority<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:14.550> rosters<00:02:15.260> seems

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
that's the majority the rosters seems

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.320 
that's the majority the rosters seems
may<00:02:16.740> seem<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.980> little<00:02:17.099> bit<00:02:17.220> small<00:02:17.550> but<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.819> think

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
may seem a little bit small but I think

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.300 
may seem a little bit small but I think
it's<00:02:18.450> a<00:02:18.569> pretty<00:02:18.930> good<00:02:19.230> sort<00:02:19.560> of<00:02:19.650> variety<00:02:20.280> of

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
it's a pretty good sort of variety of

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.430 
it's a pretty good sort of variety of
units<00:02:20.819> that<00:02:21.030> what<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:21.690> do<00:02:21.780> things<00:02:21.989> well<00:02:22.170> and

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
units that what can do things well and

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.809 
units that what can do things well and
plus<00:02:23.010> we<00:02:23.099> want<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.310> get<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.520> thing<00:02:23.580> out

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
plus we want to get this thing out

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.020 
plus we want to get this thing out
before<00:02:23.849> the<00:02:24.540> actual<00:02:25.500> 1<00:02:25.709> point<00:02:25.920> 0<00:02:26.010> release<00:02:26.280> in

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
before the actual 1 point 0 release in

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.100 
before the actual 1 point 0 release in
this<00:02:27.150> because<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.660> took<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.810> little<00:02:27.989> while

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
this because of it took a little while

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.229 
this because of it took a little while
for<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.709> enemies<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.489> actually<00:02:29.790> attack<00:02:30.030> me

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
for the enemies to actually attack me

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.850 
for the enemies to actually attack me
and<00:02:30.330> all<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.230> way<00:02:31.319> I<00:02:31.350> have<00:02:31.560> this<00:02:31.680> setup

of<00:03:27.239> units<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:28.200> colonel<00:03:28.709> called<00:03:28.829> Ashford

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
of units the colonel called Ashford

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.319 
of units the colonel called Ashford
minerals<00:03:29.549> but<00:03:29.640> they'll<00:03:29.760> probably<00:03:29.790> be<00:03:30.120> called

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
minerals but they'll probably be called

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.120 
minerals but they'll probably be called
yeast<00:03:30.989> Tamar's<00:03:31.230> been<00:03:31.410> admitted<00:03:31.650> arms<00:03:31.950> because

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
yeast Tamar's been admitted arms because

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.259 
yeast Tamar's been admitted arms because
that's<00:03:32.280> basically<00:03:32.370> their<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.000> eastern

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
that's basically their the eastern

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.390 
that's basically their the eastern
marches<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> reach<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.380> then<00:03:35.070> northern

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
marches of the reach and then northern

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.800 
marches of the reach and then northern
marches<00:03:35.579> marches<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.359> reach<00:03:36.510> have<00:03:36.690> the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
marches marches of the reach have the

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.050 
marches marches of the reach have the
ollis<00:03:37.049> greys<00:03:37.320> as<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.250> can<00:03:38.370> see<00:03:38.519> here<00:03:38.730> like<00:03:38.940> I

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
ollis greys as you can see here like I

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.190 
ollis greys as you can see here like I
think<00:03:39.209> it's<00:03:39.329> called<00:03:39.420> like<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.660> Chucky<00:03:39.900> line

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
think it's called like the Chucky line

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.020 
think it's called like the Chucky line
or<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.470> cheeky<00:03:40.799> line<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.280> their<00:03:41.459> sigil<00:03:41.670> but

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
or the cheeky line is their sigil but

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.380 
or the cheeky line is their sigil but
yeah<00:03:42.989> so<00:03:43.140> basically<00:03:43.910> they're<00:03:44.910> going<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.239> be

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
yeah so basically they're going to be

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.520 
yeah so basically they're going to be
commanding<00:03:45.810> everything<00:03:46.109> north<00:03:46.320> of<00:03:46.440> the

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
commanding everything north of the

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.620 
commanding everything north of the
Mander<00:03:46.799> over<00:03:46.829> for<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.459> like<00:03:48.030> for<00:03:48.510> the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
Mander over for the like for the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
is just going to show off a quick battle

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.590 
is just going to show off a quick battle
i'm<00:04:11.340> probably<00:04:11.910> gonna<00:04:12.120> show<00:04:12.269> the<00:04:12.359> entire

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
i'm probably gonna show the entire

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.809 
i'm probably gonna show the entire
battle<00:04:12.989> took<00:04:13.109> a<00:04:13.170> little<00:04:13.290> while<00:04:13.519> but<00:04:14.519> yeah

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
battle took a little while but yeah

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:17.210 
battle took a little while but yeah
basically<00:04:15.019> i<00:04:16.019> sort<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.500> had<00:04:16.620> to<00:04:16.650> move<00:04:16.889> forward

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
basically i sort of had to move forward

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.819 
basically i sort of had to move forward
my<00:04:17.400> longbowmen<00:04:18.150> there<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.539> try<00:04:18.750> and<00:04:18.780> get<00:04:19.680> them

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
my longbowmen there to try and get them

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.190 
my longbowmen there to try and get them
into<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.130> field<00:04:20.570> longbowmen<00:04:21.570> right<00:04:21.870> now<00:04:22.019> are

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
into the field longbowmen right now are

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.899 
into the field longbowmen right now are
kind<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.710> overpowered<00:04:23.370> so<00:04:23.490> i<00:04:23.520> might<00:04:23.729> balance

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
kind of overpowered so i might balance

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.610 
kind of overpowered so i might balance
them<00:04:24.240> down<00:04:24.450> but<00:04:25.020> i<00:04:25.110> think<00:04:25.260> that's<00:04:25.380> sort<00:04:25.440> of<00:04:25.530> a

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
them down but i think that's sort of a

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.260 
them down but i think that's sort of a
nice

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
nice

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.670 
nice
to<00:04:26.419> have<00:04:26.599> just<00:04:26.840> because<00:04:27.110> at<00:04:27.259> the<00:04:27.319> moment<00:04:27.379> the

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
to have just because at the moment the

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.980 
to have just because at the moment the
westerland's<00:04:28.129> like<00:04:29.000> basically<00:04:29.569> all<00:04:29.870> the

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
westerland's like basically all the

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.999 
westerland's like basically all the
powers<00:04:30.229> in<00:04:30.319> the<00:04:30.379> westerland's<00:04:30.680> have

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
powers in the westerland's have

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.360 
powers in the westerland's have
longbowmen<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.789> so<00:04:32.509> that<00:04:32.660> makes<00:04:32.870> them<00:04:33.370> think

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
longbowmen and so that makes them think

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.409 
longbowmen and so that makes them think
until<00:04:34.580> that<00:04:34.729> makes<00:04:34.849> them<00:04:34.970> pretty<00:04:35.060> evenly

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
until that makes them pretty evenly

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:36.730 
until that makes them pretty evenly
balanced<00:04:35.720> against<00:04:35.960> each<00:04:36.050> other<00:04:36.199> and<00:04:36.289> then<00:04:36.560> we

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
balanced against each other and then we

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.680 
balanced against each other and then we
find<00:04:36.919> each<00:04:36.979> other<00:04:37.099> most<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.520> time<00:04:37.729> and<00:04:38.300> I

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
find each other most of the time and I

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.879 
find each other most of the time and I
think<00:04:38.900> it<00:04:38.960> makes<00:04:39.139> sense<00:04:39.289> that<00:04:39.590> they<00:04:39.740> would

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
think it makes sense that they would

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.100 
think it makes sense that they would
have<00:04:40.400> a<00:04:40.789> more<00:04:41.150> powerful<00:04:41.330> archery<00:04:41.810> in<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.020> than

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
have a more powerful archery in it than

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.330 
have a more powerful archery in it than
the<00:04:42.199> other<00:04:42.349> night<00:04:42.530> to<00:04:42.620> say<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.889> gardener's<00:04:43.220> or

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
the other night to say the gardener's or

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.879 
the other night to say the gardener's or
whatnot<00:04:43.539> then<00:04:44.539> I<00:04:44.629> was<00:04:44.750> also<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:45.199> Beaumonts<00:04:45.770> of

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
whatnot then I was also the Beaumonts of

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.260 
whatnot then I was also the Beaumonts of
the<00:04:45.979> Dornish<00:04:46.250> marches<00:04:46.639> they<00:04:46.789> have<00:04:46.970> those

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
the Dornish marches they have those

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.460 
the Dornish marches they have those

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
things as well and as though so one

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.600 
things as well and as though so one
woman<00:04:51.770> are<00:04:51.860> awesome<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.400> they<00:04:52.490> actually

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.110 
whole thing about how like that like the

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.490 
whole thing about how like that like the
gardener's<00:06:06.590> have<00:06:06.919> the<00:06:07.279> different<00:06:07.900> like<00:06:08.900> I<00:06:09.080> can

oz<00:06:09.740> gray<00:06:10.219> and<00:06:10.639> Ashford<00:06:11.180> forces<00:06:11.599> as<00:06:11.719> well<00:06:11.750> just

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139 
oz gray and Ashford forces as well just

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.899 
oz gray and Ashford forces as well just
because<00:06:12.259> it<00:06:12.409> makes<00:06:12.680> their<00:06:12.889> army<00:06:13.460> more<00:06:13.639> diverse

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909 
because it makes their army more diverse

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:16.149 
because it makes their army more diverse
and<00:06:14.690> also<00:06:14.930> it<00:06:15.020> makes<00:06:15.139> it<00:06:15.319> sort<00:06:15.500> of<00:06:15.560> harder<00:06:15.949> for

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:16.159 
and also it makes it sort of harder for

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.820 
and also it makes it sort of harder for
them<00:06:16.250> to<00:06:16.310> UM<00:06:16.759> like<00:06:17.360> effectively<00:06:18.169> I<00:06:18.560> don't<00:06:18.740> know

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
them to UM like effectively I don't know

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.959 
them to UM like effectively I don't know
I<00:06:18.860> also<00:06:19.279> effectively<00:06:20.259> expand<00:06:21.259> but<00:06:21.849> it<00:06:22.849> a

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:22.969 
I also effectively expand but it a

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:24.159 
I also effectively expand but it a
little<00:06:23.090> bit<00:06:23.240> of<00:06:23.300> handicap<00:06:23.750> as<00:06:23.870> well<00:06:24.020> because

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:24.169 
little bit of handicap as well because

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.240 
little bit of handicap as well because
it<00:06:24.229> makes<00:06:24.319> it<00:06:24.440> harder<00:06:24.680> for<00:06:24.710> them<00:06:24.889> it's<00:06:25.039> a<00:06:25.099> sort

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
it makes it harder for them it's a sort

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.040 
it makes it harder for them it's a sort
of<00:06:25.279> merge<00:06:25.550> and<00:06:25.880> merge<00:06:26.180> and<00:06:26.330> recruit<00:06:26.599> units<00:06:26.900> and

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
of merge and merge and recruit units and

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.230 
of merge and merge and recruit units and
whatnot<00:06:27.319> when<00:06:28.190> it's<00:06:28.340> um<00:06:29.349> like<00:06:30.969> not<00:06:31.969> good

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 
whatnot when it's um like not good

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.329 
whatnot when it's um like not good
because<00:06:32.330> because<00:06:32.599> you<00:06:32.810> can't<00:06:33.620> say<00:06:33.860> merging

00:06:34.329 --> 00:06:34.339 
because because you can't say merging

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:37.149 
because because you can't say merging
unit<00:06:34.550> of<00:06:34.899> gardener<00:06:35.899> and<00:06:36.169> Ashford<00:06:36.680> swordsman
