00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 I've always been a fan of a show more than 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.690
 least was let me tell you my 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.580
 history was early morning there was a 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.280
 storm and my parents were working 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.230
 and I was insomnia so to kill 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.230
 the time I turned on the TV and put cartoon 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.359
 network very serious error came a poster 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.699
 who said next a new 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.830
 episode of a show plus I left it there 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.199
 Well, said earlier, I was a fan of 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.269
 show more when it started a fund came out 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.820
 red blood color with black letters 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.610
 almost like enric i saw murderer i got scared 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.770
 but I told myself calm it's just a crepe and 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.899
 sure pasta that changed his 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.120
 background if that should be but what I do 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.399
 bristled skin was the title the death of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.559
 mordecai there I got scared but then 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.960
 I thought for sure it's an episode like 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.969
 rematch because I had seen characters 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.520
 of the series die so I was not alarmed 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.410
 the episode started with rick I saw in a 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.539
 corner of his room crying while 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.000
 I held a pen which I could 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.770
 recognize was mordecai and begins to 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.079
 have a flashback of them playing 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.239
 videogames when in that comes to benson 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.010
 and tells them to go to work their 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.480
 job was to clean a 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.040
 Cliff 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.380
 apparently it was going to be exhibited as 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.330
 rare park attraction for never 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.730
 I had seen that part of the park 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.310
 mordecai and they were cleaning the 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.440
 cliff when suddenly mordecai is 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.020
 slips and falls off the cliff and 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.700
 put on black screen spent 5 minutes 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.070
 and out of nowhere there was a piercing scream 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.840
 that broke my eardrums like 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.670
 they were cutting in half a 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.470
 person while still alive 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.840
 I was in shock when 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.730
 a poster came out saying a month later 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.650
 and you see reed vi with your console 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.140
 taking her to a forest while laughing 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.300
 as a psychopath walks on a puddle of 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.640
 dry blood with intestines and organs 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.830
 rotten when it gets where it wanted 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.810
 go and I saw the most horrible scene of my 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.480
 love was love from here and was sewn 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.430
 rotten without an arm he lacked a 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.410
 eye and had the other out of its socket 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.720
 eyeball apparently falling 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.790
 exploded and rigby sewed it apparently 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.010
 he had gone mad after losing his 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.560
 best friend plugged the console to a 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.570
 stolen TV as I knew it because I had 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.600
 the price tag and he starts to play 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.880
 and it says now rays you're very good at 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.110
 this game as I kill them clear 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.330
 because not after 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.700
 they are all to blame that I will do for 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.830
 your friend the most chilling thing was that the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.780
 corpse did not even talk to him and rigby 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.880
 he went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.490
 he said they will pay for his death and he laughs 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.010
 macabrely and it goes and looks for benson and 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.170
 says hello benson what do you want rick u and what 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.270
 mordecai no longer work here is not an excuse 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.280
 to not work when that rigby 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.010
 he puts the knife in his chest and says 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.380
 before you die I'll tell you the truth 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.690
 I lied mordecai I do not give up he 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.790
 he died because of you now everyone will die and 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.770
 they will be the same as him when 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.900
 He takes out his knife and puts it in his eye 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.209
 then he takes out the other one and leaves it hanging 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.370
 he cuts his arm while benson 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.709
 I screamed and cried in pain and finally 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.930
 he put the knife to his head and says 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.090
 it is now that time makes the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.520
 work of rotting you follow your dad 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.890
 is when he goes to the room dad 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.080
 is all scared you say you know why 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.180
 Benson shouted like that and rigby tells him 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.340
 hiding the knife sure is in 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.650
 the bathroom and dad is laughing he says 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.690
 ha ha ha sure must be busy and 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.880
 rigby says dad is not telling me 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.220
 you hug for longer than me and daddy 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.500
 is he embraces everything confident and laughs 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.540
 dig the knife in the back and say 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.370
 it 's nothing personal for paddle and 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.920
 begins to mutilate it just like 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.290
 benson and for palette falls dead and says 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.360
 and sides are missing more and look for each 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.190
 character of the park and convinces them that 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.930
 approach him hiding the knife 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.330
 while killing everyone of it 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:42.030
 way when he kills the last character 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.980
 the flashback ends and rip says dead 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.960
 all or not the pain is not going I think that 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.940
 I only have one option left and rigby 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.340
 sticks the knife in the neck and leaves 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.230
 very sharply to the credits without 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.940
 sound and background was the corpse of 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.520
 each one of the park workers 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.080
 including lane love and then it comes out 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.300
 an image of the mordecai corpse 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.580
 saying if you do not turn off your TV now 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.410
 and report it and that it does not stand 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.390
 more and I fainted the next morning 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.120
 I woke up in the hospital there 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.190
 policemen but I did not see my parents when 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.530
 a policeman comes up to me and tells me he said 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.510
 your parents are dead and you were the 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.760
 only that apparently survived them 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.160
 one arm missing one eye and the other left 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.810
 from your basin and rotten and I remembered what's 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.750
 the previous night I told them my story 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.520
 and nobody believed me they took me for crazy 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.560
 they saw that I killed them and they put me in 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.530
 this damn asylum where I keep 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.520
 tormented by those damn phrases I 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.520
 same and for you 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.460
 ah
