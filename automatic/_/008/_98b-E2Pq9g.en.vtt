00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:02.490
 occurred the thirtieth 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.590
 guys strawberry nets 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:08.020
 and the whole track is very pitiful so I 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.050
 asked to put an end to Vasily 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.430
 Red-faced man 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.570
 purposeful 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.760
 it is immediately visible anyway 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.420
 that it was not fashionable to stop sturgeon with 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.230
 by the public not in the literal sense but not 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.669
 completely figurative 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.979
 and the idea of ​​an unusual symbiosis came to 

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:25.379
 Vasily Vsevolodovich when 

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:27.479
 he first saw the so-called 

00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:30.259
 sealed aquarium in which the shrimp and 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.759
 seaweed can for decades 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.159
 live without feeding the rest of the mayor 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:36.589
 work with this disgraced 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:38.599
 we decided it was time to realize what they were 

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:39.580
 more 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.280
 interesting industrial 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.160
 Russian 4 of this is certainly not shrimp and 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.560
 what samur 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.440
 they are without food and water still closed 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.340
 space will not last long 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.530
 but if you open it so varenko citroen 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.950
 roots in the water to plant 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.210
 ordinary strawberries the result 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.430
 get unexpected 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.440
 similar performance to 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.790
 employees 2 i.e. three times exceed 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.520
 results of old-fashioned growing methods 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.879
 sturgeon can always fool 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.720
 nature 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.530
 how should we take among the columns 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.820
 And this for example warm clean 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.640
 house case for example using kung fu 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.250
 publishing tomatoes is the result of hard 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.600
 works of Vasily krasnoborodko 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.250
 speaks for itself 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.830
 from one square meter aquarium can 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.940
 get 70 kilograms of sturgeon 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.260
 and 10 kilograms of strawberries per year 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.200
 the latter does not have to be watered and 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.250
 feed her roots she 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.510
 draws nutrients 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.030
 from models and fruits in summer 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.040
 so in the winter with this method the doctor 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.830
 investors 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.240
 my cost of sturgeon falls almost in 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.350
 two times compared with the usual way 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.740
 building it would seem not far off then 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.730
 time when thanks to the method which 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.440
 for sure the future will get the name 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.530
 methods can be used 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.250
 reduce the cost of a kilogram of black 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.450
 per kilo of strawberries 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.990
 but as always on the way boldly searching for steel 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.420
 Russian officials which is cheap 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.719
 black caviar is unprofitable they do not give green 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.340
 the light of the invention is redbeard but 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.700
 innovator does not give up he proceeded to 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.289
 another bold experiment now 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:08.819
 he crosses tomato ees 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.540
 unpretentious in the very such turns out 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.099
 court in tomato
