00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.540 
in the back and I want to talk to you a
little<00:00:07.200> bit<00:00:07.319> about<00:00:07.500> how<00:00:07.710> alternators<00:00:08.309> work

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
little bit about how alternators work

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.280 
little bit about how alternators work
how<00:00:08.760> they<00:00:08.880> produce<00:00:09.059> our<00:00:09.360> power<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.930> why<00:00:10.080> that

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
how they produce our power and why that

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.039 
how they produce our power and why that

and<00:00:34.370> basically<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.990> alternators

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:36.990 
and basically what this is alternators

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.410 
and basically what this is alternators
are<00:00:37.170> made<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.560> of<00:00:37.710> two<00:00:38.420> electromagnetic

field<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> stator

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
field and the stator

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.760 
field and the stator
is<00:00:43.890> an<00:00:44.480> electromagnetic<00:00:45.480> field<00:00:45.720> and<00:00:46.020> when

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
is an electromagnetic field and when

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.540 
is an electromagnetic field and when
this<00:00:46.920> rotor<00:00:47.570> field<00:00:48.680> spins<00:00:49.680> inside<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.460> the

this rotor field spins inside of the
stator<00:00:50.850> field<00:00:51.410> what<00:00:52.410> it<00:00:52.530> does<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> cause

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
stator field what it does is it cause

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.250 
stator field what it does is it cause
causes<00:00:53.940> AC<00:00:54.390> power<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.650> be<00:00:56.640> made<00:00:57.000> inside<00:00:57.630> the

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
stator and that AC power comes out

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.920 
stator and that AC power comes out
through<00:01:01.620> these<00:01:01.770> three<00:01:02.190> leads<00:01:02.930> automotive

through these three leads automotive

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.530 
through these three leads automotive
Staters<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.530> basically<00:01:05.070> three-phase<00:01:05.880> when

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
Staters are basically three-phase when

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.450 
Staters are basically three-phase when
they<00:01:06.630> say<00:01:06.810> three-phase<00:01:07.350> it<00:01:07.650> means<00:01:07.830> these

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
they say three-phase it means these

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.180 
they say three-phase it means these
wires<00:01:08.760> are<00:01:09.420> connected<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:10.440> three<00:01:10.890> different

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190

what's in your house is basically

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.730 
what's in your house is basically
single-phase<00:01:34.740> this<00:01:35.550> has<00:01:35.760> got<00:01:35.940> three

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
single-phase this has got three

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.010 
single-phase this has got three
single-phase<00:01:37.740> stations<00:01:38.550> this<00:01:39.120> rectifier<00:01:39.510> has

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
single-phase stations this rectifier has

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.190 
single-phase stations this rectifier has
six<00:01:40.800> diodes<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.610> two<00:01:42.300> diodes<00:01:42.750> for<00:01:43.020> each

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
six diodes in it two diodes for each

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770 
six diodes in it two diodes for each
conversion<00:01:43.680> station<00:01:44.430> there's<00:01:45.150> a<00:01:45.240> there's<00:01:45.690> a

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
conversion station there's a there's a

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.850 
conversion station there's a there's a
two<00:01:46.500> dials<00:01:46.830> one<00:01:47.040> negative<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:48.570> positive

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
two dials one negative and one positive

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.120 
two dials one negative and one positive
for<00:01:49.860> this<00:01:49.979> first<00:01:50.570> stator<00:01:51.570> station<00:01:52.409> one

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
for this first stator station one

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.800 
for this first stator station one
negative<00:01:53.520> one<00:01:53.700> positive<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.450> second

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
negative one positive for the second

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.140 
negative one positive for the second
stator<00:01:55.020> station<00:01:55.620> negative<00:01:56.490> negative<00:01:57.030> and

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
stator station negative negative and

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.780 
stator station negative negative and
positive<00:01:57.659> for<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.200> third<00:01:58.409> stator<00:01:58.770> station<00:01:59.280> so

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
positive for the third stator station so

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.810 
positive for the third stator station so
that's<00:01:59.940> why<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.150> only<00:02:00.240> have<00:02:00.570> each<00:02:01.820> conversion

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
that's why you only have each conversion

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.330 
that's why you only have each conversion
station<00:02:03.570> only<00:02:03.990> has<00:02:04.200> two<00:02:04.530> diodes<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.250> a

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
station only has two diodes to it a

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.550 
station only has two diodes to it a
negative<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.119> positive<00:02:06.150> so<00:02:06.750> by<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.440> to

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
negative and a positive so by going to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.050 
negative and a positive so by going to
the<00:02:07.680> dual<00:02:07.860> rectifier<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.549> we<00:02:08.670> have<00:02:08.849> there

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the dual rectifier that we have there

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.509 
the dual rectifier that we have there
we're<00:02:09.209> basically<00:02:09.569> doubling<00:02:10.259> we<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:11.129> to

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
we're basically doubling we have to

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.830 
on it or what the voltage regulator it
basically<00:02:40.650> does<00:02:40.859> is<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:42.030> ground<00:02:42.329> one<00:02:42.689> your

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
basically does is you ground one your

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.080 
basically does is you ground one your
brushes<00:02:43.290> here<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.739> then<00:02:44.069> you<00:02:44.220> send<00:02:44.519> positive

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
brushes here and then you send positive

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.330 
brushes here and then you send positive
power<00:02:45.420> varying<00:02:45.989> positive<00:02:46.439> power<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
power varying positive power to the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.800 
power varying positive power to the
other<00:02:47.489> brush<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.030> that<00:02:48.299> will<00:02:48.450> either<00:02:48.569> make

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
other brush and that will either make

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.720 
other brush and that will either make
this<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.019> big<00:02:49.349> electromagnet<00:02:50.099> or<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.280> small

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
this a big electromagnet or a small

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.309 
this a big electromagnet or a small
electromagnet<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.599> then<00:02:52.019> that<00:02:52.200> affects

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
electromagnet and then that affects

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.740 
electromagnet and then that affects
output<00:02:52.950> when<00:02:53.069> this<00:02:53.220> spins<00:02:53.819> inside<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.389> here

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
little power out to the rectifier so I

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.059 
little power out to the rectifier so I
