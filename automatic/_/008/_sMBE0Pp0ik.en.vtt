00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.750
 now we look instead 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.650
 to understand well 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.609
 the problems it can give to light pollution 

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:11.499
 we must introduce 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.499
 the imp miles concept of cycles 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.339
 a cycle is something that starts repeating itself 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.970
 in nature children are present everywhere 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 you know that 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.319
 what a earth is a cycle 

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:32.640
 does every year around the sun 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.020
 we notice it when a season is repeated 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.100
 the moon also has a cycle 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.420
 turning around the earth 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.390
 we understand why it is full 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.800
 every 29 days returns 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.800
 this is a very nice image I found on the internet 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.810
 is a moving image actually a small movie 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.960
 of the moon 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.380
 that here if you look up at the end there are days that pass quickly 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.900
 peter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 each one of these two a complete gift so it is a lot 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.190
 speeded up to make this movement since the moon there is no brands there 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.150
 small slice then comes in half and then comes full hippolytus moms 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.280
 that wasn't there 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.150
 29 days go by and this is precisely a cynic so it is a one 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.350
 passage 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.180
 from book not in the dark is the sum insured full moon and then again 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.680
 so dark is always a cycle that is always repeated to infinity 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.960
 the pearl as well as around the sun also turns on itself 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.880
 with a giant spinning top she rotates the wheel is never stops 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.799
 for every full circle that turns everything around 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.470
 with the sun that helps us the night 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.850
 it's the day 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.130
 kelly concert 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.960
 in short, you have to imagine that the sun is me 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.190
 it perhaps strikes on this side therefore the part of the earth that it was 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.440
 on this side it is in full day while the part on this opposite side 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.679
 instead in the dark 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:16.499
 therefore voting the land allows us to have 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.579
 we are in the sun illuminating the day 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.449
 and death 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.359
 also this cycle 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.680
 each of these cycles is really important for the earth the animals the 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.749
 place and also the plants 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:34.199
 and thanks to these cycles that there is life on our planet if they had to 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.279
 break 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.279
 for everyone it would be over 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:45.699
 but this is something that fortunately cannot happen but be careful 

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:48.699
 there are rules that must be respected 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.449
 with this I introduce you to the history of a plant 

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:56.150
 that at night rests 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.100
 but during the day even though motors monza 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.209
 a lot of dog facts 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.389
 you don't know if you know children 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:07.689
 plants all plants 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.869
 and thanks to the sunlight 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:12.939
 they do not receive sunlight 

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:16.430
 and even to some take we know that link plants need water 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.899
 to live 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:19.999
 is 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:24.129
 they produce a scratch-free fishing day that they are from the man and 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.229
 animals to live without oxygen know many things love 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:33.339
 and all this happens thanks to sunlight to water is also another gas that 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:37.269
 it is called it must carbon that it is because hello is a gas that 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:41.769
 instead we make us human beings living beings when 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.439
 we throw out the air after we breathe the oxygen we transform into 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.290
 Chromonic cheerfulness to the plant only friends take carbon dioxide cd from 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.509
 oxygen 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.509
 this is also a child cycle up 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:55.110
 then 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.130
 it is with the light every day he starts his work 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.400
 with chlorophyll photosynthesis it gives us pussy. 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.150
 so here I show on the crowd what I just explained to him that yes 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.389
 called chlorophyll photosynthesis so we see better than that 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:14.679
 carbon dioxide enters that which we throw out when we 

00:04:14.679 --> 00:04:16.370
 let's blow out the air 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.629
 light enters 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:19.699
 and the scene 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:21.319
 oxygen 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:24.319
 also enter the water excuse oxygen fish 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:28.289
 and the plant harbor beach also the glucose that a juice constructs element 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.270
 red news keeps him on top 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.490
 inside me 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.490
 within himself 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.099
 what could happen if we read light even at night 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.839
 she would be too tired because she would always work 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.779
 even for a plant the rest is very important if we do without it 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:51.559
 we risk diseases 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:54.650
 that sometimes even death 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.919
 so children imagine the weather parÃ²n was put the image of two 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.300
 street lamps that have a glass view 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.490
 ok said protruding 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.909
 so they throw light everywhere 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:08.469
 in the plant it is also found at night 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:12.659
 corpse light and therefore does chlorophyll photosynthesis also dino 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:17.749
 not even imagine as if you were always going to school by day 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:21.449
 night you do not stop mail they are always work sap work overwork maybe a 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.960
 couple of days you can do it too 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.270
 when a little 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.900
 have begun to feel bad to suffer here is to happen plants 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.949
 but that this presentation ended 

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:35.949
 so this serves to remind us 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.620
 all living things 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.150
 eee but also the earth to the moon 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.600
 have cycles 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.860
 and they are of ct that are important for all must be respected
