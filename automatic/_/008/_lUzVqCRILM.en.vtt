00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.059
 two dams are taking advantage of the mistakes 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:09.870
 the old cabbage saying 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.410
 explains well the agribusiness that does not stop growing in Brazil 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.329
 both we hear and goats 

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:19.329
 produce meat it indicated the quality 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.730
 the products of these animals 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.730
 previously only found in stables markets of small towns of the interior 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:30.710
 begin to emerge on supermarket shelves and store shelves 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:33.900
 non-conforming and sophisticated products 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.650
 how courteous specialized of cardiac linguists 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.030
 and is a bourgeois 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.100
 until then considered as noble raw material 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.100
 also become high quality products 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.390
 the prospects for the growth of the domestic market for animals and 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.649
 sheep and goat derivatives 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.480
 are promising 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.480
 but the current national campaign 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.100
 does not even meet the market needs of the state of são paulo 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.570
 and to become sustainable stage 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.950
 requires 28 million head of sheep 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.180
 Brazil in only 15 million sheep and 10 million goats 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.360
 the two species together 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.360
 do not reach 15% of the national bovine herd 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.530
 which has 170 million head 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.530
 but it is this situation has been changing rapidly 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.079
 with the growth of activity 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.369
 and expansion to other Brazilian regions 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.369
 especially for the Midwest and Southeast 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.290
 the considerable share of rural properties have been modernizing 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.120
 there is also the implantation of agribusinesses such as slaughterhouses 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.260
 refrigerators 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.130
 port moniz of factories 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.360
 in the great northeastern cities 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.340
 many restaurants specializing in beef and goats 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.400
 are emerging 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.170
 only in strength there are more or less 250 establishments that 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.689
 main attraction 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.629
 lamb and kid dishes 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:13.299
 although they already exist in technologies for processing the bovine 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.090
 goat 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.290
 in products such as hamburgers and smoked sausages 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:23.199
 these products are not so easily found on 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:24.299
 supermarkets 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.670
 while products of bovine origin 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.499
 swine and poultry 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.099
 it is also not easy to find courteous specialized 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.729
 like pernil 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.109
 and others 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.930
 these products can add value to the carcass 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.879
 besides taking better advantage of older animals 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.090
 discard 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.419
 which lose commercial value 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:52.089
 in the meat technology laboratory of the embrapa goats in sobral in ceará 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.389
 and also 

00:02:53.389 --> 00:02:56.489
 in other public and private institutions 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.289
 several products were developed 

00:02:59.289 --> 00:03:03.769
 the production methodology can be easily adopted 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.189
 the paintings created 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:08.489
 the research work of the embrapa goats 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.469
 has revealed great potential for the processing of light derivatives 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.109
 we passed goats and sheep 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:16.459
 these are paulo 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.899
 has developed 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.160
 products like pre-salt English 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.539
 in early spring like never before 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:28.559
 the product derived from goats and sheep that adds more value is on foot there 

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:30.540
 since the withdrawal 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.939
 until the transformation into footwear 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.159
 bags and garments 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.279
 dubbed recorders about 700% 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:40.380
 sheep skin 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.410
 in the cartoon 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.569
 it is considered 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.530
 one of the best existing ones providing clothing and 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.209
 high quality 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.030
 but to achieve a better use of the skin 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.169
 care needs to be taken 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:58.169
 it is necessary to have an offer of forms 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:04.459
 and do not be thirsty with action read the thorny like the one that is shown 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.189
 on here 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:07.279
 hahaha my left 

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:12.319
 to provide a great pilot and one to prevent damage or I run into the skin 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.989
 throughout the life of the animal mainly during the 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:16.930
 finishing 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:17.799
 in the field 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.139
 the barbed wire fences and the spines of native vegetation 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.759
 should be avoided 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.190
 you should also avoid 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.630
 the late slaughter 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.870
 which exposes animals to environmental weather 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.690
 also contributes to poor skin quality 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.340
 the almost complete absence of care during slaughter 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.229
 school and conservation as well as indiscriminate crossings 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.849
 when breeders of laminated breeds are used 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:48.120
 with females from beslan 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.400
 the koldo footwear industry 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.099
 that opera with catarina and ovine skins 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.229
 is expanding in brazil 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.430
 but much of the raw material processed is imported 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:02.520
 especially from countries in Africa and Asia 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.280
 the tanneries of the northeast 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.210
 operate with approximately 50% of their installed capacity 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.410
 another source of supply to small producers 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:18.110
 let other traders deliver us the skins here in the future 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.710
 main field defect we have today in the skins bought here in Brazil 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.300
 are mainly after conservation 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.129
 they are poorly maintained 

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:28.210
 at the time you study 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.160
 the defense of this sector's cause 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.740
 the barbed wire fences 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.740
 P 

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:44.310
 after him our mind 60% of the land purchased has not not intended for 

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:47.139
 shoes that go to export which are the highest value footwear 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.479
 Proportional value of teles 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:50.779
 being that the demand 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:54.539
 We are going to consider what is not supplied by the internal market today. 

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.769
 mainly imported from Africa and some extreme countries 

00:05:57.769 --> 00:05:58.449
 orient 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.279
 only goats and sheep 

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:03.729
 apu that the market today seeks basically with a period of 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.300
 very high quality 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.150
 of extreme soft and that provide a good comfort to the final footwear 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.970
 despite all this potential, the productive chains of goats and sheep 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.889
 still little used 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:19.819
 but this should only last a short time
