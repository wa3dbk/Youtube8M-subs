00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.080 
the story so I only looked those up but
otherwise<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.590> tried<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:02.040> understand<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
otherwise I just tried to understand the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.870 
otherwise I just tried to understand the
story<00:02:03.360> altogether<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.280> wasn't<00:02:05.640> bothered

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
story altogether and I wasn't bothered

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.510 
story altogether and I wasn't bothered
if<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.210> didn't<00:02:06.869> understand<00:02:07.469> an<00:02:07.740> exact<00:02:08.099> word<00:02:08.399> in

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
if I didn't understand an exact word in

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.609 
if I didn't understand an exact word in
a<00:02:08.610> sentence<00:02:09.060> also<00:02:09.629> I<00:02:09.660> think<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:10.200> would<00:02:10.440> be

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
a sentence also I think it would be

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.930 
a sentence also I think it would be
quite<00:02:11.099> good

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
quite good

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.630 
quite good
with<00:02:12.210> a<00:02:12.480> book<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.320> has<00:02:13.560> an<00:02:13.770> easier<00:02:14.100> language

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
with a book that has an easier language

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.580 
with a book that has an easier language
so<00:02:15.540> let's<00:02:16.050> start<00:02:16.380> with<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.710> most<00:02:17.870> complex<00:02:18.870> i-5

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
so let's start with the most complex i-5

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.680 
so let's start with the most complex i-5
book<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.220> start<00:02:20.580> with<00:02:20.760> a<00:02:20.820> contemporary<00:02:21.360> book

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
book but start with a contemporary book

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.990 
book but start with a contemporary book
because<00:02:21.990> most<00:02:22.620> likely<00:02:23.100> in<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.490> contemporary

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
because most likely in a contemporary

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.890 
because most likely in a contemporary
book<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.750> won't<00:02:25.020> find<00:02:25.610> very<00:02:26.610> difficult<00:02:27.270> words

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
book you won't find very difficult words

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.580 
book you won't find very difficult words
or<00:02:28.430> expressions<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.180> would<00:02:30.660> be<00:02:30.900> basic

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
or expressions but it would be basic

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.280 
or expressions but it would be basic
English<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.490> would<00:02:32.670> help<00:02:32.850> you<00:02:33.120> get<00:02:33.810> into

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
English and that would help you get into

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.130 
English and that would help you get into
the<00:02:34.440> whole<00:02:35.370> reading<00:02:35.850> in<00:02:36.060> English<00:02:36.480> thing<00:02:36.900> and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
the whole reading in English thing and

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.920 
the whole reading in English thing and
also<00:02:37.530> one<00:02:37.890> thing<00:02:38.130> that<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.580> think<00:02:39.120> helped<00:02:39.420> me<00:02:39.630> in

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
also one thing that I think helped me in

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.380 
also one thing that I think helped me in
English<00:02:40.410> altogether<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.280> watching<00:02:42.030> TV<00:02:42.240> shows

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
English altogether is watching TV shows

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.570 
English altogether is watching TV shows
in<00:02:43.230> English<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.890> with<00:02:44.190> English<00:02:44.550> subtitles

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
in English and with English subtitles

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.230 
in English and with English subtitles
because<00:02:45.530> if<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.740> do<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.250> just<00:02:47.280> get<00:02:47.970> used

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
because if you do that you just get used

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.500 
because if you do that you just get used
to<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.540> language<00:02:48.720> itself<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.330> even<00:02:51.330> if

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
to the language itself and and even if

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.240 
to the language itself and and even if
you<00:02:51.660> don't<00:02:51.900> understand<00:02:52.440> every<00:02:52.710> single<00:02:53.070> word

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
you don't understand every single word

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.720 
you don't understand every single word
you<00:02:53.490> understand<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.690> whole<00:02:54.870> thing<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:56.190> I

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
you understand the whole thing and and I

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.280 
you understand the whole thing and and I
think<00:02:57.000> that's<00:02:57.150> what<00:02:57.360> matters<00:02:57.780> because<00:02:58.140> you

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
think that's what matters because you

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.530 
think that's what matters because you
don't<00:02:58.710> need<00:02:58.890> to<00:02:59.040> translate<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.790> if<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.180> were<00:03:00.360> to

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
don't need to translate it if I were to

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.660 
don't need to translate it if I were to
translate<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:01.110> book<00:03:01.410> or<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> page<00:03:01.890> it<00:03:02.340> would<00:03:02.490> take

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
translate a book or a page it would take

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.120 
translate a book or a page it would take
me<00:03:02.790> so<00:03:02.820> long<00:03:03.300> because<00:03:03.570> a<00:03:03.870> lot<00:03:04.140> of<00:03:04.170> times<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.770> have

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
me so long because a lot of times I have

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.070 
me so long because a lot of times I have
no<00:03:05.340> idea<00:03:05.670> what<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:06.060> word<00:03:06.270> means<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.720> can't

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
no idea what a word means so I can't

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.380 
no idea what a word means so I can't
find<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.440> Hungarian<00:03:08.130> version<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.180> word

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
find the Hungarian version to that word

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.860 
find the Hungarian version to that word
but<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.260> could<00:03:10.730> explain<00:03:11.730> what<00:03:12.300> it<00:03:12.450> means<00:03:12.690> but

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
but I could explain what it means but

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.570 
but I could explain what it means but
could<00:03:13.140> but<00:03:13.440> I<00:03:13.560> wouldn't<00:03:13.890> be<00:03:14.010> able<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.250> find

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
could but I wouldn't be able to find

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
could but I wouldn't be able to find
just<00:03:15.300> one<00:03:15.540> word<00:03:15.840> to<00:03:16.590> translate<00:03:17.070> it<00:03:17.250> into<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.880> I

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
just one word to translate it into and I

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.440 
just one word to translate it into and I
think<00:03:18.690> that's<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.890> same<00:03:20.130> with<00:03:20.310> books<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:20.910> just

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
think that's the same with books so just

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.740 
think that's the same with books so just
try<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.920> understand<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.370> as<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:24.060> whole<00:03:24.420> and

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
try to understand it and as a whole and

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.740 
try to understand it and as a whole and
not<00:03:25.020> sentence<00:03:25.890> by<00:03:26.040> sentence<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:26.820> back<00:03:27.540> then

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
not sentence by sentence and back then

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.570 
not sentence by sentence and back then
when<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.050> started<00:03:28.530> reading<00:03:28.800> in<00:03:29.070> English<00:03:29.370> I

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
when I started reading in English I

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.120 
when I started reading in English I
couldn't<00:03:30.300> do<00:03:30.420> it<00:03:30.480> as<00:03:30.630> easily<00:03:30.840> as<00:03:31.320> I<00:03:31.530> do<00:03:31.590> it<00:03:31.860> now

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
couldn't do it as easily as I do it now

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.390 
couldn't do it as easily as I do it now
so<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.970> definitely<00:03:33.350> it<00:03:34.350> definitely<00:03:34.920> will<00:03:35.070> get

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
so it definitely it definitely will get

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.240 
so it definitely it definitely will get
better<00:03:35.700> I<00:03:36.030> promise<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.080> I<00:03:37.770> think<00:03:37.890> it's

just really cool if you can read in a

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.960 
just really cool if you can read in a
