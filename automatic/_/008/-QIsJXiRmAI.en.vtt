00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
going to miss that aspect of brandon

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.900 
going to miss that aspect of brandon
marshall<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:28.530> hey<00:03:29.220> the<00:03:29.430> sky<00:03:29.640> is<00:03:29.700> the<00:03:29.820> limit

marshall but hey the sky is the limit

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.979 
marshall but hey the sky is the limit
for<00:03:30.180> kevin<00:03:30.690> white<00:03:30.840> he<00:03:31.500> did<00:03:31.830> run<00:03:32.370> for<00:03:32.840> 3540<00:03:33.840> so

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
for kevin white he did run for 3540 so

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.490 
for kevin white he did run for 3540 so
he's<00:03:34.310> blazing<00:03:35.310> fast<00:03:35.549> 23<00:03:36.540> reps<00:03:36.780> for<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.290> bench

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
like I said with the UM run block he's

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.670 
like I said with the UM run block he's
got<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.350> lot<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.560> strain<00:03:43.860> now<00:03:44.549> he<00:03:45.330> do<00:03:45.780> I<00:03:46.080> think<00:03:46.530> he

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
got a lot of strain now he do I think he

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.009 
got a lot of strain now he do I think he
is<00:03:46.890> a<00:03:46.920> little<00:03:47.400> bit<00:03:47.549> less<00:03:48.060> potential<00:03:48.720> than

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
is a little bit less potential than

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
can get the ball to him so that's always

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.219
