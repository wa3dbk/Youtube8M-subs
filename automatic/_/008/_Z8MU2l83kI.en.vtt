 ask how to download it because 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.930

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.140
 we benefit by deepening this my 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.660
 searches I found on a forum 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 American 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.530

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.940
 a little recomposed my way so I 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.640

 described that's all was already trying 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.400

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.600
 in a row of which there is no step 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.130
 virus comment is clean 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.000
 I've already done an analysis 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:50.280
 is that full of the antivirus one you 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.280

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.860
 how are you going to put a whole for the 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.610
 download all soaps is already 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.890
 installed no need to do it again and that 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.890
 will be the same thing the same 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.760
 I 'm going to see it there because I'm wrong 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.080
 same bread exhibits the same involvement to 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.990
 open for for 4d cinema could 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.870
 create a camp will be called pure or 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.430
 if you feel like telling me I have them 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.680
 personally I put them there that 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:27.770
 it's not like com Thursday is good 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:31.250
 to fang and not how to say 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.690
 michel official it is precisely same 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.060
 except it's not an officer 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:38.690
 not connected to the internet to check 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.920
 the notebooks all so it will take the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:47.750
 put on the taskbar for 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:50.570
 that you see otherwise it works 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.340
 will open it show you it works then 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.360
 it seems like a little bit of time with them but 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.950
 rare because it is compressed you 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.650
 drag when once he has 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.610
 summer leader you do 10 and delta here he 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.330
 had only to click on it to 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.239
 open it is super simple and after 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.400
 you wonder in a key of 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.200
 check so that hinders you click 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.629
 on my 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.280
 under my little document there to fill 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:22.080
 the facts are simple and as I 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.080
 say there's no virus no dornach 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.470
 I will ask you only by a bet if this 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.209
 will be much simpler 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.560
 that's okay so it's the same and the 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.000
 time seems that there so we salute what 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:39.190
 I could have more time because 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.680
 that does the official version 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.330
 want and directly in the menu not 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.670
 that you can put a penny for them 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.700
 masters and right here so they launch themselves 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.660
 who would be in the discussion 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.310
 the little file or black ouch according to this 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.650
 loading ten external modules works 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.000
 very very good 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:05.880
 in addition you will be able to record your 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.880
 videos and all that without any worry 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:16.450
 but to show it works, that's it 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:18.190
 exactly the real thing is everything and in 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.400
 more you can buy at the project 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.580
 while in the demo version of two 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:29.950
 younger cinemas we can not then there 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.750
 you can say what you want if 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.060
 that's if you make the same club for 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.650
 to make cubes all that to you to see 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.500
 but I give you the tone for 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.870
 download software 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.460
 after you do what you want 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.860

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.840
