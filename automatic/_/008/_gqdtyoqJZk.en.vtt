00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.060
 the question everyone is asking 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.460
 why did a cluster have a 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.900
 bunch I tell you one thing that's 34 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.059
 years fall here with you in the 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.080
 fashion middle in montreal and i think 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.910
 that our industry 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.280
 she needs us to take charge 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.420
 is the best tool to be able to 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.190
 take charge is a serious 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.480
 see the speakers who will 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.820
 talk soon for me about 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.860
 the importance of working together 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.530
 mobilize to build projects 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.530
 of exchanged to do things for 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.019
 our succession for our young people for our 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.150
 partners for québec because a 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.589
 strong industry in the dreary it's a 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.010
 radiation then it's part of our 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.010
 identity 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.310
 the whole universe of fashion the universe of 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.479
 garment entered a time permutations 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.130
 at the level of its networks of 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.229
 distribution that how to operate 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.759
 we left we made in china 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.049
 comes from local productions and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.159
 a lot of change people this 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.200
 series is just new to 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.520
 consumption parameters the media 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.590
 many business models in canada 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.270
 that does not work anymore we are all in 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.210
 are asking these same questions the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.250
 know how to stand out 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.020
 more because the competition is 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.450
 become so strong and I believe that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.320
 it is by joining forces 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.670
 different sectors 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.920
 we will be able to create 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.229
 new ways of presenting 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.509
 clothes and they want to way of 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.409
 to be able to reach the new ones 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.270
 new consumers 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.289
 I think the fashion industry at 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.300
 Quebec really has something to 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:01.800
 tell also not just us and any 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.759
 the fashion industry in quebec 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.990
 something to tell people 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.179
 extraordinary that manufactures in the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.220
 beauce or lake saint jean there are 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.590
 distributors like siemens who are 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.380
 of a fabulous performance then a 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.330
 creator pool who who is very 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.890
 very talented we owed all his 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.360
 together for sure we can go 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.579
 to the neck faster much more 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.560
 far each has its own identity 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:26.970
 everyone is a product that him 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.370
 looks who's who complete and so 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.079
 all Quebec designers this complex 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.780
 I thought so that's what makes 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:36.090
 bring all this back into one and the same 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.560
 organization will do that we will be 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.410
 able together to rise to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.150
 the international and sets of 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.340
 show that Montreal has the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.709
 skills to be a fashion capital 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.850
 and i think montreal must have that 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.850
 it's an extraordinary city 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.879
 sometimes we find ourselves for lack of 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:24.799
 rigor at the level of orders 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.299
 how a garment should be designed 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.620
 of course in everyday life 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.030
 whether with trainees who 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.340
 come to work internally with us 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.500
 be it with our team 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.959
 this rigor I try to convey it 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.669
 to just make sure that this 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.439
 up there to be able to work the 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:44.150
 good way to transmit 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.090
 knowledge like me there are people 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.919
 who showed me a few years my 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.540
 job just working with 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.730
 other stakeholders in the industry 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.620
 textile or whatever the research 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.569
 who may have even done to find 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.280
 other people to do our 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.229
 clothes they are made at 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.269
 Canada 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:04.669
 all the new technologies in 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:06.379
 fabrics and all that can be a 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:09.049
 super interesting collaboration 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.909
 I think that collaboration and sharing 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.310
 knowledge is essential for 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:24.520
 that montréal remains or becomes again or 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:24.520
 become a key player in fashion but 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.470
 by force of things I learned 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.020
 quickly that it has competitive advantage 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.509
 of a company came from its ability to 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.620
 to learn but also and especially 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:40.120
 to apply to implement this 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.120
 she had learned in action 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.949
 if we are not in the fast moving 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.789
 Changes 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.319
 unfortunately we risk going to 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.259
 side so a time factor that becomes 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:55.659
 very important and we see it everywhere 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:57.639
 elsewhere it is a heavy trend of 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:01.749
 bring people back the different actors 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.949
 to be around the same table for 

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:04.899
 discuss issues and see 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:06.369
 how can we progress today to 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:08.770
 so many new trends that 

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:10.479
 impact our industry if we look 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.499
 just in the last few years at all 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.349
 what is the trade 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:15.459
 electronic and any changes to 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.069
 level of technology 

00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:44.039
 it becomes very interesting challenges 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:50.680
 for retailers we worked hard 

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:52.749
 allopass axes carry a handicap so 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.430
 henry cares about business in 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:59.039
 working together we will succeed in 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.039
 raise Montreal internationally 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:06.889
 so I think the bunch is really going 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:10.460
 help our industry it's going to be a 

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:12.080
 cluster that will bring together a lot 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.020
 many players of the joys that have a 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:17.389
 interest common to an interest for that 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.300
 the industry can compete with 

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:22.849
 with international stakeholders is 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.949
 really to radiate for only here 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:26.389
 at home but around the world 

00:06:24.949 --> 00:06:28.669
 it's important to be together 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.590
 let's go into this new there in this 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:31.940
 revival actually if there are problems 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.500
 and solutions if there are solutions 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.900
 it's a group that we find 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.729
 by being a member of a network by 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.340
 allowing all together to work 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:43.070
 in the same direction while listening in 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.440
 getting along by explaining things 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.259
 but it allows everyone to have 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.820
 a common goal and therefore to be a part of 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.080
 the solution of being a part of 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.970
 innovation to be a part of the 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.860
 renewal I think everyone 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.990
 together here an extraordinary energy 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.430
 I am convinced that working in 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.539
 team then to make that passion at 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.340
 locle that drives us all 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:02.780
 we will be able to accomplish things 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.610
 extraordinary at the technological level 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.320
 labor at the research level 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.080
 he knows what's needed and driving 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:10.490
 is a crucial element in a graffiti and 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.320
 I need everyone here 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:14.210
 today I think it's going to be a 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:16.190
 extraordinary project there are four 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.810
 beauchamp tic are coming and these 

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.680
 the projects are essential for the 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.570
 departure from the cluster 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.280
 we will need legs for stration 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.919
 we will need people everywhere so I 

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.139
 invite you jade the industry to come

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:29.240
 long-term project 

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:31.219
