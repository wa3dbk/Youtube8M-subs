 minecraft which is that when we do 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.599

 comments I have everything ready 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.180
 according what we need is this 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.739
 file here this zip point is worth the 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.480
 description you have the link of the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.850
 download we download it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.090
 decompress and we get this folder 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.800
 from here we enter very well we only go to 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.469
 use the folder already and the folder 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.629
 nobody is worth us two forget you 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.520
 them very well the next thing that you have to 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.739
 do is find the point folder 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.649
 minecraft this folder is hidden from 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.750
 agreement in linux we give you to see show 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.539
 hidden files and we get out here is already 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.760
 easy on windows is a bit more hidden 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.019
 what we are going to need is to copy and 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.369
 paste a command that is in the 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.690
 description what we do in the 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.790
 windows finder and we 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.520
 directly to the minecraft two folder 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.950
 ways will give you the exact route in case 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.880
 you want to access from my pc or from 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.860
 wherever 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.230
 It's worth very well once we've 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.970
 found as we enter inside 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.940
 from the point minecraft folder we enter 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.640
 in the pp also 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.000
 these three files points we see 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:32.210
 here we have to overwrite them by 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.340
 the three identical files points that 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.110
 there is in the folder heart of the folder 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.540
 that we have decompressed takes 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.540
 very well let's see what this is 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:49.090
 this and this these three you see that are the 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.770
 we drag them here and the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.800
 over we write this is what you have to 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.710
 to agree 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.430
 very well we go back and enter the 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.350
 native folder 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.620
 we select our operating system 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.110
 I'm in Linux so Linux 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.910
 and all these files here are there 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.460
 to put inside the native folder 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.340
 which is inside the bin folder inside 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.530
 from the minecraft folder if we enter here 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.080
 which, as you can see, are exactly the same 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.300
 then we select all of these from 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.310
 here and the copy and masters here is about 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.130
 they write and that's it 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.170
 then we close everything we have opened 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.430
 and we can play minecraft 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.810
 quietly as you see is very simple 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.030
 what we have done has been to replace 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.830
 some graphic libraries to solve 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.840
 the problem of the black screen 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.340
 so with this in theory the problem 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.830
 it's gone and we can play 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.120
 quietly to minecraft serves both 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.330
 for the pirated version as for the 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.430
 original version so remember that if 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.990
 this tutorial has served you then to leave 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.240
 a comment or decide what has gone 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.940
 well I do not know what gives it like share it 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.010
 with friends if they have the problem 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.810
 etcetera in order any doubt 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.090

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.849
