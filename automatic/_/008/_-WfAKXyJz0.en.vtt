00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
it was actually this long when I cut

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.540 
it was actually this long when I cut
this<00:00:21.060> handle<00:00:21.449> off<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.930> original<00:00:22.320> handle<00:00:23.510> and

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
added a wood handle to it not bad for a

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.540 
added a wood handle to it not bad for a
first<00:00:32.340> tried<00:00:32.640> these<00:00:32.850> screws<00:00:33.270> were<00:00:34.219> from<00:00:35.219> a

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
first tried these screws were from a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.430 
first tried these screws were from a
handsaw<00:00:36.300> an<00:00:36.480> old<00:00:36.630> hand<00:00:36.899> saw<00:00:37.110> they're<00:00:37.290> nice

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
handsaw an old hand saw they're nice

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.380 
handsaw an old hand saw they're nice
brass<00:00:37.770> screws<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.489> hold<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.910> handle<00:00:39.270> on

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
brass screws that hold that handle on

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.569 
brass screws that hold that handle on
they're<00:00:39.570> really<00:00:39.780> firmly<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:42.210> made<00:00:42.660> the

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
they're really firmly so I made the

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.160 
they're really firmly so I made the
shape<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> handle<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.780> was<00:00:45.930> nice

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
shape of the handle so that it was nice

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.220 
shape of the handle so that it was nice
and<00:00:46.200> comfortable<00:00:46.800> for<00:00:46.950> chopping<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:49.050> can

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and comfortable for chopping and I can

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.250 
and comfortable for chopping and I can
also<00:00:49.379> choke<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.950> because<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.989> put<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.020> finger

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
also choke up because I put a finger

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.490 
also choke up because I put a finger
groove<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.520> blade<00:00:53.730> right<00:00:54.000> there

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
groove in the blade right there

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.279 
groove in the blade right there
so<00:00:55.500> for<00:00:55.710> finer<00:00:55.920> chopping<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.550> carving<00:00:57.289> that'll

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
so for finer chopping or carving that'll

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.819 
so for finer chopping or carving that'll
do<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:59.270> it's<00:01:00.270> very<00:01:00.480> comfortable<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.289> used<00:01:01.620> it

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
do it it's very comfortable I used it

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.100 
do it it's very comfortable I used it
just<00:01:03.080> this<00:01:04.080> morning<00:01:04.500> ashlee<00:01:04.860> processing<00:01:05.850> wood

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
just this morning ashlee processing wood

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.070 
just this morning ashlee processing wood
very<00:01:07.110> comfortable<00:01:08.180> very<00:01:09.180> safe<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:09.930> it's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
very comfortable very safe because it's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.890 
very comfortable very safe because it's
shorter<00:01:10.500> now<00:01:10.909> it's<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:12.060> thin<00:01:12.270> knife<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.750> not

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
shorter now it's a thin knife it's not

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.830 
shorter now it's a thin knife it's not
like<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> traditional<00:01:13.350> survival<00:01:14.340> or<00:01:14.840> hunting

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
like a traditional survival or hunting

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.179 
like a traditional survival or hunting
style<00:01:16.049> knife<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:17.100> the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
style knife because it's just the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.120 
style knife because it's just the
thickness<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.759> machete<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.979> it's<00:01:19.979> pretty

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
thickness of a machete but it's pretty

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.679 
thickness of a machete but it's pretty
strong<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.509> very<00:01:21.659> strong<00:01:21.930> steel<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:23.689> it

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
strong it's a very strong steel and it

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.980 
strong it's a very strong steel and it
holds<00:01:25.259> an<00:01:25.380> edge<00:01:25.409> pretty<00:01:25.950> well<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.990> razor-sharp

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
holds an edge pretty well a razor-sharp

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.410 
holds an edge pretty well a razor-sharp
edge<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:31.189> made<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:33.509> sheath<00:01:33.810> here<00:01:34.170> out<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.650> a
