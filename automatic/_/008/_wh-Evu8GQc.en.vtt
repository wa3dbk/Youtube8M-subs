00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
this one looks like frontale um before I

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.720 
this one looks like frontale um before I
was<00:04:11.700> really<00:04:12.269> focusing<00:04:12.810> on<00:04:12.989> my<00:04:13.349> cardio<00:04:13.859> but<00:04:14.609> now

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
was really focusing on my cardio but now

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.020 
was really focusing on my cardio but now
I<00:04:14.760> found<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.329> my<00:04:15.569> muscle<00:04:16.259> early<00:04:16.650> so<00:04:17.250> I've

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
I found that my muscle early so I've

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.999 
I found that my muscle early so I've
noticed<00:04:18.269> that<00:04:18.600> the<00:04:18.750> more<00:04:18.780> strength<00:04:19.769> i'm

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:20.009 
noticed that the more strength i'm

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:21.740 
noticed that the more strength i'm
actually<00:04:20.220> doing<00:04:20.489> is<00:04:20.729> really<00:04:21.090> helping<00:04:21.479> me<00:04:21.539> to

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
actually doing is really helping me to

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.529 
actually doing is really helping me to
be<00:04:21.900> big<00:04:22.169> so<00:04:22.949> i<00:04:23.340> think<00:04:23.550> you<00:04:23.910> really<00:04:24.240> have<00:04:24.389> to

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
be big so i think you really have to

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.779 
be big so i think you really have to
balance<00:04:24.690> cardio<00:04:25.440> and<00:04:25.710> strength<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:26.610> make<00:04:26.760> sure

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
balance cardio and strength so make sure

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:30.879 
balance cardio and strength so make sure
you're<00:04:27.240> doing<00:04:27.270> both<00:04:27.600> people<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.520> cardio<00:04:29.520> will

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
you're doing both people and cardio will

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.080 
you're doing both people and cardio will
it's<00:04:31.889> good<00:04:32.130> for<00:04:32.160> your<00:04:32.340> heart<00:04:32.580> and<00:04:32.880> your

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
it's good for your heart and your

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.300 
it's good for your heart and your
stamina<00:04:33.479> and<00:04:34.820> the<00:04:35.820> weight<00:04:36.090> will<00:04:36.750> actually

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
stamina and the weight will actually

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.029 
stamina and the weight will actually
