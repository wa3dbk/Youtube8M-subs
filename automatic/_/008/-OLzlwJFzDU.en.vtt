those<00:01:27.479> outbreaks<00:01:27.960> of<00:01:28.110> heavy<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> thundery

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
those outbreaks of heavy and thundery

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.100 
those outbreaks of heavy and thundery
rain<00:01:29.220> cropping<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.700> almost<00:01:30.180> anywhere<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.020> at

I<00:01:32.579> think<00:01:32.640> later<00:01:33.360> on<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.689> night<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> very

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
I think later on in the night a very

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.260 
I think later on in the night a very
warm<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:34.979> sticky<00:01:35.189> night<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.850> temperatures

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
warm and sticky night the temperatures

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.780 
warm and sticky night the temperatures
at<00:01:36.420> their<00:01:36.570> lowest<00:01:36.780> around<00:01:37.200> about<00:01:37.350> 15<00:01:37.829> or<00:01:38.430> 17

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790

even degrees in the southeastern corner

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.889 
even degrees in the southeastern corner
country<00:01:41.220> there's<00:01:41.759> tomorrow's<00:01:42.150> chart<00:01:42.479> red<00:01:42.750> one

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.359 
country there's tomorrow's chart red one
has<00:01:43.020> changed<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.530> fact<00:01:43.710> what<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.920> can't<00:01:44.159> see

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
has changed in fact what you can't see

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.679 
has changed in fact what you can't see
there<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.820> there's<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> small<00:01:45.270> area<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
there is that there's a small area of

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.300 
there is that there's a small area of
low<00:01:45.840> pressure<00:01:45.869> there's<00:01:46.680> going<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:47.009> sitting

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
low pressure there's going to be sitting

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.920 
low pressure there's going to be sitting
more<00:01:47.549> or<00:01:47.640> less<00:01:47.759> over<00:01:47.939> southern<00:01:48.390> parts<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
more or less over southern parts of the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.660 
more or less over southern parts of the
Midlands<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.920> is<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.430> another

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
Midlands so it is going to be another

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.249

pretty<00:01:50.939> cloudy<00:01:51.299> day<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.720> fact<00:01:51.869> we'll<00:01:51.990> start

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
pretty cloudy day in fact we'll start

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.840 
pretty cloudy day in fact we'll start
off<00:01:52.409> dull<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.100> Misty<00:01:53.399> I<00:01:53.430> think<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:53.820> still

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
off dull and Misty I think there still

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.910 
off dull and Misty I think there still
be<00:01:54.180> one<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:54.869> two<00:01:54.990> of<00:01:55.110> those<00:01:55.200> outbreaks<00:01:55.740> of

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
be one or two of those outbreaks of

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.139 
be one or two of those outbreaks of
sundry<00:01:56.280> rain<00:01:56.460> around<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:56.850> won't<00:01:56.939> be

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
sundry rain around it won't be

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.459 
sundry rain around it won't be
brightening<00:01:57.540> up<00:01:57.689> though<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.899> think<00:01:58.020> many

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
brightening up though I think many

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.830 
brightening up though I think many
places<00:01:58.740> will<00:01:59.040> enjoy<00:01:59.310> some<00:01:59.939> fleeting<00:02:00.390> glimpses

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
places will enjoy some fleeting glimpses

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.630 
places will enjoy some fleeting glimpses
of<00:02:00.899> rather<00:02:01.290> watery<00:02:01.710> sunshine<00:02:02.219> during<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
of rather watery sunshine during the

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.340 
of rather watery sunshine during the
course<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.000> day<00:02:03.149> but<00:02:03.689> that's<00:02:03.840> only<00:02:04.020> going<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
course a day but that's only going to

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.929 
course a day but that's only going to
once<00:02:04.530> again<00:02:04.829> set<00:02:05.100> off<00:02:05.219> these<00:02:05.430> heavy<00:02:05.670> and

or<00:02:46.599> so<00:02:46.750> in<00:02:46.900> just<00:02:47.079> an<00:02:47.170> hour<00:02:47.290> four<00:02:47.980> inches<00:02:48.250> of

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
or so in just an hour four inches of

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.430 
or so in just an hour four inches of
rain<00:02:48.609> in<00:02:48.970> two<00:02:49.480> hours<00:02:49.750> and<00:02:50.079> I<00:02:50.140> think<00:02:50.200> there's

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
rain in two hours and I think there's

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.630 
rain in two hours and I think there's
going<00:02:50.560> to<00:02:50.620> be<00:02:50.680> some<00:02:50.890> more<00:02:51.040> thunderstorms

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
going to be some more thunderstorms

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
there's the culprit that area of low

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.780

weather-wise a lot of cloud around a lot

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.080 
weather-wise a lot of cloud around a lot
of<00:03:20.530> those<00:03:20.650> outbreaks<00:03:21.069> of<00:03:21.370> rain<00:03:21.609> some<00:03:21.849> really

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
of those outbreaks of rain some really

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.240 
of those outbreaks of rain some really
heavy<00:03:22.299> and<00:03:22.540> persistent<00:03:23.139> rain<00:03:23.709> as<00:03:23.919> well<00:03:24.040> there

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
heavy and persistent rain as well there

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.650 
heavy and persistent rain as well there
is<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> little<00:03:24.519> brightness<00:03:25.060> here<00:03:25.180> and<00:03:25.359> there

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
is a little brightness here and there

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.690 
is a little brightness here and there
for<00:03:25.900> instance<00:03:26.169> in<00:03:26.319> Eastern<00:03:27.040> Scotland<00:03:27.549> the

extreme<00:03:28.000> southeast<00:03:28.480> of<00:03:28.630> England<00:03:28.930> I<00:03:29.049> think<00:03:29.410> the

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
extreme southeast of England I think the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.289 
extreme southeast of England I think the
best<00:03:29.680> place<00:03:29.919> to<00:03:29.980> enjoy<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.519> sunshine<00:03:30.849> today

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
best place to enjoy the sunshine today

Scotland and over most of Scotland it

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.050
