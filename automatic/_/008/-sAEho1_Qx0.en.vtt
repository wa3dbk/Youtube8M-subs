00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:33.319 
an undergrad not so much in high school

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.370 
an undergrad not so much in high school
but<00:02:34.160> I'm<00:02:35.000> kind<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.569> contradicting<00:02:36.230> myself

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
but I'm kind of contradicting myself

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.830 
but I'm kind of contradicting myself
because<00:02:36.890> earlier<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.400> talked<00:02:37.730> about<00:02:37.849> how

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
because earlier I talked about how

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.470 
because earlier I talked about how
there's<00:02:39.709> these<00:02:40.190> Advantage<00:02:40.790> programs<00:02:41.269> our

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
there's these Advantage programs our

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.050 
there's these Advantage programs our
accelerated<00:02:41.989> programs<00:02:42.440> that<00:02:43.160> those<00:02:43.640> programs

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
accelerated programs that those programs

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.099 
accelerated programs that those programs
will<00:02:44.690> base<00:02:46.180> everything<00:02:47.180> on<00:02:47.570> your<00:02:47.690> high<00:02:47.840> school

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.349 
will base everything on your high school
GPAs<00:02:48.560> but<00:02:49.010> I<00:02:49.040> don't<00:02:49.340> think<00:02:49.549> they'll<00:02:49.700> count<00:02:50.090> too

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
GPAs but I don't think they'll count too

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:52.569 
GPAs but I don't think they'll count too
much<00:02:50.540> on<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.870> coursework<00:02:51.350> but<00:02:51.890> more<00:02:52.100> so<00:02:52.370> on

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
much on the coursework but more so on

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.360 
much on the coursework but more so on
what<00:02:52.850> your<00:02:53.000> out<00:02:53.260> overall<00:02:54.260> GPA<00:02:54.799> is<00:02:55.040> when<00:02:55.280> you

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
what your out overall GPA is when you

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.660 
what your out overall GPA is when you
graduate<00:02:55.850> so<00:02:56.660> yeah<00:02:57.350> I<00:02:57.380> think<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:57.950> need<00:02:58.190> really

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
graduate so yeah I think you need really

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.849 
graduate so yeah I think you need really
high<00:02:58.820> GPA<00:02:59.299> to<00:02:59.480> get<00:02:59.660> into<00:02:59.959> those<00:03:00.109> accelerated

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859 
high GPA to get into those accelerated

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:03.069 
high GPA to get into those accelerated
programs<00:03:01.310> so<00:03:01.640> that's<00:03:02.540> something<00:03:02.900> to<00:03:03.049> know

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
programs so that's something to know

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.930 
programs so that's something to know
because<00:03:03.859> I'll<00:03:03.980> talk<00:03:04.190> more<00:03:04.220> about<00:03:04.489> the

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
because I'll talk more about the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.849 
because I'll talk more about the
specialties<00:03:05.720> of<00:03:06.079> different<00:03:06.500> types<00:03:06.680> of

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
specialties of different types of

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.039 
specialties of different types of
pharmacy<00:03:07.370> so<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.239> can<00:03:08.450> have<00:03:08.600> more<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:08.930> an

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
pharmacy so that you can have more of an

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.210 
pharmacy so that you can have more of an
understanding<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.709> what<00:03:09.950> there<00:03:10.220> is<00:03:10.370> out<00:03:10.549> there

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
understanding of what there is out there

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.250 
understanding of what there is out there
instead<00:03:12.220> of<00:03:12.370> focusing<00:03:13.209> so<00:03:13.690> much<00:03:13.750> on<00:03:14.020> what

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
instead of focusing so much on what

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.990 
instead of focusing so much on what
classes<00:03:14.860> you<00:03:14.950> take<00:03:15.220> in<00:03:15.370> high<00:03:15.520> school<00:03:15.849> and

classes you take in high school and

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.140 
classes you take in high school and

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
stuff I'd focus on just outright GPA and

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.940 
stuff I'd focus on just outright GPA and
then<00:03:20.580> also<00:03:21.580> doing<00:03:21.849> extracurriculars<00:03:22.840> if<00:03:23.260> you
