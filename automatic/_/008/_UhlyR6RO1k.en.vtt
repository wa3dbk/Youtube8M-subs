tutorial<00:00:02.850> for<00:00:03.090> pebbled<00:00:03.570> Paisley<00:00:04.140> this<00:00:05.100> is

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
tutorial for pebbled Paisley this is

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.909 
tutorial for pebbled Paisley this is
stitched<00:00:05.670> by<00:00:06.000> first<00:00:06.480> starting<00:00:07.049> with<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.620> line

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
stitched by first starting with a line

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.480 
stitched by first starting with a line
of<00:00:08.130> circular<00:00:08.639> shapes<00:00:08.940> your<00:00:09.450> pebbles<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.190> so<00:00:11.190> I

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
of circular shapes your pebbles and so I

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.120 
of circular shapes your pebbles and so I
just<00:00:11.880> work<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.360> kind<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.440> line<00:00:13.740> I

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
just work this kind of in a line I

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.250 
just work this kind of in a line I
didn't<00:00:14.820> try<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.360> veer<00:00:15.630> off<00:00:15.660> or<00:00:15.960> make<00:00:16.109> them

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
didn't try and veer off or make them

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.390 
didn't try and veer off or make them
crazy<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:17.039> did<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> simple<00:00:18.060> line<00:00:18.330> of

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.400 
crazy I just did a simple line of

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.920 
crazy I just did a simple line of
circular<00:00:20.400> shapes<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.180> then<00:00:21.449> you're<00:00:21.600> going<00:00:21.779> to

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
circular shapes and then you're going to

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.679 
circular shapes and then you're going to
get<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> tip<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.519> very<00:00:23.760> top<00:00:24.029> circle<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
get to the tip the very top circle and

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.050 
get to the tip the very top circle and
travel<00:00:25.560> your<00:00:25.710> way<00:00:25.769> all<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.490> way<00:00:26.519> back<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
travel your way all the way back to the

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.990 
travel your way all the way back to the
beginning<00:00:27.650> takes<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.830> little<00:00:28.980> practice<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.789> do

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
beginning takes a little practice to do

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.790 
beginning takes a little practice to do
this<00:00:30.119> level<00:00:30.539> of<00:00:30.599> traveling<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.650> take

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
this level of traveling but just take

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.420 
this level of traveling but just take
your<00:00:31.920> time<00:00:32.570> then<00:00:33.570> you're<00:00:34.110> going<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.680> pivot<00:00:35.130> off

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
your time then you're going to pivot off

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.420 
your time then you're going to pivot off
that<00:00:35.640> starting<00:00:36.120> point<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:37.079> two<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:37.980> three

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that starting point with two or three

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.200 
that starting point with two or three
echoes<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.250> can<00:00:41.430> see<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:41.969> keeping

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
echoes and you can see that I'm keeping

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.260 
echoes and you can see that I'm keeping
the<00:00:42.540> echoes<00:00:42.989> also<00:00:43.590> consistent<00:00:44.309> distances<00:00:45.000> in

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
the echoes also consistent distances in

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.850 
the echoes also consistent distances in
this<00:00:45.390> case<00:00:45.600> about<00:00:45.899> an<00:00:46.110> eighth<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.590> an<00:00:46.739> inch

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
this case about an eighth of an inch

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.549 
this case about an eighth of an inch
away<00:00:47.129> from<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.730> previous<00:00:48.149> line<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.750> it

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
away from the previous line and it

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.470 
away from the previous line and it
really<00:00:49.980> adds<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> texture<00:00:51.210> of<00:00:51.239> this

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
really adds to the texture of this

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.410 
really adds to the texture of this
design<00:00:51.899> because<00:00:52.460> the<00:00:53.460> circles<00:00:53.940> really<00:00:54.239> get

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
design because the circles really get

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.010 
design because the circles really get
your<00:00:54.539> attention<00:00:55.039> but<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:57.059> echoes<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
your attention but then the echoes the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.849 
your attention but then the echoes the
lines<00:00:58.379> around<00:00:58.710> them<00:00:59.399> are<00:00:59.640> what<00:01:00.600> really<00:01:00.859> draw

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
lines around them are what really draw

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.550 
lines around them are what really draw
your<00:01:02.129> eye<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.879> each<00:01:03.260> individual<00:01:04.260> shape<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:06.560> to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
your eye to each individual shape and to

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.219 
your eye to each individual shape and to
move<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.280> next<00:01:08.369> one<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.180> simply<00:01:09.570> travel

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
move to the next one you simply travel

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.850 
move to the next one you simply travel
and<00:01:10.470> then<00:01:10.860> start<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.460> new<00:01:11.970> line<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.240> circles<00:01:13.080> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and then start a new line of circles and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.950 
and then start a new line of circles and
you<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.520> see<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.360> getting<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you can see I'm really getting the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.830 
you can see I'm really getting the
circles<00:01:16.500> very<00:01:16.560> very<00:01:17.280> tiny<00:01:17.670> when<00:01:18.479> they're<00:01:18.630> deep

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
circles very very tiny when they're deep

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.050 
circles very very tiny when they're deep
down<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.350> crevices<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.250> I<00:01:20.280> really<00:01:20.850> want

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
down in crevices like that I really want

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.219 
down in crevices like that I really want
them<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.270> fill<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.430> fill<00:01:23.540> up<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.840> those

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
them to fill and fill up all those

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.840 
them to fill and fill up all those
little<00:01:25.560> gaps<00:01:25.770> all<00:01:26.130> those<00:01:26.310> little<00:01:26.520> weird

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
little gaps all those little weird

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.490 
little gaps all those little weird
spaces<00:01:27.570> in<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> design<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:30.140> traveling<00:01:31.140> over

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
spaces in the design and traveling over

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410 
spaces in the design and traveling over
the<00:01:31.530> circles<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> little<00:01:32.850> tricky<00:01:33.210> that's

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
the circles is a little tricky that's

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.539 
the circles is a little tricky that's
probably<00:01:33.930> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.500> hardest<00:01:35.009> part<00:01:35.310> of

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
probably going to be the hardest part of

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.999 
probably going to be the hardest part of
the<00:01:35.729> design<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.299> south<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.710> simply

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
the design and south but just simply

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.429 
the design and south but just simply
take<00:01:38.610> your<00:01:38.670> time<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.150> keep<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:39.869> hands<00:01:40.350> a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
take your time and keep your hands a

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.380 
take your time and keep your hands a
little<00:01:40.500> closer<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> needle<00:01:41.970> then<00:01:42.270> you

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
little closer to the needle then you

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.109 
little closer to the needle then you
probably<00:01:42.420> would<00:01:43.220> normally<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.939> will

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
probably would normally and that will

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.609 
probably would normally and that will
definitely<00:01:45.329> help<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.960> maintain<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.409> better

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
definitely help you maintain a better

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.130 
definitely help you maintain a better
control<00:01:47.250> over<00:01:47.549> your<00:01:48.479> quilt<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:51.479> is<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
control over your quilt this is a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.700 
control over your quilt this is a
variation<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.689> Paisley<00:01:54.689> oh<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.229> pivoting

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
variation of Paisley oh it's a pivoting

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.010 
variation of Paisley oh it's a pivoting
design<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.340> that's<00:01:56.640> how<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.969> works<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.719> this

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
design and that's how it works so this

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.780 
design and that's how it works so this
is<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> design<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.649> will<00:01:59.009> work<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.549> about

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
is a design that will work in just about

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.690 
is a design that will work in just about
any<00:02:00.090> area<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.750> your<00:02:00.930> quilt<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:02.070> can<00:02:02.280> place<00:02:02.490> it

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
any area of your quilt you can place it

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.149 
any area of your quilt you can place it
around<00:02:02.790> complicated<00:02:03.689> quilting<00:02:04.079> motifs<00:02:04.500> or

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
around complicated quilting motifs or

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.150 
around complicated quilting motifs or
you<00:02:05.670> can<00:02:05.850> use<00:02:05.909> it<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.420> fill<00:02:06.659> large<00:02:07.049> open<00:02:07.710> areas

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
you can use it to fill large open areas

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
you can increase the size of the design

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.890 
you can increase the size of the design
and<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.580> course<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.090> amount<00:02:12.450> of

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
area it covers with each pass by

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.960 
area it covers with each pass by
increasing<00:02:16.379> the<00:02:16.530> size<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:17.129> your<00:02:17.159> pebbles<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
increasing the size of your pebbles and

increasing the size of your pebbles and
the<00:02:18.030> size<00:02:18.299> of<00:02:18.659> your<00:02:18.720> echoes<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.340> instead<00:02:20.879> of<00:02:20.939> an

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
the size of your echoes so instead of an

the size of your echoes so instead of an
eighth<00:02:21.420> of<00:02:21.599> an<00:02:21.750> inch<00:02:21.870> between<00:02:22.230> your<00:02:22.739> lines<00:02:22.950> of

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
eighth of an inch between your lines of

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.819 
eighth of an inch between your lines of
stitching<00:02:23.540> expand<00:02:24.540> it<00:02:24.689> to<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:25.049> an<00:02:25.230> inch<00:02:25.470> or<00:02:25.799> two

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:25.829 
stitching expand it to be an inch or two

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.850 
stitching expand it to be an inch or two
inches<00:02:26.040> between<00:02:26.760> the<00:02:27.060> lines<00:02:27.239> of<00:02:27.450> stitching

inches between the lines of stitching

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.009 
inches between the lines of stitching
it's<00:02:28.860> honestly<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.459> little<00:02:29.939> harder<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.510> stitch

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019
