hello my friends okay din so today I'm
gonna<00:00:08.820> look<00:00:08.970> at<00:00:09.179> em<00:00:09.480> some<00:00:09.809> armor<00:00:10.170> recipes<00:00:10.620> on

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
gonna look at em some armor recipes on

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.959 
gonna look at em some armor recipes on
junk<00:00:11.190> jack<00:00:11.460> X<00:00:12.049> um<00:00:13.049> let<00:00:13.830> me<00:00:13.920> just<00:00:14.099> say<00:00:14.309> there's

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
junk jack X um let me just say there's

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.120 
junk jack X um let me just say there's
like<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.210> common<00:00:15.719> way<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.109> doing<00:00:16.590> these<00:00:16.740> I

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
like a common way of doing these I

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.529 
like a common way of doing these I
believe<00:00:17.880> that<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.510> have<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:19.080> all<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.800> my<00:00:20.550> craft

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
believe that I have them all in my craft

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.870 
believe that I have them all in my craft
book<00:00:21.900> now<00:00:22.230> but<00:00:22.619> that's<00:00:22.830> just<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.310> craft<00:00:23.580> book

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
book now but that's just the craft book

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.400 
book now but that's just the craft book
which<00:00:24.090> doesn't<00:00:24.420> mean<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.660> say<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:25.050> then<00:00:25.230> on

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
which doesn't mean to say that then on

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.089 
which doesn't mean to say that then on
others<00:00:26.340> out<00:00:26.519> there<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.810> anyway<00:00:28.800> let's<00:00:29.010> go

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
others out there so anyway let's go

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.740 
others out there so anyway let's go
through<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.429> armor<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:29.970> we<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.599> this

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
through the armor so we have this

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.680 
through the armor so we have this
configuration<00:00:31.470> here<00:00:32.009> which<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> two<00:00:33.329> ingots

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
configuration here which is a two ingots

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.330 
configuration here which is a two ingots
on<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> left<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.380> then<00:00:34.800> two<00:00:34.980> ingots

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
on the left and a right then two ingots

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.810 
on the left and a right then two ingots
in<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> middle<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.000> then<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:37.250> bar<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
in the middle and then a bar in the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.190 
in the middle and then a bar in the
middle<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.149> top<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.750> seems<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.050> be

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
middle on top of that that seems to be

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.940 
middle on top of that that seems to be
the<00:00:40.350> common<00:00:41.070> denominator<00:00:41.780> in<00:00:42.800> armor<00:00:43.800> so

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
the common denominator in armor so

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.180 
the common denominator in armor so
that's<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.309> an<00:00:44.489> ante<00:00:45.450> neom<00:00:45.719> bar<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.770> if<00:00:47.100> you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
that's like an ante neom bar so if you

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.400 
that's like an ante neom bar so if you
can<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:48.090> copper<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.660> exactly<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
can see here with copper is exactly the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.020 
can see here with copper is exactly the
same<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.920> then<00:00:50.640> again<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:52.219> an<00:00:53.219> iron<00:00:53.789> armor

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
same and then again with an iron armor

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.569 
same and then again with an iron armor
it's<00:00:54.449> exactly<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.989> same<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.440> it's<00:00:56.309> not<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
it's exactly the same but it's not the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.630 
it's exactly the same but it's not the
same<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.420> turtle<00:00:58.230> stuff<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:58.949> for

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
same with the turtle stuff so for

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.060 
same with the turtle stuff so for
example<00:01:00.149> Diigo<00:01:00.480> you've<00:01:00.660> got<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.829> green

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
example Diigo you've got the green

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.130 
example Diigo you've got the green
turtle<00:01:02.550> chest<00:01:02.850> which<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.329> right<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.840> so

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
turtle chest which is right there so

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.600 
turtle chest which is right there so
it's<00:01:04.290> three<00:01:04.739> along<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.129> middle<00:01:05.369> been<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it's three along in the middle been the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.730 
it's three along in the middle been the
two<00:01:05.790> bits<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.180> wood<00:01:06.360> I<00:01:06.510> believe<00:01:06.810> silk<00:01:07.560> yarn

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
two bits of wood I believe silk yarn

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.210 
two bits of wood I believe silk yarn
even<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:09.240> again<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.290> mithril<00:01:10.680> armor<00:01:11.189> chest

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
even and again the mithril armor chest

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.100 
even and again the mithril armor chest
is<00:01:11.790> exactly<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> same<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.750> was<00:01:12.869> before<00:01:12.990> the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
is exactly the same as it was before the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.100 
is exactly the same as it was before the
red<00:01:16.110> turtle<00:01:16.409> chest<00:01:16.740> again<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.509> red

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
red turtle chest again is the the red

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.320 
red turtle chest again is the the red
total<00:01:19.439> shell<00:01:19.590> in<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.770> middle<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:21.030> yarn

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
total shell in the middle and the yarn

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.830 
total shell in the middle and the yarn
I'm<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.530> like<00:01:22.830> opposite<00:01:23.369> those<00:01:23.689> again<00:01:24.689> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I'm just like opposite those again the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.450 
I'm just like opposite those again the
silver<00:01:25.200> armor<00:01:25.409> chest<00:01:25.439> which<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.189> right<00:01:26.430> there

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
silver armor chest which is right there

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.200 
silver armor chest which is right there
with<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.970> ingots<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> bar<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:29.549> titanium

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
with the ingots in the bar the titanium

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.350 
with the ingots in the bar the titanium
armor<00:01:30.810> chest<00:01:31.020> again<00:01:31.920> exactly<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.670> same<00:01:32.970> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
armor chest again exactly the same and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.210 
armor chest again exactly the same and
that's<00:01:34.170> pretty<00:01:34.740> much<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.420> one<00:01:37.079> second<00:01:37.860> for

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that's pretty much it and one second for

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.539 
that's pretty much it and one second for
some<00:01:38.430> reason<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.820> can't<00:01:39.030> find<00:01:39.170> a<00:01:40.170> gold<00:01:40.829> chest<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
some reason I can't find a gold chest I

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.280 
some reason I can't find a gold chest I
don't<00:01:41.729> know<00:01:41.790> why<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.090> is<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:43.170> just

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
don't know why that is but it just

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.649 
don't know why that is but it just
doesn't<00:01:43.649> seem<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.549> there<00:01:44.820> oh<00:01:44.970> no<00:01:45.299> there<00:01:45.479> is

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
doesn't seem to be there oh no there is

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.749 
doesn't seem to be there oh no there is
look<00:01:45.840> yep<00:01:46.170> exactly<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.680> same<00:01:46.829> again<00:01:47.100> so

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
look yep exactly the same again so

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.429 
look yep exactly the same again so
that's<00:01:47.909> pretty<00:01:48.240> much<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.450> if<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.930> just<00:01:49.079> find

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
that's pretty much it if you just find

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.840 
that's pretty much it if you just find
that<00:01:49.560> configuration<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.520> that's<00:01:50.640> how<00:01:50.790> you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
that configuration and that's how you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.069 
that configuration and that's how you
make<00:01:51.119> armor<00:01:51.630> in<00:01:52.079> junk<00:01:52.710> jack<00:01:52.920> eggs<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:54.079> unless

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
make armor in junk jack eggs and unless

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.749 
make armor in junk jack eggs and unless
it's<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.409> turtle<00:01:55.770> armor<00:01:55.979> which<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.280> ever<00:01:56.549> so

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
it's the turtle armor which is ever so

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.060 
it's the turtle armor which is ever so
slightly<00:01:56.790> different<00:01:57.170> well<00:01:58.170> it's<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.530> big

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
slightly different well it's a big

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.639 
slightly different well it's a big
difference<00:01:59.250> actually<00:02:00.259> but<00:02:01.259> you've<00:02:01.409> seen<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
difference actually but you've seen the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.050 
difference actually but you've seen the
configuration<00:02:02.250> how<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.460> do<00:02:02.640> those<00:02:02.820> as<00:02:02.939> well

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
configuration how to do those as well

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.270
