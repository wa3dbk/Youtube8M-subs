00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello today i will tell you how 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.809
 increase gaming performance 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.400
 if you are weak until I am 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.549
 tell about the accordion 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.770
 desktop themes reduce quality 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.170
 desktop and at the same time enhance 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.689
 performance so you know it all 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.859
 and get down to business right now let's move on 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:30.090
 control panel nvidia and expose 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.439
 settings for maximum 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.170
 anisotropic performance 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.710
 filtering we disable the verticals 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.850
 sync pulses talk later eclipsed 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.489
 lighting background 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.340
 turn off the maximum amount 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.940
 pre-trained personnel here 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.980
 exhibition set value 2 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.660
 let's say you have sinking fps and 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.059
 the processor will help you in advance 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.920
 prepare shots 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.770
 stream optimization we include but there is 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.430
 one thing, but if you play minecraft 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.870
 then you should disable this feature 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.280
 power management mode 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.830
 maximum performance here 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.630
 understandably 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.470
 anti-aliasing we disable fx further 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.200
 smoothing gamma correction 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.140
 we will turn on since it does not affect at all 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.460
 performance and that of the bodies 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.189
 smoothing transparency we turn off 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.930
 wetter mode about them applications but 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.790
 if I am a log of advice to disable further 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.090
 triple buffering if you have 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.840
 included vertical sync here 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.590
 this is a function 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.939
 then it should turn on the acceleration 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:44.280
 mode displays on low 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:47.009
 performance texture fixing they 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.060
 anisotropic optimization here we are her 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.880
 turn on because the texture of the race is high 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.799
 performance continue to resolve 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.340
 because the peg will slow you down 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.340
 your comp 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:07.820
 so texture filtering 3 3 nina 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.820
 optimization include 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.400
 Now about vertical sync pulses 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.770
 tell in more detail happens so in 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.200
 old games for example k with the investigator 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.970
 Should I turn it off, that is, if 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.460
 you are against, we don't know 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:29.990
 It happens that in games such know the ladder 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:34.320
 no ladder for sim card is smoothing 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:38.640
 there is a break of frames 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.690
 such then we do not turn on but again 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:47.910
 if at least fps 60 is supported 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:50.160
 it will be shorter here so we all 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.990
 apply and proceed immediately to 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.570
 to the second plan 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:03:02.280
 our optimization pack is a display 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:05.550
 change the resolution so if in the game 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.580
 lag you after you've done 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.830
 it's all the same and you got up in the game 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.500
 to low settings and all our laggs 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.260
 you can do more, that something is there in 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:22.110
 you screen resolution 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.050
 16 by 9 as you see here 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.170
 here are the screen resolution itself 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.660
 big got small 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.530
 which I know may still on the Internet 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.480
 search can still find there 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:43.020
 let me stand in the game resolution 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:46.620
 thousand 100 900 0 imposes i will leave 1280 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.680
 at 720 as this is also a resolution chance 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:53.790
 I hope will give an increase of about 30 percent 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.080
 fps if it remains to lay 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:01.050
 will still have to reduce the resolution 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:03.239
 an example of 800 by 600 but there is one quality 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.730
 it will change very, very much 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:09.720
 that is, the image will stretch there I do not 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.630
 I know it will be very ugly in 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:20.280
 here and have to do here that 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:23.060
 let's go settings that is we will configure 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.060
 your display 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:33.930
 this here I have already prepared the settings 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.420
 and therefore I will show you another 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.270
 one example 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:42.590
 create use and permission so 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.630
 let's say we reduced our resolution 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:49.460
 you decision kranty nominally 900 were 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.170
 There was also 1600 by 900 in reduced 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.470
 1280 to 720 in the game but you don't care 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.080
 lag then you try another resolution 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.860
 with format 16 I hope not to lose 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.680
 quality and add performance 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:10.070
 I recommend solutions 900 years at 540 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:16.020
 come remember here we will learn everything 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:18.360
 540 is very simple here so here 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.070
 nothing is not necessary here as mine 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.870
 for example 5 push test 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.700
 Polish regime already exists 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:32.660
 the flesh since i already created me not 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:32.660
 need to output the result like mine and 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.990
 actually all in the game I will sing 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.810
 after rebooting the game when you log in 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.880
 you will have this permission in the game 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.860
 let's say you will lag even on this 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:51.419
 resolution here on this resource is 540 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:56.700
 then create and not knowing less than 84 by 180 and 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:59.250
 so on sense you caught it so I still so 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.460
 forgot to say what if you 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:07.200
 There is no such function in the control panel 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:10.740
 nvidia display setup then go to 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.740
 link and nvidia driver i will give the link in 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:17.900
 description and download the driver in general 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:17.900
 all link will be in description 

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.360
 after all this you can of course do 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.370
 clean the wedge we issued too 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:32.090
 know your roster there 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:33.610
 I don't even know what else to do in 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.400
 general all 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:40.640
 if it helped you like 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.850
 subscribe everyone good luck to new 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.850
 meeting
