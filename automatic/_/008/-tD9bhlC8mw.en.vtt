in this video we will show you two
variations<00:00:03.000> of<00:00:03.419> Tunisian<00:00:04.020> simple<00:00:04.319> stitch

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
variations of Tunisian simple stitch

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.369 
variations of Tunisian simple stitch
that<00:00:05.430> use<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.940> bar<00:00:06.210> at<00:00:06.569> the<00:00:06.750> top<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.230> the

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
that use the bar at the top of the

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.919 
that use the bar at the top of the
stitches<00:00:07.649> rather<00:00:08.160> than<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.550> posts<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.360> this

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
stitches rather than the posts and this

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.410 
stitches rather than the posts and this
is<00:00:10.080> how<00:00:10.260> they<00:00:10.440> look<00:00:10.650> this<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.730> regular

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420

posts<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:19.439> side<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.670> used<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:21.029> different

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
posts on this side we used a different

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.689 
posts on this side we used a different
part<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.050> horizontal<00:00:22.470> bar<00:00:23.039> than<00:00:23.430> this

a foundation row already worked now

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.819 
a foundation row already worked now
instead<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.290> using<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:39.260> vertical<00:00:40.260> posts

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
instead of using the vertical posts

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.060 
instead of using the vertical posts
we're<00:00:41.550> going<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.910> use<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.829> parson<00:00:43.829> a

we're going to use the parson a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.750 
we're going to use the parson a
horizontal<00:00:44.879> chain<00:00:45.270> like<00:00:46.140> piece<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.489> made

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
horizontal chain like piece that is made

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.840 
horizontal chain like piece that is made
on<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.000> return<00:00:48.510> pass<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.590> row<00:00:49.800> just

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
on the return pass of the row just

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.880 
on the return pass of the row just
completed<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.000> pulling<00:00:51.899> these<00:00:52.140> two<00:00:52.199> posts

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
completed and pulling these two posts

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
completed and pulling these two posts
apart<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.730> see<00:00:53.760> what<00:00:54.660> looks<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:54.930> a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.400 
apart you can see what looks like a
little<00:00:55.379> chain<00:00:55.890> on<00:00:56.340> its<00:00:57.059> side<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.870> we're<00:00:58.170> going

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
little chain on its side and we're going

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.189 
little chain on its side and we're going
to<00:00:58.469> put<00:00:58.770> our<00:00:59.039> hook<00:00:59.340> through<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.879> top<00:01:00.239> part<00:01:00.570> of
