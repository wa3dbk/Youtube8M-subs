00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
to once you place them they stick so you

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
kind of I'm not saying they don't they

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.899 
kind of I'm not saying they don't they
don't<00:01:52.079> blend<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.680> all<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.040> they<00:01:53.220> are<00:01:53.369> hard<00:01:53.640> to

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
don't blend it all but they are hard to

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.480 
don't blend it all but they are hard to
blend<00:01:54.320> even<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.409> you<00:01:55.500> switch<00:01:55.740> brushes<00:01:56.250> or

whatever so you kind of want to be
conscientious<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.530> first<00:02:01.799> I

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
conscientious of that I the first I

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.889 
conscientious of that I the first I
tried<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> yesterday<00:02:03.210> initially<00:02:03.689> for<00:02:03.840> the

tried a yesterday initially for the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.780 
tried a yesterday initially for the
first<00:02:04.110> time<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.829> tried<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.340> just<00:02:05.549> a

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
first time and I tried it with just a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.389 
first time and I tried it with just a
primer<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.259> shades<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:08.009> shimmer<00:02:08.280> and

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
primer and the shades the shimmer and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.089 
primer and the shades the shimmer and
the<00:02:08.700> mats<00:02:08.940> did<00:02:09.720> faith<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.530> was<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> little<00:02:10.800> bit

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
the mats did faith so I was a little bit

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.840 
the mats did faith so I was a little bit
bummed<00:02:11.340> by<00:02:11.580> that

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
bummed by that

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.130 
bummed by that
but<00:02:12.000> that's<00:02:12.210> no<00:02:12.330> big<00:02:12.510> deal<00:02:12.660> i<00:02:12.780> usually<00:02:13.110> use

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
but that's no big deal i usually use

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.300 
but that's no big deal i usually use
some<00:02:13.440> kind<00:02:13.590> of<00:02:13.710> base<00:02:13.890> i<00:02:14.130> did<00:02:14.430> use<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:15.060> primer<00:02:15.630> and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
some kind of base i did use a primer and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.090 
some kind of base i did use a primer and
i<00:02:17.310> didn't<00:02:17.910> use<00:02:18.090> a<00:02:18.120> base<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:19.110> time<00:02:19.170> but<00:02:20.070> i

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
i didn't use a base this time but i

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.520 
i didn't use a base this time but i
primed<00:02:20.520> it<00:02:20.700> really<00:02:21.000> good<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.570> i<00:02:21.720> added<00:02:22.080> on

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
primed it really good and i added on

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.060 
primed it really good and i added on
extra<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.610> i<00:02:23.640> did<00:02:24.060> notice<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.410> saying

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
extra so i did notice that and saying

extra so i did notice that and saying
that<00:02:26.370> extra<00:02:27.060> bit<00:02:27.540> i<00:02:27.840> did<00:02:28.170> notice<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.650> i<00:02:29.190> did

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
that extra bit i did notice that i did

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.520 
that extra bit i did notice that i did

still here it does fade a little bit
with<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.670> shimmers<00:02:42.120> but<00:02:42.480> if<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:42.810> pack<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.200> all

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
with the shimmers but if you pack it all

good enough it will it will fade a
little<00:02:45.870> bit<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.350> not<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.890> the<00:02:46.980> point<00:02:47.010> where

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
little bit but not to the point where

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.420 
little bit but not to the point where
it's<00:02:47.490> all<00:02:47.610> gone<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:48.810> I<00:02:49.170> did<00:02:49.500> use<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.860> shimmer

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
it's all gone so I did use the shimmer

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.240 
it's all gone so I did use the shimmer
on<00:02:50.700> my<00:02:50.940> lids<00:02:51.210> here<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.690> shimmers<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:52.560> find<00:02:52.920> to

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.750 
think that that lonely shimmers are
great<00:02:58.380> these<00:02:58.530> are<00:02:58.710> great<00:02:58.950> neutral<00:02:59.400> shimmers

lighter colors for highlight they did

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.630

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
lot easier to blend and work with and

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.250 
lot easier to blend and work with and

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
they went on beautifully but again I did

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.020 
they went on beautifully but again I did

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
have to layer it to get the effect that

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.600 
have to layer it to get the effect that
I<00:03:18.150> wanted<00:03:18.660> so<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.530> palette<00:03:19.950> for<00:03:20.040> 15<00:03:20.400> bucks

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
yeah it's worth it i think it's a good

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.600 
yeah it's worth it i think it's a good
way<00:03:22.200> to<00:03:22.260> get<00:03:22.440> into<00:03:22.590> neutral<00:03:23.040> without<00:03:23.280> spending

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
way to get into neutral without spending

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.720 
way to get into neutral without spending
fifty<00:03:24.150> or<00:03:24.270> sixty<00:03:24.420> dollars<00:03:24.960> on<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.110> pallet<00:03:25.730> what

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
fifty or sixty dollars on a pallet what

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.390 
fifty or sixty dollars on a pallet what
i<00:03:26.760> recommend<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.740> not<00:03:28.740> really<00:03:29.100> because<00:03:29.220> i

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
i recommend it not really because i

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.670 
i recommend it not really because i
think<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.820> mats<00:03:30.060> are<00:03:30.420> very<00:03:30.810> lacking<00:03:31.320> but<00:03:31.500> if
