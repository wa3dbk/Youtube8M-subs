what's<00:01:17.960> been<00:01:18.260> interesting<00:01:18.290> out<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:19.040> all<00:01:19.100> this

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
what's been interesting out of all this

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.770 
what's been interesting out of all this
I<00:01:19.490> suppose<00:01:19.640> is<00:01:19.760> the<00:01:20.060> question<00:01:20.480> of<00:01:20.600> democracy

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
I suppose is the question of democracy

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.290 
I suppose is the question of democracy
that's<00:01:21.380> been<00:01:21.590> opened<00:01:21.920> up<00:01:22.010> very<00:01:22.610> starkly<00:01:22.910> in

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
Europe though that you have a government

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.500 
Europe though that you have a government
of<00:01:24.890> bankers<00:01:25.250> essentially<00:01:25.820> imposed<00:01:26.150> on<00:01:26.360> you

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
of bankers essentially imposed on you

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.690

bankers who more or less got us into
this<00:01:28.790> mess<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.330> then<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.870> say<00:01:30.020> okay<00:01:30.260> bankers

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
this mess and then you say okay bankers

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.750 
this mess and then you say okay bankers
are<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.860> people<00:01:31.100> who<00:01:31.160> therefore<00:01:31.460> gonna<00:01:31.610> get

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
serious question democracy that's opened

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.000 
serious question democracy that's opened
up<00:01:36.650> here<00:01:36.860> by<00:01:37.760> the<00:01:37.820> way<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.090> banking<00:01:38.479> crisis

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
up here by the way the banking crisis

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.270 
up here by the way the banking crisis
drove<00:01:40.010> more<00:01:40.640> than<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.970> hundred<00:01:41.660> million<00:01:42.530> people

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
drove more than a hundred million people

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.380 
drove more than a hundred million people
back<00:01:43.490> into<00:01:43.760> poverty<00:01:45.580> the<00:01:46.580> mortality

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
back into poverty the mortality

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.830 
back into poverty the mortality
statistics<00:01:48.320> of<00:01:48.500> people<00:01:48.830> who<00:01:48.979> go<00:01:49.220> into<00:01:49.460> poverty

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
statistics of people who go into poverty

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.820 
statistics of people who go into poverty
rise<00:01:50.840> hugely<00:01:51.910> for<00:01:52.910> a<00:01:52.970> whole<00:01:53.149> range<00:01:53.180> of<00:01:53.570> reasons

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
rise hugely for a whole range of reasons

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.469 
rise hugely for a whole range of reasons
so<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.100> banking<00:01:55.399> crisis<00:01:55.910> isn't<00:01:56.090> just<00:01:56.360> about

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
so the banking crisis isn't just about

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.359 
so the banking crisis isn't just about
becoming<00:01:56.869> poorer<00:01:57.259> it<00:01:57.590> was<00:01:57.710> about<00:01:57.920> killing

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
becoming poorer it was about killing

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.280 
becoming poorer it was about killing
people<00:01:58.399> as<00:01:58.850> well<00:01:59.060> time<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.600> time<00:01:59.780> again<00:01:59.869> over

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
people as well time and time again over

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.980 
people as well time and time again over
the<00:02:00.380> last<00:02:00.530> thirty<00:02:00.740> years<00:02:00.860> we've<00:02:01.190> seen<00:02:01.990> private

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
the last thirty years we've seen private

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.889 
the last thirty years we've seen private
debts<00:02:03.200> being<00:02:03.470> transformed<00:02:04.310> into<00:02:04.610> into<00:02:05.539> public

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
debts being transformed into into public
