 Today is food 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.180
 Or what 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:18.630
 Yes, it is the meat I bought here at Costco 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:22.079
 Whether the good guy in of about two kilometers bar but I know Mai Ukibuchi entering the 12's before in loin 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:28.710
 It's a bit hard to eat as an 8-year steak 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:31.660
 So today is the case that this hard post softens this meat 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.000
 8 The way is very simple 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.750
 First of all because I just meat this 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.750

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.940

 Yes I do to cola ThatLookLikeThis 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.370
 Well, even if it is not cola , I think it would be fine if it was carbonic acid beer 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.159
 It means that it is left for more than 10 minutes by this 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.920
