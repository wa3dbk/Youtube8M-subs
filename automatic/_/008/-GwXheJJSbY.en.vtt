single index model as you recall a

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:22.170 
single index model as you recall a

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.650 
stock on the vertical axis and the

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.170 
stock on the vertical axis and the
return<00:00:23.890> on<00:00:24.099> the<00:00:24.160> market<00:00:24.460> on<00:00:24.579> the<00:00:24.610> horizontal

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
return on the market on the horizontal

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.839 
return on the market on the horizontal
axis<00:00:25.300> we<00:00:26.050> have<00:00:26.079> the<00:00:26.230> stock<00:00:26.590> levels<00:00:27.310> in<00:00:27.519> column

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
axis we have the stock levels in column

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.359 
axis we have the stock levels in column
C<00:00:27.929> and<00:00:28.929> we<00:00:29.109> have<00:00:29.259> the<00:00:29.470> market<00:00:29.859> levels<00:00:30.189> in

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
C and we have the market levels in

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.950 
C and we have the market levels in
column<00:00:30.730> B<00:00:30.759> so<00:00:31.150> first<00:00:31.420> of<00:00:31.539> all<00:00:31.570> we<00:00:31.630> need<00:00:31.839> to

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
column B so first of all we need to

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.439 
column B so first of all we need to
generate<00:00:32.199> the<00:00:32.650> percentage<00:00:33.100> returns<00:00:33.489> so<00:00:34.390> we

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
generate the percentage returns so we

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:35.939 
generate the percentage returns so we
press<00:00:34.660> equals<00:00:34.870> it<00:00:35.170> tells<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:35.470> formula<00:00:35.830> a

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
press equals it tells the formula a

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:37.700 
press equals it tells the formula a
hundred<00:00:36.339> convert<00:00:36.730> into<00:00:36.940> percentages<00:00:37.360> and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
hundred convert into percentages and

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.759 
hundred convert into percentages and
then<00:00:38.710> for<00:00:38.920> the<00:00:39.010> index<00:00:39.430> what<00:00:40.120> it<00:00:40.269> is-<00:00:41.019> what<00:00:41.650> it

00:00:41.759 --> 00:00:41.769 
then for the index what it is- what it

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:47.039 
then for the index what it is- what it
was<00:00:41.920> /<00:00:42.730> what<00:00:43.299> it<00:00:43.390> was<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:45.330> it's<00:00:46.330> two<00:00:46.659> decimal

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.049 
was / what it was and it's two decimal

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.829 
was / what it was and it's two decimal
places<00:00:47.080> which<00:00:47.530> is<00:00:47.710> fine<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:49.360> drag<00:00:49.570> it<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.720> the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
places which is fine we drag it to the

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.100 
places which is fine we drag it to the
right<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.379> get<00:00:50.530> the<00:00:50.830> stock<00:00:51.070> data<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.600> then

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
right to get the stock data and then

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.590 
right to get the stock data and then
whichever<00:00:53.949> way<00:00:54.190> you're<00:00:54.339> familiar<00:00:54.489> with<00:00:54.760> copy

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
whichever way you're familiar with copy

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.200 
whichever way you're familiar with copy
and<00:00:55.780> paste<00:00:55.960> it<00:00:56.140> down<00:00:56.729> so<00:00:57.729> now<00:00:57.820> we've<00:00:57.970> got<00:00:58.119> the

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
and paste it down so now we've got the

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.189 
and paste it down so now we've got the
weekly<00:00:58.479> returns<00:00:58.839> on<00:00:59.080> in<00:00:59.799> column<00:01:00.250> D<00:01:00.869> the<00:01:01.869> market

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
weekly returns on in column D the market

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.609 
weekly returns on in column D the market
index<00:01:02.500> and<00:01:02.949> then<00:01:03.070> column<00:01:03.400> e<00:01:03.570> p<00:01:04.570> NV<00:01:05.049> NV<00:01:05.199> perry

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
index and then column e p NV NV perry

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.890 
index and then column e p NV NV perry
barr<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.880> now<00:01:06.970> we<00:01:07.030> want<00:01:07.240> to<00:01:07.330> draw<00:01:07.450> this<00:01:07.600> the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
barr so now we want to draw this the

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.630 
barr so now we want to draw this the
scatter<00:01:08.170> diagram<00:01:08.619> so<00:01:08.770> I<00:01:08.799> just<00:01:09.009> use<00:01:09.130> my<00:01:09.159> cursor

the market returns in column a we have
the<00:01:31.720> stock<00:01:31.960> return<00:01:32.290> so<00:01:32.440> if<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:32.590> clicks<00:01:32.830> the

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
the stock return so if I clicks the

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.800 
the stock return so if I clicks the
series<00:01:33.520> tab<00:01:33.730> here<00:01:33.880> after<00:01:34.180> just<00:01:34.390> make<00:01:34.600> sure

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
series tab here after just make sure

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.010 
series tab here after just make sure
that<00:01:35.020> we're<00:01:35.170> in<00:01:35.230> the<00:01:35.440> right<00:01:35.980> order<00:01:36.510> so<00:01:37.510> on<00:01:37.750> the

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
that we're in the right order so on the

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.800 
that we're in the right order so on the
y-axis<00:01:38.260> it's<00:01:38.860> got<00:01:39.100> column<00:01:39.490> E<00:01:39.610> which<00:01:40.210> is<00:01:40.450> the

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
y-axis it's got column E which is the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.940 
y-axis it's got column E which is the
stock<00:01:41.080> returns<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.710> in<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.850> X<00:01:43.000> and<00:01:43.920> access<00:01:44.920> it

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
stock returns and in the X and access it

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.950 
stock returns and in the X and access it
has<00:01:45.250> column<00:01:45.610> D<00:01:45.790> which<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.360> market<00:01:46.690> returns

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
has column D which is the market returns

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.860 
has column D which is the market returns
so<00:01:47.229> that's<00:01:47.409> fine<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:48.580> reason<00:01:48.880> we've<00:01:49.720> been

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
so that's fine the reason we've been

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.180 
so that's fine the reason we've been
fortunate<00:01:50.170> here<00:01:50.560> and<00:01:50.650> it's<00:01:50.770> because<00:01:51.010> we've

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
fortunate here and it's because we've

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.490 
fortunate here and it's because we've
got<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.970> order<00:01:52.360> is<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.510> index<00:01:52.990> verse<00:01:53.260> which

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
got the order is the index verse which

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.440 
got the order is the index verse which
you<00:01:53.590> put<00:01:53.770> in<00:01:53.920> the<00:01:54.010> x<00:01:54.159> axis<00:01:54.549> then<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.240> stock

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
you put in the x axis then the stock

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.180 
you put in the x axis then the stock
they<00:01:55.600> had<00:01:55.690> a<00:01:55.750> second<00:01:56.110> which<00:01:56.260> it<00:01:56.409> puts<00:01:56.590> on<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:57.010> y

in fact just to be precise weekly return

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.830 
in fact just to be precise weekly return
I<00:02:38.630> click<00:02:39.630> Next<00:02:40.849> there's<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.910> new<00:02:42.120> sheet<00:02:42.329> and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
I click Next there's a new sheet and

I click Next there's a new sheet and
click<00:02:43.079> finish<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.680> don't<00:02:44.340> need<00:02:44.519> this<00:02:44.700> legend

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
click finish I don't need this legend

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.600 
click finish I don't need this legend
because<00:02:45.840> there's<00:02:45.989> only<00:02:46.110> one<00:02:46.319> series<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.890> right

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
because there's only one series I right

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.220 
because there's only one series I right
click<00:02:47.640> on<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.150> format<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.569> plot<00:02:48.780> area<00:02:48.930> I

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
click on the format the plot area I

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.949 
click on the format the plot area I
don't<00:02:49.560> want<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.769> gray<00:02:49.980> area<00:02:50.160> like<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:50.819> so<00:02:51.720> here

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
don't want a gray area like that so here

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.990 
don't want a gray area like that so here
we've<00:02:52.079> got<00:02:52.110> there's<00:02:52.829> our<00:02:53.010> scatter<00:02:53.340> diagram<00:02:53.819> as

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
we've got there's our scatter diagram as

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.449 
we've got there's our scatter diagram as
you<00:02:54.269> can<00:02:54.420> see<00:02:54.660> if<00:02:55.590> we<00:02:55.799> split<00:02:55.980> into<00:02:56.250> four

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
you can see if we split into four

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.890 
you can see if we split into four
quadrants<00:02:56.670> we've<00:02:57.239> got<00:02:57.329> the<00:02:57.420> northeast

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
quadrants we've got the northeast

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.199 
quadrants we've got the northeast
quadrant<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:59.099> southwest<00:02:59.579> quadrant<00:02:59.730> that

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
quadrant and the southwest quadrant that

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.289 
quadrant and the southwest quadrant that
is<00:03:00.329> where<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:01.260> large<00:03:01.980> majority<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.579> our<00:03:02.700> dots

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
is where the large majority of our dots

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.140 
is where the large majority of our dots
lie<00:03:04.079> we<00:03:04.590> have<00:03:04.709> got<00:03:04.829> some<00:03:05.010> outliers<00:03:05.400> here<00:03:05.790> in

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
lie we have got some outliers here in

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.880 
lie we have got some outliers here in
the<00:03:06.269> southeast<00:03:06.690> quadrant<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.260> severe<00:03:07.739> in<00:03:07.860> the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
the southeast quadrant and severe in the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.449 
the southeast quadrant and severe in the
northwest<00:03:08.430> quadrant<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:09.540> that's<00:03:10.250> part<00:03:11.250> be

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
northwest quadrant so that's part be

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.700 
northwest quadrant so that's part be
done
