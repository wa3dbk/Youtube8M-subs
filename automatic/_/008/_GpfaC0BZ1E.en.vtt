00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.970
 a very small smile on the face 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.980
 from trainer phillip cocu 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.320
 but the must handle a setback 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.429
 three lost one 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.099
 pec zwolle 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.410
 and so today there was a water for the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.029
 hangover and if you have a hangover then you must 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.980
 you that can flush to red then 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.750
 to be able to continue well one knows here 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.359
 The defeat is also a good mental one 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.420
 tests for pc that despite the loss still 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.570
 becoming a leader there was today 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.910
 trained with 14 internationals 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.460
 were absent due to the busy schedule 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.040
 the staff decided in recent days 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.930
 so those players rest for this day too 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.910
 such as georginio 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.700
 Wijnaldum is not there at Patrick I am not 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.079
 and was therefore absent 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.840
 but of course there was also attention for it 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.309
 the absence of memphis detail he 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.510
 fell in the match against pec zwolle 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.680
 out with an injury 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.680
 after this promotion 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.850
 has an MRI scan today 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.530
 revealed what is wrong with humans 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.000
 hand and what we found thereby 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.140
 is that there is one 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.600
 muscle tear 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.790
 actually in the in the groin region what 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.380
 says that for his recovery well we have 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.140
 of course with our specialists 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.780
 looked at that additional research and 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.360
 our expectation is that he is six to eight 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:25.159
 weeks will be disabled with this 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:27.649
 injury to the rule is that term 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.439
 my only practice is for that 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.720
 it so that every player reacts differently 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.300
 on the tires that you offer and 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.800
 has a different style and the coming 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.210
 weeks will show how 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.080
 recovered with him exactly comes out to 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.360
 see 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.740
 and whatever is important 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.350
 that memphis of course very expressive 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.580
 player is whatever can have consequences 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.610
 for the moment you have it again 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.810
 works late he will separate from the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.960
 train group 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.550
 He will certainly be the first few weeks he will 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.560
 individually with one of ours 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.030
 physical therapist getting started 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.040
 and from there it will pass here and then 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.080
 inflow into the group 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.520
 Man is therefore not on the training he was 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.770
 she does the only one 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.270
 goal scorer from last Saturday 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.070
 to score the goal 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.050
 that's not the reason cocu also thinks 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.180
 it will mainly position it 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.820
 possession and the defensive work of the 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.440
 must be a team that must improve and 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.920
 so training became continuous 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.600
 changed his jacket 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.459
 the button must be on the visor must be on 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.240
 a tough program for next week 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.700
 psv 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.370
 Thursday against Estoril-Praia and Sunday 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.920
 against sc Cambuur and here in Eindhoven 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.660
 they have done their homework well and 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.170
 streel praia is 12 in the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.370
 competition from portugal and with 9 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.959
 goals from 4 matches 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.810
 the weak spot 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.850
 in defense and so it was finished 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.410
 on do here for example joshua brenet 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.820
 outside your foot 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.100
 a smile on the face and of course 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:55.040
 equally yes to the 10 degree remko pass spring 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.690
 passed and we always see him 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.580
 more often on the training field and stijn 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.380
 scarce cannot yet fully participate 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.000
 with the group and trained today 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.890
 weird 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.959
 it is awaiting or message is over 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.360
 definitive recovery and until then 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.680
 as scarce should look at how they 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.720
 finish on purpose 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.720
 scoring and handing out signatures
