00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.120
 mac mini 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.950
 this is the most affordable computer family 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.260
 window one should not consider it somehow 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.560
 outcast or loser with you Ilya 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.000
 Cossacks and we look at mac mini end 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.220
 2012, which we, as always 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.810
 provided our good friends with 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.060
 store computer plaza 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.340
 from the fact that the computer is so small 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.309
 almost 20 centimeters on each side 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.840
 with a height of 3.6 centimeters sometimes 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.180
 it seems that this 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.579
 the box will not be able to withstand huge 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.190
 system blocks that gather dust 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.920
 the tables of many like not so filling 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.870
 this kozyavki inspires respect for us 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.730
 got an instance with intel core processor 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.629
 i7 with a frequency of 2 point three 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.399
 gigahertz four gigabytes of memory 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:56.280
 terabyte hard drive and built-in 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.679
 intel hd 4000 giga graphics and a half 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.499
 memory on board there is a complete set 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.129
 easier on kurae 5 and half herbs byte 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.839
 of memory 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.500
 in both cases in computers 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.730
 Intel hd 4000 video chip used 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.890
 mac mini weighs a little more than a kilo 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.899
 what's for the desktop computer 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.060
 very very little front of the computer by 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.320
 apple minimalist here only 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.170
 light indicator 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.149
 and an infrared receiver on 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.880
 the back of the various 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.280
 connectors and interfaces and port and button 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.560
 power on gigabit connector 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.200
 ethernet port firewire 800 connector 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.289
 of course edge dima and thunderbolt ports 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.500
 also there is no yusbi 3 too 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.049
 as well, and the connector for sd cards, too 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.340
 stayed in place underneath the audio input 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.439
 audio output 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.659
 and here is the optical drive in the new magician 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.670
 the menu is no longer apple refuses 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.039
 bulky drives in all their 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.200
 new computers however no one bothers 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.130
 connect an external drive to mac mini and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.710
 to use him 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.250
 the drive is seen without any problems we 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.250
 checked 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.229
 bottom is black plastic 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.390
 stub turning which we get 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.940
 access to the internal components of poppy seeds 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.920
 precisely RAM which can 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.260
 easy to replace with a couple of more capacious 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.910
 no dice at home 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.160
 special skills from you not 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.920
 will need here is the antenna 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.230
 Wi-Fi mini by the way supports networks 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.400
 n ranges and bluetooth protocol 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.480
 updated to the fourth version 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.000
 mac mini performance is perfect 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.099
 can not be correlated with his miniature 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.470
 casing in our geekbench tests 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.670
 the subject gave the result in more than 11 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.150
 thousand points 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.250
 ahead of aimag 2012 and a little bit 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.209
 reached for a powerful macbook pro with 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.069
 retina display 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.410
 however the computer behaves very 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.450
 confident and not in synthetic tests 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.430
 despite the frankly weak video 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.099
 solution that is used in mac mini 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.110
 star craft 2 in full hd resolution 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.510
 medium graphics settings he flipped over 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.060
 quite cheerfully and draw on the screen 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.739
 a swarm of zerg without problems 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.600
 average fps did not fall below 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.480
 marks at 30 frames per second 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.560
 even in the most intense scenes and in 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.810
 general with the usual everyday 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.709
 using mac mini showed itself 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.319
 Well done 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.930
 demonstrating always smooth animation and in 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:22.090
 Overall sufficient performance you 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.609
 surprised but it even has a built-in 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.709
 speaker can not say that the sound mac mini 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.260
 you will be impressed with its purity and volume 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.030
 but the fact of his presence is me honest 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.980
 the word surprised however anyway 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.120
 I recommend to think about connecting 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.010
 external acoustics 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.810
 as the quality of the built-in speaker 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.030
 you are unlikely to be satisfied 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.670
 as for connecting peripheral 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.650
 devices I managed to test mac 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.930
 mini with external full hd monitor 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.590
 connecting it directly through hdmi 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.389
 the wire 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.000
 also included 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.040
 dvi-hdmi adapter with which 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.180
 you can connect any modern 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.579
 monitor to mac mini 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.590
 let's get close to conclusions 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.690
 why mac mac is needed is it worth it 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.120
 if it is worth buying in which case 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.190
 and generally what kind of beast is this mac mini 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.959
 will be a great good shopping at 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.540
 if you want to buy yourself 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:12.250
 powerful and inexpensive desktop magician 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.420
 on which you are going not only 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.760
 watch movies and yourself 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.250
 VKontakte well and edit photos 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.230
 to edit videos and generally keep 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.330
 active with his 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.410
 computer performance baby 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.820
 quite enough 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.040
 it is not necessary to buy 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.430
 quite expensive mouse and keyboard from 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.980
 apple 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.200
 it is possible to use those that you 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.480
 have become accustomed of course if they yusbi 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.860
 compatible and of course the price too 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.110
 will play an important role in choosing 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.720
 computer today mac mini 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.850
 this is the most affordable magician on the market 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.380
 Unfortunately, the computer can not boast 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.900
 discrete video solution that 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.960
 definitely upset gamers who 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.210
 Intel hd 4000 capabilities will obviously 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.520
 not enough but overall mac mini 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.770
 damn good he's very small 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.210
 easy quiet and incredibly stylish 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.130
 aluminum case will decorate 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.190
 any desktop 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.900
 this is peculiar to any apple technique 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.600
 this is all with you on mac mini end 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.380

 subscribe to our channel put 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.460
 thumbs up and be sure to share 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.290
 your opinion on the computer in
