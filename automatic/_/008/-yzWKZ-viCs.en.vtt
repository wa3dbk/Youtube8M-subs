00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:06.299
 another device in assessing the village 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.540
 family liquid crystal thermometer 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:16.080
 joint development with English 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:19.529
 companies yew is special 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:27.230
 graduated beekeeping range 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:30.929
 Thermometer with sticky surface 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.070
 composition possessing strong enough 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.239
 adhesion and which allows us to evaluate 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.340
 temperature clock you can see that 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.910
 my temperature which measures 32 33 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.620
 degrees now a little more if 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.719
 wait will be 34 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.850
 I hope to find it normal 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.449
 glass temperature please become with 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.039
 that side 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:01:03.199
 and this sticky tape 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:01:07.080
 easy to hook on the hive give here 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.360
 let's say attacked burn flag fasten 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.290
 adhesive tape closure 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.670
 and after a while check 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:22.170
 as far as 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:24.240
 the temperature will rise joint 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:29.790
 development of the German company Pelican 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.310
 and mine for determining family strength for 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.479
 determine whether I divide 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:40.869
 and general state of work is very difficult 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.079
 at first glance as lidka 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.490
 see how much 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.100
 heavy comes bees how much they 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.119
 carry pollen 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.490
 strong family much good bribes 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.020
 but however there is the possibility of using 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.579
 simple adaptations on that 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:03.119
 the simplest device to assess the strength 

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.509
 families 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.869
 this 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.860
 the leaf is very similar to usually 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.310
 copy paper 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.580
 the truth differs from her in its composition 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.760
 in order that lungs bees could astana 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.459
 leave a mark on her paper 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.690
 here from the firm pelican 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:30.780
 in a regular paper bag and put on 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:36.670
 cast yes why run over this 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:40.090
 fixture paper leaves inside 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.359
 envelope black color comparing these traces 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.310
 can be defined as intense flew 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.590
 on the family how heavy were the bees 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:52.000
 which family is better which one 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:56.500
 needs for example feeding now we 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.190
 can see for example from this family trace 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.790
 and now I 'll show you 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:08.920
 made before that the trace of another family is 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:13.120
 here you can see examples here 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.170
 that the upper part of the upper family is much 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:19.630
 better much more developed and if 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.350
 the question is the separation of families 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.350
 naturally 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.939
 already needs separation or 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:35.420
 and this family needs feeding such 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:38.069
 with literally 2 leaflets 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:43.579
 papers of one of them specialized 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.579
 possible to evaluate the possibilities of development 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:49.159
 another one to jointly develop 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:52.859
 English company shooting gallery max 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:55.310
 this control is temperature exceeding at 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:59.879
 transportation accounted 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.510
 packages of bees are known to be very 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.209
 scary 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.189
 steaming of bees during transportation however 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.409
 when forwarding a package when receiving it 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:09.299
 very hard to check 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:11.730
 was there a steaming on the road because 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.010
 at the beginning at the end and the temperature may 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.979
 be normal for that exist 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.620
 special such tags are customized 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.380
 at a certain temperature given 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:27.949
 case of a temperature of 34 degrees which 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:29.599
 put on the package for transportation 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.030
 standard 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:35.460
 the standard color for this label is white however 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.610
 if the temperature is exceeded 34 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:44.099
 degrees label will turn black 0 is not 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:46.320
 Sure and now and will not return to white 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:49.680
 color to its original color so 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.159
 When you receive a package, you can 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:55.680
 see immediately whether the road was somewhere 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.699
 temperature exceeded critical for 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:00.510
 bee families 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:02.449
 and have the temperature been exceeded then you 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.170
 can not immediately open the package 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.720
 present 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:11.050
 who sent your complaint thanks 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.750
 well, the last one is just for fan for a joke 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:19.360
 2 now cute forks for os because u 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:20.850
 you are often robbed in the fall by the hive and in the summer 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.260
 it happens 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.720
 the simplest caught to this bottle of sugar 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.760
 sugar syrup is poured 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.160
 one to one ratio is put on 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.960
 the sun and literally a few hours 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:41.190
 starts working even days typing here 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:47.710
 wasps and some 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:48.640
 works on the principle that the wasp 

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.670
 flooded 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:53.590
 the bottle can't get back like 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.680
 you know the bee can walk 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.900
 surface vertical wasp 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.770
 make love so get out 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:07.260
 bottles she can not as well as 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.260
 fellow people coming down the neck and 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:15.130
 2 simplest catches for wasps too 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:18.990
 ordinary glass jar which 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:22.390
 poured beer bottom ever 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.460
 acquires a characteristic two-day 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:29.910
 the smell she starts to collect here 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:29.910
 the boss can also make sure and see
