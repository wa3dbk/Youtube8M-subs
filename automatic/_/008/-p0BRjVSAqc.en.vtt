00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
scrunch it and because I find that the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.750 
scrunch it and because I find that the

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
it so I just do it from far away so it's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.910 
it so I just do it from far away so it's
and<00:03:33.630> this<00:03:33.870> doesn't<00:03:34.230> make<00:03:34.350> your<00:03:34.470> hair<00:03:34.680> crunchy

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920
