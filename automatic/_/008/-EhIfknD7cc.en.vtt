intense one so I'm actually gonna go

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.759 
intense one so I'm actually gonna go
through<00:00:17.890> and<00:00:18.550> kind<00:00:19.509> of<00:00:19.660> go<00:00:19.960> over<00:00:20.320> what<00:00:20.349> you

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:20.769 
through and kind of go over what you

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.290 
through and kind of go over what you
kind<00:00:21.009> of<00:00:21.070> need<00:00:21.189> to<00:00:21.220> do<00:00:21.369> I<00:00:21.400> know<00:00:21.519> it's<00:00:21.789> a<00:00:22.029> bit

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
kind of need to do I know it's a bit

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.929 
kind of need to do I know it's a bit
irrelevant<00:00:22.810> it's<00:00:23.019> only<00:00:23.140> a<00:00:23.230> daily<00:00:23.679> but<00:00:24.009> it<00:00:24.519> will

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
irrelevant it's only a daily but it will

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.759 
irrelevant it's only a daily but it will
probably<00:00:25.150> transfer<00:00:25.539> on<00:00:25.929> to<00:00:26.050> other<00:00:26.289> ones<00:00:26.470> as

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
probably transfer on to other ones as

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:27.749 
probably transfer on to other ones as
well

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
well

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.329 
well
so<00:00:28.029> this<00:00:28.179> one<00:00:28.359> is<00:00:28.619> land<00:00:29.619> of<00:00:29.769> the<00:00:29.859> livid<00:00:30.130> dead

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.339 
so this one is land of the livid dead

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:31.919 
so this one is land of the livid dead
again<00:00:30.609> and<00:00:30.820> but<00:00:31.390> this<00:00:31.449> time<00:00:31.630> you<00:00:31.720> have<00:00:31.839> to

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929 
again and but this time you have to

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.670 
again and but this time you have to
collect<00:00:32.050> 150<00:00:32.770> Long's<00:00:32.980> as<00:00:33.579> fast<00:00:33.850> as<00:00:33.970> possible

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
collect 150 Long's as fast as possible

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.550 
collect 150 Long's as fast as possible
okay<00:00:35.680> so<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:37.210> first<00:00:37.360> thing<00:00:37.600> I<00:00:37.720> did<00:00:37.840> because<00:00:38.440> I

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:38.560 
okay so the first thing I did because I

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.400 
okay so the first thing I did because I
play<00:00:38.830> using<00:00:39.280> my<00:00:39.370> ps3<00:00:39.610> pad<00:00:40.110> connects<00:00:41.110> me<00:00:41.200> up<00:00:41.320> to

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
play using my ps3 pad connects me up to

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.030 
play using my ps3 pad connects me up to
my<00:00:41.500> PC<00:00:41.880> I'm<00:00:42.880> changing<00:00:43.390> it<00:00:43.480> from<00:00:43.710> analog<00:00:44.710> stick

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
my PC I'm changing it from analog stick

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.790 
my PC I'm changing it from analog stick
to<00:00:45.400> d-pad<00:00:46.000> I<00:00:46.030> found<00:00:46.330> the<00:00:46.420> analog<00:00:46.720> stick<00:00:47.050> always

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
to d-pad I found the analog stick always

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.350 
to d-pad I found the analog stick always
slips<00:00:48.160> in<00:00:48.310> my<00:00:48.400> finger<00:00:48.760> because<00:00:48.970> there's<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:49.210> lot

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
slips in my finger because there's a lot

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.190 
slips in my finger because there's a lot
of<00:00:49.480> ducking<00:00:49.930> and<00:00:51.330> jumping<00:00:52.330> and<00:00:52.540> loads<00:00:53.050> of

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:53.200 
of ducking and jumping and loads of

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.530 
of ducking and jumping and loads of
stuff<00:00:53.440> that<00:00:54.220> requires<00:00:54.430> me<00:00:54.790> to<00:00:54.850> keep<00:00:55.060> moving<00:00:55.240> it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
stuff that requires me to keep moving it

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.480 
stuff that requires me to keep moving it
a<00:00:55.600> lot<00:00:55.840> and<00:00:56.320> he<00:00:56.440> started<00:00:56.740> to<00:00:56.860> slip<00:00:57.070> which<00:00:57.310> made

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
a lot and he started to slip which made

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.350 
a lot and he started to slip which made
it<00:00:57.610> very<00:00:57.640> computer<00:00:58.180> play<00:00:58.860> okay<00:00:59.860> so<00:01:00.150> this<00:01:01.150> is

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
it very computer play okay so this is

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.590 
it very computer play okay so this is
kind<00:01:01.690> of<00:01:01.980> what<00:01:02.980> it<00:01:03.100> would<00:01:03.160> look<00:01:03.250> like<00:01:03.390> now<00:01:04.390> this

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
kind of what it would look like now this

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.179 
kind of what it would look like now this
is<00:01:04.720> not<00:01:04.869> going<00:01:04.960> to<00:01:05.019> be<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.199> best<00:01:05.439> sort<00:01:05.950> of<00:01:06.039> one

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
is not going to be the best sort of one

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.870 
is not going to be the best sort of one
but<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:06.640> general<00:01:07.030> gist<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:09.310> level<00:01:09.670> and

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
but the general gist of the level and

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.520 
but the general gist of the level and
where<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.149> need<00:01:10.270> to<00:01:10.390> get<00:01:10.509> to<00:01:10.719> and<00:01:11.020> some<00:01:11.380> of<00:01:11.469> the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
where you need to get to and some of the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.660 
where you need to get to and some of the
techniques<00:01:11.859> you<00:01:11.950> need<00:01:12.070> to<00:01:12.189> do<00:01:12.310> right<00:01:12.909> here

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
techniques you need to do right here

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.870 
techniques you need to do right here
okay<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:17.020> we're<00:01:17.469> nearly<00:01:17.710> coming<00:01:18.009> up<00:01:18.069> to<00:01:18.310> all

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
okay so we're nearly coming up to all

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.190 
okay so we're nearly coming up to all
the<00:01:19.030> lumps<00:01:19.210> when<00:01:19.539> you<00:01:19.630> got<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.869> this<00:01:19.960> section

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
the lumps when you got to this section

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.010 
the lumps when you got to this section
is<00:01:20.409> pretty<00:01:20.530> easy<00:01:20.979> after<00:01:21.310> that<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:22.390> hardest

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
is pretty easy after that the hardest

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.599 
is pretty easy after that the hardest
thing<00:01:23.170> is<00:01:23.289> the<00:01:23.439> beginning<00:01:23.829> now<00:01:24.100> these<00:01:24.310> last

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:24.609 
thing is the beginning now these last

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:25.380 
thing is the beginning now these last
five<00:01:24.909> lumps

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
five lumps

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.270 
five lumps
you<00:01:25.569> shouldn't<00:01:25.990> continue<00:01:26.920> after<00:01:27.249> that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
you shouldn't continue after that

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.679 
you shouldn't continue after that
otherwise<00:01:27.700> you're<00:01:28.060> probably<00:01:28.210> not<00:01:28.390> gonna<00:01:28.509> beat

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
otherwise you're probably not gonna beat

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.889 
otherwise you're probably not gonna beat
the<00:01:28.810> time<00:01:29.049> so<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.770> need<00:01:29.950> at<00:01:30.100> least<00:01:30.130> 27<00:01:31.119> nearly

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
the time so you need at least 27 nearly

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.399 
the time so you need at least 27 nearly
28<00:01:32.289> or<00:01:32.409> something<00:01:32.710> to<00:01:32.859> get<00:01:32.979> diamonds<00:01:33.759> it<00:01:33.880> seems

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
28 or something to get diamonds it seems

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.239 
28 or something to get diamonds it seems
okay<00:01:35.409> so<00:01:35.469> mr.<00:01:35.679> FOP<00:01:36.039> is

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:36.249 
okay so mr. FOP is

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.760 
okay so mr. FOP is
he's<00:01:36.729> always<00:01:36.969> got<00:01:37.509> diamond<00:01:38.109> on<00:01:38.229> everything<00:01:38.649> as

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
he's always got diamond on everything as

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.010 
he's always got diamond on everything as
soon<00:01:39.009> as<00:01:39.130> I<00:01:39.249> look<00:01:39.850> he's<00:01:40.149> already<00:01:40.420> got<00:01:40.659> diamond

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
soon as I look he's already got diamond

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.899 
soon as I look he's already got diamond
which<00:01:41.139> is<00:01:41.259> really<00:01:41.499> annoying<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:41.859> he<00:01:42.579> was<00:01:42.729> like

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
which is really annoying and he was like

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.910 
which is really annoying and he was like
the<00:01:43.060> ghost<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.450> was<00:01:43.630> training<00:01:44.139> a<00:01:44.289> lot<00:01:44.679> in<00:01:44.829> this

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
the ghost I was training a lot in this

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.230 
the ghost I was training a lot in this
one<00:01:45.130> I've<00:01:45.280> turned<00:01:45.490> ghost<00:01:45.700> off<00:01:45.909> because

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
one I've turned ghost off because

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.310 
one I've turned ghost off because
they're<00:01:46.389> very<00:01:46.530> distracting<00:01:48.509> but

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
they're very distracting but

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.310 
they're very distracting but
he<00:01:50.920> was<00:01:51.159> definitely<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:52.570> guy<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:52.780> was<00:01:52.990> training

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
he was definitely the guy I was training

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.810 
he was definitely the guy I was training
all<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.740> time<00:01:53.770> it's<00:01:54.250> very<00:01:54.400> difficult

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
all the time it's very difficult

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.630 
all the time it's very difficult
there'll<00:01:55.450> be<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.540> lot<00:01:55.750> of<00:01:56.159> difficult<00:01:57.159> things<00:01:57.490> to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
there'll be a lot of difficult things to

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.210 
there'll be a lot of difficult things to
do<00:01:57.909> in<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.570> beginning<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.860> know<00:01:59.950> you've<00:02:00.100> got

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
do in the beginning you know you've got

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.740 
do in the beginning you know you've got
to<00:02:00.310> jump<00:02:00.520> you<00:02:00.640> got<00:02:00.760> a<00:02:00.790> slide<00:02:01.180> you've<00:02:01.510> got<00:02:01.630> to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
to jump you got a slide you've got to

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.570 
to jump you got a slide you've got to
make<00:02:02.140> sure<00:02:02.260> you<00:02:02.380> don't<00:02:02.500> hit<00:02:02.650> anything<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.190> the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
make sure you don't hit anything and the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.460 
make sure you don't hit anything and the
hardest<00:02:03.940> thing<00:02:04.119> is<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.510> middle<00:02:04.840> like<00:02:05.140> there

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
hardest thing is the middle like there

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.710 
hardest thing is the middle like there
for<00:02:05.680> example<00:02:06.040> when<00:02:06.700> I<00:02:06.729> dropped<00:02:07.090> off<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:07.420> chain

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
for example when I dropped off the chain

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.870 
for example when I dropped off the chain
you<00:02:08.050> have<00:02:08.200> to<00:02:08.380> stay<00:02:08.619> on<00:02:08.649> it<00:02:08.800> for<00:02:09.070> a<00:02:09.100> bit<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.700> get

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
you have to stay on it for a bit to get

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.760 
you have to stay on it for a bit to get
a<00:02:09.910> bit<00:02:10.030> of<00:02:10.119> momentum<00:02:10.570> so<00:02:10.780> you're<00:02:11.470> actually

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
a bit of momentum so you're actually

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.980 
a bit of momentum so you're actually
travelling<00:02:12.100> forward<00:02:12.400> when<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:12.700> fly<00:02:13.690> off<00:02:13.810> it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
travelling forward when you fly off it

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.420 
travelling forward when you fly off it
and<00:02:14.170> there's<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.709> couple<00:02:14.950> of<00:02:15.010> niggly<00:02:15.280> bit

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
and there's a couple of niggly bit

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.070 
and there's a couple of niggly bit
season<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.180> kind<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.420> levels<00:02:16.690> which<00:02:16.840> I<00:02:16.959> don't

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
season the kind of levels which I don't

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.070 
season the kind of levels which I don't
really<00:02:17.410> like<00:02:17.740> that<00:02:18.130> much<00:02:18.880> because<00:02:19.180> especially

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
really like that much because especially

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.410 
really like that much because especially
this<00:02:20.200> one<00:02:20.380> I<00:02:20.620> mean<00:02:21.430> I<00:02:21.520> enjoyed<00:02:21.880> it<00:02:22.000> when<00:02:22.120> I<00:02:22.150> did

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
this one I mean I enjoyed it when I did

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.920 
this one I mean I enjoyed it when I did
it<00:02:22.450> but<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.610> prefer<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.790> long<00:02:25.000> get<00:02:25.630> as<00:02:25.720> far<00:02:25.840> as

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
it but I prefer the long get as far as

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.850 
it but I prefer the long get as far as
you<00:02:25.989> can<00:02:26.170> because<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:26.440> can<00:02:26.470> go<00:02:26.650> at<00:02:26.739> your<00:02:26.800> own

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
you can because you can go at your own

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.680 
you can because you can go at your own
speed<00:02:27.040> there's<00:02:27.400> no<00:02:27.489> tips<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:27.970> tricks<00:02:28.180> really

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
speed there's no tips and tricks really

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.780 
speed there's no tips and tricks really
involved<00:02:29.080> it's<00:02:29.230> just<00:02:29.260> skill<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.920> this

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
involved it's just skill and this

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.910 
involved it's just skill and this
obviously<00:02:31.090> has<00:02:31.270> skill<00:02:31.660> but<00:02:32.080> you<00:02:32.440> have<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.739> use

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
obviously has skill but you have to use

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.250 
obviously has skill but you have to use
all<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.340> little<00:02:33.580> tips<00:02:33.850> and<00:02:34.060> tricks<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.660> it

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
all the little tips and tricks and it

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.780 
all the little tips and tricks and it
really<00:02:35.650> comes<00:02:35.860> down<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:37.200> how<00:02:38.200> many<00:02:38.530> can<00:02:39.459> you<00:02:39.489> do

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
really comes down to how many can you do

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.280 
really comes down to how many can you do
how<00:02:40.030> many<00:02:40.090> little<00:02:40.450> tricks<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:40.930> new<00:02:41.080> little

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
how many little tricks and new little

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.020 
how many little tricks and new little
shortcuts<00:02:41.830> and<00:02:42.040> stuff<00:02:42.340> can<00:02:42.519> you<00:02:42.640> make<00:02:42.790> which

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
shortcuts and stuff can you make which

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.009 
shortcuts and stuff can you make which
is<00:02:43.060> fine<00:02:43.420> but<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.680> not<00:02:44.739> what<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.160> prefer<00:02:46.019> okay

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
is fine but it's not what I prefer okay

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.390 
is fine but it's not what I prefer okay
so<00:02:47.080> you<00:02:47.290> need<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.500> hold<00:02:47.620> that<00:02:47.709> slide<00:02:48.070> as<00:02:48.220> long

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
so you need to hold that slide as long

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.850 
so you need to hold that slide as long
as<00:02:48.550> possible<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:50.350> know<00:02:50.440> make<00:02:50.590> sure<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.769> don't

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
as possible you know make sure you don't

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.020 
as possible you know make sure you don't
hit<00:02:51.070> your<00:02:51.190> head<00:02:51.250> you<00:02:51.550> want<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.760> keep<00:02:51.940> your

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
hit your head you want to keep your

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.780 
hit your head you want to keep your
mental<00:02:52.300> off<00:02:52.570> as<00:02:53.320> much<00:02:53.530> as<00:02:53.590> possible<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:54.549> these

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
mental off as much as possible on these

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.970 
mental off as much as possible on these
down<00:02:55.060> slopes<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.630> want<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:55.959> attack<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.860> then

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
down slopes you want to attack and then

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.940 
down slopes you want to attack and then
do<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.269> slide<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.540> get<00:02:58.660> your<00:02:58.840> momentum<00:02:58.989> up<00:02:59.410> you

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
do a slide to get your momentum up you

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.289 
do a slide to get your momentum up you
travel<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.280> lot<00:03:00.310> faster<00:03:00.670> if<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.850> attack<00:03:01.120> and

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
travel a lot faster if you attack and

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.550 
travel a lot faster if you attack and
slide<00:03:02.850> okay<00:03:03.880> and<00:03:04.120> you're<00:03:04.299> inclined<00:03:05.049> you<00:03:05.380> want

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
slide okay and you're inclined you want

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.590 
slide okay and you're inclined you want
to<00:03:05.650> avoid<00:03:06.100> try<00:03:06.489> and<00:03:06.579> jump<00:03:06.760> over<00:03:06.880> them<00:03:07.180> and

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
to avoid try and jump over them and

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.380 
to avoid try and jump over them and
stuff<00:03:07.750> like<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.049> okay<00:03:08.730> so<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:09.940> next<00:03:10.090> clip

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
stuff like that okay so this next clip

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.990 
stuff like that okay so this next clip
is<00:03:10.650> one<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.739> my<00:03:11.860> best<00:03:12.100> times<00:03:12.340> I<00:03:12.519> recorded<00:03:12.940> so

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
is one of my best times I recorded so

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.670 
is one of my best times I recorded so
I'm<00:03:13.060> gonna<00:03:13.180> go<00:03:13.329> over<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.570> techniques<00:03:13.930> which

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
I'm gonna go over the techniques which

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.440 
I'm gonna go over the techniques which
are<00:03:14.890> involved<00:03:15.190> because<00:03:15.670> they<00:03:15.910> will<00:03:16.060> transfer

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
are involved because they will transfer

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.080 
are involved because they will transfer
over<00:03:16.510> to<00:03:16.690> other<00:03:17.250> challenges<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.730> might<00:03:18.880> want

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
over to other challenges you might want

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.990 
over to other challenges you might want
to<00:03:19.209> do<00:03:19.750> okay<00:03:20.560> so<00:03:20.799> the<00:03:21.040> first<00:03:21.160> one<00:03:21.430> is<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.850> most

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
to do okay so the first one is the most

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.340 
to do okay so the first one is the most
obvious<00:03:22.329> one<00:03:22.480> in<00:03:22.570> Felicity<00:03:22.870> in<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.959> lot<00:03:23.140> it's<00:03:23.290> an

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
obvious one in Felicity in a lot it's an

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.050 
obvious one in Felicity in a lot it's an
instant<00:03:23.860> running<00:03:24.310> attack<00:03:24.640> to<00:03:24.820> get<00:03:24.910> your

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
instant running attack to get your

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.780 
instant running attack to get your
momentum<00:03:25.390> up<00:03:25.540> immediately<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:27.489> then<00:03:27.700> when

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
momentum up immediately and then when

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.910 
momentum up immediately and then when
you<00:03:27.880> do<00:03:28.030> a<00:03:28.390> running<00:03:28.989> attack<00:03:29.079> into<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.530> slide

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
you do a running attack into a slide

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.430 
you do a running attack into a slide
that's<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.400> avoid<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:31.510> rock<00:03:31.780> you<00:03:32.049> still<00:03:32.260> hit

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
that's to avoid the rock you still hit

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.039 
that's to avoid the rock you still hit
it<00:03:32.560> but<00:03:32.709> you<00:03:32.769> don't<00:03:32.860> lose<00:03:33.070> as<00:03:33.250> much<00:03:33.489> momentum

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
it but you don't lose as much momentum

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.660 
it but you don't lose as much momentum
okay<00:03:35.049> now<00:03:35.530> when<00:03:35.680> you<00:03:35.769> land<00:03:36.040> out<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.340> this<00:03:36.519> you

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
okay now when you land out of this you

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:37.800 
okay now when you land out of this you
want<00:03:36.820> to<00:03:36.880> do<00:03:36.940> a<00:03:37.000> running<00:03:37.180> attack<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.630> get<00:03:37.750> you

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
want to do a running attack to get you

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.630 
want to do a running attack to get you
momentum<00:03:37.930> back<00:03:38.260> up<00:03:38.410> again<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.769> when<00:03:39.519> you're

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
momentum back up again and when you're

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:40.949 
momentum back up again and when you're
on<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.850> rope<00:03:40.030> stay<00:03:40.360> on<00:03:40.450> there<00:03:40.600> for<00:03:40.630> as<00:03:40.780> long<00:03:40.810> as

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
on the rope stay on there for as long as

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.140 
on the rope stay on there for as long as
possible<00:03:41.230> so<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.160> keep<00:03:42.579> your<00:03:42.640> forward

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
possible so you keep your forward

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:44.610 
possible so you keep your forward
momentum<00:03:43.269> otherwise<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.140> will<00:03:44.290> just<00:03:44.440> drop

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
momentum otherwise you will just drop

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.380 
momentum otherwise you will just drop
vertically<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.400> not<00:03:45.700> vertically<00:03:46.150> and

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
vertically and not vertically and

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.449 
vertically and not vertically and
forward<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.470> when<00:03:47.590> you<00:03:47.680> go<00:03:47.769> up<00:03:47.799> here<00:03:48.040> you<00:03:48.220> want

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
forward so when you go up here you want

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.729 
forward so when you go up here you want
to<00:03:48.549> get<00:03:49.269> your<00:03:49.360> momentum<00:03:49.540> going<00:03:49.959> again<00:03:50.200> by

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
to get your momentum going again by

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.050 
to get your momentum going again by
doing<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.010> running<00:03:51.250> attack<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.700> then<00:03:51.790> go<00:03:51.880> into

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
doing a running attack and then go into

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.970 
doing a running attack and then go into
a<00:03:52.090> slide<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.750> it<00:03:53.260> really<00:03:53.530> increases<00:03:53.709> your

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
a slide and it really increases your

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.080 
a slide and it really increases your
speed<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.459> want<00:03:54.579> to<00:03:54.640> keep<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.910> for<00:03:55.030> as

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
speed and you want to keep it for as

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.600 
speed and you want to keep it for as
long<00:03:55.209> as<00:03:55.360> possible<00:03:55.510> so<00:03:55.920> there<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:56.950> stopped<00:03:57.430> it

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
long as possible so there I stopped it

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.770 
long as possible so there I stopped it
because<00:03:58.000> I<00:03:58.060> was<00:03:58.150> coming<00:03:58.299> up<00:03:58.389> to<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.630> wall

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
because I was coming up to the wall

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.170 
because I was coming up to the wall
where<00:03:58.959> I<00:03:58.989> need<00:03:59.139> to<00:03:59.230> run<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.650> then<00:04:00.400> you<00:04:00.850> can<00:04:01.030> do

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
where I need to run and then you can do

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.520 
where I need to run and then you can do
this<00:04:01.359> make<00:04:01.900> sure<00:04:01.930> you<00:04:02.109> don't<00:04:02.230> hit<00:04:02.350> your<00:04:02.410> head

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
this make sure you don't hit your head

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:03.870 
this make sure you don't hit your head
and<00:04:02.799> stuff<00:04:02.949> like<00:04:03.040> that<00:04:03.190> that's<00:04:03.400> pretty

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
and stuff like that that's pretty

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.620 
and stuff like that that's pretty
clickable<00:04:04.240> for<00:04:04.870> the<00:04:04.960> entire<00:04:05.730> toy<00:04:06.730> thing<00:04:06.970> okay

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
clickable for the entire toy thing okay

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.120 
clickable for the entire toy thing okay
do<00:04:07.750> have<00:04:07.900> running<00:04:08.140> attack<00:04:08.380> at<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.620> end<00:04:08.770> so<00:04:09.100> you

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
do have running attack at the end so you

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.340 
do have running attack at the end so you
can<00:04:09.250> use<00:04:09.580> the<00:04:09.760> slide<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:11.110> running

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
can use the slide and the running

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.560 
can use the slide and the running
attacks<00:04:11.590> momentum<00:04:12.040> on<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.220> slide<00:04:12.460> always<00:04:13.360> try

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
attacks momentum on the slide always try

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.640 
attacks momentum on the slide always try
and<00:04:13.630> keep<00:04:13.720> them<00:04:13.960> for<00:04:14.110> as<00:04:14.170> long<00:04:14.320> as<00:04:14.380> possible

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
and keep them for as long as possible

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.610 
and keep them for as long as possible
these<00:04:15.130> slides<00:04:15.460> on<00:04:15.760> any<00:04:16.330> declines<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.440> there<00:04:17.560> we

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
these slides on any declines so there we

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.710 
these slides on any declines so there we
go<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:17.980> then<00:04:18.850> I<00:04:19.000> split<00:04:19.209> you<00:04:19.390> do<00:04:19.480> a<00:04:19.510> running

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
go and then I split you do a running

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.780 
go and then I split you do a running
slide<00:04:20.110> to<00:04:20.290> get<00:04:20.440> some<00:04:20.590> lumps<00:04:20.860> and<00:04:21.190> then<00:04:21.370> jump

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
slide to get some lumps and then jump

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.820 
slide to get some lumps and then jump
because<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.210> want<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.510> completely<00:04:23.290> try<00:04:23.650> and

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
because you want to completely try and

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.030 
because you want to completely try and
avoid<00:04:24.160> that<00:04:24.220> incline<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.540> after<00:04:26.530> this<00:04:26.710> on

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
avoid that incline and after this on

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.920 
avoid that incline and after this on
this<00:04:27.250> particular<00:04:27.430> level<00:04:27.850> it's<00:04:28.270> mostly<00:04:28.660> quite

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
this particular level it's mostly quite

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.080 
this particular level it's mostly quite
easy<00:04:29.170> running<00:04:30.100> attacks<00:04:30.490> to<00:04:30.670> get<00:04:30.820> you<00:04:30.880> momentum

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
easy running attacks to get you momentum

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.990 
easy running attacks to get you momentum
started<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:31.990> then<00:04:32.710> just<00:04:32.950> get<00:04:33.070> the<00:04:33.160> lumps<00:04:33.370> jump

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
started and then just get the lumps jump

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.100 
started and then just get the lumps jump
over<00:04:34.240> the<00:04:34.330> inclines<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:36.640> then<00:04:36.820> running<00:04:37.630> jump

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
over the inclines and then running jump

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.150 
over the inclines and then running jump
over<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.410> incline<00:04:38.710> on<00:04:38.860> that<00:04:38.980> one<00:04:39.070> because

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
over the incline on that one because

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.710 
over the incline on that one because
it's<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.400> little<00:04:39.430> bit<00:04:39.670> bigger<00:04:39.940> and<00:04:40.150> then<00:04:40.540> just

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
it's a little bit bigger and then just

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.020 
it's a little bit bigger and then just
do<00:04:40.840> runs<00:04:41.170> every<00:04:41.470> time<00:04:41.650> you<00:04:41.770> land<00:04:41.920> a<00:04:42.100> jump<00:04:42.400> so

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
do runs every time you land a jump so

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.790 
do runs every time you land a jump so
you<00:04:43.360> can<00:04:43.690> get<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.900> extra<00:04:44.020> lumps<00:04:44.260> as<00:04:44.410> fast<00:04:44.650> as

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
you can get the extra lumps as fast as

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.480 
you can get the extra lumps as fast as
possible

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
possible

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.390 
possible
so<00:04:46.240> hopefully<00:04:46.420> that's<00:04:47.100> cleared<00:04:48.100> up<00:04:48.220> some

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
so hopefully that's cleared up some

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.760 
so hopefully that's cleared up some
stuff<00:04:48.640> I<00:04:48.910> thought<00:04:49.660> there<00:04:50.380> were<00:04:50.470> quite<00:04:50.650> a<00:04:50.710> few

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
stuff I thought there were quite a few

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:52.950 
stuff I thought there were quite a few
techniques<00:04:51.160> running<00:04:51.640> sliding<00:04:52.240> you<00:04:52.840> know

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
techniques running sliding you know

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.050 
techniques running sliding you know
that's<00:04:53.170> why<00:04:53.320> I<00:04:53.350> changed<00:04:53.620> my<00:04:54.010> my<00:04:54.610> pads<00:04:54.850> because

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
that's why I changed my my pads because

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.060 
that's why I changed my my pads because
there<00:04:55.210> was<00:04:55.300> a<00:04:55.330> lot<00:04:55.540> of<00:04:55.570> sliding<00:04:55.840> now<00:04:56.530> these<00:04:56.800> top

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
there was a lot of sliding now these top

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.340 
there was a lot of sliding now these top
three<00:04:57.250> people<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.790> imagine<00:04:58.780> they're<00:04:58.930> cheating

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
three people I imagine they're cheating

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:00.870 
three people I imagine they're cheating
or<00:04:59.470> doing<00:04:59.500> some<00:04:59.890> sort<00:05:00.010> of<00:05:00.160> exploit<00:05:00.460> anyway<00:05:00.820> so

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
or doing some sort of exploit anyway so

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.060 
or doing some sort of exploit anyway so
that's<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:01.990> bit<00:05:02.140> of<00:05:02.230> a<00:05:02.290> shame<00:05:02.560> people<00:05:02.980> are

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
that's a bit of a shame people are

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.970 
that's a bit of a shame people are

trailing like I said and he always seems

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.640 
trailing like I said and he always seems
to<00:05:19.870> have<00:05:20.020> Dimond<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.680> he's<00:05:21.430> I<00:05:21.850> think<00:05:22.510> he<00:05:23.440> said

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
to have Dimond and he's I think he said

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.150 
to have Dimond and he's I think he said
he<00:05:23.740> was<00:05:23.920> the<00:05:24.670> first<00:05:24.700> on<00:05:25.210> the<00:05:25.360> leaderboards<00:05:25.930> for

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
he was the first on the leaderboards for

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.940 
he was the first on the leaderboards for
cups<00:05:27.160> and<00:05:27.400> I<00:05:27.850> checked<00:05:28.150> in<00:05:28.300> he<00:05:28.360> was<00:05:28.650> but<00:05:29.650> when<00:05:29.920> I

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
cups and I checked in he was but when I

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.820 
cups and I checked in he was but when I
checked<00:05:30.220> here<00:05:30.520> he'd<00:05:31.210> actually<00:05:31.510> got<00:05:31.830> bumped

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
checked here he'd actually got bumped

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.190 
checked here he'd actually got bumped
down<00:05:32.860> a<00:05:33.040> bit<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:33.880> second<00:05:34.240> but<00:05:34.390> the<00:05:34.810> fact<00:05:35.020> is

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
down a bit to second but the fact is

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.370 
down a bit to second but the fact is
these<00:05:35.950> cups<00:05:36.370> are<00:05:36.670> obtained<00:05:37.300> from<00:05:37.570> story<00:05:38.170> mode

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
these cups are obtained from story mode

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.920 
these cups are obtained from story mode
as<00:05:38.560> well<00:05:38.680> as<00:05:39.090> multiplayer<00:05:40.090> modes<00:05:40.360> so<00:05:40.720> I

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
as well as multiplayer modes so I

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.900 
as well as multiplayer modes so I
haven't<00:05:41.830> done<00:05:41.920> most<00:05:42.130> of<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.310> story<00:05:42.520> mode<00:05:42.700> now

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:42.910 
haven't done most of the story mode now

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.400 
haven't done most of the story mode now
I<00:05:43.090> assume<00:05:43.210> you<00:05:43.420> love<00:05:43.540> you<00:05:43.630> around<00:05:43.780> but<00:05:44.020> he's

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:44.410 
I assume you love you around but he's

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.750 
I assume you love you around but he's
got<00:05:44.590> bomb<00:05:44.740> down<00:05:44.890> a<00:05:44.920> second<00:05:45.310> but<00:05:45.400> he's<00:05:45.520> nearly

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
got bomb down a second but he's nearly

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.850 
got bomb down a second but he's nearly
there<00:05:45.910> so<00:05:46.120> whenever<00:05:46.300> if<00:05:46.810> he<00:05:46.930> gets<00:05:47.110> Dimond<00:05:47.560> over

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
there so whenever if he gets Dimond over

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.260 
there so whenever if he gets Dimond over
this<00:05:47.950> weekend<00:05:48.340> he<00:05:48.460> might<00:05:48.610> get<00:05:48.790> bumped<00:05:49.030> back<00:05:49.090> up
