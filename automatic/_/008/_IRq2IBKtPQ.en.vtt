00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
that it's hard for me to sort of sink my

that it's hard for me to sort of sink my
teeth<00:00:55.050> into<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.399> game<00:00:57.440> but<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.789> as

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
teeth into a game but you know as

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.660 
teeth into a game but you know as
complex<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.440> role-playing<00:01:02.129> game<00:01:02.250> for

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
complex as a role-playing game for

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.299 
complex as a role-playing game for
instance<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.899> here's<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.559> battle<00:01:04.739> system<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
instance so here's the battle system the

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.030 
instance so here's the battle system the
battle<00:01:05.549> system<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.780> cool<00:01:07.140> because<00:01:07.560> it

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
battle system is really cool because it

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.600 
battle system is really cool because it
is<00:01:08.189> very<00:01:08.490> much<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.470> know<00:01:10.590> it's<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.130> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
is very much it you know it's it's a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:19.160 
is very much it you know it's it's a
typical<00:01:15.049> JRPG<00:01:16.049> turn-based<00:01:16.619> system<00:01:17.479> but<00:01:18.479> there

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
typical JRPG turn-based system but there

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.070 
typical JRPG turn-based system but there
is<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:20.130> sort<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.490> movement<00:01:21.240> along<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:21.630> grid

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
is this sort of movement along a grid

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.050 
is this sort of movement along a grid
which<00:01:22.350> makes<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.830> almost<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:23.520> strategy

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
which makes it almost like a strategy

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.429 
which makes it almost like a strategy
RPG<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.810> not<00:01:24.990> quite<00:01:25.320> um

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
RPG but not quite um

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.950 
RPG but not quite um
it's<00:01:28.040> a<00:01:28.130> lot<00:01:28.310> it's<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.610> lot<00:01:28.759> faster<00:01:29.060> than<00:01:29.780> the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
it's a lot it's a lot faster than the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.469 
it's a lot it's a lot faster than the
typical<00:01:30.170> strategy<00:01:30.680> RPG<00:01:31.070> like<00:01:31.670> tactics<00:01:32.299> over

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
typical strategy RPG like tactics over

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.410 
typical strategy RPG like tactics over
or<00:01:34.539> Final<00:01:35.539> Fantasy<00:01:35.930> Tactics<00:01:36.110> or<00:01:37.119> whatever<00:01:38.119> but

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
or Final Fantasy Tactics or whatever but

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.899 
or Final Fantasy Tactics or whatever but
it<00:01:38.600> does<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:39.770> positioning<00:01:40.399> does<00:01:40.640> matter

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
it does so positioning does matter

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.819 
it does so positioning does matter
though<00:01:41.030> you<00:01:41.240> know<00:01:41.479> it's<00:01:41.659> not<00:01:41.810> like<00:01:41.869> it's<00:01:42.770> not

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:42.829 
though you know it's not like it's not

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.219 
though you know it's not like it's not
like<00:01:42.920> an<00:01:43.130> old-school<00:01:43.460> JRPG<00:01:44.210> where<00:01:44.509> you<00:01:45.110> know

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
like an old-school JRPG where you know

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.569 
like an old-school JRPG where you know
the<00:01:45.350> good<00:01:45.530> guys<00:01:45.560> are<00:01:45.890> on<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.100> right<00:01:46.250> the<00:01:46.460> bad

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
the good guys are on the right the bad

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.130 
the good guys are on the right the bad
guys<00:01:46.819> are<00:01:47.000> on<00:01:47.090> the<00:01:47.210> left<00:01:47.420> and<00:01:47.659> then<00:01:47.750> you<00:01:47.899> just

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
guys are on the left and then you just

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.870 
guys are on the left and then you just
select<00:01:48.409> your<00:01:48.530> your<00:01:48.979> things<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:49.460> do<00:01:49.579> have<00:01:49.789> to

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
select your your things you do have to

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.719 
select your your things you do have to
worry<00:01:50.030> about<00:01:50.119> positioning<00:01:50.869> like<00:01:51.740> if<00:01:52.039> you<00:01:52.520> just

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
worry about positioning like if you just

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.389 
worry about positioning like if you just
saw<00:01:52.909> there<00:01:53.240> um<00:01:53.720> that<00:01:54.380> enemy<00:01:54.770> did<00:01:54.950> didn't

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
saw there um that enemy did didn't

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.789 
saw there um that enemy did didn't
attack<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:55.880> dock<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.240> my<00:01:56.329> guy<00:01:56.539> back<00:01:56.799> luckily

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
attack that dock to my guy back luckily

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:59.469 
attack that dock to my guy back luckily
it<00:01:57.890> wasn't<00:01:58.250> far<00:01:58.460> enough<00:01:58.670> that<00:01:58.909> I<00:01:58.970> couldn't<00:01:59.360> hit

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
it wasn't far enough that I couldn't hit

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.600 
it wasn't far enough that I couldn't hit
him<00:01:59.630> but<00:01:59.869> he<00:02:00.530> doesn't<00:02:00.740> have<00:02:01.069> a<00:02:01.099> ranged<00:02:01.490> attack

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
him but he doesn't have a ranged attack

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.179 
him but he doesn't have a ranged attack
so<00:02:02.119> if<00:02:02.209> you<00:02:02.330> knock<00:02:02.509> him<00:02:02.750> back<00:02:02.780> far<00:02:03.289> enough<00:02:03.319> he

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189 
so if you knock him back far enough he

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.490 
so if you knock him back far enough he
can't<00:02:04.490> attack<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:05.240> there<00:02:05.899> is<00:02:06.049> some<00:02:06.259> strategy

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
can't attack so there is some strategy

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.940 
can't attack so there is some strategy
based<00:02:07.159> based<00:02:08.030> around<00:02:08.299> that<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.810> think<00:02:09.349> that<00:02:09.769> is

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
based based around that I think that is

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.190 
based based around that I think that is
probably<00:02:10.190> what<00:02:10.789> makes<00:02:11.000> make<00:02:11.510> people<00:02:11.870> love

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
probably what makes make people love

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.160 
probably what makes make people love
this<00:02:12.410> game<00:02:12.680> the<00:02:12.920> most<00:02:13.069> um<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:14.540> story<00:02:14.870> is<00:02:15.140> just

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
this game the most um the story is just

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.470 
this game the most um the story is just
sort<00:02:15.620> of<00:02:15.709> like<00:02:15.980> these<00:02:16.160> two<00:02:16.370> bratty<00:02:16.700> kids<00:02:17.120> that

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.059 
little level up or not level up a little
bit<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.269> experience<00:02:41.780> after<00:02:41.989> that

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
bit the experience after that

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.860 
bit the experience after that
running<00:02:44.790> around<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.150> overworld<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.689> little

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
running around the overworld a little

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.690 
running around the overworld a little
bit<00:02:45.959> more<00:02:46.200> I<00:02:48.650> think<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.950> have<00:02:50.099> one<00:02:50.280> more<00:02:50.459> battle

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
bit more I think I have one more battle

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:16.390 
bit more I think I have one more battle
and<00:02:51.120> then<00:02:51.689> I<00:02:52.019> check<00:02:52.470> out<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.769> town

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.589 

so<00:03:17.000> here<00:03:17.299> I<00:03:17.330> am<00:03:17.420> casting<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.319> fireball<00:03:19.599> spells

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
so here I am casting a fireball spells

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.070 
so here I am casting a fireball spells
have<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.049> charge<00:03:21.409> so<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.760> one<00:03:23.390> turned<00:03:23.780> is

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
have to charge so that the one turned is

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.589 
have to charge so that the one turned is
the<00:03:24.260> charging<00:03:24.590> of<00:03:24.830> the<00:03:24.890> spell<00:03:25.220> and<00:03:25.849> then<00:03:26.269> I<00:03:26.450> get

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
the charging of the spell and then I get

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.170 
the charging of the spell and then I get
another<00:03:26.750> turn<00:03:27.230> pretty<00:03:27.830> quickly<00:03:28.099> and<00:03:28.580> boom

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
another turn pretty quickly and boom

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:44.400 
another turn pretty quickly and boom
that<00:03:29.860> guy<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:30.920> done

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.810 

so<00:03:44.950> as<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.220> can<00:03:45.370> see<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:47.620> additions<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.370> the

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
so as you can see the additions to the

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.090 
so as you can see the additions to the
game<00:03:49.000> that<00:03:49.300> you<00:03:49.750> got<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.990> from<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.290> Vita<00:03:50.470> it's

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
game that you got it from the Vita it's

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.580 
game that you got it from the Vita it's
not<00:03:51.310> much<00:03:51.520> in<00:03:51.850> terms<00:03:52.480> of<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:55.140> right<00:03:56.140> stick

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
not much in terms of the right stick

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.730 
not much in terms of the right stick
because<00:03:57.300> the<00:03:58.300> d-pad<00:03:58.720> doesn't<00:03:59.230> do<00:03:59.380> all<00:03:59.710> that

00:03:59.730 --> 00:03:59.740 
because the d-pad doesn't do all that

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.490 
because the d-pad doesn't do all that
much<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.310> believe<00:04:00.610> it's<00:04:00.760> just<00:04:01.030> movement<00:04:01.540> I'm

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
much I believe it's just movement I'm

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.470 
much I believe it's just movement I'm
swinging<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.490> camera<00:04:03.850> around<00:04:03.940> right<00:04:04.300> now

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
swinging the camera around right now

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.340 
swinging the camera around right now
using<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:05.140> shoulder<00:04:05.680> buttons<00:04:07.020> so<00:04:08.020> you<00:04:08.110> don't

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
using the shoulder buttons so you don't

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:09.660 
using the shoulder buttons so you don't
get<00:04:08.440> anything<00:04:08.680> with<00:04:08.860> the<00:04:08.980> right<00:04:09.100> stick<00:04:09.370> but

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
get anything with the right stick but

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.190 
get anything with the right stick but
obviously<00:04:10.240> the<00:04:10.540> graphics<00:04:12.690> it<00:04:13.690> looks<00:04:13.990> very

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
obviously the graphics it looks very

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.860 
obviously the graphics it looks very
clean<00:04:14.500> with<00:04:14.860> the<00:04:15.010> bilinear<00:04:15.340> filtering<00:04:15.870> it

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
clean with the bilinear filtering it

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.240 
clean with the bilinear filtering it
looks<00:04:17.610> almost<00:04:18.610> like<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.150> passive<00:04:19.780> antic

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
looks almost like a passive antic

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.100 
looks almost like a passive antic
anti-aliasing<00:04:21.250> it's<00:04:22.180> a<00:04:22.240> very<00:04:22.420> clean<00:04:22.720> looking

anti-aliasing it's a very clean looking

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.510
