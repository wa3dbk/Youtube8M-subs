00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
but from the outside you always see they

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.820 
but from the outside you always see they

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:44.830 
have the passion for motorsport and when

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.050 
have the passion for motorsport and when
they<00:00:44.980> decide<00:00:45.310> to<00:00:45.340> do<00:00:45.610> something<00:00:45.640> in

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
they decide to do something in

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.030 
they decide to do something in
motorsport<00:00:46.600> they<00:00:47.170> do<00:00:47.230> eight<00:00:47.410> hundred<00:00:47.710> percent

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
motorsport they do eight hundred percent

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.160 
motorsport they do eight hundred percent
and<00:00:48.160> that<00:00:48.310> is<00:00:48.460> my<00:00:48.610> philosophy<00:00:48.820> so<00:00:49.450> it<00:00:49.930> was

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
and that is my philosophy so it was

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.590 
and that is my philosophy so it was
clear<00:00:50.470> when<00:00:51.370> when<00:00:51.700> they<00:00:51.880> decide<00:00:52.240> to<00:00:52.270> come

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
clear when when they decide to come

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.750 
clear when when they decide to come
again<00:00:53.520> into<00:00:54.520> the<00:00:54.550> car<00:00:54.970> that<00:00:55.420> i<00:00:56.370> was<00:00:57.370> going<00:00:57.610> to

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
again into the car that i was going to

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.200 
again into the car that i was going to
enjoy<00:00:58.030> if<00:00:58.570> I<00:00:58.750> have<00:00:58.900> the<00:00:59.020> opportunity<00:00:59.050> of

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
enjoy if I have the opportunity of

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.530 
enjoy if I have the opportunity of
course<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.600> question<00:01:02.320> which<00:01:02.550> will<00:01:03.550> come<00:01:03.820> quite

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
course a question which will come quite

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.130 
course a question which will come quite
often<00:01:04.750> I<00:01:04.989> think<00:01:05.290> it's<00:01:05.500> why<00:01:06.869> swapping<00:01:07.869> from

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
often I think it's why swapping from

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.580 
often I think it's why swapping from
bike<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.590> model<00:01:08.950> to<00:01:09.220> car<00:01:09.400> and<00:01:10.079> it's<00:01:11.079> just<00:01:11.470> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
bike to model to car and it's just the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.850 
bike to model to car and it's just the
right<00:01:11.740> time<00:01:12.009> I<00:01:12.549> guess<00:01:12.729> that<00:01:13.180> choosing<00:01:13.869> the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
right time I guess that choosing the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.910 
right time I guess that choosing the
pursuit<00:01:15.729> team<00:01:15.939> it's<00:01:16.569> a<00:01:16.869> it's<00:01:17.079> the<00:01:17.530> good<00:01:17.710> way<00:01:17.890> to

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
pursuit team it's a it's the good way to

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.980 
pursuit team it's a it's the good way to
to<00:01:18.399> progress<00:01:18.819> we<00:01:19.240> have<00:01:19.359> a<00:01:19.390> very<00:01:19.719> strong
