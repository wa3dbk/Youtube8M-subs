00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
planned obsolescence okay that is five I

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.590 
planned obsolescence okay that is five I
think<00:01:44.460> it's<00:01:44.579> about<00:01:44.700> eight<00:01:44.909> pounds<00:01:45.420> between

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
think it's about eight pounds between

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.859 
think it's about eight pounds between
the<00:01:45.840> two<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.259> those<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.329> that's<00:01:48.329> eight<00:01:48.540> pounds

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the two of those and that's eight pounds

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.289 
the two of those and that's eight pounds
of<00:01:48.990> weight<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.500> every<00:01:49.979> time<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.790> hit<00:01:50.970> a<00:01:51.030> rock

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
of weight so every time you hit a rock

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.260 
of weight so every time you hit a rock
with<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.930> thing<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.770> sends<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.759> shock<00:01:54.030> wave

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
with this thing it sends a shock wave

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.780 
with this thing it sends a shock wave
down<00:01:54.630> through<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.409> cutter<00:01:55.619> bar<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.610> has

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
down through the cutter bar and it has

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.020 
down through the cutter bar and it has
to<00:01:56.969> either<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.990> slows<00:01:58.320> down<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.979> gives<00:01:59.729> a<00:01:59.850> good

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
to either it slows down and gives a good

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.130 
to either it slows down and gives a good
hammer<00:02:00.710> from<00:02:01.710> those<00:02:01.860> crop<00:02:02.219> lifters<00:02:03.140> remove

hammer from those crop lifters remove

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.420 
hammer from those crop lifters remove
those<00:02:04.409> they're<00:02:04.979> garbage

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
those they're garbage

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.540 
those they're garbage
so<00:02:06.149> what<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.810> do<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.380> these<00:02:07.920> will<00:02:08.099> be<00:02:08.129> off<00:02:08.369> of
