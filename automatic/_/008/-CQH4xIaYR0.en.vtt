00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.829
 teeth

 only 17 years old I already had 232 teeth 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:56.339
 I had been suffering for 18 months 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.620
 pains and a flashy inflammation in 

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.379
 whole mouth and on the gums and 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.830
 Gums forgiveness due to a kind of 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.110
 benign tumor that had in its mouth the 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.350
 operation required two surgeons and 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.979
 two assistants had to use a 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.679
 chisel and a hammer to take out all 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.259
 the teeth the teeth were like 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:23.070
 little pearls that started to come out 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.260
 one by one the truth is that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.320
 It is the first case 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.630
 of a person who has Don Tomás at 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.770
 which are brought two hundred and thirty and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.780
 two awesome teeth you do not already know 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.750
 that the human mouth does not even have 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:44.370
 one sixth of this amount of 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.560
 teeth notwithstanding this man challenge 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.000
 already challenge the odón cases 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.190
 takes more ends 232 teeth is a 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.510
 authentic barbarity and of not having 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.490
 operated 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.440
 simply because he could not have 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.780
 continue living much more because in addition 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.690
 I had a tumor that could have 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.710
 transformed into something much worse without a doubt 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:10.200
 a unique and extreme case of odón toma 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.490
 complex that doctors are still not 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.490
 able to explain
