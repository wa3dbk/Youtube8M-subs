00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.930
 learn better how to edit videos 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.919
 homemade in our computer are and 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.919

 to edit all those all those videos 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.860
 that suddenly we take that with the 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.570
 children that we went on vacation that 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.790
 whatever and then we saved 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.800
 and then not for the laziness of not 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.899
 get them out to the best so much scarcity if 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.970
 what we wear I see myself to the best 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.829
 You do not know how it is that you also do not 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.840
 you do not even know how to do it then we 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.760
 teach july how we can do them and 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.200
 take advantage of having in your memories so 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.040
 beautiful 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.620
 with July dear friends, we are 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.450
 in full vacation and surely we 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.390
 they are watching squeeze from a beautiful 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:55.340
 beach or visited his relatives the case 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.200
 is that after the end of the 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.780
 school courses we were taking 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.780
 many videos photos and on vacation 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.129
 well more on the beach and all this but 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.840
 what happens when we have a 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.240
 lots of these beautiful moments 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.490
 family and we want to make a 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.460
 selection and that looks nice to the engine 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.710
 record it 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.869
 our distant relatives and send it to him 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.760
 share it on social networks how 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.950
 we can edit it without having large 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.380
 knowledge of these judges that 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.600
 We talked with Sarai Jimenez how are you? 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.530
 analyst job thank you very much for 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.530
 thank you for inviting me 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.090
 Well I'm going to tell you about a factor 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.160
 called imagination suite or the 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.050
 imagination suite is very simple 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.850
 and the first thing to do when 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.290
 one approaches an edition package 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.990
 software is not to be afraid of 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.460
 take a chance not really lose anything 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.870
 like you told after we leave 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.570
 vacations can be that our 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.460
 video cameras we capture image or 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.650
 we recorded the recording we were in the 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.030
 beach and suddenly we do not know what 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.740
 do then there are all in the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.080
 little screen watching the video 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.050
 thank you maggi mason sweet imagine 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.820
 inconsulta is a parcel of 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.640
 software where you can do various things 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.369
 You can first edit your movies 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.760
 that you capture on your video camera the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.430
 captures in your camera you can 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.380
 gather photos videos the memory of everything 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.020
 the tour trip that is looking for beaches 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.180
 it's very intuitive and very simple you're going to 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.500
 have the movie that captures this you the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.080
 will break down into an activity of 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.630
 image and little by little you can start 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.340
 create effects between a transition and 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.319
 others becomes a rating 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.870
 by putting an effect to splice the 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.760
 image of suddenly you say hear this moment 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.590
 it reminds me of the song with the guitar 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.390
 then a goal is an audio track 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.640
 and then the other time you want a 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.160
 more lively music you change the track and 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.370
 you can create according to the 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.830
 different moments and songs at the end 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.129
 you're going to have a video its popular even 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.540
 this program allows you for example 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:58.670
 put the timeline with all the 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.200
 video that captures action and sometimes as 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.239
 we are with the camera because we capture 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.829
 a lot of image that is most useful and 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.989
 then from the start you can start 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.120
 select everything you do not want not 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.000
 we know that mom got this 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.739
 the child's end-of-school festival and 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.200
 suddenly there are many moments 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.540
 dead then all the numbers are 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.829
 they can erase we throw them away and 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.349
 we are left with the moments where 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.690
 he went out to the stage where he saw the 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.549
 recording speech and so on and 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.190
 we started to gather on those moments 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.200
 the audio tracks and it's very simple 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:34.209
 we are putting an input effect of 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.209
 output we can put it for example 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.510
 a transition and we are doing more 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.150
 emotive our video and have something very 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.010
 simple and always when you talk about 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.110
 video editing packages or you have 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.200
 something that is very basic that is for a 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.720
 user without experience and gives you 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.210
 many limitations or do you have something 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.070
 very complex that is for someone with 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.780
 a lot of experience in editing and then 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.430
 you do not know how these can be the 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.480
 Mom operation they say simple but 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.160
 also cause it the boy of 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.320
 university to make his short 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.600
 of the school they are asking for 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.580
 to deliver as a task then 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.250
 also what I love this software 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.530
 is that neither is very small as very basic 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.750
 nor is it very elaborate but it adapts 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.760
 to the size of the user and that has to 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.920
 to do the technology is to adapt to the 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.650
 users so keep an eye on friends there 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.330
 They have an excellent alternative for 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.830
 all those videos that we have nothing 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.230
 more than strangers but from past years 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.330
 make excellent bookstores that well 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.820
 edited and who knows maybe after a while 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.860
 we are doing so the beginning 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.020
 some professionals excellent many 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.190
 and thanks to the know much good 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.170
 friends we continue with women in tvc 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.970
 and that the world of cinema be prepared 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.580
 because with this software you will know 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.330
 how are my nominated videos going to be 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.520
 not sure it does not happen to them that they take their 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.700
 video and they put it into the computer 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.860
 It was already long as it is them 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.570
 then edit it if there if you can 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.850
 see with the family or is already more 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.010
 ordered and yours is a session popcorn 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.810
 and everything and you feel with the family we see 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.210
 It's great to see how you remember the rent 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.770
 success you have a lot of fun because many 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.960
 thanks to julio vélez as always 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.550
 bring technology to our hands and 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.480
 let's continue what do you think we're going 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.480
 with víctor and sides
