00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.660
 I went to a pastor case by 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.580
 study it turn on making cars 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.470
 unlimitedly or also put them on 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.680
 move on to our friends or stay 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.870
 us and we can locate the garage but 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.910
 that very fast besides that is a way 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.370
 very funny and very similar to what 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.860
 will be a few tricks of the generation 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.960
 happened and I say of the last version but it's 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.579
 that continues to serve no and well what 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.039
 first thing we have to have is a car 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.379
 of luxury I say sorry no luxury sorry 

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.620
 wrong, mistaking a lot has to be 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.780
 a not luxury car and we're going to have it 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.769
 as much as we can I do not know if I already 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.409
 we have in the garage 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.479
 it does not matter simply that it is not a 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.999
 luxury car with him missing I think that 

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:58.059
 also but with horror does not work with the 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:01:00.850
 I chose rh8 if it serves not because we have it 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.620
 brother in law what we are going to need is 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.900
 bring him here to the garage and that a friend 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.270
 kill us not on Tuesday 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.520
 let's send an invitation to 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.560
 game 1 to 1 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.200
 and what this will produce when 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.960
 we tell him to accept the going 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.789
 accept here our friend kills us and what 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.610
 what we are going to have to do is fast 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:23.319
 here he runs fast for the car and 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.270
 basically as for us you 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.250
 We take our ego to accept the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.829
 mission will accept it here we go up 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.360
 to our car and quickly as soon as 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.250
 let's see that we are going to hit the door 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.679
 we tell our business there will 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.259
 they are doing already while there I do not know no 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.819
 affects the mission one by one and how can 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:44.110
 see now we are just going to give 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:46.619
 the turn and out of nowhere it looks like a car in 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.909
 the same one appears a duplicate car with 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.319
 our very character now here what 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.810
 what we are going to do is simply download 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:55.989
 the character that is this is in the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.759
 means our very character forgiveness and 

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:59.530
 we lower it and it is already 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.929
 our friend will not be watching right now 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.459
 This car will see us with a car 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.649
 we will see it now if 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:08.590
 want to do is go to a blue dot and 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.049
 all of activities that marks us in 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.120
 the map and simply position the car 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.650
 that's how the mission comes in 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.340
 we're just going to be watching in the 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.950
 Radar 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.690
 personal car the one that is there and we are going to 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.360
 see a duplicate car as you can see 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.140
 now it's just like taking it to 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.760
 garage this car because it will already be and 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.680
 we want to give it to a friend because it will be 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.209
 well we do not give it to you and it's already good 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.860
 basically it would be all for today's them 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.110
 we can reach a few thousand for this 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.269
 piece of the case we reached thousands before 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.540
 So, I bring you a night 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.540
 piece
