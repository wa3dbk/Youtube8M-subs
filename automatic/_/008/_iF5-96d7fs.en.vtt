00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.650
 new spit that I like to introduce 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.280
 would like to 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.300
 I have seen this task with 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.450
 network here on youtube 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.080
 you may know one or the other 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:18.690
 and I found this task very much 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.180
 funny and abnormally heavy 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.670
 That's why I thought I would do it 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.269
 also a video 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:30.630
 the task is simply white 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.960
 wins this partie and how put the 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.530
 on 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.270
 You can see the farmers are white here 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.540
 in the sixth row shortly before the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.450
 Conversion the white king has somehow 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.860
 managed to get to a8 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.039
 and now white needs a possibility 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.170
 to get these farmers through or 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:54.710
 to gain enough material around the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.539
 to get the game home 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.340
 there is a bit of thought here i 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.039
 even wants to suggest the video too 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.870
 pause it to rest 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.240
 because who can see the solution 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.540
 definitely deserves to be mine 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.510
 Deepest respect that is not 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.619
 easy is really hard 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.490
 and then I'm silent for now 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.820
 then contact me again about 15 seconds 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.420
 and then there should be the dissolve i should 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.100
 to mention 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.100
 white is then pulled 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.520
 and that's a lot of fun 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.390
 so hopefully 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.490
 to pause the video and were themselves 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.190
 to look over it here 's the one now 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:06.420
 Resolution the right train for white 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:10.320
 starts with f7 that threatens at least once 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.250
 the conversion of the farmer to f8 against 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:17.850
 the black must do something 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.070
 or that's why f1 plays the 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.190
 It would not be right to get it back then 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.190
 right 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:32.520
 tom stohn is awakened and therefore 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.770
 G6 is the runner-up 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.110
 Toward the tower is a theoretical chemistry 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:38.480
 position 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.680
 Of course you need it too 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.520
 certain tactical talent and that 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:48.780
 but the task has indeed synonymous 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:54.060
 loud white on winning paths to bring 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:57.080
 So back to tower F1 White needs it 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.510
 a punchier train and that is here 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.810
 beats them now are two build up 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.480
 The last series is happy to 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.519
 want to convert lady and that must 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.510
 prevent black of course 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:15.800
 Tom has two, if and when 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.709
 a farmer converts then proposes the ton 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.840
 the resulting construction field and how 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.010
 said to be up and running against it's storm 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.150
 a theoretical chemistry 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.269
 We do not want to do that 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.450
 want the win for white and now who 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.989
 it has not come so bad 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.320
 now comes the first of two 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:44.090
 tricky moves 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.090
 then he will know his runner 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.250
 that first obstructs the line to 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.580
 build on 11 7 black must respond 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.520
 with the tower on f1 takes him out and 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:02.260
 Now there is the next tricky one 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:05.920
 train and although the steering to the g20 must 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:10.900
 react and then it transforms 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.730
 Bauer to the lady and what happens then 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.239
 that they are also equally strong gen me 2 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.970
 I say and just lady what we are 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.580
 it is still white now 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.480
 threatens to get a second lady 

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:25.930
 that would be black out of the way 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.100
 go 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:35.250
 but if he takes out then follows 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:38.320
 at that time five example king g6 and 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.630
 has is therefore seven and 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.350
 Opinion against tower is for white 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.530
 won 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:47.440
 There is no dull black down here 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:52.000
 the reason 3 because the field g8 is from 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.970
 Most lady covered and that should 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.770
 continue to get home 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.500
 We also go back a bit and look 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.020
 What happens to someone else ? 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:06.760
 do gymnastics 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:11.200
 then of course hard lady follows death 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:16.090
 takes and most cases decide 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.919
 da ma 5 chess the tumor 57 field and 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.220
 when the king goes back to law 

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:23.470
 the field on g8 is still covered 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:30.210
 i'll do this task again 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:33.480
 quickly start by at 11 7 resp 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.700
 maybe still perceive variations 

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.450
 tonbach that would perhaps be one of those 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:43.600
 one or the other in the head had around 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:50.470
 to provoke the withdrawal here follows completely 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:53.340
 Simply king c6 and hate the league 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:58.120
 are definitely uncomfortable 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:00.940
 we can still show because we know 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:07.780
 here tried to get through the tree 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:10.380
 thoma 1972 beats king beats and 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:13.930
 thoma 2 is charming 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:20.580
 So that would not be so well know would 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:26.669
 react back here 7 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:29.760
 and here could be the name or tower 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:34.870
 and we will get a job again 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:37.600
 at least where black and around um 

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.960
 and Runner probably has it that way 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:45.220
 that this position is also a crime 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.140
 So f7 was the right train that leads 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:51.100
 the entire municipality to the 1 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:53.910
 with thomas 17 black always has to be here 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:58.380
 Only you can never react to it 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:04.780
 strike out live sf two 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:08.650
 brilliant to the fcg 2 still a brilliant one 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:11.830
 train what you definitely bring 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:15.220
 should be so distraction and guidance in the 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:21.350
 bay but very strong violently 

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:25.550
 Twice lady to hit 75 and finish 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:28.640
 and who got that out mine 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:29.750
 respect and i would say see us 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.440
 maybe next time 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:32.440
 pure skin
