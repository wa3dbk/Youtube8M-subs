00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 dominik 9 in the following video I show 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.839
 you guys like your mac system 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.790
 So going back could be something 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.660
 can undo and it 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.660
 could repeat 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.669
 under windows, the whole thing was something 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:27.039
 later introduced at times where I am with 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.599
 The computer started there 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.460
 the function with the undo even 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.739
 not i believe in any word 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.390
 version was introduced and since then 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.180
 I do not want to miss it anymore 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.239
 the mac is so it is almost 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.440
 systemwide but every app every program 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.989
 reacted differently 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.950
 I'll show you that I have 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.650
 now here are three lines 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.060
 Now write the fourth line here 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:55.910
 then I edit in the menu input 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.250
 revoke so command z 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.910
 usually it is undone namely really 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.309
 command system far 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.550
 There are some apps that are different 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.160
 But I'll show you that right away 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:13.640
 So I do command once z 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.860
 and you see the last action was 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.720
 this textedit revoked 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.600
 I can repeat the whole thing 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.790
 by typing edit repeat 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.729
 say switch so come z 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.420
 pay attention to the key combination is 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.150
 not the same everywhere 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.250
 So you can do that with command z 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:36.100
 undo if I am here now 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.470
 can write out fifth line 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.890
 I undo with command set the whole 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.020
 do 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.990
 I can do that too in the enemy here 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.539
 I'll go into my music once 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.750
 folder and name this file now 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.720
 Once around and what happens when I am 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.580
 now on edit go command z 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.460
 is to rename rename 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.680
 So command z and you see it is 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.720
 named again with the old name 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.340
 or I delete the file in the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.319
 trash and if I am now too 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.690
 edit go said move from 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:10.239
 cancel solution point mp3 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.630
 So command Z and he gets the file 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.030
 back out of the trash or I can 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.489
 move from solution point mp3 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.450
 say repeat then put it back 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.090
 in the trash 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.310
 I can handle the actions with command 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.380
 revoke that means at the beginning I have 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.150
 the file is deleted and a revocation 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.650
 means I get you out of the trash 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.630
 back again or I can do it 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.380
 repeat and put them in the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.190
 waste paper bin 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.230
 the same is true for example for 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.239
 programs like pixelmator or photoshop 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.580
 I go here now and draw 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.670
 something 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.490
 with command z I can do the last 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.320
 step revoked and with command set 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.620
 again intervened and again 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.750
 Step or I say edit brush 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.410
 repeat edit brush 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.630
 to repeat 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.040
 you see that is in such a way 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.750
 Program a history 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.150
 so if I can have made mistakes 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.120
 I even take several steps 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.549
 return 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.870
 Again, the hint of each 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.670
 program reacts differently 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.370
 Just try it out but in the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.769
 usually you can command the whole 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.989
 undo or if he does it again 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.569
 just want to pick up 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.560
 click or look what the second point 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.319
 under edit 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.150
 in the corresponding app means 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.360
 photoshop looks a bit different 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.909
 i also go here in photoshop and 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.459
 Paint something I just got it in 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:37.609
 pixelmator and can do here 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.829
 edit undo brush if say 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.720
 but now I brush again 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:44.870
 wants to undo here 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.190
 that means photoshop can repeat 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.310
 Do not take the steps back as well 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.010
 pixelmator but I find here 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.079
 edit the point step back that 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.879
 means photoshop works 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:58.879
 For example, I can take steps 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.739
 so soon cmd and z visier in the 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.489
 menu bar also stands the steps 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.500
 return 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:06.440
 that also means I have one here 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.459
 History and I can follow the steps too 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.459
 go forward again 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.830
 you see here in photoshop works 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.290
 it is slightly different than for example in 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:20.829
 pixelmator that means just look 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.780
 a menu bar what with you the step 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.090
 means back and how it is individual 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.190
 for the program works in 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.450
 general means that with command z 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.670
 you can usually take steps 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.710
 go back or just steps 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.240
 to repeat 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.280
 the whole thing works in the browser too 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.110
 but pay attention here 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.640
 browser again I have different 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.250
 now my contact form here 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.350
 filled in and with command z you see 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.140
 what to undo it i can 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.200
 also in the browser steps back and just 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:52.720
 steps forward but the step 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.490
 seems like you really see the whole 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.790
 Half way here after the 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.430
 comma including the correction of test 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.710
 Message that means I'm here 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.140
 last step this part set 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:08.190
 written and it was automatically off 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:12.180
 tess message go back again 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.380
 with the second big a correction from 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.300
 system made 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.200
 that means you have to do a bit 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.150
 watch what exactly does command z 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.960
 Undo and how can I do it for myself 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.300
 use 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.460
 yes i do not want to work on this 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.350
 renounce command z and steps 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.210
 forward for me, the 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.300
 key combination impressed I use 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.130
 that exclusive and really in almost everyone 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.600
 app is a great thing you have 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.160
 just mistyped or you have just times 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.540
 made mistakes or does one have a file 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.820
 deleted wrong and then I'm easy 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.670
 step back or reverse 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.420
 repeat and the system is far that 

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.820
 really good 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.130
 I hope you will find applications 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.240
 for that tip in your system 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.000
 Maybe a little bit 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:55.020
 Easier to work with 110 at this 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.310
 I say thank you very much for this 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.830
 watching looks in a canal 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.320
