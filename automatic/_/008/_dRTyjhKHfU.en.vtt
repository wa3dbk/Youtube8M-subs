00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
weighting that exactly 66 point zero

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.690 
weighting that exactly 66 point zero
zero<00:00:36.270> when<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.320> mattered<00:00:37.559> so<00:00:37.739> real<00:00:38.309> stoked<00:00:38.610> to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
zero when it mattered so real stoked to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.150 
zero when it mattered so real stoked to
the<00:00:38.790> way<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.059> when<00:00:39.559> he<00:00:40.559> has<00:00:40.680> him<00:00:40.829> open<00:00:41.100> a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the way that when he has him open a

00:00:41.160 --> 00:01:00.680 
the way that when he has him open a
score<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.399> 195<00:00:42.210> kilos

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:14.480 

sit<00:01:01.109> down<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.500> stand<00:01:01.620> up

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.590 

so<00:01:15.490> they<00:01:15.640> saw<00:01:15.880> me<00:01:16.000> just<00:01:16.150> cleaning<00:01:16.510> around

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
so they saw me just cleaning around

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.390 
so they saw me just cleaning around
before<00:01:17.020> my<00:01:17.170> second<00:01:17.710> attempt<00:01:17.950> squat

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
before my second attempt squat

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.280 
before my second attempt squat
I<00:01:18.430> was<00:01:19.270> pretty<00:01:19.450> relaxed<00:01:19.780> coming<00:01:19.930> into<00:01:20.110> this

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
I was pretty relaxed coming into this

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.109 
I was pretty relaxed coming into this
this<00:01:20.770> isn't<00:01:21.040> really<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.220> big<00:01:21.430> high<00:01:21.640> priority

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
this isn't really a big high priority

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.240 
this isn't really a big high priority
meat<00:01:22.299> for<00:01:22.479> me<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.750> so<00:01:22.840> is<00:01:22.960> my<00:01:23.080> calendar<00:01:23.500> I<00:01:23.710> mean

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
meat for me and so is my calendar I mean

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.130 
meat for me and so is my calendar I mean
they've<00:01:24.340> got<00:01:24.400> worlds<00:01:24.820> in<00:01:24.909> nine<00:01:25.090> weeks<00:01:25.119> so<00:01:25.570> this

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
they've got worlds in nine weeks so this

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.800 
they've got worlds in nine weeks so this
was<00:01:26.290> more<00:01:26.440> of<00:01:26.500> an<00:01:26.619> opportunity<00:01:26.830> for<00:01:27.250> me<00:01:27.400> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
was more of an opportunity for me to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.760 
was more of an opportunity for me to
find<00:01:28.810> out<00:01:28.899> where<00:01:29.050> I<00:01:29.110> am<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.380> give<00:01:29.500> myself<00:01:29.590> a

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
find out where I am and give myself a

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.870 
find out where I am and give myself a
little<00:01:29.860> bit<00:01:29.979> of<00:01:30.040> a<00:01:30.130> test<00:01:30.310> this<00:01:30.490> new<00:01:30.670> body

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
little bit of a test this new body

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.870 
little bit of a test this new body
weight<00:01:31.119> and<00:01:32.009> kind<00:01:33.009> of<00:01:33.070> plan<00:01:33.250> attempts<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.670> world

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
weight and kind of plan attempts a world

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.670 
weight and kind of plan attempts a world
so<00:01:34.060> hopefully<00:01:34.390> this<00:01:34.570> 207<00:01:35.080> half<00:01:35.229> will<00:01:35.409> be<00:01:35.500> more

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
so hopefully this 207 half will be more

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.960 
so hopefully this 207 half will be more
of<00:01:35.740> an<00:01:35.830> opener<00:01:36.729> attempt<00:01:37.690> at<00:01:37.810> Worlds<00:01:38.970> wasn't

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
of an opener attempt at Worlds wasn't

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.249 
of an opener attempt at Worlds wasn't
too<00:01:40.060> bad<00:01:40.240> kind<00:01:40.509> of<00:01:40.570> fell<00:01:40.690> over<00:01:40.840> to<00:01:40.930> my<00:01:40.990> left<00:01:41.140> a

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
too bad kind of fell over to my left a

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.389 
too bad kind of fell over to my left a
little<00:01:41.409> bit<00:01:41.590> which<00:01:41.680> made<00:01:41.830> it<00:01:41.950> stick<00:01:42.100> it<00:01:42.220> in<00:01:42.310> the

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
little bit which made it stick it in the

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.550 
little bit which made it stick it in the
sugar<00:01:42.430> bin<00:01:42.759> when<00:01:43.390> I<00:01:43.450> was<00:01:43.540> planning<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.810> 217

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
sugar bin when I was planning to 217

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.710 
sugar bin when I was planning to 217
maybe<00:01:44.800> 220<00:01:45.130> on<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.399> third<00:01:45.640> but<00:01:45.940> we<00:01:46.179> thought

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
maybe 220 on the third but we thought

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.760 
maybe 220 on the third but we thought
we'd<00:01:46.869> go<00:01:46.990> a<00:01:47.020> little<00:01:47.200> more<00:01:47.410> conservative

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
we'd go a little more conservative

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.419 
we'd go a little more conservative
myself<00:01:48.310> when<00:01:48.429> we<00:01:48.490> coach<00:01:48.700> Robert<00:01:49.090> winks<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.340> he

myself when we coach Robert winks so he

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.070 
myself when we coach Robert winks so he
