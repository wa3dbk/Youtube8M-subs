to be talking about football too much

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.570 
to be talking about football too much
more<00:00:06.870> but<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.259> New<00:00:07.410> England<00:00:07.529> Patriots<00:00:07.770> did

more but the New England Patriots did

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.410 
more but the New England Patriots did

deflategate<00:00:12.420> was<00:00:13.110> more<00:00:13.410> or<00:00:13.559> less<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.740> non-issue

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
deflategate was more or less a non-issue

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.250 
deflategate was more or less a non-issue
during<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.759> game<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.179> did<00:00:15.750> think<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.020> would<00:00:16.170> be

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
during the game I did think it would be

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.019 
during the game I did think it would be
funny<00:00:16.470> though<00:00:16.680> if<00:00:16.800> at<00:00:16.920> one<00:00:17.100> point<00:00:17.369> one<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.789> the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
funny though if at one point one of the

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.630 
funny though if at one point one of the
12<00:00:18.330> balls<00:00:18.720> that<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.170> Patriots<00:00:19.380> bring<00:00:20.039> out<00:00:20.220> is

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
12 balls that the Patriots bring out is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.509 
12 balls that the Patriots bring out is
so<00:00:21.330> deflated<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.380> just<00:00:22.680> floppy<00:00:23.070> you

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
so deflated that it's just floppy you

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.859 
so deflated that it's just floppy you
know<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:23.970> like<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.180> piece<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.510> leather

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
know it's just like a piece of leather

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.920 
know it's just like a piece of leather
uh<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.130> at<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:27.000> as<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> goof<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.779> know

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
uh and and at just as a goof you know

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.359 
uh and and at just as a goof you know
but<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.199> was<00:00:28.289> probably<00:00:28.470> not<00:00:28.859> something<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
but it was probably not something to

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:30.769 
but it was probably not something to
joke<00:00:29.400> about<00:00:29.609> his<00:00:29.970> tensions<00:00:30.390> are<00:00:30.510> running<00:00:30.630> very

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
joke about his tensions are running very

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.280 
joke about his tensions are running very
very<00:00:31.230> high<00:00:32.030> agreed<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.360> did<00:00:33.809> come<00:00:33.989> out<00:00:34.110> recently

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
very high agreed I did come out recently

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.620 
very high agreed I did come out recently
that<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.829> guess<00:00:35.160> only<00:00:35.399> one<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> Patriots

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
that I guess only one of the Patriots

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.220 
that I guess only one of the Patriots
balls<00:00:36.870> was<00:00:37.530> actually<00:00:38.040> deflated<00:00:38.610> uh<00:00:39.230> below

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
balls was actually deflated uh below

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.430 
balls was actually deflated uh below
more<00:00:41.160> than<00:00:41.340> you<00:00:41.640> know<00:00:41.670> enough<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.809> be<00:00:42.840> alarming

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
more than you know enough to be alarming

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.709 
more than you know enough to be alarming
uh<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:44.219> anyway<00:00:44.520> that's<00:00:44.640> that's<00:00:45.030> old<00:00:45.270> news<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
uh but anyway that's that's old news I

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.479 
uh but anyway that's that's old news I
really<00:00:46.320> thought<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> Patriots<00:00:47.370> were

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
really thought that the Patriots were

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.160 
really thought that the Patriots were
going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.760> lose<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.120> game<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> very<00:00:48.960> end

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
going to lose the game at the very end

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.439 
going to lose the game at the very end
when<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.739> was<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.070> play<00:00:50.460> where<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
when there was this play where the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.779 
when there was this play where the
Seahawks<00:00:52.170> appear<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.309> thrown<00:00:53.640> an

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
Seahawks appear to have thrown an

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.670 
Seahawks appear to have thrown an
incomplete<00:00:54.329> pass<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.020> then<00:00:55.110> upon<00:00:55.379> closer

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
incomplete pass and then upon closer

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.610 
incomplete pass and then upon closer
review<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.670> ball<00:00:56.940> never<00:00:57.480> died<00:00:57.899> because<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
review the ball never died because it

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.549 
review the ball never died because it
landed<00:00:59.309> on<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.730> Seahawk<00:01:00.239> players<00:01:00.660> body<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
landed on the Seahawk players body and

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.100 
landed on the Seahawk players body and
the<00:01:02.160> Seahawk<00:01:02.670> ultimately<00:01:03.359> caught<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.899> ball

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the Seahawk ultimately caught the ball

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.740 
the Seahawk ultimately caught the ball
somewhere<00:01:04.650> around<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.250> 10<00:01:05.460> yard<00:01:05.670> line<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:06.240> was

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
somewhere around the 10 yard line I was

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.210 
somewhere around the 10 yard line I was
convinced<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.380> was<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.830> Louis<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
convinced that that was it Louis that

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.500 
convinced that that was it Louis that
they<00:01:08.369> were<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.640> going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.939> run<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.299> ball<00:01:09.479> in

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
they were just going to run the ball in

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.359 
they were just going to run the ball in
for<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:09.930> touchdown<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.189> Patriots

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
for a touchdown and that the Patriots

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.760 
for a touchdown and that the Patriots
ran<00:01:11.850> out<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> time<00:01:12.330> and<00:01:12.390> ultimately<00:01:13.290> know<00:01:13.590> the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
ran out of time and ultimately know the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
ran out of time and ultimately know the
Patriots<00:01:14.280> did<00:01:14.430> intercept<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.210> pass<00:01:15.420> at<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
Patriots did intercept the pass at the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.080 
Patriots did intercept the pass at the
goal<00:01:15.960> line<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.520> subsequently<00:01:17.520> we<00:01:17.759> were<00:01:17.970> able

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
goal line and subsequently we were able

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.550 
goal line and subsequently we were able
to<00:01:18.330> run<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.509> clock<00:01:18.810> out<00:01:19.020> i<00:01:19.080> mean<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.380> an

questions<00:01:24.600> around<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:25.140> uh<00:01:25.580> why<00:01:26.580> didn't<00:01:27.090> they

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
questions around that uh why didn't they

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.880 
questions around that uh why didn't they
run<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.600> ball<00:01:27.750> why<00:01:28.080> did<00:01:28.229> they<00:01:28.350> risk<00:01:28.590> throwing

run the ball why did they risk throwing

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.130 
run the ball why did they risk throwing
it<00:01:29.189> why<00:01:29.610> didn't<00:01:29.939> they<00:01:30.030> take<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.240> timeout<00:01:30.540> why

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
it why didn't they take a timeout why

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.679 
it why didn't they take a timeout why

didn't the Patriots take a timeout uh
well<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.530> hold<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> second<00:01:35.310> though

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
well that I hold on a second though

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.760 
well that I hold on a second though
timeouts<00:01:35.909> aside<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.689> think<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> why

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
timeouts aside I think that the why

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.190 
timeouts aside I think that the why
didn't<00:01:38.159> they<00:01:38.310> run<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.700> question<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.720> little

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
didn't they run it question is a little

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.840 
didn't they run it question is a little
bit<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.650> cop-out<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.640> particular

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
bit of a cop-out in this particular

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.260 
bit of a cop-out in this particular
sense<00:01:42.479> number<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.920> typically<00:01:44.460> expect<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
sense number one you typically expect a

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.840 
sense number one you typically expect a
run<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.899> situation<00:01:46.649> and<00:01:47.130> i<00:01:47.399> believe<00:01:47.729> it

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
run in that situation and i believe it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.520 
run in that situation and i believe it
was<00:01:47.939> second<00:01:48.329> down<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:48.810> i<00:01:48.840> don't<00:01:49.200> think<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.439> was

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
was second down so i don't think it was

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.289 
was second down so i don't think it was
crazy<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> seahawks<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.880> try<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> do

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
crazy for the seahawks to try to do

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.060 
crazy for the seahawks to try to do
something<00:01:51.540> differently<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.350> at<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.890> same

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
something differently and at the same

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.940 
something differently and at the same
time<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.670> play<00:01:54.329> had<00:01:54.570> succeeded<00:01:55.229> no<00:01:55.649> one

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
time if that play had succeeded no one

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.560 
time if that play had succeeded no one
would<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.310> said<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.880> was<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.030> bad<00:01:57.299> call

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
would have said that it was a bad call

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.910 
would have said that it was a bad call
they<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:57.960> said<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.530> was<00:01:58.799> an

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
they would have said it was an

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.010 
they would have said it was an
incredible<00:01:59.579> play<00:01:59.880> because<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.329> Patriots

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
incredible play because the Patriots

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.780 
incredible play because the Patriots
would<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.320> been<00:02:01.469> expecting<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.130> run<00:02:02.399> given

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
would have been expecting a run given

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.030 
would have been expecting a run given
the<00:02:02.820> circumstances<00:02:03.750> they<00:02:04.500> might<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:04.860> called

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
the circumstances they might have called

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.100 
the circumstances they might have called
it<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.280> brilliant<00:02:05.729> call<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.299> think<00:02:06.689> anyone

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
it a brilliant call but I think anyone

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.839 
it a brilliant call but I think anyone
knew<00:02:07.350> who<00:02:07.500> understood<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.950> situation<00:02:08.160> still

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
knew who understood the situation still

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.339 
knew who understood the situation still
would<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.000> called<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.360> a<00:02:09.420> risky<00:02:09.810> call<00:02:10.020> right

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
would have called it a risky call right

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.800 
would have called it a risky call right
uh<00:02:10.560> which<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.190> was<00:02:11.370> uh<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:12.180> have<00:02:12.360> one<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.750> the

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
uh which it was uh you have one of the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.800 
uh which it was uh you have one of the
best<00:02:12.930> running<00:02:13.200> backs<00:02:13.470> in<00:02:13.650> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
best running backs in the

that's another story I think you hand

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.050 
that's another story I think you hand
the<00:02:19.989> ball<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.170> him<00:02:20.410> but<00:02:20.739> no<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.370> think<00:02:21.880> though

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
the ball to him but no I I think though

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.910 
the ball to him but no I I think though
that<00:02:22.090> there<00:02:22.720> is<00:02:22.959> something<00:02:23.410> else<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.770> be<00:02:23.890> said

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
that there is something else to be said

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.180 
that there is something else to be said
about<00:02:24.459> uh<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:26.080> there's<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.380> convers<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.739> theory

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
about uh that there's a convers a theory

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.770 
about uh that there's a convers a theory
that<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.370> read<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.700> think<00:02:28.000> Dave's<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.330> wrote<00:02:28.630> about

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
that I read I think Dave's I wrote about

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.110 
that I read I think Dave's I wrote about
this<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:29.560> they<00:02:29.709> deliberately<00:02:30.310> didn't<00:02:30.819> go<00:02:31.060> to

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
this that they deliberately didn't go to

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.360 
this that they deliberately didn't go to
Marshawn<00:02:31.690> Lynch<00:02:32.019> because<00:02:32.410> they<00:02:32.560> did<00:02:32.800> not<00:02:32.830> want

Marshawn Lynch because they did not want
him<00:02:33.610> to<00:02:33.760> be<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.000> hero<00:02:34.209> and<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.630> don't<00:02:34.810> know<00:02:34.900> that

him to be the hero and I don't know that

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.660 
him to be the hero and I don't know that
we<00:02:35.140> have<00:02:35.170> any<00:02:35.680> evidence<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:36.160> actually<00:02:36.519> support

we have any evidence to actually support
that<00:02:37.030> but<00:02:37.180> I've<00:02:37.300> seen<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:37.630> written<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:37.989> couple

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
that but I've seen it written a couple

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.130 
that but I've seen it written a couple

of places that uh that would be

of places that uh that would be
interesting<00:02:41.739> I<00:02:41.920> doubt<00:02:42.430> we'll<00:02:42.580> hear<00:02:42.790> from<00:02:42.819> him

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
interesting I doubt we'll hear from him

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.030 
interesting I doubt we'll hear from him
though<00:02:43.330> on<00:02:43.599> what<00:02:44.440> he<00:02:44.530> thinks<00:02:44.800> about<00:02:44.860> the
