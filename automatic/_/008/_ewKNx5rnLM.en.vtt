00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
like so you see that on the top screen

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.320 
like so you see that on the top screen
you<00:02:07.200> see<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> flying<00:02:07.710> RB<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.239> look

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
different way but it's limited in time

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.570 
different way but it's limited in time
and<00:04:00.500> then<00:04:00.710> let's<00:04:01.010> talk<00:04:01.070> about<00:04:01.190> chompers

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
and then let's talk about chompers

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.460

ability so your left bumper is a goop
ability<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.130> that's<00:04:04.250> going<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.460> fire

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
ability and that's going to fire

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.490 
ability and that's going to fire
straight<00:04:04.940> forward<00:04:05.420> it's<00:04:05.960> right<00:04:06.230> through<00:04:06.440> your
