00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.490
 Hello 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.640
 again 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.010
 until the arrival of the current third 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.960
 generation the lion was only offered in the 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.730
 five-door body but the 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.950
 things have changed and the offer has gone up 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.200
 to three then to the usual five 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.690
 doors have been added the three sc 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.200
 doors and the st that is the family ero 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.200
 ranch 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.320
 the lion sc came to the market in May of 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.570
 2013 and is a car of proportions 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.460
 balanced that transmits dynamism 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.010
 thanks to a studied relationship between 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.680
 length height and width 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.840
 the wheelbase or battle is 35 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.820
 millimeters shorter than the 5 doors 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.860
 which allows us to offer an image of 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.930
 greater dynamism and also the cantilevers 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.189
 shorter ones contribute to greater 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.189
 aggressiveness in the image 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.060
 as the five doors uses the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.670
 modular platform m 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.200
 of the volkswagen group that also use the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.250
 Golf 7 and the Audi A3 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.520
 the length of the reprobated scf is 424 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.159
 meters 35 centimeters less than 5 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.740
 doors with a width of 181 meters 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.130
 that are 06 centimeters less and one 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.729
 height of 143 meters that has dropped by 13 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.729
 centimeters 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.460
 The lion sc is different than 5 doors 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.010
 from the pillar to the rear 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.020
 the proportion in each 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.240
 design line to offer a 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.490
 dynamic image and the rear window is 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.130
 19 degrees more inclined than 5 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.680
 doors the rear pilots have been 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.960
 stretched to the sides of the car and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.610
 They have led technology 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.520
 the test unit had the 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.950
 full led package that costs one thousand 188 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.060
 euros and includes the main headlights 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.850
 with diode technology 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.250
 electroluminescent or LEDs in all 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.550
 functions and daytime running lights also by 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.550
 leds 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.010
 the interior has a clean design 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.140
 and fluid materials and finishes offers 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.410
 a remarkable perceived quality and all 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.420
 the surfaces are soft to the touch there are 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.720
 a dozen holes and spaces for 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.000
 save objects 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.800
 in the lions sc the front seats 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.830
 provides a driving position 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.320
 something lower 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.060
 those of the proven fr version are more 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.580
 envelopes and offer an excellent 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.480
 lateral support to facilitate a 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.819
 more sporty driving 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.310
 the upholstery is mixed with a very 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.980
 attractive and skin and the stitching go in 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.390
 Red also has a great 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.270
 support platform for the foot 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.400
 left 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.230
 the steering wheel is lined with a mixture of 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.230
 normal leather and perforated with stitching 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.430
 red is tied by the bottom and 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.170
 has the identification 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.240
 fr 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.680
 an uncomfortable detail is the position 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.620
 Delayed seat belts 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.530
 which makes it difficult to reach them in addition 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.930
 they do not have height regulation 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.459
 The large opening of the doors facilitates 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.160
 access and front seats 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.780
 include the easy entry function that 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.430
 allows them to slide forward 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.700
 to facilitate access to places 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.500
 but despite all access to these 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.390
 places is more cumbersome than 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.390
 five-door versions and st 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.840
 the longitudinal space for the legs 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.730
 is suitable with the same dimensions as the 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.890
 5 door like headroom 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.020
 to the roof and there's also a little more 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.970
 space at shoulder height the 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.310
 central plaza is worse than exterior 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.080
 the pressures of three doors enjoy 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.760
 of greater general rigidity and are more 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.010
 safe for children as the 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.810
 rear windows are fixed and not 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.079
 there are back doors that there is danger of 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.079
 April 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.280
 The greater structural rigidity is good 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:30.349
 for stability and in case of 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.599
 accidents but the absence of doors 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:35.389
 backs makes access to 

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:37.729
 the rear seats the trunk 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.889
 offers a load capacity of 380 

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:41.240
 liters the same as in the variant of 5 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.220
 doors 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.139
 the backrest folds with 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.169
 ease and it can be broken down by halves 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:52.810
 asymmetric 60 40 up to provide a 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.810
 maximum load volume of 1,150 liters 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.949
 the propeller of the lion sc proved 

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:00.479
 with four cylinders in line two liters 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.160
 of displacement four valves per 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:05.250
 geometry turbocharger cylinder 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.860
 variable and intercooler power 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:10.560
 maximum is 150 horses and is maintained 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.020
 between 3500 and 4000 revolutions per 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.240
 minute 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.580
 the remarkable maximum thrust torque is 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.590
 maintains between one thousand 753 thousand 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.720
 revolutions per minute that is the zone 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.520
 most commonly used so that 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.229
 you enjoy a good push from very 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.529
 under regime and a remarkable 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.539
 elasticity 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:30.219
 a manual change of six is associated 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:33.099
 marches and the driving force is 

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:36.009
 moves to the front wheels with a 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.989
 weight of one thousand 285 kilograms the car 

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:40.569
 can accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometers 

00:05:37.989 --> 00:05:43.029
 time in 84 seconds and reach a 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:45.209
 maximum speed of 215 kilometers per 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:45.209
 hour 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.960
 the average consumption approved by seat is 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.990
 of 41 liters per 100 kilometers being 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.270
 this test we have measured 63 liters each 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.370
 100 kilometers under real conditions of 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.559
 circulation and at a good pace the consumption is 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:02.069
 still reasonable but far superior to 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.069
 homologated 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:08.970
 the suspension architecture is simple 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.800
 and compact but the set-up of the 

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.330
 tarados allows a compromise between 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.900
 efficiency and running comfort of the 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.000
 best of the segment 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:20.389
 the unit tested had the package 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.310
 of dynamic equipment that costs 657 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:24.830
 euros and includes chassis control 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.560
 adaptive cc and the address 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.850
 progressive or variable relationship in the 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.610
 center console there is a push button 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.650
 identified as mode when pressed is 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.380
 You can choose between three fixed programs 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:38.389
 called normal sport and eco and a 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:41.090
 customizable room named 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.669
 individual when choosing a program the one 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.770
 cc configures the engine response the 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.270
 assistance of the direction the sound of 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.880
 engine and even the color of the 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.810
 ambient lighting that changes to red in 

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.810
 the sport program 

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:13.589
 and the
