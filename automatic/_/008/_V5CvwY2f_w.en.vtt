just<00:00:40.620> right<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.610> think<00:00:42.149> I<00:00:42.239> got<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.420> pretty

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
just right but I think I got it pretty

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.240 
just right but I think I got it pretty
good<00:00:42.809> now<00:00:43.910> also<00:00:44.910> got<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.420> color<00:00:45.719> B<00:00:46.140> shift<00:00:46.950> knob

future<00:02:10.790> things<00:02:11.030> don't<00:02:11.930> think<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.110> really<00:02:12.320> see

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
future things don't think I really see

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.920 
future things don't think I really see
myself<00:02:12.680> doing<00:02:13.010> soon<00:02:13.370> as<00:02:13.550> an<00:02:13.670> exhaust<00:02:14.030> stock

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
myself doing soon as an exhaust stock

one<00:02:15.200> sounds<00:02:15.740> nice<00:02:16.100> but<00:02:16.240> could<00:02:17.240> use<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:17.480> little

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
one sounds nice but could use a little

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.140
