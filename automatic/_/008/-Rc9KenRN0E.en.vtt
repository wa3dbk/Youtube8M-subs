00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 very good in factual youtube located 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.080
 today as a second video I bring you a 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.660
 little the two new vehicles that 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.450
 unlock jce at the end of the last 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.580
 robbery in 7 to 5 you already know playing in 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.960
 play 3 so I'll show you now in 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.539
 a moment on the internet 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.820
 the two new vehicles and that we're going to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.100
 travel and transportation and we have to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.080
 put in legendary and motorcycles and also in 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.789
 the expense that so we're going to legendary 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.029
 and up here you see part of the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.050
 shock update the electro 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.790
 750,000 of the truth that are more 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.489
 pretty expensive vehicles and how are you 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.870
 seeing then it is the final vehicle with the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.969
 that we will have to make the escape in the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.210
 last robbery you also have the box build 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.180
 this 45,000 that is a simple car of 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.190
 pretty simple delivery and then we have 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.410
 around here the Sabbath that costs almost that 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.449
 two million is an asshole that now 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.270
 I will go on to show you first let's see 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.059
 the electro I'm going to tunear I show you the 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.160
 tuned and that I thought was very 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.309
 cool because like in the mission 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.650
 as you can see, you can give that impulse 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.330
 speed squeezing the god tick 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.750
 left so this one 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.760
 and you know, therefore, it does not have a horn 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.710
 agreement and to recharge it you have to leave 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.690
 to accelerate but the bike is quite 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.070
 cool what happens that the price then I 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.680
 the price they have seems 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.840
 so let's see it tuned and so that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 you see a little worth it does not deserve 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.610
 worth the truth that to see me the motorbike 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.440
 I like the three that have gotten 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.270
 the one that I like but the truth that 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.460
 it's a pasture what you have to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.950
 leave in it since you see it a little bit 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.620
 with the love handles and so the color the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.510
 metallic pearly is also very 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.550
 cool with two colors that has color 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.860
 secondary and the truth is that it's cool 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.700
 let's see now if you notice a little the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.760
 no change and the truth is that it's a motorcycle 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:54.780
 that runs worth now I'm going to ask what 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.720
 It would be the one he knows we have to call 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.130
 to pegasus you already know so the test 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.229
 the day mo forgiveness 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.320
 I'm going to call you see a bit how the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:07.619
 motorcycle agreed and now we go to see 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.140
 how the Sabbath works which is the new 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.569
 helicopter that they got also goes out in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.459
 the last mission of agreement 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.650
 How good to me either dislike is 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.420
 cool just because you can see a 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.549
 bit that you can use the turbo 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.230
 Hold on a little bit more 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.180
 speed more power so to speak 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.639
 after the tuning and the truth that is 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.739
 pretty cool it 's very manageable and now 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.180
 finally we have here what would be the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.180
 helicopter the truth that is quite 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.700
 big although the valkyrie has the tail 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.439
 a little bit longer but good 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.079
 it's really cool and as you see behind 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.669
 of the pilot you can sit one what 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.650
 happens that I think it does not let me put 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:46.319
 no vision for you to see but you can 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.849
 go someone on top of the pilot and two on 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.450
 the sides and then it's pretty 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.609
 cool 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.310
 you can also save the wheels thing 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.349
 that gives you as well as a little touch 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.150
 and it's cool to me I like it 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.469
 hiding the wheels is the truth in the 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.569
 Landing gear aircraft is a 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:02.639
 nonsense but I'm cool then you have here 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.290
 can be the pilot can control the 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.599
 contrary to the fact that the Valkyrie almost 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.659
 hit well can control what 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:11.609
 would be rockets guided rockets and 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.829
 also the missiles and the truth that is 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:18.650
 pretty cool are not some vehicles 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.930
 that in the online then the much better 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.299
 the other one that you have to look for according 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.220
 because the truth that the buffer takes longer 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.870
 in throwing it goes slower when reloading me 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.840
 requested then this one is very much 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.939
 better but the truth is that they are vehicles 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.319
 quite affectionate I have seen them like this 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.930
 that nothing I hope you liked the 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.329
 video to unlock them then I'll leave you 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.730
 out there the previous robbery is worth it is 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.439
 the last holdup you spend it costs 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.290
 a little bit and you are going to unblock them 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.900
 also tell you that he also calls 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.120
 lester and commented that I was going to 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.250
 have six robberies in the end I said that 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.889
 not that there were five in the opinion that 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.840
 I'll leave it up on the hastes and 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:01.400
 they said there are not five left but I 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:04.220
 true that I do not know to me it seems to me that it is 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.810
 they really said there were six what 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.930
 they said the page and lester calls you 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.510
 before, maybe after a while like 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.519
 that puts in some more or such I do not know the 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.109
 it's really funny that 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.239
 I will be commenting I hope that I have 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.099
 liked already you know if you give like in 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:23.019
 the comments any question and we 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:23.019
 we see in the next video cha cha
