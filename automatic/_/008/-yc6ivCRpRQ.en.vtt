00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.440
 the wind has been caused by your gloves 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.680

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.760
 I think I think that this jury 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.920
 believe more in yourself than yourself 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.940

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.030

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.080

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:56.430
