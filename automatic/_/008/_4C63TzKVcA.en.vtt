00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:12.260
 it works for us electric boiler 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:17.030
 he was set to temperature 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:21.950
 70 can even put 60 degrees then 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:24.500
 there is if the temperature of the corpses fall 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:29.510
 below 60 degrees collarbone electric boiler 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:33.980
 now we heat up the temperature 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:38.870
 solid fuel boiler here's an aperture 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.470
 now a little over 60 we are almost 70 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:50.379
 degrees now on 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:50.379
 we burn firewood 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.379
 traction 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.200
 the hood will work 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.490
 the hood turns on when triggered 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.640
 smoke detector is generally a little bit 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.450
 automated this whole system here 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.090
 we have relyushki that govern 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.700
 switching on the electric boiler 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.659
 controls the flow of solid and fuel 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.460
 underfloor heating and control the reason for it 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.880
 the pump, that is, the principle of all this 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.880
 controlled via gsm 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:43.619
 SIM card fee can be with 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.780
 phone control the desired temperature 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.390
 there is a temperature sensor in the house 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.920
 well, and accordingly kb, there is no one 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.069
 at home we can be supported in principle 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.959
 maintain the temperature of nations 16 

00:01:56.069 --> 00:01:59.959
 degrees and on arrival 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:09.929
 China 2020 but also controlled from here 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:12.000
 lighting when we leave the house close 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.810
 then the principle automatically turn off 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.280
 outdoor lighting here that is 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.900
 until we leave the house with this 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.110
 perfectly and completely works 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.110
 lighting 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:42.660
 2 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:49.560
 all is conveniently visible we can look at 10 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:52.800
 it's cold here 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:57.360
 goes exelon chick case 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.690
 if the light suddenly disappears of course there will be 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.550
 it is critical to support the movement of the pump 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:07.670
 system because the boiler can boil 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:14.450
 for this we have set such a lexion 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.450
 hooked up to it hooked up 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:23.400
 Radiator floor heating pump and Vlad 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.370
 from an elephant and everything is powered by such 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.960
 car battery 100 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.790
 ampere hours then basically according to calculations 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.780
 the case of the pro if the light disappears to us 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.760
 should on 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:42.360
 two or three hours can 4 grab move 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.190
 heating pumps to give 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.530
 possibility of solid fuel boiler 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:52.490
 extinguish pumps such a floor heating pump 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.490
 baby 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.560
 it's all the same now 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.700
 everything works 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:08.870
 half power zion trick 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.790
 I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that despite 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.190
 the fact that you have two pumps connected to it and 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.660
 water mont he kind of pulled though on hand 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.660
 washing is not only 400 year 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:30.530
 here we are also setting the desired 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:34.070
 temperature and if wanted reaches this 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:37.790
 temperature is covered by the door 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.650
 and a little bit of oxygen and kitten is removed 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.070
 play the fool 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.580
 from how does this tioga go today and when 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.840
 open up accordingly begin 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:56.740
 thrust oxygen appears and start 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:05:00.500
 burn more now wanted give such 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:04.640
 just say 60 degrees 70 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:09.230
 because warm floor is fully on 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:11.200
 all over the first floor plus radiator 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.950
 everything in the whole house in principle 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:20.080
 heated area is obtained order 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:23.740
 probably 200 can 240 230 meters 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.740
 quite a lot 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:30.960
 I think that 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.770
 even if the boiler is now off electro 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.450
 solid fuel handle alone 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.390
 that why I turned off I want a little bit 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:42.180
 faster now heat the boiler indirectly 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.180
 hot water hot 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:51.820
 respectively, and included the vector boiler 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:56.340
 now it is a temperature control sensor 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.340
 at home, that is, if we have a temperature 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:00.220
 boiler and reaches temperature 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.420
 certain 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.420
 that turns on 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.860
 in a big circle 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.889
 water movement and if the boiler is very many 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.260
 so he moves in a small circle 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:22.120
 earned home from either can know 

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:26.540
 him somewhere like this well this this this 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.690
 heat accumulator principle 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:33.940
 the basic idea of installing it was to 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:37.450
 could say for the night download 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:43.060
 fully solid fuel boiler and 

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:45.740
 excess heat transfer to this barrel and 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.810
 after the body goes out well 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.910
 suppose that electric boiler we are not 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.650
 turn on 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:55.100
 solid fuel boiler goes out heat 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:59.620
 will fight already from the prepared 

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.620
 key from heat accumulator 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.040
 somewhere around the way it works
