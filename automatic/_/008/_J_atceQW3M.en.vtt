00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
and I wonder if something good happens

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.150 
and I wonder if something good happens
when<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.420> click<00:00:18.570> on<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.810> button<00:00:18.960> I<00:00:21.980> would<00:00:22.980> say

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.940 

without<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.629> eggs<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.649> wouldn't<00:00:43.920> be

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
without that eggs it wouldn't be

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.500 
without that eggs it wouldn't be
possible<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.550> me<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.700> defeat<00:00:45.059> all<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.360> these

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.220 
possible for me to defeat all of these
zombies<00:00:45.899> so<00:00:46.559> fortunately<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:48.450> knock<00:00:49.079> them

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230

zombies so fortunately I can knock them
high<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.860> all<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.520> my<00:00:50.640> problems<00:00:50.850> are

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
high up and all of my problems are

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:00.020 
high up and all of my problems are
solved<00:00:51.710> isn't<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.739> great<00:00:58.730> the<00:00:59.730> way<00:00:59.850> this

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
solved isn't that great the way this

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.450 
solved isn't that great the way this
works<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.420> fairly<00:01:00.690> simple<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.890> main<00:01:02.070> redstone

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
works is fairly simple the main redstone

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.340 
works is fairly simple the main redstone
contraption<00:01:03.000> consists<00:01:03.719> out<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.930> three<00:01:04.140> parts

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
contraption consists out of three parts

contraption consists out of three parts
the<00:01:05.070> first<00:01:05.220> part<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.970> simple<00:01:06.360> fill<00:01:06.540> clock

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
the first part is a simple fill clock

the first part is a simple fill clock
that<00:01:07.350> replaces<00:01:08.189> all<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.369> these<00:01:08.610> blocks<00:01:08.909> here

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
that replaces all of these blocks here

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.320 
that replaces all of these blocks here
with<00:01:09.689> redstone<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.439> air<00:01:11.400> all<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> time

over<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.400> index<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.880> eight<00:02:18.090> and<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:19.080> main

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
over to the index of eight and the main

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.540
