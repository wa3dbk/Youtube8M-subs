out and this too busy running from
radiator<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:45.219> the<00:00:45.539> chipset<00:00:47.280> block<00:00:48.280> must<00:00:48.489> be

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
radiator to the chipset block must be

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:52.290 
radiator to the chipset block must be
booked<00:00:48.910> till<00:00:49.480> you<00:00:49.539> see<00:00:49.719> it<00:00:49.839> it's<00:00:49.989> not<00:00:50.730> any<00:00:51.730> more

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
booked till you see it it's not any more

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.349 
booked till you see it it's not any more
than<00:00:53.289> actual<00:00:53.620> power<00:00:53.859> cables<00:00:54.460> here<00:00:54.699> so<00:00:54.999> the<00:00:55.210> no

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
than actual power cables here so the no

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.689 
than actual power cables here so the no
issues<00:00:55.780> whatsoever<00:00:55.929> with<00:00:56.920> putting<00:00:57.190> cabling

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
issues whatsoever with putting cabling

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.950 
issues whatsoever with putting cabling
behind<00:01:00.059> they'll<00:01:01.059> had<00:01:01.359> a<00:01:01.390> couple<00:01:01.690> questions

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
behind they'll had a couple questions

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.619 
behind they'll had a couple questions
when<00:01:02.469> people<00:01:02.829> ask<00:01:02.980> actually<00:01:03.460> if<00:01:03.730> i<00:01:03.999> can<00:01:04.269> put

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
when people ask actually if i can put

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.780 
when people ask actually if i can put
half<00:01:05.350> inch<00:01:05.590> tube<00:01:05.860> here<00:01:06.310> exist<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:09.400> i<00:01:09.670> think

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
half inch tube here exist that i think

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.630 
half inch tube here exist that i think
is<00:01:10.240> possible<00:01:10.540> because<00:01:11.170> when<00:01:11.980> you<00:01:12.130> put<00:01:12.400> you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
is possible because when you put you

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.130 
is possible because when you put you
through<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.240> holes<00:01:14.909> again<00:01:15.909> it<00:01:16.570> doesn't<00:01:16.810> take

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
through the holes again it doesn't take

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.749 
through the holes again it doesn't take
more<00:01:17.470> space<00:01:17.890> than<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:20.590> cabling<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:21.280> power<00:01:21.460> k

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
more space than then cabling the power k

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.580 
more space than then cabling the power k
being<00:01:21.970> so<00:01:22.149> it's<00:01:22.329> not<00:01:22.450> that<00:01:22.509> not<00:01:22.899> an<00:01:23.049> issue<00:01:23.200> to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
being so it's not that not an issue to

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.929 
being so it's not that not an issue to
close<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.220> panel<00:01:24.490> without<00:01:25.149> squishing<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:26.140> you

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.149 

you<00:01:30.939> see<00:01:31.149> it's<00:01:31.509> not<00:01:31.600> a<00:01:31.719> problem<00:01:32.140> what<00:01:32.740> I<00:01:32.770> think

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
you see it's not a problem what I think

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.940 
you see it's not a problem what I think
potentially<00:01:33.729> could<00:01:34.360> be<00:01:34.680> more<00:01:35.680> challenging

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
potentially could be more challenging

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.980 
potentially could be more challenging
situation<00:01:36.790> rather<00:01:37.149> than<00:01:37.329> with<00:01:37.600> a<00:01:37.630> smaller

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
situation rather than with a smaller

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.910 
situation rather than with a smaller
tube<00:01:38.289> that<00:01:38.619> you<00:01:38.979> need<00:01:39.219> to<00:01:39.399> bend<00:01:39.869> cubing<00:01:40.869> in<00:01:41.110> on

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
tube that you need to bend cubing in on

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.080 
tube that you need to bend cubing in on
other<00:01:42.340> side<00:01:42.700> of<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.659> tray<00:01:43.899> and<00:01:44.229> neat<00:01:45.090> proper

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
other side of the tray and neat proper

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.649 
other side of the tray and neat proper
and<00:01:46.570> go<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.890> to<00:01:48.520> connect<00:01:48.850> to<00:01:48.969> the<00:01:49.090> fittings<00:01:49.450> and

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
and go to to connect to the fittings and

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.740 
and go to to connect to the fittings and
then<00:01:50.140> you<00:01:50.320> see<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.560> stopped<00:01:50.920> painting<00:01:51.189> more<00:01:51.549> so

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
then you see it stopped painting more so

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.330 
then you see it stopped painting more so
I<00:01:53.369> still<00:01:54.369> sing<00:01:54.700> as<00:01:54.909> possible<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:57.009> its

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
I still sing as possible but is its

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.099 
I still sing as possible but is its
differently<00:01:58.240> will<00:01:58.390> be<00:01:58.539> more<00:01:58.840> challenging

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
differently will be more challenging

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.179 
differently will be more challenging
than<00:01:59.850> putting<00:02:00.850> small<00:02:01.479> tube<00:02:01.810> here<00:02:02.109> which<00:02:02.799> I<00:02:02.950> did

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
than putting small tube here which I did

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.599 
than putting small tube here which I did
and<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:05.140> this<00:02:05.350> house<00:02:05.590> at<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:05.950> kind<00:02:06.189> of<00:02:06.399> the

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:06.609 
and so this house at the kind of the

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.240 
and so this house at the kind of the
computer<00:02:07.600> look<00:02:07.840> like<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.380> I<00:02:08.649> will<00:02:08.860> flip<00:02:09.100> it

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
computer look like and I will flip it

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.940 
computer look like and I will flip it
around<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:09.910> we'll<00:02:10.210> see<00:02:10.539> what<00:02:11.440> I<00:02:11.470> have<00:02:11.710> another

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
around and we'll see what I have another

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.610 
around and we'll see what I have another
side<00:02:12.330> this<00:02:13.330> whole<00:02:13.570> system<00:02:13.930> look<00:02:14.110> like<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.500> have

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
side this whole system look like I have

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.740 
side this whole system look like I have
completed<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.760> from<00:02:16.060> water<00:02:16.300> cooling

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
completed it from water cooling

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.309 
completed it from water cooling
standpoint<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.700> filled<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.820> up<00:02:18.940> no<00:02:19.210> leaks

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319

the<00:03:12.760> system<00:03:13.739> you<00:03:14.739> see<00:03:14.949> this<00:03:15.159> Inlet<00:03:15.969> on<00:03:16.209> the

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:16.359 
the system you see this Inlet on the

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.309 
the system you see this Inlet on the
bottom<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.400> bubbles<00:03:18.400> goes<00:03:19.090> up<00:03:19.389> up<00:03:19.689> up<00:03:19.870> and<00:03:20.260> the

bottom and bubbles goes up up up and the

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.050 
bottom and bubbles goes up up up and the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
expectancy will be heavily stocked by

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.149 
expectancy will be heavily stocked by
the<00:03:22.120> pump<00:03:22.449> but<00:03:22.719> actually<00:03:23.620> it<00:03:23.709> didn't<00:03:24.010> happen

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:24.159

wishes<00:03:28.259> kept<00:03:29.259> bubbles<00:03:29.799> on<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.659> left<00:03:31.659> side<00:03:31.840> of

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
wishes kept bubbles on the left side of

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.289 
wishes kept bubbles on the left side of
the<00:03:32.229> reservoir<00:03:32.349> so<00:03:32.979> the<00:03:33.459> bling<00:03:33.669> process<00:03:34.090> was

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
the reservoir so the bling process was

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.140 
the reservoir so the bling process was
actually<00:03:34.840> faster<00:03:35.199> than<00:03:35.590> I<00:03:35.829> expected<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.909> it

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
actually faster than I expected and it

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.809 
actually faster than I expected and it
was<00:03:37.299> probably<00:03:37.449> even<00:03:37.689> faster<00:03:38.229> which<00:03:38.620> is<00:03:38.799> like<00:03:39.549> a

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
was probably even faster which is like a

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.960 
was probably even faster which is like a
normal<00:03:40.389> set<00:03:40.599> up<00:03:40.780> when<00:03:41.019> you<00:03:41.169> have<00:03:41.919> inlet<00:03:42.669> and

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
normal set up when you have inlet and

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.809 
normal set up when you have inlet and
outlet<00:03:43.650> somewhere<00:03:44.650> here<00:03:45.099> in<00:03:45.129> the<00:03:45.280> bottom<00:03:45.489> from

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
outlet somewhere here in the bottom from

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.929 
outlet somewhere here in the bottom from
both<00:03:46.000> sides<00:03:46.299> so<00:03:46.569> which<00:03:47.040> was<00:03:48.040> was<00:03:48.519> something

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
both sides so which was was something

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:50.520 
both sides so which was was something
that<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.120> didn't<00:03:49.329> expect<00:03:49.659> so<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.079> works<00:03:50.319> very

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
that I didn't expect so it works very

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.210 
that I didn't expect so it works very
well<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:52.019> system<00:03:53.019> fully<00:03:53.229> ready<00:03:53.500> so<00:03:53.949> what<00:03:54.189> I

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
well and system fully ready so what I

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.879 
well and system fully ready so what I
will<00:03:54.370> do<00:03:54.699> I<00:03:54.759> will<00:03:55.000> put<00:03:55.959> more<00:03:56.139> into<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:56.769> all

that UV reactive unfortunately chimera
is<00:05:30.110> making<00:05:30.860> stuff<00:05:32.020> brighter<00:05:33.020> than<00:05:33.320> a<00:05:33.380> Taser

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
up more than it is it's much more subtle

up more than it is it's much more subtle
look<00:05:49.940> and<00:05:51.639> looks<00:05:52.639> nice<00:05:52.880> in<00:05:53.090> a<00:05:53.210> real<00:05:53.389> life
