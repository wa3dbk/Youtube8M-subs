00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.100 
use the spine of the knife let's turn
them<00:02:17.790> over<00:02:17.880> this<00:02:18.120> time<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.720> they<00:02:18.810> don't<00:02:18.960> move

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
them over this time so they don't move

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.130 
them over this time so they don't move
as<00:02:19.290> much<00:02:21.830> little<00:02:22.830> rocking<00:02:23.340> motion<00:02:23.930> those<00:02:24.930> are

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
as much little rocking motion those are

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.050 
as much little rocking motion those are
coming<00:02:25.350> out<00:02:25.470> more<00:02:25.740> uniform<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.490> guess<00:02:26.700> we

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
coming out more uniform I guess we
