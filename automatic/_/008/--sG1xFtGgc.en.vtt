00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.070
 get yourself an elastic steel wire 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 semi-rigid differential beads and 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.949
 hard stones at your leisure a 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.759
 ring a pliers and a hook 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.640
 Start by taking the steel wire 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.340
 semi rigid elastic and put on i 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.559
 materials you prefer can be 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.410
 beads or hard stones of various kinds e 

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:37.160
 color or even more or less differentials 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.160
 that worked 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.929
 using the pliers bend one of the 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:35.450
 end of the wire to form a 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.119
 ring in this way you will have achieved 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.649
 two purposes is to achieve one 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.200
 part of bracelet closure 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.709
 both to stop the materials 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.709
 included 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.020
 then continue to thread beads and 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.090
 stones until you have reached the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.510
 length needed to close the 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.510
 bracelet 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.980
 now there is no need to cultivate the mechanism 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.050
 of closing 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.660
 therefore thread the ends of the wire 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.570
 free a hook that you will stop 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.490
 by closing the wire with the pliers the hook 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.990
 he will then go into the small hole 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.680
 from the other end closing the 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.330
 bracelet as the last step you make 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.600
 then the proof of the operation of the 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.600
 closing 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.020
 we remind you that to accomplish this 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.230
 bracelet are not necessary 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:37.790
 very elaborate materials or tools 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.310
 an elastic steel wire is enough 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.170
 semi-rigid beads and semiprecious stones one 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.170
 pliers a hook is a little lamb
