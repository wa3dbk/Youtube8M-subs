00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 very good guys who are such a 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.649
 new video more for the channel that such 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.809
 I am 618 we are again in gt5 online 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.980
 as usual in the channel and 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.809
 today we are going to talk about something that has 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.639
 I have been quite impressed by the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.460
 last weeks and he's been giving me 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.310
 Turning my head seriously I wanted to talk 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.650
 about babies is my question is still 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.039
 there are the dns is for those who do not know 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.349
 which means dns the dns will be about 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.820
 types of codes that were placed or that 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.980
 there are some codes that were placed in 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.170
 our internet network configuration 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.550
 obviously from our console by 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.340
 example if we have the request 3 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.559
 we could include in that place you are 5 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.960
 online and that here the 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.149
 dns is a lot of obviously ask a 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.120
 Once you had these dns placed on 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.719
 enter 5 cards online or it happened 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.879
 that then the values ​​of for example 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.190
 of several things increased for example 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.829
 the money or you kill a person and when 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.260
 kill them more instead of giving you ten 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.879
 dollars gave you a million not the money 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.979
 which vote is for example little things two 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.590
 million three million for killing a 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.630
 simple person 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.850
 blog you played a race with the 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.920
 right exposed in the obviously hey 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.609
 and when finished the race you give 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.979
 account that earns more 80,000 of erp 80 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:22.130
 million rpp one thing but rise from 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.189
 level 6 up to level 80 during the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.289
 career and playing the only one was the boom of 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.780
 jeta 5 was the dns in those times 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.310
 obviously, youtuber bar, they were going up 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.709
 it also went up but it was very very 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.810
 small so nobody knew me but

 continue to exist this is my great 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.929

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.739
 subscribe if you are new because there 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.140
 a lot of daily content of gt5 online 

00:02:03.739 --> 00:02:08.299
 we started a few days ago I was 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.709
 obviously going through the page 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.180
 main from youtube I got into 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.819
 recommended and I realized that I saw a 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.760
 video that seemed recommended to me 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.099
 it was a Brazilian channel that said that 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.060
 gave tenés is for all the consoles I 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.819
 I really said there are still the 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.200
 dns for jeta 5 online even said that 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.270
 he gave them for the good and for the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.980
 annexation 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.560
 I could not believe that because obviously 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.140
 and for me the next ones is I did not exist 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.270
 that is my question is my doubt continue 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.550
 existing the dns is that people no longer 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.170
 he wants to show them as an excess 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.720
 someone explain to me the sane that a 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.760
 time I used the dns is in the hear in 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.490
 the playstation 3 ok i got the dns is me 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.860
 I went up and up in level 10 up to level 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.840
 100 of a single water race alone 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.340
 and I was not worth most people 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.960
 they were not peronas way and rockstar is 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.700
 putting a hard hand with banners like this 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.100
 that you have to be very careful is the 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.340
 big question is the dns follow 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.130
 existing or no longer exists not because this 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.170
 Brazilian channel I seriously got into a 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.400
 doubt that the truth I never thought I was going to 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.650
 to be thinking so many times and giving 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.080
 turn your head over if months 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.170
 they continue to exist that DNA is 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.660
 exist right now would be crazy not 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.880
 because all the people would have millions and 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.100
 would level up very fast and it would be 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.080
 well it would not be so legal but seriously 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.210
 it would be a boom would still be a 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.370
 online auto boomerang that's what 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.110
 have it very clear so I do not want anything 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.450
 that you comment to me down in the box 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.270

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.410
 in sanction believe that there are the dns or 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.120

 I had to talk about this topic because 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:04.069
 the truth really catches my attention 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.599
 the last days I was thinking 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.760
 very much about this after this 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.250
 Brazilian channel called me a lot the 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.380
 doubt because now I have searched for that channel and 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:15.470
 no longer exists has disappeared is a little 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.479
