Daniel Sauter they've used a collection
of<00:00:17.960> tactical<00:00:18.470> flashlights<00:00:19.099> to<00:00:19.400> create<00:00:19.670> a<00:00:19.700> very

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
of tactical flashlights to create a very

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.600 
of tactical flashlights to create a very
low<00:00:20.180> resolution<00:00:20.869> projection<00:00:21.439> screen<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:22.220> on

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
low resolution projection screen so on

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.670 
low resolution projection screen so on
the<00:00:23.060> wall<00:00:23.240> you're<00:00:23.480> seeing<00:00:23.779> these<00:00:23.990> 96

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
the wall you're seeing these 96

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.470 
the wall you're seeing these 96
flashlights<00:00:25.340> each<00:00:25.550> one<00:00:25.760> is<00:00:25.910> a<00:00:25.940> point<00:00:26.210> of<00:00:26.300> light

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
flashlights each one is a point of light

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.740 
flashlights each one is a point of light
that's<00:00:27.170> a<00:00:27.529> very<00:00:27.770> low<00:00:28.160> resolution<00:00:28.760> version<00:00:29.660> of

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
that's a very low resolution version of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.300 
that's a very low resolution version of
what's<00:00:29.960> on<00:00:30.109> the<00:00:30.230> screen<00:00:30.439> over<00:00:30.859> here<00:00:30.890> and

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
what's on the screen over here and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.640 
what's on the screen over here and
they're<00:00:32.269> very<00:00:32.330> much<00:00:32.629> interested<00:00:32.900> in<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.290> idea

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
they're very much interested in the idea

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.549 
they're very much interested in the idea
of<00:00:33.949> surveillance<00:00:34.760> and<00:00:35.230> low<00:00:36.230> quality

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
of surveillance and low quality

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.400 
of surveillance and low quality
information<00:00:37.010> that's<00:00:37.550> behind<00:00:37.850> a<00:00:38.059> lot<00:00:38.239> of

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
information that's behind a lot of

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.930 
information that's behind a lot of
semi-automated<00:00:39.410> decisions<00:00:40.370> that<00:00:40.610> are

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
semi-automated decisions that are

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.510 
semi-automated decisions that are
happening<00:00:41.239> in<00:00:41.600> terms<00:00:41.840> of<00:00:41.989> military<00:00:42.170> and<00:00:42.829> other

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
happening in terms of military and other

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.819 
happening in terms of military and other
kinds<00:00:43.910> of<00:00:44.000> you<00:00:44.570> know<00:00:44.690> group<00:00:44.989> management<00:00:45.410> or

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
kinds of you know group management or

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.130 
kinds of you know group management or
crowd<00:00:46.460> control<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.510> if<00:00:47.750> you<00:00:47.899> think<00:00:48.079> about

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
crowd control so if you think about

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.470 
crowd control so if you think about
something<00:00:48.500> like<00:00:48.590> a<00:00:48.710> drone<00:00:49.040> strike<00:00:49.329> we've<00:00:50.329> all

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
something like a drone strike we've all

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.780 
something like a drone strike we've all
seen<00:00:50.719> those<00:00:50.960> video<00:00:51.320> images<00:00:51.829> that<00:00:52.489> come<00:00:52.670> from

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
seen those video images that come from

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.700 
seen those video images that come from
the<00:00:52.940> airplanes<00:00:53.360> are<00:00:53.540> very<00:00:53.690> very<00:00:54.050> grainy<00:00:54.379> very

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
the airplanes are very very grainy very

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.170 
the airplanes are very very grainy very
limited<00:00:55.039> information<00:00:55.250> but<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:55.940> know<00:00:56.030> we're

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180 
limited information but you know we're

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.029 
limited information but you know we're
making<00:00:56.480> life-and-death<00:00:56.780> decisions<00:00:57.559> based<00:00:57.800> on

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
making life-and-death decisions based on

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.250 
making life-and-death decisions based on
that<00:00:58.219> limited<00:00:58.670> information<00:00:58.910> so<00:00:59.510> they<00:01:00.050> have<00:01:00.230> a

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
that limited information so they have a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.229 
that limited information so they have a
dancer<00:01:00.710> performing<00:01:01.340> what<00:01:01.610> she<00:01:01.940> was<00:01:02.030> basically

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
dancer performing what she was basically

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.650 
dancer performing what she was basically
instructed<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.719> perform<00:01:04.660> suspicious

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
instructed to perform suspicious

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.680 
instructed to perform suspicious
movements<00:01:06.200> these<00:01:06.440> asymmetrical<00:01:07.690> suspicious

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
movements these asymmetrical suspicious

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.850 
movements these asymmetrical suspicious
movements<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.259> that's<00:01:09.380> what's<00:01:09.560> then<00:01:09.680> being

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
movements and that's what's then being

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.609 
movements and that's what's then being
projected<00:01:10.100> on<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.550> screen<00:01:11.170> that<00:01:12.170> it's

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
projected on the screen that it's

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.440 
projected on the screen that it's
interesting<00:01:12.920> that<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.760> flashlights<00:01:14.330> that

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
interesting that the flashlights that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.510 
interesting that the flashlights that
are<00:01:14.659> there<00:01:14.810> all<00:01:15.049> Smith<00:01:15.500> &amp;<00:01:15.680> Wesson<00:01:15.979> flashlights

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
are there all Smith &amp; Wesson flashlights

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.250 
are there all Smith &amp; Wesson flashlights
a<00:01:16.700> nice<00:01:16.850> nice<00:01:17.180> little<00:01:17.210> detail<00:01:17.780> if<00:01:17.930> they<00:01:18.020> get<00:01:18.140> in

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
a nice nice little detail if they get in

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.240 
a nice nice little detail if they get in
there<00:01:19.750> where<00:01:20.750> to<00:01:20.930> next<00:01:21.110> we'll<00:01:22.010> talk<00:01:22.130> about

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
there where to next we'll talk about

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.240 
there where to next we'll talk about
this<00:01:22.460> piece<00:01:23.860> stratocaster<00:01:24.860> is<00:01:24.979> right<00:01:25.130> next

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
this piece stratocaster is right next

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.920 
this piece stratocaster is right next
door<00:01:26.470> the<00:01:27.470> artist<00:01:27.770> joseph<00:01:28.159> barbera<00:01:28.689> if<00:01:29.689> the

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
door the artist joseph barbera if the

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.800 
door the artist joseph barbera if the
Second<00:01:30.770> Life<00:01:31.030> interface<00:01:32.030> but<00:01:32.509> the

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
Second Life interface but the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.929 
Second Life interface but the
navigational<00:01:33.740> tool<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:34.250> actually<00:01:34.909> a

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
navigational tool is actually a

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.289 
navigational tool is actually a
wheelchair<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.659> so<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.439> kind<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:36.830> if<00:01:37.400> you<00:01:37.610> know

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
wheelchair and so it kind of if you know

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.760 
wheelchair and so it kind of if you know
much<00:01:38.450> about<00:01:38.630> second<00:01:39.079> life<00:01:39.110> and<00:01:39.409> if<00:01:39.470> you<00:01:39.560> watch

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
much about second life and if you watch

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.830 
much about second life and if you watch
people<00:01:40.549> tend<00:01:40.759> to<00:01:40.820> have<00:01:41.000> these<00:01:41.270> these

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
people tend to have these these

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.980 
people tend to have these these
glorified<00:01:42.520> avatars<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:43.850> you<00:01:44.420> know<00:01:44.540> seen<00:01:44.960> a

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
glorified avatars and you know seen a

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.230 
glorified avatars and you know seen a
lot<00:01:45.200> of<00:01:45.229> people<00:01:45.560> who<00:01:45.740> have<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:47.030> know<00:01:47.090> they

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
lot of people who have you know they

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.300 
lot of people who have you know they
sort<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.509> take<00:01:47.659> on<00:01:47.689> this<00:01:48.049> idealized<00:01:48.619> persona

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
sort of take on this idealized persona

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.160 
sort of take on this idealized persona
and<00:01:49.670> in<00:01:50.119> this<00:01:50.210> case<00:01:50.390> it's<00:01:50.659> actually<00:01:50.960> kind<00:01:51.140> of

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
and in this case it's actually kind of

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.510 
and in this case it's actually kind of
gone<00:01:51.350> in<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.590> other<00:01:51.710> direction<00:01:51.890> so<00:01:52.369> you're

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
gone in the other direction so you're

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.969 
gone in the other direction so you're
sort<00:01:52.700> of<00:01:52.729> forced<00:01:53.090> into<00:01:53.390> an<00:01:53.720> uncommon<00:01:54.530> and

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
sort of forced into an uncommon and

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.780 
sort of forced into an uncommon and
often<00:01:55.369> you<00:01:56.180> know<00:01:56.320> what<00:01:57.320> is<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.500> reduced<00:01:58.250> social

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
often you know what is a reduced social

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.370 
often you know what is a reduced social
position<00:01:59.210> in<00:01:59.329> our<00:01:59.450> society<00:01:59.930> in<00:02:00.110> a<00:02:00.170> wheelchair

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
position in our society in a wheelchair

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.050 
position in our society in a wheelchair
and<00:02:00.649> that's<00:02:00.920> your<00:02:01.040> navigational<00:02:01.640> tool<00:02:01.850> in

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
and that's your navigational tool in

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.260 
and that's your navigational tool in
second<00:02:02.420> life<00:02:03.100> he's<00:02:04.100> brought<00:02:04.700> in<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:05.000> bunch<00:02:05.030> of

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
second life he's brought in a bunch of

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.139 
second life he's brought in a bunch of
imagery<00:02:05.630> so<00:02:06.049> the<00:02:06.259> environment<00:02:06.829> is<00:02:07.040> as<00:02:07.700> he

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
imagery so the environment is as he

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.490 
imagery so the environment is as he

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
your hand in a black box and you know

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.250 
your hand in a black box and you know
you're<00:02:56.180> probably<00:02:56.450> just<00:02:56.630> interacting<00:02:57.110> with

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
you're probably just interacting with

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.230 
you're probably just interacting with
lime<00:02:57.470> jell-o<00:02:57.800> but<00:02:58.130> in<00:02:58.310> this<00:02:58.670> case<00:02:58.850> you<00:02:59.060> have<00:02:59.090> a

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
lime jell-o but in this case you have a

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.770 
lime jell-o but in this case you have a
kind<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.100> it's<00:03:01.100> a<00:03:01.250> urethane<00:03:01.760> cast<00:03:02.270> of<00:03:02.570> body

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
kind of it's a urethane cast of body

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.450 
kind of it's a urethane cast of body
parts<00:03:03.050> so<00:03:03.350> if<00:03:03.470> you<00:03:03.590> look<00:03:03.770> in<00:03:03.950> there<00:03:04.130> you'll<00:03:04.280> see

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
parts so if you look in there you'll see

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.420 
parts so if you look in there you'll see
noses<00:03:05.030> and<00:03:05.180> ears<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.720> fingers<00:03:05.870> and<00:03:06.430> nothing

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
noses and ears and fingers and nothing

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.130 
noses and ears and fingers and nothing
nothing<00:03:08.090> dirty<00:03:08.270> but<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.630> know<00:03:08.720> its<00:03:08.870> body

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
nothing dirty but you know its body

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.110 
nothing dirty but you know its body
parts<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.100> as<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.340> feel<00:03:10.550> your<00:03:10.730> way<00:03:10.940> around

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
parts and so as you feel your way around

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.330 
parts and so as you feel your way around
this<00:03:11.540> interface<00:03:12.050> your<00:03:12.740> touch<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.010> then

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
this interface your touch is then

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.520 
this interface your touch is then
actually<00:03:13.730> erasing<00:03:14.300> layers<00:03:15.020> of<00:03:15.290> information

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
actually erasing layers of information

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.710 
actually erasing layers of information
on<00:03:15.980> the<00:03:16.100> screen<00:03:16.460> and<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:16.910> you're<00:03:17.540> basically

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
on the screen and so you're basically

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.560 
on the screen and so you're basically
creating<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.710> modifying<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.490> image<00:03:19.790> as<00:03:20.000> you

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
creating and modifying the image as you

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.060 
creating and modifying the image as you
work<00:03:20.780> through<00:03:20.810> but<00:03:21.320> there's<00:03:21.740> a<00:03:21.800> bit<00:03:21.950> of<00:03:21.980> a

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
work through but there's a bit of a

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.040 
work through but there's a bit of a
disconnect<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.760> for<00:03:23.480> the<00:03:23.570> artist<00:03:23.870> that's

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
disconnect and for the artist that's

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.660 
disconnect and for the artist that's
intentional<00:03:24.410> so<00:03:24.830> there<00:03:24.950> is<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.070> no<00:03:25.250> it's<00:03:25.430> not<00:03:25.640> a

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
intentional so there is a no it's not a

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.250 
intentional so there is a no it's not a
one-to-one<00:03:26.060> interface<00:03:26.660> you<00:03:26.810> know<00:03:26.870> just<00:03:27.050> touch

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
one-to-one interface you know just touch

on the 3d glasses and you sort of step

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.690 
on the 3d glasses and you sort of step
into<00:04:06.780> this<00:04:06.900> surreal<00:04:07.350> environment<00:04:07.590> of<00:04:08.130> a<00:04:08.220> beach

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.870 
into this surreal environment of a beach
scene<00:04:08.970> with<00:04:09.210> these<00:04:09.360> strange<00:04:10.200> creatures<00:04:10.880> but

scene with these strange creatures but
you<00:04:11.970> have<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.240> navigational<00:04:12.900> tool<00:04:13.080> which<00:04:13.230> is

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
you have this navigational tool which is

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.410 
you have this navigational tool which is
an<00:04:13.530> old<00:04:13.680> holga<00:04:14.100> camera<00:04:14.130> so<00:04:14.760> as<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:14.940> as<00:04:15.360> you

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
an old holga camera so as you as you

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.060 
an old holga camera so as you as you
point<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.870> camera<00:04:15.900> in<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.440> environment<00:04:16.739> and

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
point the camera in the environment and

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.610 
point the camera in the environment and
take<00:04:17.820> a<00:04:17.850> picture<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.690> then<00:04:18.930> sort<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.260> pushes

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
take a picture that then sort of pushes

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.410 
take a picture that then sort of pushes
the<00:04:19.739> environment<00:04:20.280> out<00:04:20.430> into<00:04:20.790> the<00:04:20.910> scene<00:04:21.150> so

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
the environment out into the scene so

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.180 
the environment out into the scene so
it's<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.630> sort<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:21.870> your<00:04:22.590> sort<00:04:22.740> of<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.860> visual

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
it's a sort of your sort of a visual

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.240 
it's a sort of your sort of a visual
tourist<00:04:23.640> in<00:04:23.820> this<00:04:23.970> 3d<00:04:24.360> environment<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.250> as

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
tourist in this 3d environment and as

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.190 
tourist in this 3d environment and as
you<00:04:26.490> point<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:26.910> shoot<00:04:27.120> then<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.510> direct<00:04:27.870> the

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
you point and shoot then you direct the

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.660 
you point and shoot then you direct the
environment<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:28.860> then<00:04:29.040> different<00:04:29.490> things

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
environment and then different things

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.010 
environment and then different things
will<00:04:29.790> start<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.030> happen<00:04:30.240> and<00:04:30.510> unfold<00:04:30.810> very

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
will start to happen and unfold very

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.080 
will start to happen and unfold very
much<00:04:31.170> an<00:04:31.290> experiential<00:04:31.800> thing<00:04:32.160> kind<00:04:32.850> of<00:04:32.940> hard

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
much an experiential thing kind of hard

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.700 
much an experiential thing kind of hard
to<00:04:33.150> explain<00:04:33.480> but<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.930> know<00:04:34.020> definitely<00:04:34.380> take

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
to explain but you know definitely take

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.510 
to explain but you know definitely take
a<00:04:34.740> look<00:04:35.010> I<00:04:36.440> think<00:04:37.440> that<00:04:37.950> we've<00:04:38.160> just<00:04:38.370> done<00:04:38.490> a

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
a look I think that we've just done a

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.040 
a look I think that we've just done a
full<00:04:38.790> round<00:04:38.970> I<00:04:39.180> think<00:04:39.360> we've<00:04:39.450> skipped<00:04:39.660> over<00:04:39.840> a

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
full round I think we've skipped over a

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.480 
full round I think we've skipped over a
couple<00:04:40.380> of<00:04:40.470> pieces<00:04:40.650> but<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:41.310> know<00:04:41.370> I<00:04:41.430> just

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
couple of pieces but you know I just

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.470 
couple of pieces but you know I just
kind<00:04:41.730> of<00:04:41.760> wanted<00:04:41.970> to<00:04:42.060> give<00:04:42.180> you<00:04:42.270> a<00:04:42.330> quick

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
kind of wanted to give you a quick

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.180 
kind of wanted to give you a quick
introduction<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.200> some<00:04:43.350> of<00:04:43.380> the<00:04:43.500> work<00:04:43.650> I'm

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
introduction to some of the work I'm

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.860 
introduction to some of the work I'm
more<00:04:44.430> than<00:04:44.550> happy<00:04:44.730> to<00:04:44.910> answer<00:04:45.090> questions<00:04:45.210> and

more than happy to answer questions and

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.930 
more than happy to answer questions and
like<00:04:46.200> I<00:04:46.320> said<00:04:46.380> most<00:04:46.890> of<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.160> artists<00:04:47.580> are<00:04:47.730> here

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
like I said most of the artists are here

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.100 
like I said most of the artists are here
oh<00:04:48.150> this<00:04:48.960> one<00:04:49.170> okay<00:04:49.890> this<00:04:50.580> piece<00:04:50.880> we<00:04:51.810> have<00:04:51.960> in

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
oh this one okay this piece we have in

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.560 
oh this one okay this piece we have in
here<00:04:52.230> only<00:04:52.440> in<00:04:52.650> video<00:04:52.919> form<00:04:53.570> unfortunately

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.570 
here only in video form unfortunately

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.659 
here only in video form unfortunately
when<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:54.990> came<00:04:55.110> down<00:04:55.140> to<00:04:55.500> it<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:56.310> physical

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
when it came down to it the the physical

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.400 
when it came down to it the the physical
work<00:04:56.820> wasn't<00:04:57.060> able<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.360> make<00:04:57.510> it<00:04:57.660> but<00:04:57.930> it's

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
work wasn't able to make it but it's

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.840 
work wasn't able to make it but it's
called<00:04:58.590> sampling<00:04:58.950> plum<00:04:59.310> and<00:05:00.320> it's<00:05:01.320> this<00:05:01.850> very

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
called sampling plum and it's this very

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.420 
called sampling plum and it's this very
bizarre<00:05:03.060> interface<00:05:03.810> but<00:05:04.230> it<00:05:04.470> what<00:05:05.190> I<00:05:05.220> like

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
bizarre interface but it what I like

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.000 
bizarre interface but it what I like
about<00:05:05.460> is<00:05:05.820> it<00:05:06.000> has<00:05:06.390> a<00:05:06.419> you<00:05:07.110> know<00:05:07.230> that<00:05:07.560> classic

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
about is it has a you know that classic

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.890 
about is it has a you know that classic
hand<00:05:08.340> as<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.669> navigational<00:05:09.270> tool<00:05:09.480> but<00:05:09.690> it's<00:05:09.840> a

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
hand as the navigational tool but it's a

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.500 
hand as the navigational tool but it's a
projection<00:05:10.320> on<00:05:10.680> a<00:05:10.740> bunch<00:05:11.370> of<00:05:11.550> these<00:05:12.000> whizzing

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
projection on a bunch of these whizzing

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.810 
projection on a bunch of these whizzing
gizmos<00:05:13.470> so<00:05:13.710> it<00:05:13.830> has<00:05:13.860> this<00:05:14.100> very<00:05:14.280> high-tech

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
gizmos so it has this very high-tech

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.970 
gizmos so it has this very high-tech
low-tech<00:05:15.060> feel<00:05:15.630> you<00:05:16.530> know<00:05:16.620> there's<00:05:16.800> things

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
low-tech feel you know there's things

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.800 
low-tech feel you know there's things
inflating<00:05:17.730> and<00:05:17.940> things<00:05:18.210> whirring<00:05:18.660> and

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
inflating and things whirring and

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.740 
inflating and things whirring and
buzzing<00:05:19.280> so<00:05:20.280> but<00:05:20.640> it<00:05:20.730> has<00:05:20.910> this<00:05:21.180> you<00:05:21.630> know

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
buzzing so but it has this you know

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.110 
buzzing so but it has this you know
using<00:05:21.990> that<00:05:22.200> mouse<00:05:22.500> interface<00:05:23.100> but<00:05:23.730> with<00:05:23.910> it

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
using that mouse interface but with it

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.880 
using that mouse interface but with it
with<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.390> physical<00:05:24.660> environment<00:05:25.470> I<00:05:25.590> think

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
with a physical environment I think

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.140 
with a physical environment I think
we're<00:05:26.010> used<00:05:26.160> to<00:05:26.280> seeing<00:05:26.520> that<00:05:26.730> just<00:05:26.790> kind<00:05:27.120> of

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
we're used to seeing that just kind of

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.909 
we're used to seeing that just kind of
on<00:05:27.330> a<00:05:27.360> screen<00:05:27.750> but<00:05:28.290> here<00:05:28.500> you're<00:05:28.650> sort<00:05:28.860> of

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
on a screen but here you're sort of

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:31.460 
on a screen but here you're sort of
mousing<00:05:29.400> over<00:05:29.520> these<00:05:30.270> toys<00:05:30.570> and<00:05:30.870> objects<00:05:31.260> and

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
mousing over these toys and objects and

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.440 
mousing over these toys and objects and
kind<00:05:32.040> of<00:05:32.070> selectively<00:05:32.640> activating<00:05:33.360> the

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
kind of selectively activating the

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.780 
kind of selectively activating the
sculpture<00:05:33.900> a<00:05:34.050> little<00:05:34.530> piece<00:05:34.680> at<00:05:34.830> a<00:05:34.860> time

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790
