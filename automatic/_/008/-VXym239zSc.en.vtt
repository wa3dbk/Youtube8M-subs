00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
that little spider web they do exactly

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.700 
that little spider web they do exactly
what<00:00:37.059> you<00:00:37.210> would<00:00:37.329> think<00:00:37.539> they<00:00:37.809> slow<00:00:38.170> down<00:00:38.200> your

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
what you would think they slow down your

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.100 
what you would think they slow down your
opponent<00:00:39.250> so<00:00:39.850> I'll<00:00:39.969> get<00:00:40.120> into<00:00:40.239> a<00:00:40.300> few<00:00:40.570> uses<00:00:40.870> of

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
opponent so I'll get into a few uses of

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.479 
opponent so I'll get into a few uses of
that<00:00:41.140> little<00:00:41.590> later<00:00:41.710> on<00:00:41.800> but<00:00:41.949> let's<00:00:42.340> get

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
that little later on but let's get

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.160 
that little later on but let's get
started<00:00:42.879> with<00:00:43.090> the<00:00:43.210> weapon<00:00:43.480> itself<00:00:43.810> and<00:00:44.079> the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
started with the weapon itself and the

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.830 
started with the weapon itself and the
statue<00:00:44.410> acquired<00:00:44.800> so<00:00:45.700> this<00:00:46.090> weapon<00:00:46.450> requires

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
statue acquired so this weapon requires

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.560 
statue acquired so this weapon requires
10<00:00:47.260> strength<00:00:47.620> and<00:00:47.860> 25<00:00:48.310> dexterity<00:00:49.000> in<00:00:49.180> order<00:00:49.420> to

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
10 strength and 25 dexterity in order to

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.139 
10 strength and 25 dexterity in order to
wield<00:00:49.870> it<00:00:50.050> it<00:00:50.649> has<00:00:50.800> an<00:00:50.980> e<00:00:51.160> scaling<00:00:51.610> in<00:00:51.760> strength

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
wield it it has an e scaling in strength

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.970 
wield it it has an e scaling in strength
and<00:00:52.329> an<00:00:52.480> A<00:00:52.660> in<00:00:52.930> dexterity<00:00:53.500> so<00:00:53.649> it's<00:00:53.800> pretty

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
and an A in dexterity so it's pretty

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.220 
and an A in dexterity so it's pretty
much<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.220> typical<00:00:54.460> curved<00:00:55.420> sword<00:00:55.750> weapon<00:00:56.079> as

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 
much a typical curved sword weapon as

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.530 
much a typical curved sword weapon as
far<00:00:56.440> as<00:00:56.530> that's<00:00:56.649> concerned<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.970> physical

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
far as that's concerned the physical

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.410 
far as that's concerned the physical
base<00:00:58.750> damage<00:00:59.170> on<00:00:59.350> this<00:00:59.470> weapon<00:00:59.680> is<00:01:00.180> 210<00:01:01.180> and

the<00:01:02.079> attack<00:01:02.320> rating<00:01:02.620> on<00:01:02.829> this<00:01:03.010> weapon<00:01:03.160> is<00:01:03.659> 340

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
the attack rating on this weapon is 340

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.270 
the attack rating on this weapon is 340
while<00:01:04.899> I'm<00:01:05.019> wearing<00:01:05.320> a<00:01:05.409> ring<00:01:05.590> of<00:01:05.680> blades<00:01:05.950> plus

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
while I'm wearing a ring of blades plus

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.300 
while I'm wearing a ring of blades plus
to<00:01:06.549> keep<00:01:07.360> in<00:01:07.509> mind<00:01:07.659> I<00:01:07.869> am<00:01:07.899> on<00:01:08.200> a<00:01:08.229> 40<00:01:08.590> 40<00:01:08.890> quality

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
to keep in mind I am on a 40 40 quality

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.010 
to keep in mind I am on a 40 40 quality
build<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.759> without<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:10.570> ring<00:01:10.689> of<00:01:10.810> blades

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
build and without the ring of blades

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.520 
build and without the ring of blades
plus<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.740> attack<00:01:12.009> writing<00:01:12.460> would<00:01:12.939> be<00:01:13.530> 290

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
plus to the attack writing would be 290

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.739 
plus to the attack writing would be 290
so<00:01:15.100> that's<00:01:15.280> really<00:01:15.490> not<00:01:15.759> too<00:01:16.060> high<00:01:16.270> but<00:01:16.299> again

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:16.749 
so that's really not too high but again

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:19.050 
so that's really not too high but again
it<00:01:17.200> is<00:01:17.259> a<00:01:17.530> curved<00:01:18.009> sword<00:01:18.219> so<00:01:18.579> that<00:01:18.609> should<00:01:18.969> be

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
it is a curved sword so that should be

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.330 
it is a curved sword so that should be
around<00:01:19.359> what<00:01:19.539> you<00:01:19.659> expect<00:01:20.139> the<00:01:20.979> counter

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
around what you expect the counter

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.639 
around what you expect the counter
damage<00:01:21.639> on<00:01:21.759> this<00:01:21.909> weapon<00:01:22.119> is<00:01:22.539> 200<00:01:23.289> and<00:01:23.350> weight

damage on this weapon is 200 and weight
now<00:01:23.859> at<00:01:24.689> 110<00:01:25.689> not<00:01:25.899> 210<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:27.189> poise<00:01:27.399> damage<00:01:28.060> on

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
now at 110 not 210 the poise damage on

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.899 
now at 110 not 210 the poise damage on
this<00:01:28.359> weapon<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.810> 10<00:01:29.259> per<00:01:29.799> hit<00:01:30.039> and<00:01:30.219> the<00:01:30.729> weight

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
this weapon is 10 per hit and the weight

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.760 
this weapon is 10 per hit and the weight
this<00:01:31.119> is<00:01:31.270> where<00:01:31.420> I<00:01:31.450> got<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.810> number<00:01:32.020> 2<00:01:32.170> from<00:01:32.439> is

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
this is where I got the number 2 from is

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.870 
this is where I got the number 2 from is
the<00:01:33.729> weight<00:01:33.880> is<00:01:34.029> 2<00:01:34.359> units<00:01:34.749> so<00:01:35.109> that<00:01:35.399> is<00:01:36.399> pretty

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
the weight is 2 units so that is pretty

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.309 
the weight is 2 units so that is pretty
decent<00:01:37.060> it's<00:01:37.359> a<00:01:37.479> curved<00:01:37.719> sword<00:01:37.899> though<00:01:38.109> so<00:01:38.289> I

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
decent it's a curved sword though so I

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.599 
decent it's a curved sword though so I
mean<00:01:38.619> it's<00:01:38.799> exactly<00:01:38.950> what<00:01:39.399> you<00:01:39.459> would<00:01:39.549> expect

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
mean it's exactly what you would expect

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.499 
mean it's exactly what you would expect
and<00:01:40.090> that<00:01:40.450> well<00:01:40.869> in<00:01:41.079> that<00:01:41.409> respect<00:01:41.799> so<00:01:42.509> overall

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
and that well in that respect so overall

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.120 
and that well in that respect so overall
it's<00:01:43.959> got<00:01:44.499> a<00:01:44.859> pretty<00:01:45.579> basic<00:01:46.709> amount<00:01:47.709> of<00:01:47.829> stuff

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
it's got a pretty basic amount of stuff

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.580 
it's got a pretty basic amount of stuff
it's<00:01:48.340> nothing<00:01:48.609> really<00:01:48.759> too<00:01:49.029> complicated

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
it's nothing really too complicated

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.949 
it's nothing really too complicated
yeah<00:01:51.310> words<00:01:53.429> this<00:01:54.429> weapon<00:01:54.819> it<00:01:55.029> really<00:01:55.630> doesn't

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909

they<00:02:02.919> do<00:02:02.979> slow<00:02:03.490> your<00:02:03.700> opponent<00:02:04.119> if<00:02:04.209> you

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
they do slow your opponent if you

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:07.109 
they do slow your opponent if you
noticed<00:02:05.109> when<00:02:05.499> they<00:02:05.740> do<00:02:06.369> slow<00:02:06.669> your<00:02:06.849> opponent

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
noticed when they do slow your opponent

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.199 
noticed when they do slow your opponent
when<00:02:07.209> your<00:02:07.329> opponent<00:02:07.599> is<00:02:07.659> slowed<00:02:08.310> they<00:02:09.310> not

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
when your opponent is slowed they not

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.030 
when your opponent is slowed they not
only<00:02:10.569> decrease<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.530> movement

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
only decrease the movement

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.819 
only decrease the movement
speed<00:02:12.189> but<00:02:12.790> also<00:02:13.030> change<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:13.900> roll<00:02:14.170> speed<00:02:14.560> of

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
speed but also change the roll speed of

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.259 
speed but also change the roll speed of
your<00:02:14.950> opponent<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:15.549> they<00:02:15.640> could<00:02:15.790> have<00:02:15.909> a<00:02:15.969> fast

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
your opponent so they could have a fast

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:17.789 
your opponent so they could have a fast
roll<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.629> then<00:02:16.750> suddenly<00:02:16.959> they'll<00:02:17.439> be<00:02:17.590> fat

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
roll and then suddenly they'll be fat

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.949 
roll and then suddenly they'll be fat
rolling<00:02:18.159> if<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.400> hit<00:02:18.519> them<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.939> believe<00:02:19.840> in

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
rolling if you hit them I believe in

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.990 
rolling if you hit them I believe in
only<00:02:20.019> lasts<00:02:20.560> for<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:20.950> five<00:02:21.340> seconds

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
only lasts for like five seconds

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.240 
only lasts for like five seconds
but<00:02:22.359> that<00:02:23.019> can<00:02:23.140> be<00:02:23.260> enough<00:02:23.500> time<00:02:23.680> if<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.040> want

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
but that can be enough time if you want

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.839 
but that can be enough time if you want
to<00:02:24.519> onl<00:02:25.239> combo<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.930> with<00:02:26.079> a<00:02:26.109> spell<00:02:26.640> combo<00:02:27.640> with

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
to onl combo it with a spell combo with

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.339 
to onl combo it with a spell combo with
a<00:02:27.879> guard<00:02:28.150> break<00:02:28.390> because<00:02:28.599> people<00:02:28.959> get<00:02:29.109> on<00:02:29.230> the

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
a guard break because people get on the

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.050 
a guard break because people get on the
defensive<00:02:29.769> one<00:02:29.980> suddenly<00:02:30.280> they<00:02:30.640> can't<00:02:30.909> move

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
defensive one suddenly they can't move

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.000 
defensive one suddenly they can't move
as<00:02:31.209> well<00:02:31.329> so<00:02:31.900> they<00:02:32.019> will<00:02:32.260> hold<00:02:32.439> their<00:02:32.650> shields

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
as well so they will hold their shields

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.130 
as well so they will hold their shields
up<00:02:33.099> and<00:02:33.280> they<00:02:33.400> will<00:02:33.670> not<00:02:33.939> be<00:02:34.180> moving<00:02:34.629> nearly<00:02:34.930> as

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
up and they will not be moving nearly as

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.800 
up and they will not be moving nearly as
much<00:02:35.319> so<00:02:36.280> that's<00:02:37.060> something<00:02:37.299> you<00:02:37.450> can<00:02:37.569> really

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
much so that's something you can really

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.069 
much so that's something you can really
keep<00:02:38.019> in<00:02:38.170> mind<00:02:38.489> usually<00:02:39.489> the<00:02:39.870> opponent<00:02:40.870> will

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
keep in mind usually the opponent will

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.740 
keep in mind usually the opponent will
either<00:02:41.739> put<00:02:42.670> up<00:02:42.790> their<00:02:42.969> shield<00:02:43.239> or<00:02:43.540> they'll

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
either put up their shield or they'll

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.449 
either put up their shield or they'll
start<00:02:43.989> our<00:02:44.079> one<00:02:44.290> span<00:02:44.590> one<00:02:44.859> of<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.069> two<00:02:45.250> I

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
start our one span one of the two I

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.879 
start our one span one of the two I
really<00:02:46.359> haven't<00:02:46.569> seen<00:02:46.689> anything<00:02:47.139> other<00:02:47.500> than

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:47.889 
really haven't seen anything other than

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:51.179 
really haven't seen anything other than
them<00:02:48.069> that<00:02:48.099> happens<00:02:48.819> so<00:02:49.709> it<00:02:50.709> is<00:02:50.829> what<00:02:50.980> it<00:02:51.069> is

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
them that happens so it is what it is

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:52.530 
them that happens so it is what it is
people<00:02:51.400> tend<00:02:51.669> to<00:02:51.760> react<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> same<00:02:52.269> way<00:02:52.329> to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
people tend to react the same way to

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.420 
people tend to react the same way to
this<00:02:52.750> thing<00:02:52.989> which<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.680> not<00:02:53.859> really<00:02:54.189> a<00:02:54.220> bad

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
this thing which is not really a bad

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.819 
this thing which is not really a bad
thing<00:02:54.700> especially<00:02:55.299> if<00:02:55.840> you<00:02:56.019> are<00:02:56.169> able<00:02:56.319> to<00:02:56.590> take

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829 
thing especially if you are able to take

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:59.699 
thing especially if you are able to take
advantage<00:02:57.189> of<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.430> so<00:02:57.609> yeah<00:02:58.419> now<00:02:59.290> right<00:02:59.500> here<00:02:59.680> I

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
advantage of it so yeah now right here I

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.920 
advantage of it so yeah now right here I
put<00:02:59.950> a<00:03:00.010> buff<00:03:00.189> on<00:03:00.340> just<00:03:00.609> because<00:03:00.939> I<00:03:01.359> mean<00:03:01.629> I

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
put a buff on just because I mean I

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.720 
put a buff on just because I mean I
started<00:03:02.650> putting<00:03:02.769> buffs<00:03:03.040> on<00:03:03.189> my<00:03:03.310> weapons<00:03:03.609> if

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
started putting buffs on my weapons if

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.520 
started putting buffs on my weapons if
the<00:03:03.909> other<00:03:04.060> person<00:03:04.720> I'm<00:03:04.810> fighting<00:03:05.139> starts<00:03:05.439> to

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
the other person I'm fighting starts to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.379 
the other person I'm fighting starts to
buff<00:03:05.709> it's<00:03:06.250> just<00:03:06.489> something<00:03:06.760> I've<00:03:06.879> started<00:03:07.180> to

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
buff it's just something I've started to

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:09.210 
buff it's just something I've started to
do<00:03:07.540> because<00:03:08.019> it<00:03:08.290> doesn't<00:03:08.319> really<00:03:08.650> take<00:03:08.980> much

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
do because it doesn't really take much

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.770 
do because it doesn't really take much
to<00:03:09.519> use<00:03:09.700> flame<00:03:10.000> weapon<00:03:10.329> I<00:03:10.359> mean<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.629> just

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
to use flame weapon I mean it just

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.649 
to use flame weapon I mean it just
requires<00:03:11.109> the<00:03:11.200> attunements<00:03:11.769> lot<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.659> it

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
requires the attunements lot so it

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:14.670 
requires the attunements lot so it
might've<00:03:13.870> been<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.989> little<00:03:14.049> bit<00:03:14.319> of<00:03:14.409> overkill

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
might've been a little bit of overkill

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.439 
might've been a little bit of overkill
on<00:03:14.829> that<00:03:15.099> fight<00:03:15.310> though<00:03:15.549> so<00:03:15.819> you<00:03:16.090> know<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.359> is

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:16.449 
on that fight though so you know it is

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:19.589 
on that fight though so you know it is
what<00:03:16.599> it<00:03:16.629> is<00:03:16.810> but<00:03:17.169> whatever<00:03:18.090> so<00:03:19.090> like<00:03:19.449> in<00:03:19.569> my

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
what it is but whatever so like in my

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
in fact of those can synergize really

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.159 
in fact of those can synergize really
well<00:03:57.250> with<00:03:57.519> pretty<00:03:57.760> much<00:03:57.939> anything<00:03:58.479> if<00:03:58.870> you

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
well with pretty much anything if you

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.280 
well with pretty much anything if you
are<00:03:59.409> you<00:03:59.949> know<00:04:00.069> aware<00:04:00.879> and<00:04:01.209> close<00:04:01.750> enough<00:04:01.900> to

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
are you know aware and close enough to

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.070 
are you know aware and close enough to
take<00:04:02.439> advantage<00:04:02.560> of<00:04:03.010> it

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
take advantage of it

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.630 
take advantage of it
the<00:04:04.319> biggest<00:04:04.500> con<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.069> weapon<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.430> would

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
the biggest con of the weapon I would

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.190 
the biggest con of the weapon I would
have<00:04:05.730> to<00:04:05.849> say<00:04:05.970> that<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.300> biggest<00:04:06.480> con<00:04:06.780> would

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
have to say that the biggest con would

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.320 
have to say that the biggest con would
probably<00:04:07.560> be<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.800> low<00:04:07.950> damage<00:04:08.220> output<00:04:08.550> but

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
probably be the low damage output but

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.449 
probably be the low damage output but
then<00:04:09.450> again<00:04:09.540> it<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.200> a<00:04:10.530> curved<00:04:10.770> sword<00:04:11.130> and

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
then again it is a curved sword and

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.610 
then again it is a curved sword and
their<00:04:12.150> damage<00:04:12.599> output<00:04:12.750> in<00:04:12.989> this<00:04:13.080> game<00:04:13.260> really

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
their damage output in this game really

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.920 
their damage output in this game really
isn't<00:04:13.770> too<00:04:14.010> spectacular<00:04:14.280> so<00:04:15.000> it's<00:04:15.690> pretty

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
isn't too spectacular so it's pretty

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.060 
isn't too spectacular so it's pretty
