cold cycles with cold seasons you still

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.790 
cold cycles with cold seasons you still
have<00:00:15.570> some<00:00:15.720> water<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.020> penetrations<00:00:16.590> atop

the door or even just from open and
closing<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.230> door<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.470> what'll<00:00:19.680> happen<00:00:19.890> here

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
closing the door and what'll happen here

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.740 
closing the door and what'll happen here
is<00:00:20.340> there<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.640> rubber<00:00:20.880> seals<00:00:21.180> located<00:00:21.689> around

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
is there is rubber seals located around

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.749 
is there is rubber seals located around
the<00:00:21.990> perimeter<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> door<00:00:22.770> and<00:00:23.009> it'll

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:23.759 
the perimeter of the door and it'll

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.339 
the perimeter of the door and it'll
leave<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> freeze<00:00:24.270> to<00:00:24.450> the<00:00:24.480> door<00:00:24.720> itself<00:00:25.050> or

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
leave the freeze to the door itself or

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.950 
leave the freeze to the door itself or
to<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.619> body<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.509> this<00:00:27.509> prevents<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.900> from

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
to the body and this prevents you from

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.889 
to the body and this prevents you from
opening<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.439> door<00:00:28.669> now<00:00:29.669> if<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.360> do<00:00:30.480> run<00:00:30.810> into

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:30.899 
opening a door now if you do run into

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:32.120 
opening a door now if you do run into
this<00:00:31.079> situation<00:00:31.320> where<00:00:31.680> you<00:00:31.770> can't<00:00:31.950> get<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
this situation where you can't get the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.130 
this situation where you can't get the
door<00:00:32.279> open

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
door open

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.780 
door open
just<00:00:34.140> uh<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.890> a<00:00:34.980> couple<00:00:35.130> rules<00:00:35.399> what<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> would

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
just uh just a couple rules what I would

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.119 
just uh just a couple rules what I would
go<00:00:35.910> by<00:00:36.090> here<00:00:36.410> most<00:00:37.410> vehicles<00:00:37.800> are<00:00:37.890> equipped

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
go by here most vehicles are equipped

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.400 
go by here most vehicles are equipped
with<00:00:38.190> plastic<00:00:38.579> door<00:00:38.730> handles<00:00:39.120> now<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.510> I

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
with plastic door handles now and I

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.950 
with plastic door handles now and I
wouldn't<00:00:41.340> recommend<00:00:41.640> pulling<00:00:42.449> too<00:00:42.629> hard<00:00:42.660> on

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
wouldn't recommend pulling too hard on

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:43.939 
wouldn't recommend pulling too hard on
these<00:00:43.079> because<00:00:43.230> what<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.559> happen<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.890> can

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
these because what can happen you can

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.319 
these because what can happen you can
break<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> door<00:00:44.460> handle<00:00:44.760> itself<00:00:45.059> where<00:00:45.269> you

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
break the door handle itself where you

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.759 
break the door handle itself where you
can<00:00:45.420> break<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.750> mechanism<00:00:46.199> inside<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:46.530> door

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
can break the mechanism inside the door

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.729 
can break the mechanism inside the door
and<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.879> be<00:00:48.000> costly<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.449> fix<00:00:48.739> so

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and that can be costly to fix so

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.049 
and that can be costly to fix so
normally<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.429> is<00:00:50.579> if<00:00:50.699> you<00:00:50.789> can<00:00:50.910> just

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
normally we can do is if you can just

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.000 
normally we can do is if you can just
get<00:00:51.179> it<00:00:51.300> open<00:00:51.690> just<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.960> crack<00:00:51.989> here<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.710> maybe

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
get it open just a crack here just maybe

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.520 
get it open just a crack here just maybe
on<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> first<00:00:53.519> click<00:00:53.820> or<00:00:54.000> whatever<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:55.350> can

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
on the first click or whatever you can

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.200 
on the first click or whatever you can
fit<00:00:55.739> your<00:00:55.769> fingers<00:00:56.160> inside<00:00:56.519> here<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:56.940> maybe

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
fit your fingers inside here and maybe

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.470 
fit your fingers inside here and maybe
pull<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> door<00:00:58.260> open<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:59.210> just<00:01:00.210> buy<00:01:00.329> that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
pull the door open I just buy that

pull the door open I just buy that
method<00:01:00.899> there<00:01:01.309> or<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.760> find<00:01:02.969> another<00:01:03.149> door

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
method there or if you find another door

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.790 
method there or if you find another door
that<00:01:03.539> isn't<00:01:03.659> frozen<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.290> can<00:01:04.320> go<00:01:04.530> from<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
that isn't frozen you can go from the

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.380 
that isn't frozen you can go from the
inside<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> vehicle<00:01:05.370> and<00:01:05.730> push<00:01:05.970> outwards

inside of the vehicle and push outwards

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.770 
inside of the vehicle and push outwards
or<00:01:06.690> if<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:07.350> vehicle<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.800> equipped<00:01:08.130> with

or if your vehicle is equipped with

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.420 
or if your vehicle is equipped with
remote<00:01:09.780> start<00:01:10.200> sometimes<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.190> can<00:01:11.280> help

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
remote start sometimes that can help

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.860 
remote start sometimes that can help
what<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.730> can<00:01:11.910> do<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.300> can<00:01:12.450> start<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
what you can do is you can start the

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.480 
what you can do is you can start the
vehicle<00:01:13.230> allow<00:01:13.800> it<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> warm<00:01:14.190> up<00:01:14.370> in<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
vehicle allow it to warm up in the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.980 
vehicle allow it to warm up in the
inside<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.210> turn<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.390> melt<00:01:15.750> any

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
inside and this in turn will melt any

rubbers I am talking about here this is

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.230 
rubbers I am talking about here this is
the<00:01:28.320> main<00:01:28.500> rubber<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.760> that<00:01:29.880> goes<00:01:30.030> all<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the main rubber here that goes all the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.580 
the main rubber here that goes all the
way<00:01:30.330> around<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.780> perimeter<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.350> door

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
way around the perimeter of the door

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.340 
way around the perimeter of the door
itself<00:01:32.240> you<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.420> see<00:01:33.600> now<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.080> a<00:01:34.110> fair

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
itself you can see now it is a fair

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.750 
itself you can see now it is a fair
amount<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.620> area<00:01:34.890> here<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.250> that's<00:01:35.400> what

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
amount of area here and that's what

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.040 
amount of area here and that's what
happens<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.120> some<00:01:36.270> moisture<00:01:36.390> gets<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:36.870> here

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.050 
happens is some moisture gets on here

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.540 
happens is some moisture gets on here
and<00:01:37.110> does<00:01:37.290> freeze<00:01:37.560> against<00:01:37.980> the<00:01:38.070> sheet<00:01:38.400> metal

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
and does freeze against the sheet metal

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.500 
and does freeze against the sheet metal
on<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.720> door<00:01:40.310> now<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.460> are<00:01:41.580> located<00:01:42.000> some<00:01:42.420> of

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
on the door now they are located some of

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.910 
on the door now they are located some of
them<00:01:42.600> are<00:01:42.870> equipped<00:01:43.230> with<00:01:43.290> ones<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.680> go

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
them are equipped with ones that go

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.530 
them are equipped with ones that go
along<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.310> bottom<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.700> door<00:01:44.880> and

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
along the bottom of the door and

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.150 
along the bottom of the door and
something<00:01:46.080> go<00:01:46.290> along<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.560> top<00:01:46.590> of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.040> world

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
something go along the top of the world

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.710 
something go along the top of the world
like<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.880> now<00:01:48.030> these<00:01:48.270> ones<00:01:48.510> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
like this is here now these ones you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.060 
like this is here now these ones you
don't<00:01:48.990> normally<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.530> worry<00:01:49.680> about<00:01:49.800> too

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
don't normally have to worry about too

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.520 
don't normally have to worry about too
much<00:01:50.390> especially<00:01:51.390> with<00:01:51.510> the<00:01:51.660> it's<00:01:52.200> got<00:01:52.380> more

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
much especially with the it's got more

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.720 
much especially with the it's got more
of<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:52.650> textured<00:01:52.830> surface<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.550> so<00:01:53.640> it

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
of a textured surface on it so it

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.050 
of a textured surface on it so it
doesn't<00:01:53.880> allow<00:01:54.120> it<00:01:54.150> to<00:01:54.330> freeze<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.840> as<00:01:54.990> bad<00:01:56.060> and

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
doesn't allow it to freeze up as bad and

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.310 
doesn't allow it to freeze up as bad and
you<00:01:57.120> can<00:01:57.270> see<00:01:57.390> here<00:01:57.570> where<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.720> witness<00:01:58.050> marks

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
you can see here where the witness marks

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.810 
you can see here where the witness marks
are<00:01:58.500> where<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.830> rubber<00:01:59.100> seal<00:01:59.400> that<00:01:59.640> main

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
are where that rubber seal that main

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.570 
are where that rubber seal that main
primary<00:02:00.540> seal<00:02:00.900> rubs<00:02:01.200> against<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.010> door<00:02:02.160> here

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
primary seal rubs against the door here

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.660 
primary seal rubs against the door here
and<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.330> is<00:02:03.510> where<00:02:03.720> it<00:02:03.750> freezes<00:02:03.960> against<00:02:04.670> now

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
and that is where it freezes against now

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.180 
and that is where it freezes against now
what<00:02:05.850> I'll<00:02:05.940> be<00:02:06.030> using<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.740> just

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
what I'll be using here is this is just

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.680 
what I'll be using here is this is just
a<00:02:08.250> product<00:02:08.459> it's<00:02:08.700> made<00:02:08.819> by<00:02:08.970> LPS<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.629> a

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
a product it's made by LPS it's a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.960 
a product it's made by LPS it's a
heavy-duty<00:02:09.959> silicone<00:02:10.440> lubricant<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.670> doesn't

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
heavy-duty silicone lubricant it doesn't

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.060 
heavy-duty silicone lubricant it doesn't
necessarily<00:02:12.510> have<00:02:12.630> to<00:02:12.660> be<00:02:12.810> heavy<00:02:13.050> duty<00:02:13.380> this

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
necessarily have to be heavy duty this

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.100 
necessarily have to be heavy duty this
is<00:02:14.130> just<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.460> one<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.000> had<00:02:15.240> kicking<00:02:15.810> around<00:02:16.020> at

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
is just a one I had kicking around at

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.260 
is just a one I had kicking around at
home<00:02:16.230> here

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
home here

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.570 
home here
and<00:02:17.390> basically<00:02:18.080> with<00:02:18.350> this<00:02:18.470> application<00:02:19.250> here

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
and basically with this application here

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.710 
and basically with this application here
you're<00:02:19.700> just<00:02:19.730> looking<00:02:20.210> for<00:02:20.360> something<00:02:20.600> that

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
you're just looking for something that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.650 
you're just looking for something that
is<00:02:20.840> a<00:02:20.930> silicon-based<00:02:21.680> lubricant<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.660> what

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
is a silicon-based lubricant and what

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.210 
is a silicon-based lubricant and what
this<00:02:23.810> is<00:02:23.990> this<00:02:24.170> is<00:02:24.230> rubbers<00:02:24.680> safe<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.130> you

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
this is this is rubbers safe so you

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.210 
this is this is rubbers safe so you
don't<00:02:25.610> have<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.850> worry<00:02:26.030> about<00:02:27.130> destroying<00:02:28.130> the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
don't have to worry about destroying the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.430 
don't have to worry about destroying the
rubber<00:02:28.400> at<00:02:28.580> all<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:29.360> some<00:02:29.690> stuff<00:02:29.930> is<00:02:30.080> known<00:02:30.290> to

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
rubber at all so some stuff is known to

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.720 
rubber at all so some stuff is known to
dry<00:02:30.590> out<00:02:30.710> the<00:02:30.740> rubbers<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:31.160> you<00:02:31.250> also<00:02:31.370> want<00:02:31.670> to

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
dry out the rubbers so you also want to

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.030 
dry out the rubbers so you also want to
make<00:02:31.880> note<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.470> so<00:02:33.470> basically<00:02:33.740> what<00:02:33.920> I<00:02:33.950> do

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
make note of that so basically what I do

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.280 
make note of that so basically what I do
here<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:34.610> it's<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.270> a<00:02:35.420> spray<00:02:35.630> application

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
here is it's just a spray application

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.200 
here is it's just a spray application
now<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:36.980> won't<00:02:37.160> be<00:02:37.250> spraying<00:02:37.550> it<00:02:37.670> on<00:02:37.820> the<00:02:38.030> body

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
now I won't be spraying it on the body

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.730 
now I won't be spraying it on the body
itself<00:02:38.480> because<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:38.750> do<00:02:38.810> don't<00:02:39.230> want<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.560> go<00:02:39.650> in

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
itself because I do don't want to go in

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.980 
itself because I do don't want to go in
places<00:02:40.220> that<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:41.120> have<00:02:41.270> to<00:02:41.360> clean<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.600> up<00:02:41.690> after

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
places that I have to clean it up after

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.210 
places that I have to clean it up after
so<00:02:42.140> what<00:02:42.260> I'll<00:02:42.350> be<00:02:42.380> doing<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.740> I'll<00:02:42.830> apply<00:02:43.040> it

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
so what I'll be doing is I'll apply it

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.280 
so what I'll be doing is I'll apply it
to<00:02:43.370> a<00:02:43.400> cloth<00:02:43.730> there<00:02:44.030> as<00:02:44.120> you<00:02:44.240> can<00:02:44.270> see<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:44.720> then

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
to a cloth there as you can see and then

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.720 
to a cloth there as you can see and then
I'll<00:02:45.380> be<00:02:45.470> rubbing<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:45.860> on<00:02:45.980> but<00:02:46.400> first<00:02:46.610> before

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
I'll be rubbing it on but first before

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.340 
I'll be rubbing it on but first before
