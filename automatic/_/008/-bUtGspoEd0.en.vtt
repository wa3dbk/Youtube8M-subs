are a lot like the kd3 avila got the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.850 
are a lot like the kd3 avila got the
scoring<00:05:08.540> titles<00:05:09.170> right<00:05:09.350> here<00:05:11.710> compare<00:05:12.710> the

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
scoring titles right here compare the

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.390 
scoring titles right here compare the
all<00:05:12.980> songs<00:05:13.310> are<00:05:13.580> pretty<00:05:13.850> similar<00:05:15.400> almost

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
all songs are pretty similar almost

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.140 
all songs are pretty similar almost
exactly<00:05:16.910> the<00:05:16.970> same<00:05:17.680> so<00:05:18.680> yeah<00:05:18.980> I<00:05:19.340> guess<00:05:19.730> he

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
exactly the same so yeah I guess he

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.090 
exactly the same so yeah I guess he
should<00:05:20.390> provide<00:05:20.710> pretty<00:05:21.710> much<00:05:21.830> the<00:05:21.950> same

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
should provide pretty much the same

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:29.530 
should provide pretty much the same
