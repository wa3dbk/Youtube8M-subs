00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.089 

right<00:03:13.349> here<00:03:13.590> you<00:03:13.890> know<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:13.980> just<00:03:14.190> think

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:16.099 
right here you know I just think

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:27.120 
right here you know I just think
he<00:03:16.670> told<00:03:16.939> our<00:03:17.120> didi

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.500 

then<00:03:27.310> you<00:03:27.430> get<00:03:27.610> bubbles<00:03:27.850> all<00:03:28.120> starting<00:03:28.480> to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
then you get bubbles all starting to

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.750 
then you get bubbles all starting to
make<00:03:28.570> sense<00:03:28.720> now

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
make sense now

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.750 
make sense now
