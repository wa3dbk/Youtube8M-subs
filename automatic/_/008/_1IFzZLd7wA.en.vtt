00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.979
 they were a group of elect barely 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.050
 they knew but a huge link them 

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:10.670
 his love had gotten there 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.570
 unconditional for football and the 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.580
 videogames I play football from very 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.410
 small so far that I keep playing and 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.630
 he also tried it has always been my 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.089
 favorite football videogame me 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.610
 My parents always took me from 

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:27.470
 six or seven years 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.780
 and until now he has never stopped playing 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.330
 football I have eight years playing 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.610
 pretty little soccer my father has 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.980
 been the one that has spent the most rain 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.350
 I heat the cold and it's the one that always 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.260
 take the matches 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.300
 that day the life of one of them was going to 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.940
 change forever 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.310
 enter the game meant becoming 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.340
 in a video game star 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.170
 pinter from the closest you can be 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.400
 is to be inside we believe that this is a 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.860
 step forward is something historic poke 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.500
 a real person inside the video game 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.780
 I think being in a video game is the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.000
 dream of anyone who plays that 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.550
 he likes video games a dream up 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.880
 now impossible a prize only reserved 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.320
 to a chosen the total player will meet 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.510
 some physical characteristics and 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.440
 gameplay and will be the best of all 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.150
 The winner of this event goes to Japan 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.670
 November we will capture your 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.280
 movements we will physically capture 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.479
 how is he and we are going to reproduce it 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.920
 physically within the video game and in 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.229
 a near future probably the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.330
 next year we can make a selection 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.910
 of 11 players around the world that is 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.160
 the weight selection between the game them 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:43.360
 had opened the way to glory but 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.360
 it was not going to be a simple way 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.920
 the tests happened one after the other 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.920
 without a rest 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.940
 base dribble defense put to the test 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.630
 all your skills taking them to 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.630
 new extremes 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.980
 the weakest were falling those 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.240
 that they kept fighting against the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.240
 tired of nerves 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.290
 six finalists had met at 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.240
 doors of glory six candidates 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.920
 getting into the story I did not think I was going 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.620
 to get that far and right now I'm going to 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.990
 fight with everything to get the trip 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.560
 going to japan and being in the finals was my 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.230
 dream 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.670
 because it is difficult very difficult that and the 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.670
 support of the later people 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.720
 the final big moment had come a 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:21.379
 final match the last step before 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.379
 of victory 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.250
 a donor whose dream has not done more 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.250
 what to start
