understand<00:01:36.299> why<00:01:36.479> Hasbro<00:01:37.020> would<00:01:37.170> use<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.560> it's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
understand why Hasbro would use it it's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
understand why Hasbro would use it it's
probably<00:01:38.369> very<00:01:38.400> cheap<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.119> easy<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.509> source

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
probably very cheap and easy to source

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.679 
probably very cheap and easy to source
but<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.220> problem<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.119> it's<00:01:42.299> going<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
but it's a problem and it's going to

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.870 
but it's a problem and it's going to
degrade<00:01:42.840> very<00:01:43.619> quickly<00:01:43.979> which<00:01:44.430> really

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
degrade very quickly which really

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.999 
degrade very quickly which really

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.449 
job molding it and I appreciate the
little<00:03:47.989> dollops<00:03:48.470> of<00:03:48.620> paint<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:49.100> they<00:03:49.190> used

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
little dollops of paint that they used

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.120 
little dollops of paint that they used
for<00:03:50.180> the<00:03:50.330> eyes<00:03:50.450> though<00:03:51.200> when<00:03:51.620> playing<00:03:51.950> with

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
for the eyes though when playing with

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.380 
for the eyes though when playing with
the<00:03:52.220> figure<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.610> fiddling<00:03:52.970> with<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:53.239> you're

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
the figure and fiddling with it you're

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.509 
the figure and fiddling with it you're
going<00:03:53.570> to<00:03:53.750> deploy<00:03:54.019> the<00:03:54.200> gun<00:03:54.380> as<00:03:54.709> soon<00:03:55.280> as<00:03:55.400> you

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 
going to deploy the gun as soon as you

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.220 
going to deploy the gun as soon as you
touch<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:55.730> wings<00:03:56.060> there's<00:03:56.330> really<00:03:56.660> no<00:03:57.050> way

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
touch the wings there's really no way

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.920 
touch the wings there's really no way
around<00:03:57.260> that<00:03:57.709> overall<00:03:58.670> though<00:03:58.880> I<00:03:58.910> can't<00:03:59.600> say<00:03:59.900> I

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
around that overall though I can't say I

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.699 
around that overall though I can't say I
really<00:04:00.380> liked<00:04:00.800> Waspinator<00:04:01.430> I<00:04:01.700> mean<00:04:02.000> he's<00:04:02.209> just

has plans lots of plans most of them

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.580 
has plans lots of plans most of them
involve<00:04:14.690> killing<00:04:15.050> your<00:04:16.600> plants<00:04:17.600> if<00:04:17.720> you've

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
involve killing your plants if you've

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.830 
involve killing your plants if you've
ever<00:04:18.799> had<00:04:19.100> a<00:04:19.130> secret<00:04:19.609> eye<00:04:20.000> before<00:04:20.450> you<00:04:20.660> can

ever had a secret eye before you can

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.730 
ever had a secret eye before you can
probably<00:04:21.410> guess<00:04:22.370> how<00:04:22.640> this<00:04:22.850> is<00:04:23.000> going<00:04:23.210> to<00:04:23.330> go

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
probably guess how this is going to go

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.440 
probably guess how this is going to go
for<00:04:24.740> this<00:04:24.919> transformation<00:04:25.370> I<00:04:25.760> just<00:04:26.030> pop<00:04:26.240> off

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
for this transformation I just pop off

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.089 
for this transformation I just pop off
the<00:04:26.720> null<00:04:26.900> ray<00:04:27.110> guns<00:04:27.380> cuz

00:04:28.089 --> 00:04:28.099 
the null ray guns cuz

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:30.850 
the null ray guns cuz
quite<00:04:28.699> frankly<00:04:29.060> they<00:04:29.270> don't<00:04:29.419> stay<00:04:29.870> on<00:04:30.199> during

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
quite frankly they don't stay on during

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.830 
quite frankly they don't stay on during
the<00:04:30.949> transformation<00:04:31.400> at<00:04:31.729> all<00:04:31.879> and<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.300> have<00:04:32.689> no

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
the transformation at all and I have no

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.959 
the transformation at all and I have no
idea<00:04:32.870> why<00:04:33.409> they're<00:04:33.590> colored<00:04:34.009> red<00:04:34.430> on<00:04:34.819> the

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:34.969 
idea why they're colored red on the

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.050 
idea why they're colored red on the
handles<00:04:35.419> oh<00:04:35.569> well<00:04:36.080> put<00:04:36.289> them<00:04:36.379> off<00:04:36.499> to<00:04:36.529> the<00:04:36.710> side

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
handles oh well put them off to the side

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.339 
handles oh well put them off to the side
okay<00:04:38.060> for<00:04:38.389> the<00:04:38.509> transformation<00:04:39.139> we're<00:04:39.259> gonna

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
okay for the transformation we're gonna

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.439 
okay for the transformation we're gonna
start<00:04:39.710> with<00:04:39.889> taking<00:04:40.129> the<00:04:40.430> entire<00:04:40.759> back<00:04:41.090> plate

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
start with taking the entire back plate

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.989 
start with taking the entire back plate
our<00:04:42.050> wings<00:04:42.349> and<00:04:42.740> flipping<00:04:43.159> them<00:04:43.249> around<00:04:43.580> and

00:04:43.989 --> 00:04:43.999 
our wings and flipping them around and

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:46.839 
our wings and flipping them around and
down<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.810> then<00:04:45.349> we<00:04:45.469> can<00:04:45.650> bring<00:04:45.889> the<00:04:46.219> feet

00:04:46.839 --> 00:04:46.849 
down and then we can bring the feet

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.659 
down and then we can bring the feet
together<00:04:47.330> over<00:04:48.259> a<00:04:48.289> little<00:04:48.740> connector<00:04:49.370> port

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:49.669 
together over a little connector port

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:51.879 
together over a little connector port
that<00:04:50.180> is<00:04:50.240> on<00:04:50.449> the<00:04:50.569> bottom<00:04:50.960> of<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.229> wing<00:04:51.469> of<00:04:51.740> the

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
that is on the bottom of the wing of the

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.059 
that is on the bottom of the wing of the
main<00:04:52.099> wings<00:04:52.340> section<00:04:53.060> and<00:04:53.300> then<00:04:53.870> fold<00:04:54.319> up<00:04:54.529> the

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:55.069 
main wings section and then fold up the

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:58.629 
main wings section and then fold up the
feet<00:04:55.719> one<00:04:56.719> word<00:04:56.930> of<00:04:57.050> warning<00:04:57.319> the<00:04:57.740> legs<00:04:58.069> on<00:04:58.400> my

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
feet one word of warning the legs on my

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.269 
feet one word of warning the legs on my
figure<00:04:58.969> and<00:04:59.389> I<00:04:59.479> suspect<00:05:00.050> on<00:05:00.229> many<00:05:00.439> others<00:05:00.830> will

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
figure and I suspect on many others will

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.179 
figure and I suspect on many others will
not<00:05:01.610> stay<00:05:02.120> together<00:05:02.419> so<00:05:03.259> you're<00:05:03.620> just<00:05:03.979> gonna

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:04.189 
not stay together so you're just gonna

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:07.360 
not stay together so you're just gonna
have<00:05:04.490> to<00:05:04.639> deal<00:05:05.319> for<00:05:06.319> the<00:05:06.409> chest<00:05:06.650> just<00:05:06.949> simply

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
have to deal for the chest just simply

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.100 
have to deal for the chest just simply
reach<00:05:07.610> underneath<00:05:07.969> the<00:05:08.240> chest<00:05:08.479> and<00:05:08.689> fold<00:05:08.990> it

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
reach underneath the chest and fold it

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.499 
reach underneath the chest and fold it
up<00:05:09.169> over<00:05:09.409> the<00:05:09.500> head<00:05:09.710> and<00:05:09.979> then<00:05:10.610> fold<00:05:11.029> out<00:05:11.300> the

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
up over the head and then fold out the

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.409 
up over the head and then fold out the
nose<00:05:11.689> cone<00:05:12.080> thus<00:05:12.740> deploying<00:05:13.340> a<00:05:13.729> landing<00:05:14.389> gear

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
nose cone thus deploying a landing gear

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.550 
nose cone thus deploying a landing gear
the<00:05:14.779> arms<00:05:15.620> they<00:05:15.979> will<00:05:16.990> unpack<00:05:17.990> even<00:05:18.439> though

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
the arms they will unpack even though

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:19.990 
the arms they will unpack even though
they're<00:05:18.770> supposed<00:05:19.279> to<00:05:19.310> be<00:05:19.430> a<00:05:19.460> peg<00:05:19.669> there<00:05:19.849> they

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
they're supposed to be a peg there they

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.719 
they're supposed to be a peg there they
just<00:05:20.210> kind<00:05:20.449> of<00:05:20.479> fall<00:05:20.779> open<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:21.830> then<00:05:22.400> peg

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
just kind of fall open and then peg

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.790 
just kind of fall open and then peg
underneath<00:05:23.719> the<00:05:24.169> wings<00:05:24.379> like<00:05:24.949> so<00:05:26.589> and<00:05:27.589> then

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
underneath the wings like so and then

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.550 
underneath the wings like so and then
once<00:05:28.009> that's<00:05:28.279> done<00:05:28.639> you<00:05:28.969> can<00:05:29.020> reattach<00:05:30.020> the

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
once that's done you can reattach the

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.829 
once that's done you can reattach the
cannons<00:05:31.249> or<00:05:31.639> the<00:05:31.759> null<00:05:31.939> rays<00:05:32.210> or<00:05:32.509> whatever<00:05:32.719> the

cannons or the null rays or whatever the
hell<00:05:32.960> you<00:05:33.110> want<00:05:33.259> to<00:05:33.319> call<00:05:33.500> them<00:05:33.699> cursing<00:05:34.699> them

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
hell you want to call them cursing them

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:37.899 
hell you want to call them cursing them
loudly<00:05:35.060> for<00:05:35.479> falling<00:05:35.810> off<00:05:35.960> consistently<00:05:36.909> and

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:37.909 
loudly for falling off consistently and

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.110 
loudly for falling off consistently and
here<00:05:38.419> we<00:05:38.569> have<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:39.139> plain<00:05:39.529> mode<00:05:39.830> now<00:05:40.729> I<00:05:40.759> will

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
here we have the plain mode now I will

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.409 
here we have the plain mode now I will
admit<00:05:41.419> the<00:05:41.659> idea<00:05:42.289> of<00:05:42.529> an<00:05:42.680> f-22<00:05:43.129> plain<00:05:43.849> mode<00:05:44.120> is

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
admit the idea of an f-22 plain mode is

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:48.100 
admit the idea of an f-22 plain mode is
pretty<00:05:44.960> cool<00:05:45.229> I<00:05:45.500> like<00:05:45.889> their<00:05:46.270> attempt<00:05:47.270> here

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
pretty cool I like their attempt here

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.129 
pretty cool I like their attempt here
though<00:05:48.740> I<00:05:48.770> think<00:05:48.919> they've<00:05:49.219> ultimately<00:05:49.669> failed
