00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:07.560
 friends, I strongly welcome you 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.440
 next time now I want to spend 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.519
 such an experiment than all the same 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.029
 oil of various viscosities 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.490
 practically differ from each other by 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.789
 I managed to get an example of ravenol 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.240
 a large enough range of them is not 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:32.500
 products thanks here from quick 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.180
 one seller of this oil responded 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.480
 that's what thanks to him so much 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.199
 no less now I want to spend 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.920
 experiment 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:44.620
 next character I filled these 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.239
 here are the test tubes 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.760
 oils of different viscosity for example 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.129
 They go with me well, the numbering is standard 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.879
 times up to 45 and look what 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.930
 numbering 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:01.210
 Oils were what kinds of oils were poured 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:07.820
 In these test tubes from 1 punching it was 0 to 20 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:14.260
 oil 0 to 30 0 to 40 so they all go 0 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.260
 the series then goes 5 to 40 and 10 to 30 and 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.490
 now 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.799
 just to visually see what 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.040
 They are different, I just have this installation 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:28.210
 just collected and see with what 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.799
 speed roll balls in this oil 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.450
 the form 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:38.570
 note that there is oil in oil 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:45.950
 0 20 ball much faster resorting 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:48.530
 in oil 10-30, this suggests that 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.499
 Well, the oil really corresponds 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.130
 its for with the stated viscosity since 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:56.060
 balls run very fast I'm all right now 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.030
 I will take it out 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.189
 this installation in the cold literally minutes 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.039
 by five so that the oil is faded and yet 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.039
 we will do it again
