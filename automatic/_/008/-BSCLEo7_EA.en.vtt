00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
guard is a bit just taken a lot hits the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.780

now would you know all it does is 900

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.270 
now would you know all it does is 900
damage<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:57.079> nothing<00:01:58.079> really<00:01:58.110> too<00:01:58.619> much<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.130> it

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
