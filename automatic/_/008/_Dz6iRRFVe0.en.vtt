holds that panel in I continue on with
the<00:03:46.230> handle<00:03:46.560> up<00:03:46.710> I<00:03:47.180> got<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.210> driver<00:03:48.540> set<00:03:48.870> off

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
the handle up I got the driver set off

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.410 
the handle up I got the driver set off
now<00:03:49.170> I<00:03:49.230> wanted<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.620> know<00:03:49.830> what<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:51.000> other<00:03:51.180> side

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
now I wanted to know what the other side

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.100 
now I wanted to know what the other side
came<00:03:51.660> off<00:03:51.870> very<00:03:52.140> easily<00:03:52.440> but<00:03:52.770> there<00:03:52.920> is<00:03:53.010> a<00:03:53.040> clip

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
came off very easily but there is a clip

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.220 
came off very easily but there is a clip
inside<00:03:56.480> your<00:03:57.480> C<00:03:57.780> pillar<00:03:58.110> not<00:03:58.830> at<00:03:58.950> the<00:03:59.040> bottom

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
inside your C pillar not at the bottom

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.460 
inside your C pillar not at the bottom
by<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.290> rear<00:04:01.770> quarter<00:04:02.670> window<00:04:02.970> there<00:04:03.200> as<00:04:04.200> I

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
by the rear quarter window there as I

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.900 
by the rear quarter window there as I
popped<00:04:04.740> off<00:04:04.920> pretty<00:04:05.130> easy<00:04:05.370> so<00:04:05.640> maybe<00:04:05.850> it

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
popped off pretty easy so maybe it

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.520 
popped off pretty easy so maybe it
wasn't<00:04:06.060> back<00:04:06.270> in<00:04:06.450> there<00:04:06.630> from<00:04:06.810> when<00:04:06.960> I<00:04:06.990> popped

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
wasn't back in there from when I popped

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:12.230 
wasn't back in there from when I popped
all<00:04:07.710> that<00:04:07.860> apart<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.600> install<00:04:09.600> my<00:04:11.240> hitch

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
all that apart to install my hitch

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.470 
all that apart to install my hitch
controller<00:04:13.550> but<00:04:14.550> you<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:14.880> have<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.120> pry<00:04:15.450> it

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
controller but you just have to pry it

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.900 
controller but you just have to pry it
slowly<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.200> it<00:04:16.290> will<00:04:16.470> pop<00:04:16.710> out<00:04:16.980> and<00:04:17.430> slowly

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
slowly and it will pop out and slowly

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.870 
slowly and it will pop out and slowly
pry<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.840> down<00:04:18.989> from<00:04:19.350> around<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:19.950> headliner<00:04:20.280> at

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
pry it down from around the headliner at

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.760 
pry it down from around the headliner at
one<00:04:21.060> screw<00:04:21.330> left<00:04:21.540> and<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:21.930> headliner<00:04:22.320> should

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
one screw left and the headliner should

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.850 
one screw left and the headliner should
drop<00:04:23.730> out<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.330> let's<00:04:25.200> cross<00:04:25.410> our<00:04:25.530> fingers<00:04:25.680> and

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
drop out so let's cross our fingers and

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.060 
drop out so let's cross our fingers and
hope<00:04:26.010> it<00:04:26.190> works

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
hope it works

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.290 
hope it works
okay<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.190> headliner<00:04:29.550> is<00:04:29.670> loose<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:30.060> haven't

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
okay the headliner is loose I haven't

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.660 
okay the headliner is loose I haven't
dropped<00:04:30.420> it<00:04:30.660> much<00:04:30.920> someone<00:04:31.920> else<00:04:32.070> suggested

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
dropped it much someone else suggested

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:36.410 
dropped it much someone else suggested
in<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.880> thread<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:34.220> use<00:04:35.220> your<00:04:35.520> headrest<00:04:36.120> to

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
in the thread to use your headrest to

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.240 
in the thread to use your headrest to
prop<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.110> up<00:04:37.200> so<00:04:37.380> it<00:04:37.470> doesn't<00:04:37.500> drop<00:04:37.830> down<00:04:38.070> too

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
prop it up so it doesn't drop down too

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.160 
prop it up so it doesn't drop down too
much<00:04:38.400> so<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.700> don't<00:04:38.850> risk<00:04:39.030> creasing<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:39.690> so

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
much so you don't risk creasing it so

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.630 
much so you don't risk creasing it so
I'm<00:04:40.230> going<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:40.440> slowly<00:04:40.650> lower<00:04:40.950> my<00:04:41.190> head<00:04:41.370> rest

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
I'm going to slowly lower my head rest

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.600 
I'm going to slowly lower my head rest
and<00:04:41.940> let<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:42.930> drop<00:04:43.140> down<00:04:43.200> on<00:04:43.710> there<00:04:46.280> okay<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:47.340> I

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
and let it drop down on there okay so I

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.130 
and let it drop down on there okay so I
got<00:04:47.760> my<00:04:47.880> headliner<00:04:48.300> dropped<00:04:48.630> down<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.840> little

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
got my headliner dropped down a little

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.720 
got my headliner dropped down a little
bit<00:04:49.350> I'm<00:04:49.590> not<00:04:49.620> I<00:04:49.980> don't<00:04:50.100> want<00:04:50.250> to<00:04:50.400> pull<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.640> down

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
bit I'm not I don't want to pull it down

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.560 
bit I'm not I don't want to pull it down
any<00:04:51.060> further<00:04:51.380> because<00:04:52.380> there<00:04:52.590> is<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:52.830> little

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
any further because there is a little

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.740 
any further because there is a little
crease<00:04:54.570> forming<00:04:55.050> up<00:04:55.170> by<00:04:55.320> my<00:04:55.560> B<00:04:55.800> pillar

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
crease forming up by my B pillar

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.380 
crease forming up by my B pillar
hopefully<00:04:57.750> that<00:04:58.430> it's<00:04:59.430> okay<00:04:59.700> once<00:04:59.910> I<00:05:00.030> pop<00:05:00.210> it

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
hopefully that it's okay once I pop it

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.330 
hopefully that it's okay once I pop it
back<00:05:00.570> up<00:05:00.810> there<00:05:01.250> they'll<00:05:02.250> continue<00:05:02.550> creasing

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
back up there they'll continue creasing

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.130 
back up there they'll continue creasing
but

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
but

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:13.590

there's going to be a tight squeeze so
we'll<00:05:19.420> see<00:05:19.660> I<00:05:20.070> can<00:05:21.070> get<00:05:21.220> that<00:05:22.350> all<00:05:23.350> right

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
we'll see I can get that all right

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.640 
we'll see I can get that all right
that's<00:05:25.030> the<00:05:25.060> first<00:05:25.120> two<00:05:25.540> out<00:05:25.690> it's<00:05:26.200> a<00:05:26.260> bit<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.530> a

that's the first two out it's a bit of a

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.880 
that's the first two out it's a bit of a
more<00:05:27.040> of<00:05:27.070> a<00:05:27.190> struggle<00:05:27.520> than<00:05:27.870> anticipated

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
more of a struggle than anticipated

there's a dust cover underneath it has

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.760 
there's a dust cover underneath it has
little<00:05:32.890> Clips<00:05:33.310> have<00:05:33.970> to<00:05:34.090> be<00:05:34.180> popped<00:05:34.420> out<00:05:34.690> I<00:05:34.960> had

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
little Clips have to be popped out I had

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.950 
little Clips have to be popped out I had
to<00:05:35.890> pop<00:05:36.100> my<00:05:38.070> rear<00:05:39.070> washer<00:05:39.520> fluid<00:05:39.670> line<00:05:40.030> out<00:05:40.360> get

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
to pop my rear washer fluid line out get

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.950 
to pop my rear washer fluid line out get
that<00:05:40.990> out<00:05:41.350> and<00:05:41.980> it<00:05:42.130> opens<00:05:42.430> up<00:05:42.580> a<00:05:42.730> cavity<00:05:43.300> light

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
that out and it opens up a cavity light

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.220 
that out and it opens up a cavity light
here<00:05:47.820> then<00:05:48.820> you<00:05:48.970> can<00:05:49.120> see<00:05:49.300> the<00:05:49.390> two<00:05:49.570> pins<00:05:49.870> for

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
here then you can see the two pins for

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.350 
here then you can see the two pins for
the<00:05:50.290> far<00:05:50.530> end<00:05:50.770> right<00:05:51.460> there<00:05:52.020> you<00:05:53.020> look<00:05:53.170> in<00:05:53.320> here

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
the far end right there you look in here

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.210 
the far end right there you look in here
you<00:05:55.360> got<00:05:55.510> the<00:05:55.630> big<00:05:55.810> and<00:05:56.170> the<00:05:56.380> small<00:05:56.470> pins<00:05:57.010> in

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
you got the big and the small pins in

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.390 
you got the big and the small pins in
here<00:05:59.040> so<00:06:00.040> I<00:06:00.660> had<00:06:01.660> to<00:06:01.780> take<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.110> big<00:06:02.290> pin<00:06:02.590> slide

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
here so I had to take the big pin slide

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.610 
here so I had to take the big pin slide
it<00:06:03.550> forward<00:06:03.760> pull<00:06:04.600> it<00:06:04.690> back<00:06:04.870> between<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.410> two

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
it forward pull it back between the two

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.430 
it forward pull it back between the two
hinges<00:06:06.130> here<00:06:06.760> and<00:06:06.970> then<00:06:07.419> drop<00:06:07.660> it<00:06:07.810> down<00:06:07.960> and

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
hinges here and then drop it down and

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.060 
hinges here and then drop it down and

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.969 
take the other side part all right two
new<00:06:27.100> struts<00:06:27.430> in<00:06:28.080> hatch<00:06:29.080> actually<00:06:29.530> supports

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
new struts in hatch actually supports

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.860 
new struts in hatch actually supports
itself<00:06:30.280> by<00:06:30.520> itself<00:06:30.760> just<00:06:30.880> with<00:06:31.210> these<00:06:31.360> on<00:06:31.630> this

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
itself by itself just with these on this

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.530 
itself by itself just with these on this
side<00:06:32.080> on<00:06:32.290> but<00:06:32.580> the<00:06:33.580> other<00:06:33.760> side<00:06:33.940> in<00:06:34.060> a<00:06:34.120> second

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
side on but the other side in a second

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.130 
side on but the other side in a second
so<00:06:35.470> quick<00:06:36.100> note<00:06:36.570> make<00:06:37.570> sure<00:06:37.600> you<00:06:37.870> have<00:06:37.990> this

so quick note make sure you have this

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.080 
so quick note make sure you have this
outer<00:06:38.410> hatch<00:06:38.770> fully<00:06:39.310> position<00:06:39.850> where<00:06:40.000> it

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:40.090 
outer hatch fully position where it

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.700 
outer hatch fully position where it
needs<00:06:40.270> to<00:06:40.360> be<00:06:40.450> before<00:06:40.960> you<00:06:41.140> click<00:06:41.380> the<00:06:41.500> front

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
needs to be before you click the front

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.330 
needs to be before you click the front
part<00:06:41.950> on<00:06:42.100> if<00:06:42.940> you<00:06:43.060> leave<00:06:43.210> it<00:06:43.330> in<00:06:43.419> the<00:06:43.510> center

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
part on if you leave it in the center

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:46.650 
part on if you leave it in the center
here<00:06:45.340> between<00:06:45.700> them<00:06:45.820> like<00:06:45.940> I<00:06:46.060> had<00:06:46.240> to<00:06:46.419> to<00:06:46.510> get

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660 
here between them like I had to to get

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.650 
here between them like I had to to get
it<00:06:46.780> in<00:06:46.960> yeah<00:06:47.919> pop<00:06:48.220> trap<00:06:48.520> clip<00:06:48.760> back<00:06:48.910> off<00:06:49.150> before

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
it in yeah pop trap clip back off before

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.620 
it in yeah pop trap clip back off before
you<00:06:49.840> can<00:06:50.140> put<00:06:50.560> it<00:06:50.650> on<00:06:50.710> the<00:06:50.830> outside<00:06:51.419> so<00:06:52.419> make

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:52.630 
you can put it on the outside so make

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.659 
you can put it on the outside so make
sure<00:06:52.660> I<00:06:53.350> put<00:06:53.650> that<00:06:53.830> one<00:06:53.979> in<00:06:54.100> first<00:06:54.280> cuz<00:06:54.520> it's

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:54.669 
sure I put that one in first cuz it's

00:06:54.669 --> 00:06:56.460 
sure I put that one in first cuz it's
bigger<00:06:55.300> it's<00:06:55.570> easier<00:06:55.810> to<00:06:55.900> get<00:06:55.990> the<00:06:56.110> small<00:06:56.350> one

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
bigger it's easier to get the small one

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.960 
bigger it's easier to get the small one
in<00:06:56.850> afterward<00:06:57.850> and<00:06:58.450> vice<00:06:58.660> versa<00:06:59.400> so<00:07:00.400> on<00:07:00.669> to<00:07:00.850> the

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:09.969 
piece of louver like Nick down use this

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:12.809 
piece of louver like Nick down use this
to<00:07:10.969> hold<00:07:11.150> it<00:07:11.300> up<00:07:11.389> anymore

00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:12.819 
to hold it up anymore
