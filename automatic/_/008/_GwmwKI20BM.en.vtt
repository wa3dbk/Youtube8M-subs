of traps here this is a safe spot to

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.490 
of traps here this is a safe spot to
stake<00:01:12.090> stay<00:01:13.090> here<00:01:13.360> check<00:01:13.630> out<00:01:13.810> the<00:01:13.930> pattern<00:01:14.320> of

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
stake stay here check out the pattern of

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.469 
stake stay here check out the pattern of
firing<00:01:14.800> patterns<00:01:15.369> are<00:01:15.640> quite<00:01:15.820> different<00:01:18.479> okay

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
firing patterns are quite different okay

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.980 
firing patterns are quite different okay
so<00:01:20.229> it's<00:01:20.350> safe<00:01:20.560> now<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:22.270> is<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.540> path<00:01:22.780> you

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
so it's safe now this is the path you

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.240

you<00:01:27.310> need<00:01:27.550> to<00:01:27.640> be<00:01:27.759> careful<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:28.300> don't<00:01:28.450> step<00:01:28.750> on

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
you need to be careful to don't step on

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.810 
you need to be careful to don't step on
this<00:01:29.080> one<00:01:29.380> this<00:01:29.770> one<00:01:30.009> is<00:01:30.039> critical<00:01:30.310> if<00:01:30.729> you

and<00:01:38.860> to<00:01:39.850> get<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.300> barrier<00:01:40.600> removal<00:01:40.750> scroll

00:01:41.309 --> 00:01:41.319 
and to get the barrier removal scroll

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:47.070 
and to get the barrier removal scroll
you<00:01:41.560> need<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.830> take<00:01:42.039> it<00:01:42.159> dig<00:01:42.369> this<00:01:42.550> place<00:01:46.080> and

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
you need to take it dig this place and

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.330 
you need to take it dig this place and
there<00:01:47.259> we<00:01:47.409> go<00:01:47.850> removing<00:01:48.850> magical<00:01:49.390> barriers

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
there we go removing magical barriers

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.559 
there we go removing magical barriers
now<00:01:51.340> we<00:01:51.399> just<00:01:51.610> need<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.909> get<00:01:52.030> to<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.240> barrier

00:01:52.559 --> 00:01:52.569 
now we just need to get to the barrier

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:54.359 
now we just need to get to the barrier
use<00:01:52.780> a<00:01:52.810> scroll<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.200> little<00:01:53.380> bit<00:01:53.800> thank<00:01:54.069> you<00:01:54.220> guys
