00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.040
 playstation 1 on playstation 2 usb 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.719
 flash drives and so on usb flash drive i 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.400
 already everything that needs to be recorded that is 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.210
 emulator 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:21.029
 emulator and game for playstation 1 and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.490
 he is not ashamed of the crowd in principle now 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.640
 will include by i show how to configure 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:30.179
 it happens sometimes with me 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.990
 old disc launcher Well he is not with 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:41.100
 first time 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:43.820
 read so now he should 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.820
 to start 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.609
 on and so launcher started 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:21.860
 and so not so in principle now we 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:29.870
 we can remove the disk you do not take out go to 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:34.190
 we go to the masses, but ps 2 x is an emulator ps2 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:38.110
 ps xr2 tone is the newest version here 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:40.370
 this one here is a gunib ok. elf we turn on 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.380
 now we need to be right 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.690
 configure ie principle i 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.740
 solemnly figured that in this in 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.740
 self includes 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.600
 it is correct to point this way ps2 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.450
 psx the way we do it in general is this one 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.160
 need to point out that now began 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.810
 dear ipad here it is here here ps2 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:04.700
 ps x food and pack . 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.220
 now you need to choose bios again 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.880
 are in the same folder 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.850
 ps2 psx ep 202 here is the top daddy bios 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.060
 principle, you can choose any, I choose 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:21.739
 usually some newer '97 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:27.320
 for example now we go back we press 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:32.300
 save on construction and now need 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:35.630
 open sidirom image again masses 300 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:40.180
 metal here is this bin file click 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:44.380
 run the emulator all went download 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.380
 flash drive blinked by the way 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:56.070
 Now a little thought, everything will open 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:10.290
 such things are going 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:13.810
 loading our balan with you 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.420
 principle there are games that are not all 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.250
 games are emulated but this game 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.099
 a little bit there is good with sound 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.620
 the start of the action time is running on 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:26.110
 now there is no such moment for example 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.319
 if for this noble choose long screw on 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:36.200
 that is, passing the tournament 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.200
 and even try to play the same 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:42.900
 constantly it is as if included as 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:50.540
 I constantly use this 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:50.540
 the very machine gun this sound 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.810
 yes there is a mind in the background 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.400
 This is not a game in general. 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.610
 I want to add 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.030
 heroes programmatically on 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.530
 playstation and some though some 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.720
 games absolutely 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.669
 in general, everything is perfect without any problems 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:32.750
 some do nothing 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:35.050
 and Valera are different so with 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.800
 yet it often depends on the distribution of 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.100
 how well the image is converted 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.229
 created and yes 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:48.229
 I want to say that principle 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.670
 play games you enjoy the game with you 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:52.050
 was 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.050
 channel romance is a service
