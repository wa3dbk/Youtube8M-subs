00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
 hi friends how are you this time 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:09.010
 I'm going to show you how to prepare a rich 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.140
 michelada and for that 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.760
 the first thing I'm going to do is salsa 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.800
 base 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.800
 takes you chamoy 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.450
 for that there are no measures this only 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.630
 can you explain 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.200
 more or less as it should be we're going 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.200
 to squeeze 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.610
 a lemon 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.150
 or half a lemon because we're 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.150
 without things 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.519
 today we are going to mix 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.770
 and we are going to add chilet in order not to 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.270
 find chile tajín can use 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.270
 chile piquín milled 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:04.050
 and this is good 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.390
 we are going to mix it well 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.170
 for us to stay we have to stay 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.170
 thick 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.350
 then I 'm not going to see it not only in 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.689
 Chile 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.229
 well I like that we have our sauce 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.440
 and here is that if it is well mixed 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:24.240
 let's cover our glass with this 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.980
 sauce 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.140
 so in this way 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.140
 and we are going to add ice 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.360
 and after that I 'm going to add it later 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.390
 a quarter of care that comes 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.370
 being cocktail of tomato and clam 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.190
 is this look 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:51.820
 I'm going to add a quarter of 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.820
 this glass 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.939
 more or less like that 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.110
 I 'm also going to add a little bit of 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.110
 valentina sauce 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.119
 about three drops of maggie seasoning this 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.119
 who sells the liquid 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.720
 and about two or three drops of sauce 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.720
 english 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.390
 there in the description I will leave the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.150
 name how you get it in usa in 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.840
 English 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.940
 Y 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.940
 I'm going to squeeze a lemon 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.379
 then I'm going to finally put a 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.379
 little salt 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.720
 and I'm going to mix it 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.980
 since they mixed it well because finally 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:02.159
 your beer will be irrigated 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.000
 from a can are about 2 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.000
 micheladas 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.240
 and there they are, this is the first 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.790
 michelada version 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.070
 and now I'm going to show you how to make another 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.260
 for the second version of the michelada 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:24.590
 the only thing that will change is how 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.350

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.380

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.950
 and the lemon and then we're going to put it 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:41.500

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.140
