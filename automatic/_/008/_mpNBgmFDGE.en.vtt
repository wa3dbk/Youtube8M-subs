00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
you're charging so let's say $5 and then

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.139 
you're charging so let's say $5 and then
you<00:01:02.760> can<00:01:02.940> enter<00:01:03.239> an<00:01:03.690> optional<00:01:03.780> note<00:01:05.149> or

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
card through the top and hit charge yeah

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.490 
card through the top and hit charge yeah
this<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.120> just<00:01:12.300> a<00:01:12.360> Costco<00:01:12.780> card<00:01:12.990> I'm<00:01:13.260> actually

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
this is just a Costco card I'm actually

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.530 
this is just a Costco card I'm actually
gonna<00:01:13.740> charge<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.310> right<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:15.180> because<00:01:15.390> I'm

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
gonna charge it right now because I'm

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.420 
gonna charge it right now because I'm
not<00:01:15.570> gonna<00:01:15.810> charge<00:01:16.050> myself<00:01:16.260> but<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:17.340> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
not gonna charge myself but it's a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.010 
not gonna charge myself but it's a
pretty<00:01:17.610> cool<00:01:17.850> idea<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.450> works<00:01:18.659> very<00:01:18.780> well

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
pretty cool idea and it works very well

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.330 
pretty cool idea and it works very well
there<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> low<00:01:20.159> processing<00:01:20.909> fee<00:01:21.170> like<00:01:22.340> 2.75

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
there is a low processing fee like 2.75

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.600 
there is a low processing fee like 2.75
so<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.690> $5<00:01:25.260> payment<00:01:25.770> you'll<00:01:25.920> actually<00:01:26.159> get

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
so on a $5 payment you'll actually get

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.080 
so on a $5 payment you'll actually get
about<00:01:27.170> 471<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.200> think<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.820> test

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
about 471 I think that is I do the test

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.480 
about 471 I think that is I do the test
earlier<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.930> check<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.409> out<00:01:31.590> but<00:01:32.340> it's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
earlier to check that out but it's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.399 
earlier to check that out but it's
pretty<00:01:32.670> convenient<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.049> know<00:01:34.170> somebody

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
pretty convenient so you know somebody

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.899 
pretty convenient so you know somebody
owes<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.770> money<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.580> pay<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.790> in

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
owes you money they can pay you in

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.510 
owes you money they can pay you in
credit<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:37.200> they<00:01:37.350> say<00:01:37.530> they<00:01:37.680> don't<00:01:38.040> have<00:01:38.159> cash

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
credit and they say they don't have cash

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.200 
credit and they say they don't have cash
like<00:01:39.330> oh<00:01:39.540> well<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.799> actually<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:42.030> take<00:01:42.150> a

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
like oh well I actually can take a

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.149 
like oh well I actually can take a
credit<00:01:42.510> card<00:01:42.600> debit<00:01:42.960> card<00:01:43.080> so<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:43.979> pretty

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
credit card debit card so that's pretty

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.370 
credit card debit card so that's pretty
cool<00:01:44.490> very<00:01:44.880> convenient<00:01:45.270> just<00:01:45.810> wanted<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> show

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
cool very convenient just wanted to show

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.880 
cool very convenient just wanted to show
you<00:01:46.409> it

whatever this is called

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.350 
whatever this is called
simply<00:01:53.490> go<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:54.530> square<00:01:55.530> up<00:01:55.740> com<00:01:56.369> I'll<00:01:57.119> have

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
simply go to square up com I'll have

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.140 
simply go to square up com I'll have
that<00:01:57.510> link<00:01:57.780> be<00:01:58.200> low<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.770> they'll<00:01:59.700> send<00:01:59.970> it<00:02:00.030> to

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
that link be low and they'll send it to

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.560 
that link be low and they'll send it to
you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.170 
you
I<00:02:00.630> think<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.200> took<00:02:01.350> them<00:02:01.500> like<00:02:02.000> probably<00:02:03.000> five

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
I think it took them like probably five

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.260 
I think it took them like probably five
days<00:02:03.420> total<00:02:03.720> after<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.490> ordered<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.119> it's

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
days total after I ordered it so it's

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.089
