00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.060
 you li gasa man today we get 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.010
 found on call of duty 4 in ml gira to 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.210
 the old so my class and bazaars 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.439
 default place of the game so I 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.200
 will come back a little bit later when 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.210
 will talk about this game mode so very 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.130
 quickly the gameplay it's going to be a das 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.050
 does a pretty good score I find being 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.150
 given that returning to the old does 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.530
 do not get his life back, I 'm going to 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.390
 also talk a little bit right after the 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.170
 fashion beast but I still have this 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.000
 characteristics 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.290
 so I think I'm one of those words 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.510
 gameplay and I will try to send to 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.710
 coach side because right now me 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.420
 even given to these two chains 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.250
 we see on the youtube home page 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.140
 a lot of black ops the gameplay is 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.460
 very often at the pgw I have nothing against 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.020
 because I love this weapon I play it 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.340
 myself but it's true that it 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.110
 do not diversify too much so I have time 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.390
 to propose this little gap the comrades you 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.600
 will please a lot of you 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.160
 I feel then to speak a little bit 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.530
 characteristics of the girard fray 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.229
 old already we always start with the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.880
 same place so scorpions more m9 on 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.140
 double notice we do not recover his health 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.399
 so pay attention if you are taking 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.229
 balls it's a little bit anyway 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.340
 again ben voila you want to keep a 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.729
 little bit in your body we'll say that 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.009
 like that 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.479
 and also you have to pick them up 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.530
 parterre and assets that there is no 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.510
 all the unique assets all the weapons 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.700
 it depends how it worked 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.260
 general ya mastodon ya cac 40 is 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.290
 in general and there is strong opposition 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.939
 that's what comes up most often 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.799
 in general it depends on the maps range 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.869
 pretty well done the thing i find 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.220
 personally so I'm going quickly 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.380
 present my chain and then after we go 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.380
 attack on really the heart of the subject 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.210
 which we will really talk about the scrum 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.290
 general by the ansÃ©s excuse me so we 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.610
 will talk a little bit about his points 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.420
 strong his weak points et cetera and 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.680
 so 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.610
 I can just a little bit his microphone 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.729
 because I see more in the red 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.829
 here is the lamb's lettuce is no I know 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.869
 I'm doing the tiling meeting 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.189
 I stammered baby you do multi gaming 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.409
 so I'm 13 years old my name is 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.369
 benjamin I made videos since at 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.799
 almost fight 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.630
 hence May 4, 2012 so this is the 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.179
 change the birthday what I had 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.250
 received from my microphone 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.569
 I do not know why we follow the lifting 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.010
 reald really bad just because he 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.030
 was 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.230
 I had received my microphone to my 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.680
 anniversary of the coup I had started 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.879
 Youtube 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.739
 at that moment so that's it if you pass 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:23.480
 see walk a pass and see two of 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.590
 my main videos that works the 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.599
 more on the clear channel right now 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.069
 it's the high moor my team ties it so 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.599
 everything explained in 11 minutes 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.370
 we explain the first 5 hours 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.480
 the five conditions we will say but 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.730
 because we have a zombie and we were a 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.959
 little bit concentrated so here and also 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.519
 subscribers instead so you we 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.319
 propose a place on moder means 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.669
 three or black ops the coop of that will come 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.260
 at christmas because we have not yet all 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:44.540
 both of them I put them my colleague 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.010
 micromega does not have it so you do not 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.780
 propose a class with a challenge to the 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.829
 key or not and we will try to 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.329
 realize like for example doing a 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.790
 neck with arms or without success 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.379
 or another day we had proposed to 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.269
 unlock 1st with a backlog of 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.409
 kibo vectors without aiming solid face 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.209
 we had not succeeded so it was 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.319
 whoever was the biggest score so 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.549
 here I do not know why to meet again 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.829
 chair it would be really nice 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.909
 no need for you will just see and 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.500
 tell a little bit what you think of 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.719
 my videos would do me a lot 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.790
 pleasure so beat we 'll talk about the 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:12.470
 shemale old in itself 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.900
 as mid-June to the old so the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.909
 strengths so the ties desert to 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.829
 spawn ocr you spawn and you all have 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:21.500
 a new man and a scorpion so that 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.299
 avoids the disadvantages for example 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.439
 that we go online the small level 1 which 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:26.840
 starts with 100 m 9 

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:28.699
 so level 55 that starts with his 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.859
 ak 47 gold and years of opposition 

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:32.419
 here it is still not too many 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.370
 cleavages and there we are really all those 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.780
 who breaks them to the spawn so you have to 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.579
 go find the weapons be puts so 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.790
 that's really a very good point for 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:42.139
 me then we can talk so the 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.790
 no real health recovery 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.409
 reappearance health is my fist 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.819
 and at the same time is bad so the 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.169
 only bad think I finally found that 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.790
 I will come back a little talk 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.909
 because it can be good that's it 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.829
 avoid lows also in his corner and 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.030
 of expectations since we notice double that's it 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.879
 we do not recover so we need a small 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.109
 little rock have reflexes that I 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.629
 think a little bit of that 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.769
 king of europe i have you etc etc 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:06.199
 after the obligation to take weapons 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.759
 ground so it is and strengths 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:10.460
 really a very good point because if 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:13.310
 you do the whole thing with 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.690
 there the 9 beats you have galley so that 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.340
 forced to rock to fetch 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.540
 assets so I 'm not too 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.610
 because I suffered all the time 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.500
 side of the map the a47 and the mastodon 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.650
 finally this is my strategy talk to them 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.360
 just after and also so I find 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.890
 balancing and germs on the maps and 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.660
 sells well done so that is his 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.610
 little one confessed to me 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.380
 machine guns on this map the age is 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.960
 rather assault rifles like AK 47 g 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.520
 36 and I do not really know what has other 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.660
 but it's really the two I retained 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.150
 finally that I saw in this map because 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.500
 that I 'm not really the biggest 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.600
 player of this game mode really 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.890
 rarely between 2.4 and the same 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.510
 time right now I came to play at 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.560
 that because I was bothered I want to do 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.170
 my classes so no longer play online 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.940
 in short, spend my life so we do not care 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.250
 a little bit so here I have a little 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.560
 just about everything says about strengths 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.730
 of this game mode so we'll talk to 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.070
 this point does so it's the recovery 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.660
 health it's a shame that there is 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.250
 no me I'm dim at least 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.170
 because here's no one going to see you 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.700
 there it is now you will see 

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.990
 I 'm going to fart by the car then 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.810
 I am three meters away it is abused 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.160
 watch and balms what the fuck the 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.660
 car three meters from me and I'm 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.080
 fart finally that's really 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.310
 weird but good result we can say 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.140
 that it's a very good game mode 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.900
 really very fun I advise you if 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.060
 you want to spend a little fun part 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.440
 on coole four children a good fashion 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:29.630
 game but you still have to have a 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.190
 minimum of reflexes and strategy in 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.020
 this part so I stay is all the 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.360
 time with 47 and mastodon will not be able 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.830
 so have limited ammunition of ak 47 and 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.540
 have my this gift so you see I have a 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.250
 connection an American connection to 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.360
 day in good galley and there I speak 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.620
 in front of a black screen so I tell you to 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.600
 soon byte world i hope the 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.230
 biotherm checks will accept and 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.230
 further
