00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
whenever they're gonna release a really

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.769 
whenever they're gonna release a really
big<00:00:23.160> pack<00:00:23.400> or<00:00:23.580> time<00:00:23.760> I'm<00:00:24.000> expecting<00:00:24.630> them<00:00:24.750> to

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
big pack or time I'm expecting them to

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.810 
big pack or time I'm expecting them to
do<00:00:25.019> for<00:00:25.199> Team<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.470> Year<00:00:25.609> prices<00:00:26.609> are<00:00:26.730> gonna

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
do for Team of the Year prices are gonna

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.349 
do for Team of the Year prices are gonna
go<00:00:27.000> way<00:00:27.390> way<00:00:27.420> down<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.800> means<00:00:29.220> face<00:00:29.910> cards

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
go way way down so that means face cards

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.319 
go way way down so that means face cards
most<00:00:30.599> likely<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> doubt<00:00:31.859> they'd<00:00:32.070> redo<00:00:32.550> like

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
most likely I doubt they'd redo like

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.110 
most likely I doubt they'd redo like
what<00:00:33.450> they<00:00:33.570> did<00:00:33.690> for<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:34.020> 2014<00:00:35.120> Christmas

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
what they did for the 2014 Christmas

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.700 
what they did for the 2014 Christmas
packs<00:00:36.329> would<00:00:36.540> they<00:00:36.630> put<00:00:36.809> every<00:00:37.200> card<00:00:37.440> back

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
packs would they put every card back

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.900 
packs would they put every card back
into<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> packs<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.520> don't<00:00:38.670> think<00:00:38.820> they're

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
into the packs I don't think they're

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.979 
into the packs I don't think they're
gonna<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.180> that<00:00:39.210> but<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.500> most<00:00:40.680> part<00:00:40.860> um

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
gonna do that but for the most part um

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.450 
gonna do that but for the most part um
they're<00:00:42.989> gonna<00:00:43.200> have<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> big<00:00:43.770> pack<00:00:44.040> probably

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
they're gonna have a big pack probably

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.920 
they're gonna have a big pack probably
the<00:00:44.550> ultimate<00:00:44.610> pack<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.270> probably<00:00:45.539> won't<00:00:45.750> do

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
the ultimate pack they probably won't do

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.720 
the ultimate pack they probably won't do
bigger<00:00:46.140> than<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:47.010> that's<00:00:47.250> gonna<00:00:47.399> cook

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
bigger than that but that's gonna cook

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.850 
bigger than that but that's gonna cook
that's<00:00:48.000> going<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.210> drive<00:00:48.390> base<00:00:48.750> cards<00:00:49.260> prices

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
that's going to drive base cards prices

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.560 
that's going to drive base cards prices
way<00:00:50.520> down<00:00:50.789> because<00:00:51.030> they're<00:00:51.120> gonna<00:00:51.210> be<00:00:51.360> more

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
way down because they're gonna be more

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.910 
way down because they're gonna be more
there's<00:00:52.140> gonna<00:00:52.230> be<00:00:52.320> more<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.590> them<00:00:52.680> available

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
there's gonna be more of them available

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.740 
there's gonna be more of them available
it's<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.370> simple<00:00:53.640> supply<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.239> demand<00:00:54.360> pretty

the<00:01:36.990> design<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:37.590> paying<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:37.890> pretty

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the design that you're paying for pretty

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.819 
the design that you're paying for pretty
much<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.240> say<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.200> invest<00:01:40.740> in

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
much so I say not to invest in

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.460 
much so I say not to invest in
November's<00:01:41.400> I'm<00:01:41.549> saying<00:01:41.939> seldom<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.810> pretty

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
November's I'm saying seldom as pretty

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.260 
November's I'm saying seldom as pretty
much<00:01:43.619> as<00:01:43.770> fast<00:01:43.979> as<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.310> can<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:44.759> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
much as fast as you can because the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.120 
much as fast as you can because the
price<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.570> right<00:01:45.750> now<00:01:46.049> ridiculously<00:01:46.920> high

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
price is right now ridiculously high

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.149

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
on xbox and that's crazy because his

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
on xbox and that's crazy because his
team<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:54.990> year<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.170> not<00:01:55.380> gonna<00:01:55.619> go<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:55.979> 1.1
