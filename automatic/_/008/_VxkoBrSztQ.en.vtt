00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.660
 love elder scrolls online friends my 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.519
 name Sirius and today I want 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.300
 start a guild together with you 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.370
 or 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.469
 I'll start a guild now and if you can 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.370
 you can have it with you 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.260
 to be there 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.590
 this works as follows 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.720
 really just that on your keyboard 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.689
 press and then the following will appear 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.970
 option against create and join 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.640
 Guilds are an excellent one 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.599
 Means to travel with others 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.480
 to join them in the 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.250
 world of tamriel can encounter these 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.170
 allow large and permanent groups 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.910
 they play together in common 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.640
 aim to work and special things 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.320
 How to unlock the guild load 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.940
 Whatever we share one for 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.219
 Guild loading but then would have 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.780
 Maybe we'll need yours 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.460
 Guild structured or free 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.140
 shape as you wish speak 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.120
 off with your guild members and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.879
 beats huge battles against others 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.649
 get into the alliance and then mine 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.510
 favorite sentence in this text and yet 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.789
 much more 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.010
 these are nothing else occurred to the 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.409
 Guild with clear the many membership 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.450
 is bound to all user id and up 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.090
 So a total of five guilds are limited 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.490
 You can have a total of five of these private ones 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.860
 Guilds join all characters below 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.570
 your user id will then access 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.159
 the respective guilds have kicked then 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.470
 consist guild at or establishes your 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.850
 own guild blah blah blah blah blah so we 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.430
 will now create your own guild 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.320
 You can only guild one way 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.509
 create by the guild 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.119
 Leader is okay or something I would have 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.250
 Now let's do it like here 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.520
 continue to follow her certain guild name 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.619
 select and then within which 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.970
 allianz belongs to these funds and that 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.810
 Of course , that's the old mary 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.630
 dominate 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.840
 the first act or the fall 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.340
 alliance and now you can already see 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.070
 guild alliance the alliance of yours 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.920
 character is the aluminum so me 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.439
 I'm in the woods 11 and that's why mine will 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.700
 Pictures also within the old miri 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.140
 Dominion be settled 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.060
 so and I have now considered 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.300
 which good name we want to forgive 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.310
 and that's a community guild 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.769
 I thought that's me 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.209
 seriously, I may not be blood knows 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.519
 you would have a better name left 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.230
 but I think I wanted that 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.790
 first call sirius alliance and then 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.819
 I somehow found sirius drinking blood 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.410
 I found is somehow even better and 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.349
 I hope that is in your senses and 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.629
 interest and now bock look at it 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.940
 how the whole works perfectly 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:38.650
 Blood Alliance creates the first user 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.239
 each ex sirius x1 of 1 members 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.840
 here if then the members sorted 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.819
 and managed and the ranks and you can 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.470
 to show the persistent and then 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.200
 you can just as well 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.400
 determine what the respective rank 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.930
 may not ask me now so please 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.340
 this is just what happened here 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.810
 is me then there is a church bench 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.640
 is there then sales afterwards 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.519
 campaigns will create such a load 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.260
 I think that works starting from 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.280
 ten members go that cares here 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.780
 see eggs here above 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.730
 The Guild Bank is not yet available 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.440
 from ten members there you can 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.989
 trade items and believe something like that 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.100
 I and the guild invite 50 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.780
 members 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.790
 so now asks me once not as the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.049
 serious blood alliance but join 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.420
 somehow that must work 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.030
 I would like to know 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:29.329
 and the video post is definitely 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.880

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:34.250

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.500
