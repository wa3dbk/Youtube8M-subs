00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.129 
another one of my favorite tricks just
to<00:05:40.150> kind<00:05:40.330> of<00:05:40.360> pull<00:05:40.569> the<00:05:40.659> whole<00:05:40.840> look<00:05:40.960> together

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
to kind of pull the whole look together

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.010 
to kind of pull the whole look together
is<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:42.550> take<00:05:42.669> a<00:05:42.729> bronzer<00:05:43.240> and<00:05:43.419> just<00:05:43.569> soften<00:05:43.930> the

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
is to take a bronzer and just soften the

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.629 
is to take a bronzer and just soften the
entire<00:05:44.349> look<00:05:44.620> so<00:05:44.830> it<00:05:44.889> just<00:05:45.039> looks<00:05:45.219> like<00:05:45.340> her

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
entire look so it just looks like her

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.309 
entire look so it just looks like her
she<00:05:45.849> doesn't<00:05:45.939> have<00:05:46.270> too<00:05:46.539> much<00:05:46.689> of<00:05:46.870> a<00:05:46.930> pop<00:05:47.139> of

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
she doesn't have too much of a pop of

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.219 
she doesn't have too much of a pop of
color<00:05:47.560> it<00:05:47.830> just<00:05:47.979> kind<00:05:48.129> of<00:05:48.189> melds<00:05:48.639> together<00:05:49.229> so

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
color it just kind of melds together so

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:51.270 
color it just kind of melds together so
I'm<00:05:50.319> going<00:05:50.439> to<00:05:50.469> start<00:05:50.680> at<00:05:50.800> the<00:05:50.830> base<00:05:51.009> of<00:05:51.069> the

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
I'm going to start at the base of the

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.129 
I'm going to start at the base of the
forehead<00:05:51.699> and<00:05:51.939> again<00:05:52.180> lightly<00:05:52.629> touching<00:05:53.020> your
