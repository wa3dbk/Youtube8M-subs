 You who watched the video and something 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.359
 before you finish 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.889
 If you finish doing everything, it's e 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.620
 put a wall on top 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:58.109
 if you can not then 1 on top of 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.479
 solar block of the light block because 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.359
 no he will not he will always stay 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:06.930
 closed will never get energy out of it 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:09.840
 for it to remain open so always leaves the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.639
 block is on top open 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.389
 no matter if you have yes it will not 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:16.979
 to not operate the water 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.979
 lighting keeps passing but has been 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:21.430
 so the light signal will not pass 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.590
 so it's over, right? 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.600
 so many birds can be understood and I know that 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.919
 I just talked not so much upstairs 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.720
 so unless you let someone 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.110
 something like this so you can be 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.360
 patent that without talking that was it 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.139
 It was good to have been there and even the 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.139
