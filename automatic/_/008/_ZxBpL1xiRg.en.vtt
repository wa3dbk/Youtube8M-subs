00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.800 

we<00:03:05.769> want<00:03:05.980> to<00:03:06.069> quit<00:03:06.370> processing<00:03:07.060> for<00:03:07.480> now<00:03:07.569> and

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
we want to quit processing for now and

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.070 
we want to quit processing for now and
restart<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.700> open<00:03:13.030> up<00:03:13.090> three<00:03:13.420> phase<00:03:13.569> PDE

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
restart it so open up three phase PDE

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.059 
restart it so open up three phase PDE
again<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.760> now<00:03:19.690> once<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.349> could<00:03:20.530> play<00:03:20.799> it

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
again and now once you could play it

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:31.720 
again and now once you could play it
should<00:03:21.540> give<00:03:22.540> you<00:03:22.690> your<00:03:23.080> 3d<00:03:23.590> point<00:03:23.980> cloud
