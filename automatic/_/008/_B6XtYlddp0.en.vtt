00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.130 
let's check it out okay guys so you've
probably<00:00:20.550> heard<00:00:20.850> about<00:00:21.000> vo2<00:00:21.689> max<00:00:21.930> before

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
probably heard about vo2 max before

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.200 
probably heard about vo2 max before
maybe<00:00:23.039> you've<00:00:23.279> discussed<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.880> with<00:00:24.090> your

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
maybe you've discussed that with your

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.210 
maybe you've discussed that with your
fellow<00:00:24.420> cyclists<00:00:25.050> maybe<00:00:25.230> you've<00:00:25.439> already

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
fellow cyclists maybe you've already

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.339 
fellow cyclists maybe you've already
done<00:00:26.670> some<00:00:27.000> kind<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.300> view<00:00:27.449> -<00:00:27.689> max<00:00:27.900> intervals

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
done some kind of view - max intervals

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.349 
done some kind of view - max intervals
as<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> part<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:28.980> your<00:00:29.130> training<00:00:29.310> program<00:00:29.820> well

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
as a part of your training program well

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.260 
as a part of your training program well
in<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.279> video<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.579> going<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.880> share<00:00:33.059> with

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
in this video I'm going to share with

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.110 
in this video I'm going to share with
you<00:00:33.480> what<00:00:34.290> vo2<00:00:34.739> max<00:00:34.980> actually<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.640> why<00:00:36.030> it

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
you what vo2 max actually is why it

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
you what vo2 max actually is why it
matters<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.840> what<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.290> do<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.559> improve<00:00:37.890> it

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
matters and what we can do to improve it

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.470 
matters and what we can do to improve it
and<00:00:38.250> how<00:00:38.670> that's<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> affect<00:00:39.390> your

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
and how that's going to affect your

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.590 
and how that's going to affect your
cycling<00:00:39.930> performance<00:00:40.050> so<00:00:41.210> vo2<00:00:42.210> max<00:00:42.450> is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
cycling performance so vo2 max is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600 
cycling performance so vo2 max is
basically<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.320> maximum<00:00:43.860> amount<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.250> oxygen

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
basically the maximum amount of oxygen

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.840 
basically the maximum amount of oxygen
that<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.390> can<00:00:45.600> take<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.100> deliver<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.820> our

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that we can take in and deliver to our

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.560 
that we can take in and deliver to our
working<00:00:48.239> muscles<00:00:48.950> at<00:00:49.950> submaximal<00:00:50.579> or<00:00:51.000> maximal

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
working muscles at submaximal or maximal

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.959 
working muscles at submaximal or maximal
efforts<00:00:51.930> vo2<00:00:52.739> max<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.039> usually<00:00:53.489> expressed

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
efforts vo2 max is usually expressed

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.840 
efforts vo2 max is usually expressed
through<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:55.320> milliliters<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> oxygen<00:00:56.610> used

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
through in milliliters of oxygen used

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.660 
through in milliliters of oxygen used
per<00:00:57.329> minute<00:00:57.719> per<00:00:58.050> kilogram<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.829> body<00:00:59.520> weight

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
per minute per kilogram of body weight

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.670 
per minute per kilogram of body weight
so<00:01:01.910> usually<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.210> high-level<00:01:03.960> kind<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.439> elite

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
so usually the high-level kind of elite

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.219 
so usually the high-level kind of elite
and<00:01:04.920> pro<00:01:05.070> cyclist<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:05.790> will<00:01:05.939> have<00:01:06.150> their<00:01:07.049> vo2

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and pro cyclist they will have their vo2

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.679 
and pro cyclist they will have their vo2
max<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:07.799> going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.130> about<00:01:08.400> 70<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.090> 80<00:01:09.119> so

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
max is going to be about 70 to 80 so

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.500 
max is going to be about 70 to 80 so
that's<00:01:09.869> really<00:01:10.140> high<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:11.420> cyclists<00:01:12.420> are

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
that's really high and cyclists are

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.289 
that's really high and cyclists are
basically<00:01:12.869> some<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.520> you<00:01:14.520> know<00:01:14.549> athletes

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
basically some of the you know athletes

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.300 
basically some of the you know athletes
that<00:01:15.390> are<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.659> ranks<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.680> rank<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.040> highest

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
that are the ranks the rank the highest

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.240 
that are the ranks the rank the highest
in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.240> world<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.630> all<00:01:18.780> sports<00:01:19.320> when<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.040> comes

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
in the world of all sports when it comes

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.100 
in the world of all sports when it comes
to<00:01:20.460> how<00:01:20.610> high<00:01:20.850> they're<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.509> -<00:01:21.659> max<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.049> be

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
to how high they're really - max can be

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.940 
to how high they're really - max can be
so<00:01:22.890> when<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.670> comes<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.060> what<00:01:24.720> really<00:01:25.080> what<00:01:25.830> it

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
so when it comes to what really what it

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.300 
so when it comes to what really what it
really<00:01:26.100> means<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.820> vo2<00:01:27.210> max<00:01:27.420> actually<00:01:27.689> is

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
really means what vo2 max actually is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.190 
really means what vo2 max actually is
basically<00:01:29.310> put<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.210> kind<00:01:30.450> of<00:01:30.509> simply<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
basically put it kind of simply in a

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.149 
basically put it kind of simply in a
very<00:01:32.000> simple<00:01:33.000> terms<00:01:33.270> vo2<00:01:34.229> max<00:01:34.470> determines

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
very simple terms vo2 max determines

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.190 
very simple terms vo2 max determines
your<00:01:35.280> aerobic<00:01:35.909> endurance<00:01:36.200> potential

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
your aerobic endurance potential

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.280 
your aerobic endurance potential
basically<00:01:37.950> how<00:01:38.189> big<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.759> your<00:01:39.090> aerobic<00:01:39.810> engine

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
basically how big is your aerobic engine

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.389 
basically how big is your aerobic engine
that's<00:01:40.860> determined<00:01:41.430> by<00:01:41.579> your<00:01:41.909> vo2<00:01:42.420> max<00:01:42.659> now

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
that's determined by your vo2 max now

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.139 
that's determined by your vo2 max now
when<00:01:44.399> it<00:01:44.520> comes<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.920> when<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:46.950> comes<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.490> -<00:01:47.790> how

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
when it comes to when it comes to - how

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.960 
when it comes to when it comes to - how
much<00:01:48.299> how<00:01:48.840> trainable<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.130> have<00:01:50.640> good<00:01:50.909> and

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
much how trainable it is I have good and

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.460 
much how trainable it is I have good and
bad<00:01:51.119> news<00:01:51.479> and<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.020> Turner<00:01:52.229> that's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
bad news and that the Turner that's

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.910 
bad news and that the Turner that's
going<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.829> based<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.540> what<00:01:54.540> level<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.320> you

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
going to be based on what level of you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.410 
going to be based on what level of you
know<00:01:56.040> kind<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.430> performance<00:01:57.060> you're<00:01:57.210> right

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
know kind of performance you're right

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.399 
know kind of performance you're right
you<00:01:57.750> are<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.079> right<00:01:58.350> now<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.930> said<00:02:01.229> that

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
you are at right now so it's said that

to improve your vo2 max on the other

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.520 
to improve your vo2 max on the other
hand<00:02:26.460> if<00:02:26.610> you<00:02:26.820> are<00:02:26.850> an<00:02:27.420> elite<00:02:27.750> cyclist<00:02:28.380> or

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
hand if you are an elite cyclist or

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.800 
hand if you are an elite cyclist or
maybe<00:02:28.710> you<00:02:29.220> know<00:02:29.340> cat<00:02:29.610> one<00:02:29.820> or<00:02:29.970> two<00:02:30.120> Rider<00:02:30.390> or

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
maybe you know cat one or two Rider or

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.530 
maybe you know cat one or two Rider or
you're<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:31.110> pro<00:02:31.380> maybe<00:02:31.740> in<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.700> case<00:02:32.940> you've

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
you're a pro maybe in that case you've

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.660 
you're a pro maybe in that case you've
probably<00:02:33.840> already<00:02:34.230> reached<00:02:34.709> your<00:02:34.890> vo2<00:02:35.160> max

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
probably already reached your vo2 max

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.690 
probably already reached your vo2 max
and<00:02:35.910> you're<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:37.170> percentage<00:02:37.650> of<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.550> is

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
and you're the percentage of it that is

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.220 
and you're the percentage of it that is
general<00:02:38.970> genetically-determined<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.959> also

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
general genetically-determined is also

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.780 
general genetically-determined is also
higher<00:02:40.440> which<00:02:40.740> means<00:02:40.770> you<00:02:41.520> have<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.700> much

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
higher which means you have a much

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.770 
higher which means you have a much
smaller<00:02:42.510> kind<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.310> window<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.780> potential

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
smaller kind of window of potential

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.900 
smaller kind of window of potential
improvement<00:02:46.350> but<00:02:46.500> still<00:02:46.670> remembering<00:02:47.670> that

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
improvement but still remembering that

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.960 
improvement but still remembering that
about<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.930> know<00:02:49.080> 1%<00:02:49.790> difference<00:02:50.790> in

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
about you know 1% difference in

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.820 
about you know 1% difference in
performance<00:02:51.120> can<00:02:51.690> at<00:02:51.870> that<00:02:51.900> high<00:02:52.260> level<00:02:52.290> can

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
performance can at that high level can

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.229 
performance can at that high level can
really<00:02:53.100> mean<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.820> difference<00:02:54.180> between

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
really mean the difference between

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.000 
really mean the difference between
action<00:02:54.780> winning<00:02:55.050> the<00:02:55.200> race<00:02:55.350> or<00:02:55.620> being<00:02:55.830> in<00:02:55.920> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
action winning the race or being in the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.220 
action winning the race or being in the
top<00:02:56.190> 10<00:02:56.520> or<00:02:56.730> maybe<00:02:57.239> being<00:02:57.630> somewhere<00:02:58.050> in<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
top 10 or maybe being somewhere in the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.670 
top 10 or maybe being somewhere in the
middle<00:02:58.440> of<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.620> pack<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.480> either<00:03:00.480> way<00:03:00.750> we<00:03:01.440> want

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
middle of the pack so either way we want

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.830 
middle of the pack so either way we want
to<00:03:01.770> make<00:03:01.920> sure<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.400> we<00:03:02.820> implement<00:03:03.060> at<00:03:03.600> least

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
to make sure that we implement at least

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.800 
to make sure that we implement at least
once<00:03:04.170> a<00:03:04.380> week<00:03:04.590> vo2<00:03:05.550> max<00:03:06.000> intervals<00:03:06.570> in<00:03:06.720> order

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
once a week vo2 max intervals in order

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.010 
once a week vo2 max intervals in order
to<00:03:07.110> improve<00:03:07.580> and<00:03:08.580> kind<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.239> increase<00:03:09.660> our<00:03:09.840> view

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
to improve and kind of increase our view

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.370 
to improve and kind of increase our view
to<00:03:10.230> max<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:10.770> I<00:03:11.010> have<00:03:11.700> two<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.750> really<00:03:13.019> great

work to rest ratio okay so we're going

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.870 
work to rest ratio okay so we're going
to<00:03:24.989> spend<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.380> same<00:03:25.739> exact<00:03:26.190> amount<00:03:26.340> of<00:03:26.610> time

at<00:03:27.739> the<00:03:28.739> vo2<00:03:29.220> max<00:03:29.459> effort<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.920> rest

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
at the vo2 max effort and the rest

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.520 
at the vo2 max effort and the rest
period<00:03:32.519> following<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.120> so<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.989> best<00:03:34.260> way<00:03:34.500> to

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
period following it so the best way to

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.090 
period following it so the best way to
improve<00:03:35.220> your<00:03:35.280> vo2<00:03:35.880> max<00:03:36.120> and<00:03:36.420> raise<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.900> is<00:03:37.100> to

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
improve your vo2 max and raise it is to

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.360 
improve your vo2 max and raise it is to
perform<00:03:38.880> efforts<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.840> are<00:03:39.989> at<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.560> vo2<00:03:41.130> max

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
perform efforts that are at the vo2 max

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.840 
perform efforts that are at the vo2 max
level<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.920> here's<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.040> first<00:03:44.190> workout<00:03:44.640> for

you and one of my favorite workouts to

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.970 
you and one of my favorite workouts to
elicit<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.360> positive<00:03:48.780> response<00:03:49.170> here<00:03:49.470> it's

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
elicit the positive response here it's

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.720 
elicit the positive response here it's
going<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.340> be<00:03:50.570> three<00:03:51.570> minutes<00:03:51.780> on<00:03:52.730> three

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
going to be three minutes on three

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.470 
going to be three minutes on three
minutes<00:03:54.120> off<00:03:55.160> right<00:03:56.160> so<00:03:56.850> we<00:03:56.970> have<00:03:57.120> three

minutes off right so we have three

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.280 
minutes off right so we have three
minutes<00:03:57.660> at<00:03:58.049> vo2<00:03:58.709> max<00:03:58.920> effort<00:03:59.310> level<00:03:59.790> and

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
minutes at vo2 max effort level and

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.020 
minutes at vo2 max effort level and
three<00:04:01.290> minutes<00:04:01.620> rest<00:04:01.950> and<00:04:02.250> then<00:04:02.760> we're<00:04:02.880> going

cool down and stretch properly because

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.280 
cool down and stretch properly because
it<00:04:35.890> is<00:04:36.010> a<00:04:36.220> very<00:04:36.820> high<00:04:37.030> intensity<00:04:37.540> now<00:04:38.080> if<00:04:38.170> you

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
it is a very high intensity now if you

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.170 
it is a very high intensity now if you
can<00:04:38.440> see<00:04:38.650> here<00:04:38.890> three<00:04:39.220> times<00:04:39.430> three<00:04:39.850> minutes

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
can see here three times three minutes

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.350 
can see here three times three minutes
we<00:04:40.810> basically<00:04:41.440> end<00:04:41.650> up<00:04:41.860> at<00:04:42.160> if<00:04:42.850> done<00:04:43.330> properly

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
we basically end up at if done properly

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.780 
we basically end up at if done properly
at<00:04:44.200> nine<00:04:44.800> minutes<00:04:45.310> total<00:04:46.030> time<00:04:46.540> at<00:04:47.580> vo2<00:04:48.580> max

at nine minutes total time at vo2 max

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.610 
at nine minutes total time at vo2 max
level<00:04:49.030> this<00:04:49.330> is<00:04:49.480> going<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:49.810> elicit<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.260> very

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
level this is going to elicit a very

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.660 
level this is going to elicit a very
very<00:04:51.600> significant<00:04:52.600> positive<00:04:53.370> response<00:04:54.370> when

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
very significant positive response when

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.020 
very significant positive response when

at the same week you want to do them
once<00:05:03.970> per<00:05:04.330> week<00:05:04.360> so<00:05:04.900> this<00:05:05.350> is<00:05:05.440> going<00:05:05.560> to<00:05:05.620> be

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
once per week so this is going to be

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.660 
once per week so this is going to be
let's<00:05:05.980> say<00:05:06.160> week<00:05:06.400> one<00:05:06.700> here<00:05:07.800> right<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:09.040> week

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
let's say week one here right and week

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.430 
let's say week one here right and week
two<00:05:09.970> is<00:05:10.180> going<00:05:10.300> to<00:05:10.360> be<00:05:10.480> the<00:05:10.630> second<00:05:11.050> video<00:05:11.290> -

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
two is going to be the second video -

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.510 
two is going to be the second video -
max<00:05:11.650> workout<00:05:12.130> where<00:05:12.790> we're<00:05:12.970> going<00:05:13.180> to<00:05:13.240> do<00:05:14.520> 30

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
max workout where we're going to do 30

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:23.070 
max workout where we're going to do 30
seconds<00:05:16.920> on<00:05:17.920> and<00:05:18.790> 30<00:05:19.690> seconds<00:05:20.290> off<00:05:21.360> right<00:05:22.360> now

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
seconds on and 30 seconds off right now

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.980 
seconds on and 30 seconds off right now
if<00:05:23.770> you<00:05:24.340> see<00:05:24.370> here<00:05:24.610> we<00:05:25.510> have<00:05:25.690> a<00:05:25.720> much<00:05:25.960> shorter

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
if you see here we have a much shorter

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.250 
if you see here we have a much shorter
interval<00:05:26.950> so<00:05:27.160> 30<00:05:27.460> seconds<00:05:28.030> of<00:05:28.180> effort<00:05:29.050> that

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
interval so 30 seconds of effort that

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.550 
interval so 30 seconds of effort that
the<00:05:29.440> vo2<00:05:29.800> max<00:05:30.010> level<00:05:30.430> in<00:05:30.580> 30<00:05:31.150> seconds<00:05:31.720> rest<00:05:32.140> and

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
the vo2 max level in 30 seconds rest and

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.120 
the vo2 max level in 30 seconds rest and
we're<00:05:33.160> going<00:05:33.310> to<00:05:33.370> combine<00:05:33.550> this<00:05:34.030> ten<00:05:34.840> times

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
we're going to combine this ten times

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.610 
we're going to combine this ten times
right<00:05:36.130> so<00:05:36.730> you<00:05:37.270> can<00:05:37.450> see<00:05:37.630> here<00:05:37.990> that<00:05:38.110> 10<00:05:38.380> times

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
right so you can see here that 10 times

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.040 
right so you can see here that 10 times
1/2<00:05:39.010> a<00:05:39.130> minute<00:05:39.280> basically<00:05:39.880> equals<00:05:40.240> five

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
1/2 a minute basically equals five

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.660 
1/2 a minute basically equals five
minutes<00:05:41.530> right<00:05:43.320> five<00:05:44.320> minutes<00:05:44.770> of<00:05:45.040> total<00:05:45.460> time

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
minutes right five minutes of total time

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.050 
minutes right five minutes of total time
at<00:05:46.270> vo2<00:05:47.020> max<00:05:47.230> level<00:05:47.650> now<00:05:47.830> this<00:05:48.430> is<00:05:48.580> going<00:05:48.760> to<00:05:48.850> be

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
at vo2 max level now this is going to be

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.570 
at vo2 max level now this is going to be
somewhat<00:05:49.540> easier<00:05:50.080> but<00:05:50.470> because<00:05:50.830> we<00:05:50.980> have<00:05:51.220> a

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
somewhat easier but because we have a

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.080 
somewhat easier but because we have a
higher<00:05:52.240> number<00:05:52.480> of<00:05:52.780> these<00:05:53.680> sets<00:05:54.070> it's<00:05:54.880> still

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
higher number of these sets it's still

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.880 
higher number of these sets it's still
going<00:05:55.210> to<00:05:55.270> be<00:05:55.360> pretty<00:05:55.600> hard<00:05:55.840> now<00:05:56.140> when<00:05:56.800> you

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
going to be pretty hard now when you

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.070 
going to be pretty hard now when you
just<00:05:56.920> start<00:05:57.430> if<00:05:57.580> you've<00:05:57.730> never<00:05:57.940> done<00:05:58.300> vo2<00:05:58.840> Max

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
just start if you've never done vo2 Max

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.350 
just start if you've never done vo2 Max
efforts<00:05:59.500> before<00:05:59.680> I<00:06:00.130> highly<00:06:00.700> suggest<00:06:00.880> that<00:06:01.180> you

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 
efforts before I highly suggest that you

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:04.530

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
go into this very very slowly gradually

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.540 
go into this very very slowly gradually
and<00:06:05.020> just<00:06:05.170> be<00:06:05.350> smart<00:06:05.710> about<00:06:05.830> it<00:06:06.100> so<00:06:06.190> you<00:06:06.280> don't

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
and just be smart about it so you don't

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.730
