we're about to crap because I like and
that's<00:05:03.820> it<00:05:04.290> in<00:05:05.290> most<00:05:05.530> of<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.830> three<00:05:06.370> FBI<00:05:06.490> says

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
that's it in most of the three FBI says

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.880 
that's it in most of the three FBI says
you'll<00:05:07.060> try<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:07.600> there's<00:05:08.320> a<00:05:08.380> lot<00:05:08.560> of<00:05:08.590> lag

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
you'll try and there's a lot of lag

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.150 
you'll try and there's a lot of lag
especially<00:05:09.700> games<00:05:09.880> like<00:05:10.530> combat<00:05:11.530> arms<00:05:11.860> common

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160
