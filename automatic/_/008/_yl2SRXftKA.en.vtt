really<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:46.570> it<00:00:47.570> kind<00:00:47.840> of<00:00:47.899> annoyed<00:00:48.110> me<00:00:48.320> a

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
really and it kind of annoyed me a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.200 
really and it kind of annoyed me a
little<00:00:48.530> bit<00:00:48.680> because<00:00:48.890> he<00:00:49.820> was<00:00:49.970> still

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
little bit because he was still

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.330 
little bit because he was still
underneath<00:00:50.540> the<00:00:50.660> pet<00:00:50.989> and<00:00:51.220> someone<00:00:52.220> else

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
underneath the pet and someone else

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.920 
underneath the pet and someone else
someone<00:00:52.640> else<00:00:52.760> probably<00:00:53.090> got<00:00:53.329> it<00:00:53.360> three<00:00:53.690> girls

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
someone else probably got it three girls

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.500 
someone else probably got it three girls
but<00:00:54.590> I've<00:00:54.710> been<00:00:54.829> that<00:00:55.040> I<00:00:55.100> think<00:00:55.430> I'm<00:00:55.670> on<00:00:56.120> my<00:00:58.510> 260

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
but I've been that I think I'm on my 260

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.920 
but I've been that I think I'm on my 260
earth<00:00:59.780> kill<00:01:00.260> something<00:01:00.800> like<00:01:00.980> that<00:01:01.190> now<00:01:01.930> with

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
earth kill something like that now with

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.990 
earth kill something like that now with
no<00:01:03.200> pet<00:01:03.440> which<00:01:04.009> I<00:01:04.250> guess<00:01:04.489> isn't<00:01:04.759> bad

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
no pet which I guess isn't bad

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.520 
no pet which I guess isn't bad
considering<00:01:05.479> their<00:01:05.750> personal<00:01:06.170> kills<00:01:06.380> were

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
considering their personal kills were

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.850 
considering their personal kills were
probably<00:01:06.799> on<00:01:06.950> about<00:01:07.420> five<00:01:08.420> six<00:01:08.990> seven<00:01:09.320> hundred

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
probably on about five six seven hundred

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.609 
probably on about five six seven hundred
toll<00:01:10.130> may<00:01:10.520> be<00:01:10.600> among<00:01:11.600> us<00:01:11.780> I'd<00:01:12.109> probably

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
toll may be among us I'd probably

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.039 
toll may be among us I'd probably
guessed<00:01:12.920> me<00:01:13.130> about<00:01:13.340> 600<00:01:13.880> total<00:01:14.060> which<00:01:14.749> isn't

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
guessed me about 600 total which isn't

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.590 
guessed me about 600 total which isn't
half<00:01:15.229> bad<00:01:15.259> we've<00:01:15.709> had<00:01:15.859> about<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.520> know<00:01:16.639> 200

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
half bad we've had about you know 200

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.699 
half bad we've had about you know 200
each<00:01:17.659> I'd<00:01:17.899> say<00:01:18.079> I've<00:01:18.200> had<00:01:18.439> the<00:01:18.560> majority

00:01:18.699 --> 00:01:18.709 
each I'd say I've had the majority

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:20.349 
each I'd say I've had the majority
because<00:01:19.159> my<00:01:19.369> range<00:01:19.609> most<00:01:19.789> has<00:01:19.969> been<00:01:20.149> quite

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
because my range most has been quite

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:23.410 
because my range most has been quite
high<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:21.219> I've<00:01:22.219> upgraded<00:01:22.459> my<00:01:22.880> amador<00:01:23.240> gear

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
high and I've upgraded my amador gear

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.300 
high and I've upgraded my amador gear
recently<00:01:23.869> I've<00:01:23.959> upgraded<00:01:24.109> to<00:01:24.529> an<00:01:24.649> audio<00:01:24.950> Mord

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
recently I've upgraded to an audio Mord

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.080 
recently I've upgraded to an audio Mord
I<00:01:26.149> decided<00:01:26.959> to<00:01:27.200> take<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:27.499> over<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.770> DFS<00:01:28.249> as<00:01:28.549> the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
I decided to take that over a DFS as the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.239 
I decided to take that over a DFS as the
DFS<00:01:29.450> only<00:01:29.749> had<00:01:29.869> them<00:01:30.049> Ali<00:01:30.259> defense<00:01:30.619> on<00:01:30.799> it<00:01:30.920> yes

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:31.249 
DFS only had them Ali defense on it yes

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:33.910 
DFS only had them Ali defense on it yes
it's<00:01:31.969> good<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:32.569> it's<00:01:33.170> probably<00:01:33.679> more

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
it's good and it's probably more

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.679 
it's good and it's probably more
suitable<00:01:34.249> for<00:01:34.459> a<00:01:34.490> jewel<00:01:34.789> but<00:01:35.119> I<00:01:35.149> went<00:01:35.450> with<00:01:35.569> the

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
suitable for a jewel but I went with the

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.239 
suitable for a jewel but I went with the
audio<00:01:35.990> mode<00:01:36.170> instead<00:01:36.380> because<00:01:36.889> I<00:01:36.950> felt<00:01:37.159> a

00:01:37.239 --> 00:01:37.249 
audio mode instead because I felt a

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:38.949 
audio mode instead because I felt a
range<00:01:37.490> bonus<00:01:37.819> would<00:01:37.939> be<00:01:37.999> more<00:01:38.209> beneficial<00:01:38.359> to

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:38.959 
range bonus would be more beneficial to

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:40.599 
range bonus would be more beneficial to
our<00:01:38.990> middle<00:01:39.409> and<00:01:39.619> possibly<00:01:39.920> any<00:01:40.159> other<00:01:40.369> bosses

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
our middle and possibly any other bosses

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.440 
our middle and possibly any other bosses

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
that I do so the first drop we got was

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.389 
that I do so the first drop we got was
an<00:01:44.719> our<00:01:44.929> middle<00:01:45.200> helmet<00:01:45.649> this<00:01:46.069> was<00:01:46.249> on<00:01:46.369> the

recently<00:01:59.389> we've<00:02:00.169> had<00:02:00.200> a<00:02:00.409> chance<00:02:00.919> good<00:02:01.219> and

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
recently we've had a chance good and

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.719 
recently we've had a chance good and
held<00:02:01.639> a<00:02:01.909> chess<00:02:02.270> player<00:02:02.649> all<00:02:03.649> you<00:02:04.310> know<00:02:04.399> also

fall<00:02:04.909> without<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.270> helm<00:02:05.599> so<00:02:05.959> I<00:02:05.989> guess<00:02:06.169> would<00:02:06.439> you

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:06.619 
fall without a helm so I guess would you

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.650 
fall without a helm so I guess would you
the<00:02:06.709> helm<00:02:06.889> and<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.340> helm<00:02:07.549> completed<00:02:08.179> my<00:02:08.360> set

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
the helm and the helm completed my set

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.220 
the helm and the helm completed my set
and<00:02:09.429> not<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.610> I've<00:02:10.729> kept<00:02:10.970> it<00:02:11.150> but<00:02:11.480> i<00:02:11.690> kept<00:02:12.140> the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
and not that I've kept it but i kept the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.080 
and not that I've kept it but i kept the
helmand<00:02:12.590> paid<00:02:12.860> I<00:02:13.190> think<00:02:13.489> it<00:02:13.580> was<00:02:13.640> pig<00:02:13.880> pneus

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
helmand paid I think it was pig pneus

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.940 
helmand paid I think it was pig pneus
the<00:02:14.630> other<00:02:14.780> half<00:02:14.990> of<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.230> drop<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.650> I<00:02:15.680> kept

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950
