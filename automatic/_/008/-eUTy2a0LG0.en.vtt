it is a beautiful example of a very
hobby<00:07:20.910> I<00:07:22.050> think<00:07:23.050> of<00:07:23.139> it<00:07:23.199> as<00:07:23.319> a<00:07:23.349> double<00:07:23.560> IPA<00:07:24.180> it

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.180 
hobby I think of it as a double IPA it

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:30.629 
hobby I think of it as a double IPA it
is<00:07:28.530> really<00:07:29.530> very<00:07:29.710> good<00:07:30.069> if<00:07:30.250> you're<00:07:30.400> a<00:07:30.430> hophead

00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 
is really very good if you're a hophead

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.879 
is really very good if you're a hophead
you<00:07:31.360> really<00:07:31.780> can't<00:07:32.020> go<00:07:32.169> wrong<00:07:32.199> go<00:07:32.590> ahead<00:07:32.770> and

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:32.889 
you really can't go wrong go ahead and

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:34.230 
you really can't go wrong go ahead and
get<00:07:33.009> it<00:07:33.099> one<00:07:33.580> of<00:07:33.669> the<00:07:33.759> other<00:07:33.879> things<00:07:34.120> about

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 
get it one of the other things about

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.830 
get it one of the other things about
this<00:07:34.509> $5<00:07:35.349> for<00:07:35.530> a<00:07:35.590> bomber<00:07:35.830> it<00:07:36.250> it's<00:07:36.669> it<00:07:37.419> can't<00:07:37.720> be

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840 
this $5 for a bomber it it's it can't be

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.059 
this $5 for a bomber it it's it can't be
beat<00:07:38.020> so<00:07:40.110> even<00:07:41.110> if<00:07:41.199> you're<00:07:41.349> not<00:07:41.379> a<00:07:41.500> hophead<00:07:41.740> and

00:07:42.059 --> 00:07:42.069 
beat so even if you're not a hophead and

00:07:42.069 --> 00:07:44.869 
beat so even if you're not a hophead and
if<00:07:42.129> you<00:07:42.250> want<00:07:42.400> to<00:07:42.490> expand<00:07:42.849> your<00:07:42.970> palate<00:07:43.560> and

00:07:47.339 --> 00:07:47.349 
really get what I think is an exemplar

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:52.320 
really get what I think is an exemplar
of<00:07:48.090> a<00:07:49.090> double<00:07:49.690> IPA<00:07:49.810> or<00:07:50.409> a<00:07:50.440> strong<00:07:50.770> IPA<00:07:51.130> I<00:07:51.400> would

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:52.330 
of a double IPA or a strong IPA I would

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.180 
of a double IPA or a strong IPA I would
say<00:07:52.599> that<00:07:53.199> this<00:07:53.349> is<00:07:53.530> a<00:07:53.560> good<00:07:53.770> one<00:07:53.919> to<00:07:54.039> try

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:54.190 
say that this is a good one to try

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:57.599 
say that this is a good one to try
thanks<00:07:55.060> a<00:07:55.120> lot<00:07:55.240> see<00:07:55.539> you
