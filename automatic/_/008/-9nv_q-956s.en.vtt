00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.450
 servus know the topic today 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.030
 damper treat the problems 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.500
 Can we buy a damper on 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.560
 Just do it in the dugout 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.199
 extension if, for example, which responds or 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.170
 the whole time breaks through what can 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.970
 lie if I want to expand it gives 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.830
 it often seems out war problems or 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.779
 when installing it does not fit click 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.030
 Number pressed in with the problem 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.170
 Let's get started today. I'll start 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.809
 others will become yours 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.610
 Remove damper 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.379
 Turn the screws loose and you will notice 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.420
 Already I can get up there though 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.829
 example but below calls the same 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.120
 can go upstairs with what you're up to 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.610
 out of grazing or goes at all 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.250
 nothing that can not be that now 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.570
 only with these so many must there 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.550
 i just post a bit here 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.100
 turn out that I have more up here 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.820
 game then I get the normalos 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.920
 and below 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.070
 The plumber is here for the model 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.309
 between these two attachment points 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.479
 I have two on the other side 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.950
 unscrew if I get out a bit 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.510
 I have more trainer between the coaches 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.220
 then you get the simple plates I 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.080
 also easy out because many then 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.729
 wonder you just can not get out 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.619
 Just look that I left 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.210
 from when it still does not 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.290
 going 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.439
 Maybe the screw is forgotten 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.020
 maybe something in between 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.390
 is there any foreign matter in there man 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.189
 do not know it but usually are 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.299
 mostly things like that here bit 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.290
 more play between the individual 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.400
 components builds then with many completely 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.159
 basically country damper 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.590
 Whole time lays two rooms 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.899
 then either completely wrong pen 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.700
 we now have 450 x 30 here 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.500
 Feather in the we now about 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.970
 suitable for 70 kilos 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.009
 if of course the bike one of course 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.780
 the 80 kilo drives but how would it be 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.090
 Of course then will most likely 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.079
 with bigger jumps the whole tampa 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.210
 I would have to break through there 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.310
 of course, either the scene 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.950
 in the radiant but what stands out 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.150
 but really great or was it really 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.080
 appropriate errors 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:12.120
 who adored the error 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.550
 have easy adjustment possibilities 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.920
 we still with the other video and otherwise 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.980
 when installing or expanding can even 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.870
 No more problems simply occur 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.060
 I have always looked nice here 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.730
 Game can not be here at all 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.590
 all the screws are outside, outside 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.720
 sufficient is still important one should 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.640
 Of course, before the fault voltage we 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.950
 go out when the error is curious 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.510
 of course it is logical that is pretty 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.980
 difficult to get out 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.660
 or he will be great 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.320
 jumps out and of course it can 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:45.269
 not bad because I wisely the s33 in 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.430
 warschau ask us if the intention 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.410
 or together 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.690
 who is not as good as I say 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.840
 if you want romantic or romantic on the damper 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.500
 so is a torque key already 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.500
 very advisable because right here is the 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.540
 right topic a really very important 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.630
 and if I just a little here 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.920
 Tool is clear is 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.079
 but work at the right moment 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.880
 always with the works is still 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.860
 better 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.180
 well that was already so far in case she 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.829
 still have questions or have a problem here 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.610
 with a damper in the whole 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.739
 Comments 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.579
 and otherwise see us in the next video 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.579
