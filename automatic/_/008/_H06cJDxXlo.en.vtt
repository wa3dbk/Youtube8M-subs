gear and the steering wheel turned

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.479 
gear and the steering wheel turned
itself<00:00:50.629> I<00:00:50.989> kind<00:00:51.590> of<00:00:51.649> thought<00:00:51.800> we're<00:00:52.039> over<00:00:52.309> K

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
itself I kind of thought we're over K

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.750 
itself I kind of thought we're over K
we'll<00:00:52.820> watch<00:00:52.969> this<00:00:53.350> and<00:00:55.300> it<00:00:56.300> literally<00:00:56.870> just

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
we'll watch this and it literally just

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.910 
we'll watch this and it literally just
popped<00:00:58.760> me<00:00:58.910> into<00:00:59.120> position<00:00:59.570> and<00:00:59.750> turned<00:01:00.680> me

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
popped me into position and turned me

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.310 
popped me into position and turned me
into<00:01:01.039> disposing<00:01:01.790> it's<00:01:01.909> great<00:01:02.120> but<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.780> action

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
into disposing it's great but the action

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.620 
into disposing it's great but the action
of<00:01:03.409> it<00:01:03.530> is<00:01:03.649> so<00:01:03.800> positive<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:04.610> you<00:01:05.030> know<00:01:05.180> it's

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
of it is so positive that you know it's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.060 
of it is so positive that you know it's
doing<00:01:05.899> it<00:01:05.990> properly<00:01:06.170> it's<00:01:06.440> not<00:01:06.619> as<00:01:06.830> if<00:01:06.950> they're

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
doing it properly it's not as if they're

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.130 
doing it properly it's not as if they're
sort<00:01:07.250> of<00:01:07.280> wobbling<00:01:08.180> around<00:01:08.270> and<00:01:08.690> not<00:01:08.810> taking

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
sort of wobbling around and not taking

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:31.610 
sort of wobbling around and not taking
in<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.290> right<00:01:09.409> position

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.560 

I<00:01:31.680> was<00:01:32.310> amazed<00:01:32.760> I'm<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.910> terrible<00:01:33.120> buff<00:01:33.450> for

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
I was amazed I'm a terrible buff for

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.280 
I was amazed I'm a terrible buff for
myself<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.230> I<00:01:35.630> find<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.780> quite<00:01:36.840> difficult<00:01:37.050> to

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
myself and I find it quite difficult to

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.990 
myself and I find it quite difficult to
trust<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:39.560> and<00:01:40.560> quite<00:01:41.190> difficult<00:01:41.370> to<00:01:41.670> let<00:01:41.940> go

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
trust it and quite difficult to let go

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.990 
trust it and quite difficult to let go
of<00:01:42.150> control<00:01:42.560> but<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.830> was<00:01:43.920> incredible<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
of control but as I was incredible the

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.480 
of control but as I was incredible the
idea<00:01:45.330> is<00:01:45.450> fantastic<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:47.160> actually<00:01:47.280> be

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
idea is fantastic and to actually be

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.400 
idea is fantastic and to actually be
able<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.760> do<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.120> brilliant<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.990> main<00:01:49.170> thing

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
able to do is brilliant the main thing

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.860 
able to do is brilliant the main thing
was<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.980> unusual<00:01:50.610> experience<00:01:51.150> of<00:01:51.330> being<00:01:51.600> out

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
was the unusual experience of being out

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.510 
was the unusual experience of being out
of<00:01:51.900> control<00:01:52.140> while<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.530> was<00:01:52.710> parking<00:01:52.920> but<00:01:53.400> I

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
of control while I was parking but I

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.460 
of control while I was parking but I
felt<00:01:53.760> a<00:01:53.940> lot<00:01:54.210> more<00:01:54.240> confident<00:01:54.810> with<00:01:55.350> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
felt a lot more confident with the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.620 
felt a lot more confident with the
parking<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.190> parallel<00:01:57.120> parking<00:01:57.390> isn't

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
parking and parallel parking isn't

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.220 
parking and parallel parking isn't
something<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.930> I'm<00:01:57.990> particularly

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
something that I'm particularly

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.130 
something that I'm particularly
confident<00:01:58.650> with<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.250> having<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.480> sorted<00:02:00.960> for

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
confident with so having that sorted for

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.060 
confident with so having that sorted for
me<00:02:01.290> done<00:02:01.920> safely<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.490> brilliant
