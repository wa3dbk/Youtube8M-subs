00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.120
 m 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.470
 well that's all you are is cyril 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.290
 today finds himself guys for the 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.750
 more wheels of this type dream it's the 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.430
 little swiss nuremberg so 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.770
 currently we can see the team in 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.850
 which I the millions who did not sulk 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.920
 cia classic a 4 3 2 4 2 3 1 2 forgiveness 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.780
 on the side of his skills then 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.640
 frankly it's a money card his 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.830
 price is not very high 45 miles on 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.989
 xbox 55000 on the psn is a small 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.670
 a small monopoly on xbox but good nothing 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.460
 well, we know what 10000 credit 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:53.320
 10 15 more case it's urgent that I 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:55.840
 say either 14.2 general 90s 96 76 shooting 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.180
 by which 112.2 dribbles his hearing from 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.829
 the head 90 in finishing for a card 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.190
 agency is really extraordinary the 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.550
 rest either at 115 ball check do 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.090
 12-year-old penalty his stats correct for 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.979
 a map 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.920
 thot for a money card and to me 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.950
 also 1 83 years long shot and 92 in 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.700
 shooting power on the physical side by 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:22.330
 of which 80 in acceleration 81 stirred 81 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:25.540
 in balance with 77.2 force it does not fall 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.939
 never 84 sprint this is a date too 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.229
 interesting are 14 by aggressing and getting 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.939
 are hoisted in positioning this is 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.439
 really so very interesting you 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.799
 will see learn in the phases of 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.290
 gameplay 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.090
 so I wanted to say jimmy choo it's 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.450
 simple he is swiss he is attacker of 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.400
 point 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.560
 he is 22 years old he is 1 m 85 he is 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.630
 right handed too tight it's nick three 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.950
 canvases of death and so pay first 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.610
 we will start on the points side 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.090
 positive of josip I lead to t2 his 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.920
 bad foot 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.820
 that's because his left foot was 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.500
 nor who who succeeds him the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.700
 better 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.020
 sempt right is largely there for 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.270
 fill one of the slowness of the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.750
 copper from outside to the other six 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.570
 points 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.500
 pouzet gatif pardon his three stars of 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.570
 this cnnic here for me it deserves 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.260
 maybe four to really in 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:13.030
 enjoy 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.320
 three paintings it is not enough certainly 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.180
 he's really acting so the peaks 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.980
 rochelle the footwork 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.510
 goes very very well it's true but good 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.549
 four stars I would have really been 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.400
 satisfied on the positive side 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:26.170
 and has so much that 90 finish in 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.490
 finish and guys for a 74 2 card 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.730
 July 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.260
 it is enormously me me I tell you 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.450
 already I really wanted to enjoy 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.890
 to death is so thing 83 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.080
 we are not friends unfortunately I do not 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.780
 me on the bar but it goes very well 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.950
 193 since the power of shot is 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.530
 a cannonball that leave all 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.030
 rights another positive point acceleration 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.520
 and speed 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.660
 it's true that bomb at 81 speed 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.120
 it's correct 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.670
 So that's not a 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.170
 aubameyang was not a brandao 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.180
 put so he is correct he has a good 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.620
 physical also so a physical like I 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.570
 will say it force is it is 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.040
 really very interesting as I say 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.450
 there a statue in equilibrium of 2,81 and 17 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.580
 years ford honky tonk never and never 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.810
 gone for and against and paul of the 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.760
 head there is good there a good relaxation 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.530
 I did not pay attention to that 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.000
 seems he has a sound 18.2 of 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.390
 hues so what is still that 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.640
 with these ball checks he has 81 to 75 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.590
 years ball check it's okay 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.600
 secret for a money card knowing 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.160
 that I have evolved in a bottle 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.260
 so I was falling that when players 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.670
 off against big defenses 17 h 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.770
 besides everything you can so 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.250
 really a very interesting thing like 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.340
 we can see it 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:38.820
 already when I bought on 62500 with 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.070
 directly the stat finally that a few 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.670
 hunters chemistry that's another point 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.620
 positive 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.970
 also if it's not it's not that that has 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.460
 still a nice decisive pass and 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.540
 most of his passes were successful 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.680
 I'm trying I'm really trying to put it 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.110
 at the finish he 'll do some 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.080
 other assists that's true but 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.190
 really on the side of past passes 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.640
 short long passes he's really 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.340
 interesting 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.410
 another plus point its price that's right 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.060
 that its really interesting prices less 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.440
 of sixty thousand credit that's 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.700
 accessible for second attacking room 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.860
 really very interesting because 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.030
 certainly the 114 rolls can 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.850
 certainly it is hot but when you have 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.190
 a war that 90 in finish that deserves 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.859
 really hate his goal with me it's 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.350
 simple these six games 11 goals and one pd 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.270
 so it's perfect frankly it's going to be 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.450
 snatch a ratio 2 for a 

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:26.610
 money striker while the games 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.710
 like dead and timor and the big teams 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.150
 it's really impressive that 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.380
 lot for me twenty out of twenty he the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.880
 deserve that for sure and certain 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.770
 so in any case the war but I hope 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.400
 that this pure you on this gold spice 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.110
 josip dream itx will have pleased you 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.759
 do not hesitate to test frankly 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.060
 mentioned to me on twitter is keeping you at 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.860
 current 

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.120
 if you bought it in the past or what 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.620
 whether or not he does it with his monthly report 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.910
 I would appreciate it and for me it is 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.320
 really a very very good and he deserves 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.449
 to be tested so anyway guys 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.430

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:57.310
