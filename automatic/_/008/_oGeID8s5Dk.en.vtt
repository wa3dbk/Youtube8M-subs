00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
shot at a time which does the same

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
damage as a normal shotgun and you need

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.270 
damage as a normal shotgun and you need
to<00:02:09.330> reload<00:02:09.660> off<00:02:09.869> each<00:02:10.170> shot<00:02:10.470> don't<00:02:11.099> bother

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280

to reload off each shot don't bother
getting<00:02:11.549> this<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:12.180> completely<00:02:12.870> useless

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
getting this and it's completely useless

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.199 
getting this and it's completely useless
in<00:02:13.319> demise<00:02:13.680> or<00:02:13.890> use<00:02:14.069> your<00:02:14.190> pistol<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:15.000> smoke

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.180 

the<00:02:57.510> tower<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:58.019> slightly<00:02:58.379> better<00:02:58.650> version

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
the tower is a slightly better version

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.820

than<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.459> TVR<00:02:59.849> same<00:03:00.629> attachments<00:03:01.319> but<00:03:01.709> you

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
than the TVR same attachments but you

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.589 
than the TVR same attachments but you
can<00:03:02.040> move<00:03:02.250> faster<00:03:02.849> what<00:03:03.030> aiming<00:03:03.420> down<00:03:03.540> the

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
can move faster what aiming down the

can move faster what aiming down the
sights<00:03:03.930> that's<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.349> really<00:03:04.769> big<00:03:04.920> plus<00:03:05.099> for<00:03:05.220> this

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519

fire<00:03:08.310> but<00:03:08.819> shoots<00:03:09.120> slightly<00:03:09.660> slower<00:03:09.930> so

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
fire but shoots slightly slower so

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.559 
fire but shoots slightly slower so
you're<00:03:11.220> gonna<00:03:11.370> get<00:03:11.549> a<00:03:11.610> lot<00:03:11.819> more<00:03:11.849> accuracy<00:03:12.450> at

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
you're gonna get a lot more accuracy at

you're gonna get a lot more accuracy at
close<00:03:12.840> quarters<00:03:13.319> as<00:03:13.440> well<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:14.430> you're<00:03:14.700> just

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
close quarters as well but you're just

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.339 
close quarters as well but you're just
gonna<00:03:15.000> get<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.209> few<00:03:15.299> less<00:03:15.720> rounds<00:03:16.080> out<00:03:16.140> but

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
gonna get a few less rounds out but

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:17.570 
gonna get a few less rounds out but
you're<00:03:16.440> likely<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.739> get<00:03:16.920> more<00:03:17.160> on<00:03:17.340> target

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
you're likely to get more on target
