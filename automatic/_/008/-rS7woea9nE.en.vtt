00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.510 
on top of it I think that would be good
but<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.720> its<00:01:46.140> own<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.710> think<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:47.369> would

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
but on its own I think that this would

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.499 
but on its own I think that this would
just<00:01:47.700> kind<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> be<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.210> those<00:01:48.299> things

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
just kind of be one of those things

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.370 
just kind of be one of those things
where<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:49.140> would<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:49.530> like<00:01:49.560> uh<00:01:50.899> it's<00:01:51.899> just

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
where it would just be like uh it's just

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.929 
where it would just be like uh it's just
going<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.530> add<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> little<00:01:52.920> bit<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.130> Sheen<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
going to add a little bit of Sheen to

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.370 
going to add a little bit of Sheen to
your<00:01:54.060> lips<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.570> almost<00:01:54.750> like<00:01:54.869> an<00:01:54.990> iridescent

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
your lips it almost like an iridescent

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.469 
your lips it almost like an iridescent
effect<00:01:55.829> was<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.040> sample<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.579> here<00:01:56.820> this<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.270> by

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
effect was a sample in here this is by

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.740 
effect was a sample in here this is by
sore<00:01:57.960> me<00:01:58.490> they<00:01:59.490> gave<00:01:59.640> a<00:01:59.700> sample<00:01:59.909> last<00:02:00.329> month

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
sore me they gave a sample last month

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:08.650 
sore me they gave a sample last month
and<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.790> what<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.969> this

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.930 

this<00:02:09.660> is<00:02:09.840> an<00:02:09.960> anti-aging<00:02:10.890> under<00:02:11.460> foundation

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
this is an anti-aging under foundation

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.140 
this is an anti-aging under foundation
makeup<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.570> guess<00:02:12.780> it's<00:02:12.930> another<00:02:13.140> primer

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
makeup so I guess it's another primer

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.510 
makeup so I guess it's another primer
okay<00:02:15.150> then<00:02:15.450> we<00:02:15.600> have<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.050> stick<00:02:16.860> from<00:02:17.280> be<00:02:17.490> a

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
okay then we have this stick from be a

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.060 
okay then we have this stick from be a
bombshell<00:02:17.760> this<00:02:18.600> is<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.990> color<00:02:19.200> southern

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
bombshell this is in the color southern

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:28.070 
bombshell this is in the color southern
belle<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:26.400> not<00:02:26.640> for<00:02:26.850> me<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.270> it's<00:02:27.900> just

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
belle and it's not for me so it's just

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.590 
belle and it's not for me so it's just
not<00:02:28.290> my<00:02:28.410> color<00:02:28.650> um<00:02:29.100> this<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.300> color<00:02:30.510> that

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600

not my color um this is the color that
it<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.020> that<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.130> very<00:02:32.370> very<00:02:32.490> very<00:02:32.610> bright

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
it is that is a very very very bright

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.580 
it is that is a very very very bright
pink<00:02:35.030> typically<00:02:36.030> every<00:02:36.600> time<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.930> see<00:02:37.290> be<00:02:37.560> a

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
pink typically every time I see be a

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.160 
pink typically every time I see be a
bombshell<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:38.490> one<00:02:39.300> of<00:02:39.330> these<00:02:39.450> kids<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:39.959> not

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
bombshell in one of these kids it's not

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.229 
bombshell in one of these kids it's not
my<00:02:40.380> color<00:02:40.590> so<00:02:41.100> whether<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.520> was<00:02:41.760> in<00:02:41.880> an<00:02:41.970> Ipsy

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
my color so whether it was in an Ipsy

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.330 
my color so whether it was in an Ipsy
bag<00:02:42.270> or<00:02:42.630> it's<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.840> wantable<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.530> just<00:02:44.160> don't

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
bag or it's in wantable I just don't

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.010 
bag or it's in wantable I just don't
think<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.580> they're<00:02:44.760> ever<00:02:44.910> my<00:02:45.120> color<00:02:45.420> but<00:02:45.750> I

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
think that they're ever my color but I

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.710 
think that they're ever my color but I
suppose<00:02:46.500> if<00:02:46.620> you<00:02:46.709> blend<00:02:46.950> it<00:02:47.130> out<00:02:47.690> it<00:02:48.690> just

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
suppose if you blend it out it just

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.890 
suppose if you blend it out it just
turns<00:02:49.140> into<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.470> bright<00:02:49.739> coral<00:02:50.540> quite<00:02:51.540> poorly

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
turns into a bright coral quite poorly

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.900 
turns into a bright coral quite poorly
pink<00:02:52.320> so<00:02:52.680> I'd<00:02:52.890> have<00:02:52.920> to<00:02:53.100> see<00:02:53.370> about<00:02:53.400> how<00:02:53.730> that

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
pink so I'd have to see about how that

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.430 
pink so I'd have to see about how that
would<00:02:54.030> work<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:54.510> for<00:02:54.720> some<00:02:54.900> reason<00:02:55.260> I<00:02:55.410> just

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
would work but for some reason I just

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.840 
would work but for some reason I just
don't<00:02:55.830> think<00:02:56.130> that<00:02:56.190> that's<00:02:56.370> going<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.700> be

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
don't think that that's going to be

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.790 
don't think that that's going to be
something<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.350> I'm<00:02:58.350> going<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.590> be<00:02:58.680> very

I think of them because star looks I

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.600 
I think of them because star looks I
know<00:03:57.480> they<00:03:58.140> have<00:03:58.260> their<00:03:58.410> own<00:03:58.440> box<00:03:58.799> but<00:03:59.220> you<00:03:59.250> can

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
know they have their own box but you can

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:00.830 
know they have their own box but you can

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
so i have been hearing a lot about them

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.300 
so i have been hearing a lot about them
recently<00:04:02.640> too<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.500> star<00:04:04.739> looks<00:04:05.040> brow

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310

powders<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.290> $21<00:04:07.290> which<00:04:07.739> i<00:04:07.890> think<00:04:07.950> is<00:04:08.220> a

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
powders for $21 which i think is a

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.210 
powders for $21 which i think is a
pretty<00:04:08.579> decent<00:04:09.239> price<00:04:09.980> when<00:04:10.980> you're<00:04:11.100> getting

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
pretty decent price when you're getting

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.860 
pretty decent price when you're getting
all<00:04:11.610> these<00:04:11.790> different<00:04:12.030> routers<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:12.810> a

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
all these different routers and a

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.740 
all these different routers and a
highlight<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:14.430> girl<00:04:14.730> lactic

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
highlight the girl lactic

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.569 
highlight the girl lactic
liner<00:04:16.680> was<00:04:17.040> $19<00:04:17.940> um<00:04:19.220> depending<00:04:20.220> on<00:04:20.400> the

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
liner was $19 um depending on the

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.039 
liner was $19 um depending on the
quality<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:21.000> the<00:04:21.180> liner<00:04:21.359> I<00:04:21.630> could<00:04:21.840> see<00:04:21.959> it

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
quality of the liner I could see it

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.930 
quality of the liner I could see it
going<00:04:22.079> for<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.590> because<00:04:22.920> I<00:04:23.130> pay<00:04:23.340> 20<00:04:23.670> for<00:04:23.910> the

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
going for that because I pay 20 for the

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.110 
going for that because I pay 20 for the
Stila<00:04:24.270> liner<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.980> pot<00:04:26.250> gloss<00:04:26.700> this<00:04:27.690> is

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
Stila liner so the pot gloss this is

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.330 
Stila liner so the pot gloss this is
nineteen<00:04:30.120> dollars<00:04:30.240> i<00:04:30.660> would<00:04:30.990> not<00:04:31.140> pay<00:04:31.380> $19<00:04:32.070> for

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
nineteen dollars i would not pay $19 for

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.820 
nineteen dollars i would not pay $19 for
this<00:04:32.550> gloss<00:04:32.790> but<00:04:33.420> i'm<00:04:33.930> not<00:04:34.170> saying<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.590> it's

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
this gloss but i'm not saying that it's

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:37.160 
this gloss but i'm not saying that it's
not<00:04:34.920> worth<00:04:35.100> $19<00:04:35.880> but<00:04:36.210> i<00:04:36.450> wouldn't<00:04:37.080> pay

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
not worth $19 but i wouldn't pay

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.240 
not worth $19 but i wouldn't pay
nineteen<00:04:37.470> dollars<00:04:37.530> for<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.830> because<00:04:37.980> it's

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
nineteen dollars for it because it's

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.330 
nineteen dollars for it because it's
there's<00:04:38.670> no<00:04:38.850> color<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.390> then<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.980> be<00:04:41.310> a

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
there's no color and then the be a

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.530 
there's no color and then the be a
bombshell<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:42.750> is<00:04:43.080> sixteen<00:04:43.950> dollars<00:04:44.150> so<00:04:45.150> the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
bombshell this is sixteen dollars so the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.510 
bombshell this is sixteen dollars so the
box<00:04:45.690> pretty<00:04:45.960> much<00:04:46.110> pays<00:04:46.320> for<00:04:46.560> itself<00:04:46.650> but

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
box pretty much pays for itself but

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.310 
box pretty much pays for itself but
within<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.740> 221<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.340> 19<00:04:51.060> this<00:04:51.510> alone<00:04:51.870> was

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
within the 221 and 19 this alone was

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.230 
within the 221 and 19 this alone was
worth<00:04:52.350> the<00:04:52.560> price<00:04:52.980> of<00:04:53.160> the<00:04:53.220> box<00:04:53.460> in<00:04:53.669> my<00:04:53.910> opinion

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
worth the price of the box in my opinion

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.120 
worth the price of the box in my opinion
so<00:04:54.630> you<00:04:54.900> still<00:04:55.110> have<00:04:55.230> a<00:04:55.290> chance<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.590> get<00:04:55.710> farias

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
so you still have a chance to get farias

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.170
