00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.890
 close turn on the ignition 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:48.410
 we have it quietly extinguished and we 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.410
 we start the engine we start 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:01:00.290
 here we have dipped now 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:04.519
 dimensions and other light bulbs all we have 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:07.670

 lit dipped show 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.359
 indication 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.040
 to 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.290
 let's say include dimensions 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.710
 translate 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.440
 mode 1 heap says and we have enabled 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.060

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:31.890
 You can also turn on the fog 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:36.800

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.800
 dimensions dazzle it burns 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.850
 to disable this feature we translate 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:48.290
 switch to low beam mode in 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:51.260
 us it also burns and then turn off all 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:55.070
 we have all gone out now we have neither 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:57.150
 how almost don't burn here at night if 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.380
 need to sneak up 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.380
 she did it all off 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.050
 Further 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:09.580
 if necessary, turn on the light already 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:12.040
 We turn on as usual the regular mode two 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.150
 click dazzle or one click 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.910
 dimensions to re-enable mode 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.300
 running lights 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.920
 we suppress the motor we start it again we wait 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.760
 until a certain voltage is typed 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.810
 to turn on the relay and here we see 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.810
 dipped beam 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.320
 there was a function initially 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.090
 with connected dimensions i.e. 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.090
 Startup included the dimensions of the near 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.810
 I decided to turn off the size function 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.260
 wire 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:54.150
 I unhooked and now I only have a neighbor 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.160
 the light is working and I have nothing behind me 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.350
 no side lights included 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.350
 not only dipped 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.210
 These are the things that's all good and Gentlemen 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.430
 good luck on the road 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:09.430
