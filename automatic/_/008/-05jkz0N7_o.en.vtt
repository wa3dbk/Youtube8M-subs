 Being you how to do it for those who still 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.330

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.790

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.640
 the things that I'm going to use make a break 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.680
 So girls like you can see the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.210
 my hair tips are already fine 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:29.820
 clarinhos is they are your tips 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.850
 also the clearer than the top 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.399
 because I left it like this and I'm going to talk 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.379
 For you, what I'm going to use now is me. 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.499
 I want to clear the tips more 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:41.639
 so I'll use this discoloration powder 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:47.010
 on here 

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:51.260
 damiÃ£o put very cheap very cheap and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:58.079
 I mixed with this hydrogen peroxide the 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:01.649
 volume of aluminum foil 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.949
 size because we're going to 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.210
 I need to show it to you here. 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.350
 Mix I made of the bleaching powder 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:16.400
 Let's start, I advise everyone. 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.610
 You're supposed to wear a shirt. 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:24.780
 because a mess that only 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.410
 God, what am I going to do? I'm going to arrest the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.380
 My hair is, I'm going to start doing it. 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.690
 one side and then I do the other then 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.810
 start walking on this side here that is not 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.960
 the fran as I like to use the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:47.250
 fringe on this side of here 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:50.840
 so I'll learn it like this and now I will 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.270
 start passing my discoloration powder 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.150
 but look how we're going to pass 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.810
 I got the ticks here that even me 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.810
 to help 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:10.840
 I'm going to have three hair here. 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:18.220
 start with this is what I'm going to do 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:20.470
 who has pm wine a brush is in 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.709
 if you do not have a paint brush 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.800
 that I 'm going to use aaa this way that 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.530
 He can take a toothpick from 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.989
 do something like this to separate the 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:39.130
 you will sew the hair okay 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.799
 then seam separates 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.500
 I do not know if you give so you can see the pull 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.180
 down and pick up the one that sewed with what 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.500
 sewed what you are going to do and will 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:54.640
 get the foil here so it goes 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.920
 put foil behind him 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.930
 It's for you not to get dirty, not to make 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:17.470
 mess are you going to get the dust 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:19.930
 bleach and will pass all my 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.609
 in the case that moves people turning not 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.609
 wants to show up to you 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:34.780
 after you pass you will soon 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:39.480
 You'll shine it after you 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:43.780
 no doubt he was passing by 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.480
 so you'll do this with your hair 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.690
 everything will separate leave a little without and 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:53.230
 to put on is not going to sew it 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:55.630
 Forget that, seamstress separates and 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.370

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.739
