00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.330
 already from the normal note 10 1 yes and 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.010
 otherwise there are not any 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.390
 modification 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.380

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.520
 quadcore processor in it 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.580
 I can also give you that incredible 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.040

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.110
 menu and we want the settings 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.110

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.500
 I am at speed I am doing here 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.829

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.969
 still subject to the place gate 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.530
 Now we still have the place to find 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.759
 it here 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.750
