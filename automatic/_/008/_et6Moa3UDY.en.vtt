of get a scale after you have the main
part<00:00:52.079> put<00:00:52.320> together<00:00:52.500> of<00:00:52.969> it<00:00:53.969> should<00:00:54.149> call<00:00:54.300> them

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
part put together of it should call them

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.540 
part put together of it should call them
the<00:00:54.510> dormers<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.079> windows<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.710> know<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.980> how

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the dormers the windows you know and how

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.189 
the dormers the windows you know and how
does<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.879> angle<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.390> roof<00:00:57.660> go<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.050> what

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
does the angle of the roof go and what

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.569 
does the angle of the roof go and what
will<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> angle<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.800> dormer<00:00:59.190> need<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.460> be

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
will the angle of the dormer need to be

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.400 
will the angle of the dormer need to be
and<00:00:59.730> so<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.149> so<00:01:00.210> forth

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.710 

takes<00:01:04.129> a<00:01:04.220> few<00:01:04.430> hours<00:01:04.489> maybe<00:01:05.059> three<00:01:05.180> four<00:01:05.540> hours

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
takes a few hours maybe three four hours

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.870 
takes a few hours maybe three four hours
to<00:01:06.140> roll<00:01:06.290> out<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.590> pieces<00:01:06.800> on<00:01:07.070> one<00:01:07.310> day<00:01:07.520> than

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
to roll out the pieces on one day than

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.760 
to roll out the pieces on one day than
to<00:01:08.060> actually<00:01:08.180> put<00:01:08.660> it<00:01:08.750> together<00:01:08.900> and<00:01:09.260> decorate

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
to actually put it together and decorate

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.020 
to actually put it together and decorate
it<00:01:09.890> on<00:01:10.010> another<00:01:10.250> day<00:01:10.550> it<00:01:10.670> probably<00:01:10.910> takes

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
it on another day it probably takes

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.650 
it on another day it probably takes
another<00:01:11.300> five<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.720> six<00:01:11.960> hours<00:01:13.390> but<00:01:14.390> it<00:01:14.510> really

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
another five to six hours but it really

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.420 
another five to six hours but it really
just<00:01:14.870> depends<00:01:15.170> on<00:01:15.290> some<00:01:15.500> of<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.680> detail<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:16.100> it

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
just depends on some of the detail of it

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.860 
just depends on some of the detail of it
sometimes<00:01:16.910> it<00:01:17.060> could<00:01:17.180> take<00:01:17.330> a<00:01:17.390> little<00:01:17.570> longer

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
sometimes it could take a little longer

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.780 
sometimes it could take a little longer
but<00:01:18.440> on<00:01:18.590> average<00:01:18.830> that's<00:01:19.220> about<00:01:19.430> how<00:01:19.550> long<00:01:19.610> it

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
but on average that's about how long it

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.400 
but on average that's about how long it
takes<00:01:22.000> what<00:01:23.000> I'm<00:01:23.119> going<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.330> do<00:01:23.890> is<00:01:25.030> actually

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.410 
takes what I'm going to do is actually

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.440 
takes what I'm going to do is actually
roll<00:01:27.410> this<00:01:27.619> little<00:01:27.920> cutter<00:01:28.220> over<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.060> it

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
roll this little cutter over it and it

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.830 
roll this little cutter over it and it
has<00:01:29.800> it's<00:01:30.800> like<00:01:31.040> an<00:01:31.160> impression<00:01:31.840> makes

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
has it's like an impression makes

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.560 
has it's like an impression makes
impressions<00:01:33.410> into<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.830> dough<00:01:34.180> so<00:01:35.180> it<00:01:35.300> looks

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
impressions into the dough so it looks

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.240 
impressions into the dough so it looks
like<00:01:35.860> little<00:01:36.860> bricks<00:01:38.710> we<00:01:39.710> have<00:01:39.920> a<00:01:39.950> few

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
like little bricks we have a few

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.630 
like little bricks we have a few
different<00:01:40.280> sizes<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.180> houses<00:01:41.979> this<00:01:42.979> year<00:01:43.340> so

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
different sizes of houses this year so

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.529 
different sizes of houses this year so
far<00:01:44.350> we<00:01:45.350> made<00:01:45.670> what<00:01:46.670> we<00:01:46.850> consider<00:01:47.180> a<00:01:47.240> small

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
far we made what we consider a small

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.440 
far we made what we consider a small
house<00:01:48.050> which<00:01:48.979> is<00:01:49.009> on<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.340> 16<00:01:49.940> by<00:01:50.090> 20<00:01:50.149> board<00:01:50.810> and

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
house which is on a 16 by 20 board and

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.430 
house which is on a 16 by 20 board and
then<00:01:53.450> we<00:01:53.660> made<00:01:54.220> five<00:01:55.600> large<00:01:56.600> houses<00:01:56.990> which<00:01:57.320> are

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
then we made five large houses which are

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.490 
then we made five large houses which are
about<00:01:57.619> triple<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.160> size<00:01:58.930> of<00:01:59.930> the<00:02:00.170> small

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
about triple the size of the small

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.790 
about triple the size of the small
houses<00:02:00.800> and<00:02:02.440> shoe<00:02:03.670> extra<00:02:04.670> large<00:02:04.880> houses

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
houses and shoe extra large houses

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.300 
houses and shoe extra large houses
which<00:02:07.870> are<00:02:08.870> probably<00:02:09.470> triple<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:09.920> size<00:02:10.070> of

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
which are probably triple the size of

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.700 
which are probably triple the size of
the<00:02:10.400> large<00:02:10.640> house<00:02:11.200> range<00:02:12.200> is<00:02:12.320> probably

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
the large house range is probably

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.000 
the large house range is probably
between<00:02:12.890> 15<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.520> 20<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.960> small<00:02:15.290> ones<00:02:15.620> and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
between 15 and 20 of the small ones and

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.520 
between 15 and 20 of the small ones and
just<00:02:17.000> depending<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:17.570> other<00:02:17.750> things<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.350> could

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
just depending on other things it could

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.330 
just depending on other things it could
be<00:02:19.090> you<00:02:20.090> know<00:02:20.240> eight<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.720> ten<00:02:20.990> of<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
be you know eight to ten of the of the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.590 
be you know eight to ten of the of the
large<00:02:22.580> houses<00:02:24.610> we<00:02:25.610> have<00:02:25.760> delivery<00:02:26.150> drivers

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
large houses we have delivery drivers

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.450 
large houses we have delivery drivers
we're<00:02:27.170> connected<00:02:27.530> with<00:02:27.620> the<00:02:27.710> warehouse<00:02:27.920> and

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
we're connected with the warehouse and

our delivery drivers actually deliver

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.650 
our delivery drivers actually deliver

the houses the smaller houses can fit
into<00:02:32.810> our<00:02:32.930> cabinets<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:34.310> larger<00:02:34.610> houses

into our cabinets but the larger houses

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.320 
into our cabinets but the larger houses
need<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.960> go<00:02:36.490> into<00:02:37.490> our<00:02:37.850> van<00:02:40.030> fourth<00:02:41.030> year

we've<00:02:41.570> had<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.870> repin<00:02:42.400> exact<00:02:43.400> replicas<00:02:43.910> not

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
we've had to repin exact replicas not

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.370 
we've had to repin exact replicas not
exactly<00:02:44.960> close<00:02:45.470> to<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:46.040> replica<00:02:46.760> of<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.970> end

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
exactly close to the replica of the end

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.630 
exactly close to the replica of the end
we've<00:02:48.380> also<00:02:48.560> had<00:02:48.770> the<00:02:48.890> smaller<00:02:49.190> ones<00:02:49.460> we

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
we've also had the smaller ones we
