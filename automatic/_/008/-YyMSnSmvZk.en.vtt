what<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:50.189> have<00:01:50.280> been<00:01:50.399> working<00:01:50.579> on

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
what we have been working on

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.250 
what we have been working on
what<00:01:52.070> do<00:01:52.160> you<00:01:52.190> think<00:01:52.250> there<00:01:52.690> how<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:53.720> teams

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
what do you think there how the teams

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.920 
what do you think there how the teams
play<00:01:54.980> has<00:01:55.220> been<00:01:55.460> over<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.150> past<00:01:56.330> few<00:01:56.690> weeks

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
play has been over the past few weeks

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.570 
play has been over the past few weeks
before<00:01:57.260> the<00:01:57.350> break<00:01:57.500> well<00:01:58.040> I<00:01:58.070> think<00:01:58.280> we<00:01:58.550> have

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
before the break well I think we have

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.180 
before the break well I think we have
played<00:01:59.060> very<00:01:59.330> good<00:01:59.420> as<00:01:59.780> a<00:01:59.810> team<00:02:00.110> we<00:02:00.380> have<00:02:00.560> we

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
played very good as a team we have we

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.670 
played very good as a team we have we
have<00:02:01.280> played<00:02:01.580> one<00:02:01.760> of<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.990> best<00:02:03.230> games<00:02:03.410> the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
have played one of the best games the

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.440 
have played one of the best games the
thing<00:02:03.860> against<00:02:04.220> blues<00:02:04.430> we<00:02:04.790> played<00:02:05.270> a<00:02:05.300> very

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
thing against blues we played a very

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.690 
thing against blues we played a very
good<00:02:05.590> we<00:02:06.590> had<00:02:06.710> a<00:02:06.740> very<00:02:06.980> good<00:02:07.010> team<00:02:07.280> effort<00:02:07.490> and

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
good we had a very good team effort and

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.510 
good we had a very good team effort and
everyone<00:02:08.420> is<00:02:08.600> buying<00:02:09.440> into<00:02:09.860> our<00:02:09.979> system<00:02:10.399> and

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
everyone is buying into our system and

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.940 
everyone is buying into our system and
play<00:02:11.450> play<00:02:11.750> really<00:02:11.990> good<00:02:12.080> team<00:02:12.410> game<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.860> we

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
play play really good team game and we

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.150 
play play really good team game and we
have<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.280> continue<00:02:13.700> to<00:02:14.000> do<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.650> things<00:02:15.650> still

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
have to continue to do that things still

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.740 
have to continue to do that things still
think<00:02:16.430> we're<00:02:16.580> a<00:02:16.610> little<00:02:16.700> bit<00:02:16.910> too<00:02:17.030> unstable<00:02:17.420> we

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
think we're a little bit too unstable we

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.570 
think we're a little bit too unstable we
we<00:02:18.080> win<00:02:18.320> one<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.680> lose<00:02:18.830> one<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.250> I<00:02:19.280> think

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
we win one we lose one but I think

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.700 
we win one we lose one but I think
overall<00:02:20.360> we<00:02:20.420> were<00:02:20.840> playing<00:02:21.110> a<00:02:21.170> lot<00:02:21.320> better<00:02:21.470> now

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
overall we were playing a lot better now

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.430 
overall we were playing a lot better now
how<00:02:22.700> do<00:02:22.760> you<00:02:22.880> work<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.270> their<00:02:23.510> keeping<00:02:24.290> the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
how do you work on their keeping the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.040 
how do you work on their keeping the
game<00:02:24.590> stable<00:02:25.580> for<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.300> whole<00:02:26.480> 60<00:02:26.750> minutes

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
game stable for the whole 60 minutes

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.410 
game stable for the whole 60 minutes
well<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:27.800> think<00:02:28.160> it's<00:02:28.280> about<00:02:28.400> focus<00:02:28.970> from<00:02:29.209> each

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
well I think it's about focus from each

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.800 
well I think it's about focus from each
individual<00:02:30.140> guy<00:02:30.290> we<00:02:31.250> have<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.600> everyone<00:02:32.600> has<00:02:32.780> a

individual guy we have to everyone has a

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.410 
individual guy we have to everyone has a
has<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> has<00:02:34.370> something<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.850> do<00:02:34.970> out<00:02:35.120> there<00:02:35.150> and

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
we have to do the hundred percent each
