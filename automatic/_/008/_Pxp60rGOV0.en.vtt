well<00:00:01.620> we<00:00:01.920> must<00:00:02.190> all<00:00:02.340> think<00:00:02.399> we're<00:00:02.850> pretty

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
well we must all think we're pretty

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.970 
well we must all think we're pretty
smart<00:00:03.149> now<00:00:03.629> because<00:00:04.049> we<00:00:04.200> have<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.380> big<00:00:04.680> long

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
smart now because we have a big long

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.829 
smart now because we have a big long
list<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.490> our<00:00:05.609> minds<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.180> all<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.480> things<00:00:06.750> that

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
list in our minds of all the things that

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.440 
list in our minds of all the things that
would<00:00:07.080> cause<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.740> spleen<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.550> be<00:00:08.670> enlarged

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
would cause a spleen to be enlarged

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.709 
would cause a spleen to be enlarged
you<00:00:09.960> know<00:00:10.110> like<00:00:10.349> Obama's<00:00:10.950> leukemias<00:00:11.790> storage

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
blah blah blah well I Got News for you

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.779 
blah blah blah well I Got News for you
we<00:00:18.359> now<00:00:18.539> have<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.900> think<00:00:19.170> of<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:20.189> things<00:00:20.490> that

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
we now have to think of the things that

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.900 
we now have to think of the things that
might<00:00:21.029> make<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.570> spleen<00:00:22.230> be<00:00:22.920> smaller<00:00:23.460> than

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
might make a spleen be smaller than

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.310 
might make a spleen be smaller than
usual<00:00:24.150> so<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:25.289> many<00:00:25.439> people<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.820> quick

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
usual so not many people have a quick

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.529 
usual so not many people have a quick
differential<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.529> splenomegaly<00:00:29.179> in<00:00:30.179> their

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.299 
differential of splenomegaly in their
heads<00:00:30.750> because<00:00:31.289> they<00:00:31.500> all<00:00:31.679> think<00:00:31.890> they<00:00:32.070> know

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
heads because they all think they know

heads because they all think they know
all<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.969> causes<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.360> splenomegaly<00:00:35.300> this<00:00:36.300> is

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
all the causes for splenomegaly this is

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.810 
all the causes for splenomegaly this is
a<00:00:36.510> spleen<00:00:36.960> unfortunately<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:38.160> know<00:00:38.340> you<00:00:38.550> don't

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
a spleen unfortunately I know you don't

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.459 
a spleen unfortunately I know you don't
believe<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.450> because<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.930> doesn't<00:00:40.260> look<00:00:40.440> like

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
believe it because it doesn't look like

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.150 
believe it because it doesn't look like
a<00:00:40.710> normal<00:00:41.129> spleen<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.410> spleen<00:00:43.980> that

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
a normal spleen this is a spleen that

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.279 
a normal spleen this is a spleen that
has<00:00:44.370> been<00:00:44.640> very<00:00:44.969> very<00:00:45.090> small<00:00:45.780> this<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
has been very very small this is

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.680 
has been very very small this is
classically<00:00:47.010> one<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> most<00:00:47.940> common<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
classically one of the most common and

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.200 
classically one of the most common and
one<00:00:48.840> of<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> most<00:00:49.289> extreme<00:00:49.829> causes<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.670> a

one of the most extreme causes of a

one of the most extreme causes of a
small<00:00:51.570> spleen<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.800> reason<00:00:53.190> why<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.879> spleen

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
small spleen the reason why this spleen

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.060 
small spleen the reason why this spleen
is<00:00:54.809> small<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.620> perhaps<00:00:57.379> not<00:00:58.379> anywhere<00:00:59.010> near

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
is small and perhaps not anywhere near

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.360 
is small and perhaps not anywhere near
to<00:00:59.670> its<00:00:59.850> normal<00:01:00.359> adult<00:01:00.750> weight<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.260> 150<00:01:01.859> grams

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.640 
to its normal adult weight of 150 grams
this<00:01:02.579> could<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.879> 30<00:01:03.210> grams<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.840> 10<00:01:04.080> grams<00:01:04.379> I've

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
this could be 30 grams or 10 grams I've

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.530 
this could be 30 grams or 10 grams I've
seen<00:01:04.860> them<00:01:04.979> or<00:01:05.369> they're<00:01:05.640> hardly<00:01:06.000> bigger<00:01:06.270> than

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
seen them or they're hardly bigger than

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.310 
seen them or they're hardly bigger than
a<00:01:06.659> grape<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.979> reason<00:01:08.340> why<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.549> particular

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
a grape the reason why this particular

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.130 
a grape the reason why this particular
spleen<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.590> small<00:01:11.090> will<00:01:12.090> be<00:01:12.240> very<00:01:12.750> quickly

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
spleen is small will be very quickly

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.039 
spleen is small will be very quickly
apparent<00:01:13.860> because<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:15.090> could<00:01:15.299> see<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
apparent because you could see all of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.130 
apparent because you could see all of

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
their little infarcts this is a spleen

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.390 
their little infarcts this is a spleen
that<00:01:24.540> has<00:01:24.810> infarcted<00:01:25.530> itself<00:01:26.100> by<00:01:26.369> having

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
that has infarcted itself by having

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.910 
that has infarcted itself by having
numerous<00:01:27.240> little<00:01:27.600> infarcts<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> small

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
numerous little infarcts in the small

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.160 
numerous little infarcts in the small
blood<00:01:29.189> vessels<00:01:29.729> which<00:01:30.390> basically<00:01:30.810> has

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
blood vessels which basically has

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.350 
blood vessels which basically has
blocked<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.650> entire<00:01:31.979> spleen<00:01:32.460> oh<00:01:32.700> yeah<00:01:33.329> I

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
blocked the entire spleen oh yeah I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270 
blocked the entire spleen oh yeah I
could<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> few<00:01:34.110> residual<00:01:34.680> lymphocytes

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
could see a few residual lymphocytes

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.950 
could see a few residual lymphocytes
here<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.000> that<00:01:36.180> bitch<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.630> look<00:01:36.810> around

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
here and that bitch if we look around

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.830 
here and that bitch if we look around
randomly<00:01:37.890> lick<00:01:38.280> here<00:01:38.579> maybe<00:01:39.090> we'll<00:01:39.360> see<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.570> few

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
randomly lick here maybe we'll see a few

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.859 
randomly lick here maybe we'll see a few
more<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.380> well<00:01:40.829> but<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.729> little<00:01:41.880> parts<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
more as well but for little parts the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.200 
more as well but for little parts the
spleen<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.560> practically<00:01:44.210> non-functional

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
spleen is practically non-functional

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.420 
spleen is practically non-functional
besides<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> fact<00:01:45.990> that's<00:01:46.430> tremendously

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
besides the fact that's tremendously

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.550 
besides the fact that's tremendously
smaller<00:01:47.939> than<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.329> should<00:01:48.540> be<00:01:48.720> because<00:01:49.170> it's

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
smaller than it should be because it's

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.609 
smaller than it should be because it's
infarcted<00:01:50.250> itself<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.479> most<00:01:51.659> common<00:01:52.200> reason

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
infarcted itself the most common reason

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.440 
infarcted itself the most common reason
in<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:53.100> country<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:53.820> spleen<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
in this country for a spleen to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.020 
in this country for a spleen to
basically<00:01:54.869> auto<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.619> marked<00:01:55.950> itself<00:01:56.369> would

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
basically auto and marked itself would

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.109 
basically auto and marked itself would
be<00:01:57.240> because<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> small<00:01:58.229> blood<00:01:58.560> vessels<00:01:59.119> that

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
be because the small blood vessels that

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.709 
be because the small blood vessels that
feed<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.750> spleen<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:02.040> been<00:02:02.719> sequestering

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
feed the spleen have been sequestering

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.130 
feed the spleen have been sequestering
sickle<00:02:04.590> cells<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.790> sickle<00:02:06.180> cell<00:02:06.390> anemia<00:02:06.899> is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
sickle cells so sickle cell anemia is
