I'm going to draw this artist start by
going<00:00:03.179> around<00:00:03.689> an<00:00:04.049> oval<00:00:05.359> roll<00:00:06.359> of<00:00:06.569> tape<00:00:06.779> I've

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
going around an oval roll of tape I've

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.209 
going around an oval roll of tape I've
already<00:00:08.130> done<00:00:08.370> it<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:08.730> I<00:00:09.360> am<00:00:09.780> going<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.559> do<00:00:11.099> it

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
freehand leave the top of the oval even

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.740 
freehand leave the top of the oval even
area<00:00:15.420> there<00:00:15.890> so<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.160> will<00:00:17.520> come<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.270> oval

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
area there so I will come in this oval

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.590 
area there so I will come in this oval
shape<00:00:19.369> go<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.670> far<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.029> then<00:00:21.359> I'm<00:00:21.449> going<00:00:21.570> to

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
shape go that far and then I'm going to

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.990 
shape go that far and then I'm going to
stop<00:00:24.980> because<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:27.019> legs<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.730> feet<00:00:29.730> are

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
stop because of the legs and feet are

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.970 
stop because of the legs and feet are
going<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.570> come<00:00:30.900> out<00:00:31.080> from<00:00:31.439> there<00:00:33.770> all<00:00:34.770> right

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
going to come out from there all right

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.030 
going to come out from there all right
then<00:00:35.280> we're<00:00:35.430> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> make<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> skinny<00:00:36.390> little

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
then we're going to make a skinny little

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:47.529 
then we're going to make a skinny little
connection<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.360> into<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:41.450> oval<00:00:42.450> shape<00:00:46.340> and

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
connection and go into a oval shape and

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:54.380 
connection and go into a oval shape and
these<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:49.969> out<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.239> feet<00:00:51.620> which<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:53.360> believe<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
these are out of feet which I believe to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.490 
these are out of feet which I believe to
turn<00:00:54.780> into<00:00:54.960> roots<00:00:55.320> at<00:00:55.980> night<00:00:56.870> this<00:00:57.870> has<00:00:58.199> very

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
turn into roots at night this has very

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.880 
turn into roots at night this has very
tiny<00:00:58.980> eyes<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.469> going<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.710> make<00:01:01.829> a

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
tiny eyes so I'm just going to make a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.149 
tiny eyes so I'm just going to make a
circle<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.359> another<00:01:03.690> circle<00:01:04.439> inside<00:01:04.979> of

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
circle and then another circle inside of

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.450 
circle and then another circle inside of
that<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.630> eyes<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:07.110> red<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.619> think<00:01:07.799> that's

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
that and the eyes are red I think that's

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.010 
that and the eyes are red I think that's
pretty<00:01:08.790> cool<00:01:09.150> just<00:01:09.900> make<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.229> curved<00:01:10.650> line<00:01:12.020> come

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
pretty cool just make a curved line come

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.760 
pretty cool just make a curved line come
down<00:01:13.490> with<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.640> u-shape<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.450> a<00:01:15.960> curve<00:01:16.259> inside

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
down with the u-shape and a curve inside

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.420 
down with the u-shape and a curve inside
for<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> tongue<00:01:17.990> the<00:01:18.990> leads<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.560> top<00:01:19.860> going<00:01:20.250> to

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
for the tongue the leads on top going to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.310 
for the tongue the leads on top going to
follow<00:01:21.799> efficient<00:01:22.799> shape<00:01:23.600> come<00:01:24.600> out<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.080> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
follow efficient shape come out to the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.469 
follow efficient shape come out to the
point

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.529 

they're<00:01:30.110> effective<00:01:30.649> shape<00:01:30.979> down<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.149> center

00:01:32.529 --> 00:01:32.539 
they're effective shape down the center

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.510 
they're effective shape down the center
will<00:01:32.810> make<00:01:33.079> a<00:01:33.110> line<00:01:35.320> we<00:01:36.320> did<00:01:36.590> one<00:01:36.860> on<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.340> other

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
will make a line we did one on the other

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:48.120 
will make a line we did one on the other
side<00:01:39.490> this<00:01:40.490> shape<00:01:41.110> back<00:01:42.110> towards<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:42.979> head

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.309 

come<00:01:49.130> up<00:01:49.250> with<00:01:49.429> a<00:01:49.549> line<00:01:49.759> like<00:01:49.789> a<00:01:50.060> vein<00:01:50.420> this

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
come up with a line like a vein this

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.770 
come up with a line like a vein this
centered<00:01:51.950> leaf<00:01:52.250> is<00:01:53.590> tallest<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:55.210> it's<00:01:56.210> also

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
centered leaf is tallest and it's also

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.149 
centered leaf is tallest and it's also
bent<00:01:57.340> back<00:01:58.340> at<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:59.000> top<00:01:59.240> so<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.869> do<00:02:00.079> this<00:02:00.319> we're

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
bent back at the top so to do this we're

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.719 
bent back at the top so to do this we're
going<00:02:01.189> to<00:02:01.340> curve<00:02:01.640> up<00:02:01.880> make<00:02:02.270> like<00:02:02.659> a<00:02:02.689> moonscape

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
going to curve up make like a moonscape

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.440 
going to curve up make like a moonscape
stop<00:02:04.729> there

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
stop there

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.229 
stop there
pick<00:02:06.080> up<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.530> leaf<00:02:06.770> shape<00:02:06.799> right<00:02:07.520> there<00:02:07.549> and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
pick up the leaf shape right there and

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.289 
pick up the leaf shape right there and
come<00:02:08.899> back<00:02:08.929> down<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:09.950> then<00:02:10.640> we<00:02:10.880> will<00:02:11.090> make<00:02:11.269> a

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
come back down and then we will make a

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.130 
come back down and then we will make a
line<00:02:11.630> a<00:02:11.930> vein<00:02:12.560> through<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.160> center<00:02:13.549> there<00:02:14.140> now

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
line a vein through the center there now

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.520 
line a vein through the center there now
when<00:02:15.500> we<00:02:15.799> see<00:02:16.010> part<00:02:16.430> of<00:02:16.700> these<00:02:17.360> fish<00:02:18.200> state

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
when we see part of these fish state

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.360 
when we see part of these fish state
leaves<00:02:19.930> well<00:02:20.930> we<00:02:21.110> will<00:02:21.319> still<00:02:21.560> put<00:02:21.799> that<00:02:22.010> vein

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
leaves well we will still put that vein

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.509 
leaves well we will still put that vein
and<00:02:23.980> there's<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.340> fifth<00:02:25.549> one<00:02:26.860> I'll<00:02:27.860> start<00:02:27.920> off

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
and there's the fifth one I'll start off

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
inside of each leaf you will give it

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.539 
inside of each leaf you will give it
more<00:02:42.170> dimension<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:43.489> eyes<00:02:43.609> are<00:02:43.910> red
