00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.690 
store and then my boss there let me have
the<00:01:46.230> back<00:01:46.380> corner<00:01:46.830> so<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:47.430> had<00:01:47.610> this

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
the back corner so then I had this

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.940 
the back corner so then I had this
little<00:01:47.910> like<00:01:48.120> mini<00:01:48.330> shop<00:01:48.690> in<00:01:48.900> the<00:01:48.990> back<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.740> so

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
little like mini shop in the back and so

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.080 
little like mini shop in the back and so
I<00:01:49.980> started<00:01:50.370> selling<00:01:50.730> to<00:01:50.760> other<00:01:50.910> stores<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:53.090> it

I started selling to other stores and it
just<00:01:54.330> slowly<00:01:54.570> grew<00:01:55.080> that<00:01:55.320> way<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.940> lot<00:01:56.940> of

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
just slowly grew that way a lot of

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.730 
just slowly grew that way a lot of
designers<00:01:57.480> maybe<00:01:57.930> come<00:01:58.170> from<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:58.500> background

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
designers maybe come from a background

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.440
