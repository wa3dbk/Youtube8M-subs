00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.349
 that of the friends here clarion is far from being on 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:24.409
 their hopes 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.399
 here it is here finally a certain equality 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.210
 she has you all asked me 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.670
 as a result of the video where I was this would it interest you net 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.630
 this one started on the canvas know but all divides 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.070
 So here it is, ending up with a team death match at the map 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.410
 the courtyard afp 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.190
 I play with little people a little later miremont that is to say 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.520
 in the euro zone 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.160
 waiting for the results a meeting is exactly that it is 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
 a very powerful little pistol 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.020
 but who can today that here is fragmentation the will 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 that's okay it's the equivalent of the gas should on the coast 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.460
 antena everything 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.530
 the know-how 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.619
 four strengths and 8% why and to which saint to turn after 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.810
 so in first hit explosive charges 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.780
 car 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.240
 then force skin and finally 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.240
 we will try to talk about it fourth to all 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.000
 and so as if we said to say it but why there is fourth trump 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.010
 despite the fact that all three of these six places where the world goes 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.600
 a young child the sms 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.350
 why creators at all 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.740
 simply on the canvas on certain subjects the possibility of posing the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.500
 time 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.850
 personally I never denied 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.500
 when you want in a time when you are 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.130
 within reach among the states toul site and it's gift molded in its 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.450
 conquer all the grenade launcher 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.700
 all great honors really it's a traveling target 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.370
 he considers that he returns from what makes a big fat brothel when you 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.740
 roll on the map 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.470
 but very effective 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.250
 a so not sold famous 4th at all so it's still to strengthen the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.230
 Charentais 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.440
 it is to improve cross mulching that has more interest to act against 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.409
 like that personally I use water coolers 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.900
 which allowed the narrator and they did much faster and so what 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.179
 which allows you to chain the enemies 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:16.959
 very very quickly 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.549
 the actor who started in March the violence this type of audience so 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.399
 to advance in the talks 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:26.259
 and he surely lands you saw that my arms are made torn 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.739
 and if his parents wisdom that's what I love about the fair 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.540
 it was on his right foot but some who understood in sectors 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.219
 sensitive like this year 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.819
 to your members wish hers to seize to pass half of the body 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.069
 it's not real people like pores it's really very realistic 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.329
 the state are being campaigned for a pomegranate 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:49.519
 hello nation torn why 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.859
 you'll have a little fun it's the bad role of a merchant port that is 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.859
 even worse like on the egg no it's not like that 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.709
 so here's a gameplay level dams that's not telling you the score I'd like 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.899
 Spoil you to the surprise is exceptional 

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:06.649
 but it's a good score anyway 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:09.069
 to know that on a red roof 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.339
 in matter did not leave me like all the matches to be hungry all the parcels 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:13.739
 a team death match 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.349
 it's often small diesel are still small raise the small level 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.659
 so it's worth it is rare to see depressive consolidated from the faa that this 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:24.929
 either 512 cross on the beach am not sure 

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:28.199
 sarah of plastic products only I love 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.069
 what you do a double opportunity to make wines to less than a very 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.929
 enjoy the game 

00:03:33.929 --> 00:03:37.150
 even if on black ops all-powerful left domination shin-soo choo 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.619
 namely to guarantee total domination over the heirs of the port is coty 

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.889
 in the front we do not care about the capped summon surely notorious strong swell 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.119
 who was raging like on this head here face the young unblocked yesterday is 

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:48.719
 your past 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:52.099
 one out of five successes in a row in too many laterite cases 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.159
 advisedly 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.120
 I hear right away we hope that young people are posted as on the 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.469
 coast between that I do not know 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:58.799
 it's a shame 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.079
 do not worry 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.379
 the bishopric on the form the bottom not to pay the consumer bite 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.909
 I have you in March on earlier 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.239
 nantes 7 were pacsÃ©es patio doors in paris more bites 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:14.479
 to close they are much easier 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:16.959
 to be continued 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.329
 you also need to know that when you do 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.870
 carpooling 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.510
 so basically you're also looking for +3 the most growing bullets to keep score 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.300
 the blue team who is at 336 seed they killed two dogs 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 his sister stating that added assistance happened 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:38.209
 in case of posthumous title about the century in the private and public who 

00:04:38.209 --> 00:04:39.469
 is not dead 

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:41.650
 with a small room 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.729
 to know that his ammar share signed the protocol on the party 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.789
 % and so our mining area since the origin that I have 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.719
 ap she alone without touching them strong of this society 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:54.680
 the person in person is one of the favorite weapons 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.319
 favorite forgiveness 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.319
 My personal favorite is the spirit of the moment 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.469
 I love this sector 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.939
 but it's a start of this conflict i was not asking myself and 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:09.709
 do not hesitate to ask me if it interests you that I make you a 

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:11.279
 gameplay as much 

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:12.830
 for his school a lot 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.569
 ariana not interested but it could be nice of montreal 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:19.650
 how time to follow step by step 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.900
 I think I was younger I was happier to know it 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.190
 I redevelop mission I send them little bit when I run I do not know 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.129
 Why 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:28.349
 rafi hariri 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.050
 we must develop them then begin 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.289
 but I speak bas-fonds of France and me 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:36.520
 so the finished habit must be emphasized so if he knows homes of 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.139
 depressive mastiffs 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.159
 the low cost running when we run 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:43.659
 that it's not as if the appeal characters face isere 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.869
 the polemic that the community is doing I wanted was to see people getting 

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:47.819
 catch up 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:50.050
 I see a little test before 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.220
 unfortunately I do not know with mark hurd between the senate did not catch fire 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.289
 and work around it 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.210
 and there I was proud like a big badger from behind 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.710
 here again by a little sand 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.839
 and here is the score is signed so 750 euros for us 

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:09.589
 ap 466 he adds a score of 32 to 5 so that's a good part I think 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.079
 So, as I already told you, do not hesitate to ask me for ideas 

00:06:13.079 --> 00:06:16.639
 I like it on the canvas I'm interested that I love it preparatory 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:21.319
 do not hesitate to leave a small i also like north strafed button 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:22.969
 I love 

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:26.519
 the unions still hope to leave comments as well 

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:28.110
 that I can improve 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.240
 it's by a god in the commentary is far from law 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.589
 far from the other far from there 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:36.409
