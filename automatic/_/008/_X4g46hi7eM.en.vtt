past<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.689> good<00:01:36.840> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> past<00:01:37.290> now<00:01:37.740> of

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
past was it good in the past now of

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.740 
past was it good in the past now of
course<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.189> was<00:01:38.310> good<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.729> was<00:01:38.970> used<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.600> order

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
course it was good it was used in order

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.080 
course it was good it was used in order
to<00:01:39.960> combat<00:01:40.439> against<00:01:40.770> in<00:01:40.979> sectors<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.549> wind

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
to combat against in sectors and wind

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.280 
to combat against in sectors and wind
ups<00:01:42.299> now<00:01:43.850> comparing<00:01:44.850> both<00:01:45.270> wind-ups<00:01:46.049> in

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
ups now comparing both wind-ups in

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.580 
ups now comparing both wind-ups in
sectors<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.210> potential<00:01:48.689> of<00:01:49.170> module

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
sectors and the potential of module

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.969 
sectors and the potential of module
chase<00:01:49.890> are<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.880> equal<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.659> tier<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
chase are they equal in tier if you

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.429 
chase are they equal in tier if you
played<00:01:53.280> wind-ups<00:01:54.180> way<00:01:54.570> back<00:01:54.810> when<00:01:55.049> when<00:01:55.110> they

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
played wind-ups way back when when they

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.770 
played wind-ups way back when when they
were<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.890> know<00:01:55.920> talked<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:56.820> in<00:01:57.299> sectors

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
were you know talked here or in sectors

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.389 
were you know talked here or in sectors
way<00:01:57.960> back<00:01:58.170> when<00:01:58.380> when<00:01:58.439> they<00:01:58.710> were<00:01:58.770> top<00:01:59.040> tier

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
way back when when they were top tier

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.730 
way back when when they were top tier
what<00:02:00.000> would<00:02:00.180> win<00:02:00.390> overall<00:02:00.840> would<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.409> module

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
what would win overall would the module

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.920 
what would win overall would the module

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
take the actual cake

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.729 
take the actual cake
now<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.299> course<00:02:13.359> in<00:02:13.750> response<00:02:14.200> he<00:02:14.379> said<00:02:14.620> you

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
now of course in response he said you

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.770 
now of course in response he said you
know<00:02:14.829> what<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.459> in<00:02:15.609> sectors<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.390> the

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
know what the in sectors and the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.229 
know what the in sectors and the
wind-ups<00:02:17.200> had<00:02:17.469> such<00:02:17.829> powerful<00:02:18.370> combos<00:02:18.969> in

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
wind-ups had such powerful combos in

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.479 
wind-ups had such powerful combos in
other<00:02:20.019> words<00:02:20.290> they<00:02:20.500> were<00:02:20.560> able<00:02:20.829> to<00:02:21.010> get<00:02:21.189> onto

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
other words they were able to get onto

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.780 
other words they were able to get onto
the<00:02:21.909> banned<00:02:22.150> list<00:02:22.379> that<00:02:23.379> it<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:24.159> not<00:02:24.430> really<00:02:24.670> a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
the banned list that it is not really a

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.880 
the banned list that it is not really a
great<00:02:25.060> comparison<00:02:25.480> so<00:02:26.170> what<00:02:26.560> we<00:02:26.680> can

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
great comparison so what we can

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.670 
great comparison so what we can
determine<00:02:27.219> from<00:02:27.430> that<00:02:27.819> is<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.780> card<00:02:29.139> will

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
determine from that is the card will

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.759 
determine from that is the card will
most<00:02:30.010> likely<00:02:30.310> plateau<00:02:31.060> at<00:02:31.239> that<00:02:31.389> point<00:02:31.769> now

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
most likely plateau at that point now

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.949 
most likely plateau at that point now
what<00:02:33.579> we<00:02:33.700> also<00:02:33.879> have<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.269> look<00:02:34.450> at<00:02:34.659> the

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
what we also have to look at the

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.289 
what we also have to look at the
secondary<00:02:35.859> point<00:02:36.250> where<00:02:36.459> we<00:02:36.609> can<00:02:36.790> see<00:02:37.030> if<00:02:37.150> it's

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
secondary point where we can see if it's

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.199 
secondary point where we can see if it's
going<00:02:37.629> to<00:02:37.750> you<00:02:38.139> know<00:02:38.260> increase<00:02:38.950> in<00:02:39.129> value<00:02:39.280> we

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
going to you know increase in value we

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.199 
going to you know increase in value we
look<00:02:40.420> at<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.629> card<00:02:40.870> we<00:02:41.109> say<00:02:41.290> okay<00:02:41.829> is<00:02:42.209> Angeline

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
look at the card we say okay is Angeline

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.720 
look at the card we say okay is Angeline
being<00:02:43.930> removed<00:02:44.319> from<00:02:44.470> both<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.189> field<00:02:45.459> and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
being removed from both the field and

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.360 
being removed from both the field and
the<00:02:46.090> deck<00:02:46.359> going<00:02:47.319> to<00:02:47.470> hurt<00:02:47.769> madolche<00:02:48.129> is

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
the deck going to hurt madolche is

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.699 
the deck going to hurt madolche is
enough<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.939> it<00:02:49.359> will<00:02:49.510> either<00:02:49.870> shut<00:02:50.200> down<00:02:50.260> a

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
enough that it will either shut down a

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.920 
enough that it will either shut down a
potential<00:02:51.189> combo<00:02:51.730> or<00:02:51.879> shut<00:02:52.359> down<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.750> deck

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
potential combo or shut down the deck

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.920 
potential combo or shut down the deck
completely<00:02:53.620> now<00:02:54.280> he<00:02:54.340> said<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.970> could<00:02:55.329> it<00:02:55.599> is<00:02:55.900> a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
completely now he said it could it is a

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.050 
completely now he said it could it is a
very<00:02:56.079> powerful<00:02:56.560> card<00:02:56.889> it<00:02:57.340> is<00:02:57.459> a<00:02:57.489> very<00:02:57.790> powerful

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
very powerful card it is a very powerful

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.959 
very powerful card it is a very powerful
engine<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.290> actual<00:02:59.560> madolche<00:02:59.950> deck<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:00.849> it

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:00.969 
engine in the actual madolche deck so it

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:02.909 
engine in the actual madolche deck so it
does<00:03:01.150> have<00:03:01.389> a<00:03:01.419> great<00:03:01.870> chance<00:03:02.260> of<00:03:02.530> actually

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
does have a great chance of actually

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:05.670 
does have a great chance of actually
stopping<00:03:03.669> you<00:03:04.599> know<00:03:04.719> the<00:03:04.959> plays<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.230> module

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
stopping you know the plays that module

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.220 
stopping you know the plays that module
jays<00:03:05.919> have<00:03:06.489> or<00:03:06.819> the<00:03:07.090> potential<00:03:07.629> that<00:03:07.900> module

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
jays have or the potential that module

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.089 
jays have or the potential that module
jays<00:03:08.500> have<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.340> we<00:03:10.090> can<00:03:10.239> see<00:03:10.450> that<00:03:10.659> price

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
jays have so we can see that price

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.979 
jays have so we can see that price
potentially<00:03:12.099> going<00:03:12.280> up<00:03:12.579> at<00:03:12.939> which<00:03:13.359> point<00:03:13.689> in

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
potentially going up at which point in

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.819 
potentially going up at which point in
his<00:03:14.799> mind<00:03:15.489> it<00:03:15.790> is<00:03:16.359> now<00:03:16.569> a<00:03:16.599> good<00:03:16.750> investment<00:03:17.440> to

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
his mind it is now a good investment to

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.759 
his mind it is now a good investment to
invest<00:03:18.250> pretty<00:03:19.180> much<00:03:19.359> nothing<00:03:19.690> dollars<00:03:20.379> ten

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
invest pretty much nothing dollars ten

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.559 
invest pretty much nothing dollars ten
dollars<00:03:21.220> i<00:03:21.370> think<00:03:21.609> was<00:03:21.760> the<00:03:21.790> super<00:03:22.209> one<00:03:22.359> right

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
dollars i think was the super one right

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:25.469 
dollars i think was the super one right
now<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:23.019> the<00:03:23.709> chain<00:03:24.010> disappearance<00:03:24.639> right<00:03:25.239> now

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:25.479 
now in the chain disappearance right now

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:29.069 
now in the chain disappearance right now
as<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:26.560> stands<00:03:26.859> it<00:03:27.220> has<00:03:27.970> a<00:03:28.000> potential<00:03:28.659> of<00:03:28.780> going

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
as it stands it has a potential of going

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.069 
as it stands it has a potential of going
up<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.889> possibly<00:03:30.519> will<00:03:30.639> plateau<00:03:31.000> but<00:03:31.750> we<00:03:31.870> could

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
up it possibly will plateau but we could

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.750 
up it possibly will plateau but we could
not<00:03:32.199> come<00:03:32.439> up<00:03:32.470> with<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.769> reason<00:03:33.189> for<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.609> go

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
not come up with a reason for it to go

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.969 
not come up with a reason for it to go
down<00:03:33.790> in<00:03:34.239> value<00:03:34.269> because<00:03:34.959> we<00:03:35.319> still<00:03:35.590> see<00:03:35.829> the

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:35.979 
down in value because we still see the

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:39.179 
down in value because we still see the
potential<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.729> the<00:03:36.909> card<00:03:37.269> in<00:03:37.629> that<00:03:38.409> kind<00:03:39.040> of<00:03:39.099> a

potential of the card in that kind of a

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:41.909 
potential of the card in that kind of a
matchup<00:03:39.430> now<00:03:40.209> once<00:03:40.419> again<00:03:40.680> multiple<00:03:41.680> things

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
matchup now once again multiple things

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:43.319 
matchup now once again multiple things
could<00:03:42.129> happen<00:03:42.280> on<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.639> banned<00:03:42.819> list<00:03:42.909> that

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
could happen on the banned list that

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.809 
could happen on the banned list that
maybe<00:03:43.359> brings<00:03:44.079> back<00:03:44.349> in<00:03:44.620> sectors<00:03:45.370> maybe

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:45.819 
maybe brings back in sectors maybe

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.420 
maybe brings back in sectors maybe
brings<00:03:46.180> back<00:03:46.479> wind-ups<00:03:47.409> maybe<00:03:47.829> brings<00:03:48.189> back

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
you can use it on on a regular basis now

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.349 
you can use it on on a regular basis now
it's<00:03:57.069> a<00:03:57.159> card<00:03:57.400> that's<00:03:57.549> not<00:03:57.759> just<00:03:58.030> use<00:03:58.209> our

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
it's a card that's not just use our

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.240 
it's a card that's not just use our
module<00:03:58.689> chase<00:03:58.989> but<00:03:59.500> it's<00:03:59.650> used<00:03:59.889> on<00:04:00.040> multiple

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
module chase but it's used on multiple

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.420 
module chase but it's used on multiple
decks<00:04:00.849> so<00:04:01.479> the<00:04:01.720> potential<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.470> profit<00:04:03.099> in<00:04:03.250> a

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
decks so the potential of profit in a

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.849 
decks so the potential of profit in a
chain<00:04:03.669> disappearance<00:04:04.239> situation<00:04:04.930> is<00:04:05.079> ever

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
chain disappearance situation is ever

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:09.539 
chain disappearance situation is ever
increasing<00:04:06.479> however<00:04:07.479> however<00:04:08.079> however<00:04:08.549> until

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
increasing however however however until

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.240 
increasing however however however until
it<00:04:10.269> actually<00:04:10.449> does<00:04:11.019> that<00:04:11.259> increase<00:04:11.620> it<00:04:11.949> will

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
it actually does that increase it will

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.869 
it actually does that increase it will
stay<00:04:12.549> at<00:04:12.790> a<00:04:12.819> plateau<00:04:13.150> which<00:04:14.049> means<00:04:14.409> if<00:04:14.879> you're

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
stay at a plateau which means if you're

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.180 
stay at a plateau which means if you're
going<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.150> tie<00:04:16.479> up<00:04:16.690> your<00:04:16.720> money<00:04:17.169> it's<00:04:17.889> not<00:04:18.130> a

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
going to tie up your money it's not a

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.519 
going to tie up your money it's not a
good<00:04:18.459> investment<00:04:18.940> however<00:04:19.720> if<00:04:19.959> you<00:04:20.079> have<00:04:20.289> some

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:20.529 
good investment however if you have some

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.260 
good investment however if you have some
extra<00:04:20.680> funds<00:04:21.159> it<00:04:21.639> would<00:04:21.880> be<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.029> good

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
extra funds it would be a good

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.750 
extra funds it would be a good
investment<00:04:22.779> to<00:04:23.139> sit<00:04:23.440> on<00:04:23.469> and<00:04:23.860> wait<00:04:24.219> and<00:04:24.460> watch

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
investment to sit on and wait and watch

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.280 
investment to sit on and wait and watch
it<00:04:25.000> increase<00:04:25.479> in<00:04:25.690> value

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
it increase in value

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.110 
it increase in value
hopefully<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.190> guys<00:04:27.370> took<00:04:27.670> a<00:04:27.730> little<00:04:27.940> bit

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
hopefully you guys took a little bit

hopefully you guys took a little bit
from<00:04:28.330> this<00:04:28.570> actual<00:04:28.960> episode<00:04:29.320> make<00:04:29.980> sure<00:04:30.190> that

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
from this actual episode make sure that

from this actual episode make sure that
you're<00:04:30.550> doing<00:04:30.790> this<00:04:31.030> would<00:04:31.240> not<00:04:31.450> just<00:04:31.810> chain

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
you're doing this would not just chain

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.080 
you're doing this would not just chain
disappearance<00:04:32.920> but<00:04:33.070> doing<00:04:33.310> it<00:04:33.400> with<00:04:33.550> multiple

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
disappearance but doing it with multiple

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.060 
disappearance but doing it with multiple
different<00:04:34.270> cards<00:04:34.840> different<00:04:35.590> cards<00:04:35.920> that

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
different cards different cards that

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.400 
different cards different cards that
