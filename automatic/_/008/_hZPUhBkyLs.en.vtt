kind of geometry and why you should try

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.400 
kind of geometry and why you should try
to<00:00:33.930> keep<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.380> like<00:00:34.559> that<00:00:35.329> so<00:00:36.329> when<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.020> mirrored

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
to keep it like that so when I mirrored

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.500 
to keep it like that so when I mirrored
the<00:00:37.530> surface<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.219> then<00:00:38.640> use<00:00:38.879> these<00:00:39.270> two

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the surface and then use these two

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.110 
the surface and then use these two
surfaces<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.260> input<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> tangential<00:00:41.489> VSR

the same low number of control points

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.680 
the same low number of control points
and<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.250> got<00:00:47.430> perfect<00:00:47.670> transitions<00:00:48.360> between

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
this kind of etches I run into trouble

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.960 
this kind of etches I run into trouble
for<00:01:09.350> example<00:01:09.830> a<00:01:09.979> perfect<00:01:10.430> position<00:01:10.580> of

for example a perfect position of

complicated<00:01:23.009> too

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.770 

mirroring<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:29.220> surface<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.910> using<00:01:30.210> two<00:01:30.540> such

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.080 
edges as input for surface blend you can
see<00:01:33.540> that<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> same<00:01:34.230> happens<00:01:34.590> there<00:01:34.940> you<00:01:35.940> get

see that the same happens there you get

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.180 
see that the same happens there you get
a<00:01:36.120> highly<00:01:36.420> complex<00:01:36.900> result<00:01:37.350> surface<00:01:37.770> with

a highly complex result surface with

a highly complex result surface with
only<00:01:38.400> fair<00:01:38.820> connections<00:01:39.300> to<00:01:39.510> the<00:01:39.630> input

only fair connections to the input

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.860 
only fair connections to the input
surfaces<00:01:40.490> so<00:01:41.490> your<00:01:41.700> strategy<00:01:42.420> should<00:01:42.450> be<00:01:42.720> to

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
surfaces so your strategy should be to

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.230 
surfaces so your strategy should be to
avoid<00:01:43.290> trimmed<00:01:43.650> edges<00:01:44.040> as<00:01:44.280> long<00:01:44.550> as<00:01:44.760> possible

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
how to achieve that if the trimming

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.240 
how to achieve that if the trimming

the<00:01:52.399> surface<00:01:52.759> to<00:01:52.909> trim<00:01:53.149> you<00:01:53.659> can<00:01:53.899> use<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.380> VSR

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
the surface to trim you can use the VSR

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.770 
the surface to trim you can use the VSR
split<00:01:55.040> function<00:01:55.250> to<00:01:55.700> get<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:56.090> single-span

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
wanted the original surface can be kept

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.050 
wanted the original surface can be kept
