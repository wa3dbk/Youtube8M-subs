00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
hair and as we know and I've mentioned

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.539 
hair and as we know and I've mentioned
in<00:01:05.580> an<00:01:05.700> earlier<00:01:05.790> video<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.740> banana<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.400> like

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
in an earlier video the banana and like

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.520 
in an earlier video the banana and like
plantains<00:01:09.150> which<00:01:09.390> are<00:01:09.510> also<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.780> part<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.170> that

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
plantains which are also a part of that

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.510 
plantains which are also a part of that
family<00:01:10.850> what<00:01:11.850> they<00:01:12.000> do<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.360> they<00:01:12.510> aid<00:01:12.810> in

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
family what they do is they aid in

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.580 
family what they do is they aid in
retaining<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> elasticity<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:16.110> curls<00:01:16.380> so

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
retaining the elasticity of the curls so

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.880 
retaining the elasticity of the curls so
making<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.950> bouncier<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:18.450> whatnot<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.140> yeah

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
making it bouncier or whatnot but yeah

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.969 
making it bouncier or whatnot but yeah
so<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.340> was<00:01:20.610> my<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.450> guess<00:01:21.990> my<00:01:22.020> quick<00:01:22.439> -<00:01:22.680> I

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so that was my I guess my quick - I

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.609 
so that was my I guess my quick - I
don't<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.909> life<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.049> busy<00:01:25.259> right<00:01:25.470> now

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
don't know life is really busy right now

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.770 
don't know life is really busy right now
that's<00:01:25.860> why<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> haven't<00:01:26.250> been<00:01:26.780> uploading

that's why I haven't been uploading

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.010 
that's why I haven't been uploading

if you want to add slip to any

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.109 
if you want to add slip to any
conditioner<00:01:41.280> or<00:01:41.579> whatever

conditioner or whatever
add<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.750> ripe<00:01:43.020> banana<00:01:43.340> why<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.369> write<00:01:44.850> them

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
add a ripe banana why I write them

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.719 
add a ripe banana why I write them
banana<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.570> may<00:01:45.689> ask<00:01:46.220> well<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.340> ripened

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
banana you may ask well the ripened

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.190 
banana you may ask well the ripened
banana<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.780> sugars<00:01:49.670> over<00:01:50.670> time<00:01:50.939> usually<00:01:51.869> is

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
banana the sugars over time usually is

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.730 
banana the sugars over time usually is
the<00:01:52.350> oxidative<00:01:52.920> process<00:01:53.490> I'm<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:53.909> quite<00:01:54.149> sure

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
the oxidative process I'm not quite sure

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.679 
the oxidative process I'm not quite sure
which<00:01:55.740> means<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.100> loss<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.460> electrons<00:01:56.909> but

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
which means a loss of electrons but

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.190 
which means a loss of electrons but
anymore

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
anymore

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.090

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.590 
but the sugars interact with the with
the<00:02:06.760> hair<00:02:06.970> so<00:02:07.960> look<00:02:08.619> at<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:09.280> lot<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:10.060> is

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
the hair so look at a lot of the is

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.270 
the hair so look at a lot of the is
natural<00:02:12.030> hair<00:02:13.170> like<00:02:14.170> conditioners<00:02:14.920> and

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
natural hair like conditioners and

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.620 
natural hair like conditioners and
creams<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.700> things<00:02:15.910> like<00:02:16.060> that<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.510> you'll

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
creams and things like that and you'll

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.440 
creams and things like that and you'll
notice<00:02:16.930> they<00:02:17.110> have<00:02:17.290> something<00:02:17.590> like<00:02:18.450> sorbitol

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
notice they have something like sorbitol

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.380 
notice they have something like sorbitol
or<00:02:20.080> some<00:02:20.709> kind<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.100> sugar<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.000> and<00:02:22.270> that's

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
or some kind of sugar in it and that's

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.920 
or some kind of sugar in it and that's
because<00:02:22.750> it<00:02:22.900> interacts<00:02:23.470> with<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.670> UM<00:02:24.930> strands

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
because it interacts with the UM strands

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.460 
because it interacts with the UM strands
of<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.620> hair<00:02:27.209> or<00:02:28.209> the<00:02:28.239> bonds<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.260> hair

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
of the hair or the bonds of the hair

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.949 
of the hair or the bonds of the hair
like<00:02:29.739> the<00:02:29.860> O<00:02:29.890> H<00:02:30.190> bonds<00:02:30.700> sugars<00:02:31.450> have<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.690> lot<00:02:31.930> of

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
like the O H bonds sugars have a lot of

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.860 
like the O H bonds sugars have a lot of
Oh<00:02:32.170> H<00:02:32.410> bonds<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.220> so<00:02:33.819> being<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.390> hair<00:02:34.750> is

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
Oh H bonds and so being that hair is

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.110 
Oh H bonds and so being that hair is
protein<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:37.000> has<00:02:37.239> a<00:02:37.270> it's<00:02:37.690> amino<00:02:39.000> protein<00:02:40.000> is

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
protein it has a it's amino protein is

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.420 
protein it has a it's amino protein is
made<00:02:40.300> of<00:02:40.540> amino<00:02:41.170> acids<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:44.010> fast<00:02:45.010> I<00:02:45.280> was

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
made of amino acids and so fast I was

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.120 
made of amino acids and so fast I was
saying<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:46.150> have<00:02:46.180> amino<00:02:46.750> amino<00:02:47.350> acids<00:02:47.920> are

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
saying you have amino amino acids are

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.620 
saying you have amino amino acids are
the<00:02:48.190> building<00:02:48.400> blocks<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:50.110> proteins<00:02:50.800> okay<00:02:51.760> so

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
the building blocks to proteins okay so

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.050 
the building blocks to proteins okay so
we<00:02:53.260> may<00:02:53.380> see<00:02:53.440> things<00:02:53.709> as<00:02:53.980> hydrolyzed<00:02:54.519> protein

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
we may see things as hydrolyzed protein

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.759 
we may see things as hydrolyzed protein
hydrolyzed<00:02:55.570> proteins<00:02:56.080> are<00:02:56.200> just<00:02:56.410> smaller

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
hydrolyzed proteins are just smaller

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.310 
hydrolyzed proteins are just smaller
chunks<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.340> actual<00:02:57.760> protein<00:02:58.180> it's<00:02:58.930> probably

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
chunks of actual protein it's probably

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.990 
chunks of actual protein it's probably
easier<00:02:59.620> for<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.890> hair<00:03:00.070> to<00:03:00.100> uptake<00:03:00.640> amino

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
easier for the hair to uptake amino

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.370 
easier for the hair to uptake amino
acids<00:03:01.510> because<00:03:01.570> they<00:03:01.840> are<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.200> building

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
acids because they are the building

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.479 
acids because they are the building
blocks<00:03:02.800> think<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.310> like<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.580> single<00:03:04.680> block<00:03:05.680> or

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
blocks think of like a single block or

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.490 
blocks think of like a single block or
like<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.640> Lego<00:03:06.940> or<00:03:07.180> something<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:08.140> then<00:03:08.320> put

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
like a Lego or something and then put

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.990 
like a Lego or something and then put
them<00:03:08.620> all<00:03:08.739> together<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.190> make<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.340> castle<00:03:09.850> or

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
them all together and make a castle or

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.180 
them all together and make a castle or
whatever<00:03:10.420> that's<00:03:11.110> like<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.500> amino<00:03:11.739> going

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
whatever that's like the amino going

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.979 
whatever that's like the amino going
from<00:03:12.340> the<00:03:12.430> amino<00:03:12.610> acid<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.420> protein<00:03:13.870> the

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
from the amino acid to the protein the

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.660 
from the amino acid to the protein the
protein<00:03:14.019> is<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.620> bigger<00:03:14.920> spectrum<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.549> the

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
protein is the bigger spectrum of the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.330 
protein is the bigger spectrum of the
amino<00:03:15.940> acid<00:03:16.420> is<00:03:16.540> just<00:03:16.840> that<00:03:17.049> small<00:03:17.380> chunk<00:03:17.920> is

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
amino acid is just that small chunk is

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.050 
amino acid is just that small chunk is
the<00:03:18.579> very<00:03:19.500> basic<00:03:20.610> building<00:03:21.610> for<00:03:21.850> from<00:03:22.000> the

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
the very basic building for from the

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.350 
the very basic building for from the
very<00:03:22.299> basic<00:03:22.690> foundation<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.350> a<00:03:23.440> protein<00:03:24.360> so

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
very basic foundation of a protein so

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.960 
very basic foundation of a protein so
amino<00:03:25.870> acids<00:03:26.350> have<00:03:26.470> an<00:03:26.560> amino<00:03:26.860> end<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.760> it<00:03:27.850> has

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
amino acids have an amino end and it has

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.810 
amino acids have an amino end and it has
an<00:03:28.120> acid<00:03:28.570> end<00:03:29.070> depending<00:03:30.070> on<00:03:30.250> what<00:03:30.370> type<00:03:30.549> of<00:03:30.670> s

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
an acid end depending on what type of s

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.220 
an acid end depending on what type of s
it<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.180> like<00:03:31.650> carboxylic<00:03:32.650> acids<00:03:33.250> are<00:03:33.790> usually

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
it is like carboxylic acids are usually

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.180 
it is like carboxylic acids are usually
um<00:03:35.700> recognized<00:03:36.700> by<00:03:36.880> having<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.780> O<00:03:37.810> H<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.590> C

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
um recognized by having the O H a C

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.229 
um recognized by having the O H a C
double<00:03:39.820> bond<00:03:40.000> o<00:03:40.209> and<00:03:40.690> then<00:03:40.930> Oh<00:03:41.110> H<00:03:41.320> I<00:03:41.880> know<00:03:42.880> I'm

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
double bond o and then Oh H I know I'm

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.900 
double bond o and then Oh H I know I'm
speaking<00:03:43.450> to<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.690> varied<00:03:44.110> audience<00:03:44.590> out<00:03:44.799> there

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
speaking to a varied audience out there

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.000 
speaking to a varied audience out there
so<00:03:45.910> in<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.750> future<00:03:47.079> I'll<00:03:47.260> work<00:03:47.470> on<00:03:47.620> its

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
so in the future I'll work on its

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.250 
so in the future I'll work on its
breaking<00:03:48.459> it<00:03:48.549> down<00:03:48.730> it's<00:03:49.060> a<00:03:49.150> simpler<00:03:49.600> into<00:03:50.230> a

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
breaking it down it's a simpler into a

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.680 
breaking it down it's a simpler into a
simpler<00:03:50.530> explanation<00:03:50.709> if<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.730> need<00:03:52.030> me<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.450> I

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
simpler explanation if you need me to I

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.350 
simpler explanation if you need me to I
know<00:03:53.410> not<00:03:53.560> everybody's<00:03:54.160> into<00:03:54.549> science<00:03:55.150> or

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
know not everybody's into science or

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.630 
know not everybody's into science or
chemistry<00:03:55.540> and<00:03:56.019> stuff<00:03:56.260> like<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.799> but<00:03:57.579> that

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
chemistry and stuff like that but that

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.900 
chemistry and stuff like that but that
is<00:03:57.820> why<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.120> sugars<00:03:59.220> interact<00:04:00.220> with<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.670> hair

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
is why the sugars interact with the hair

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.460 
is why the sugars interact with the hair
and<00:04:01.180> I<00:04:01.239> think<00:04:01.420> it's<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.630> sugars<00:04:02.019> that's<00:04:02.320> why<00:04:02.440> I

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
and I think it's the sugars that's why I

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.180 
and I think it's the sugars that's why I
choose<00:04:02.680> a<00:04:02.739> ripen<00:04:03.250> banana<00:04:03.660> versus<00:04:04.660> a<00:04:05.190> bananas

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
choose a ripen banana versus a bananas

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.180 
choose a ripen banana versus a bananas
barely<00:04:06.850> ripen<00:04:07.299> well<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.260> hope<00:04:08.530> this<00:04:08.709> tip<00:04:08.920> will

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
barely ripen well I hope this tip will

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.250 
barely ripen well I hope this tip will
