you<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.590> um<00:01:46.890> let's<00:01:47.670> see<00:01:47.909> open<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.840> up<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.399> see

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
you so um let's see open that up and see

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.399 
you so um let's see open that up and see
what's<00:01:50.850> inside<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:51.630> has<00:01:51.930> Swiss<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.380> a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
what's inside this one has Swiss have a

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.780 
what's inside this one has Swiss have a
Araki<00:01:53.040> hot<00:01:53.250> dog

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
Araki hot dog

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.660 
Araki hot dog
so<00:01:54.210> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.290> shape<00:01:55.530> this<00:01:56.189> normal

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670
