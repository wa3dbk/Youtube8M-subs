00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:05.109 
hey guys i am here with another redstone

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.110 
hey guys i am here with another redstone
video<00:00:05.620> i<00:00:05.830> made<00:00:06.759> a<00:00:06.819> nice<00:00:07.569> level<00:00:07.839> 2<00:00:08.170> bit<00:00:08.349> adder

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
video i made a nice level 2 bit adder

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.850 
video i made a nice level 2 bit adder
see<00:00:10.120> if<00:00:10.269> you<00:00:10.360> had<00:00:10.480> a<00:00:10.919> 1<00:00:11.919> +<00:00:12.280> 0<00:00:13.559> you'll<00:00:14.559> end<00:00:14.740> up

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
see if you had a 1 + 0 you'll end up

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.740 
see if you had a 1 + 0 you'll end up
with<00:00:14.919> one<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:16.480> if<00:00:17.350> you<00:00:17.439> add<00:00:17.560> one<00:00:17.800> to<00:00:17.949> that<00:00:18.750> i'll

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:19.750 
with one and if you add one to that i'll

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.330 
with one and if you add one to that i'll
look<00:00:20.019> it<00:00:20.470> too<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:23.289> kidding<00:00:23.590> about<00:00:23.679> the<00:00:23.949> two

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
look it too just kidding about the two

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.490 
look it too just kidding about the two
bit<00:00:24.550> part<00:00:24.849> it's<00:00:25.150> actually<00:00:25.300> a<00:00:25.980> 16-bit<00:00:28.500> that

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
bit part it's actually a 16-bit that

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.139 
bit part it's actually a 16-bit that
means<00:00:29.710> uh<00:00:30.150> it'll<00:00:31.150> add<00:00:31.330> two<00:00:31.599> numbers<00:00:31.779> up<00:00:32.290> to

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
means uh it'll add two numbers up to

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.860 
means uh it'll add two numbers up to
32,000<00:00:34.149> samode<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:36.520> let<00:00:37.510> me<00:00:39.510> let<00:00:40.510> me<00:00:40.629> show<00:00:40.840> you

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
32,000 samode so let me let me show you

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:50.340 
32,000 samode so let me let me show you
that<00:00:41.020> i<00:00:42.480> lad<00:00:43.480> so<00:00:47.070> what's<00:00:48.070> this<00:00:49.170> actually<00:00:50.170> more

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
that i lad so what's this actually more

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.560 
that i lad so what's this actually more
than<00:00:50.379> 32,000<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:52.629> will<00:00:52.780> actually<00:00:52.930> go<00:00:54.570> I'm

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
than 32,000 this will actually go I'm

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.900 
than 32,000 this will actually go I'm
going<00:00:55.690> to<00:00:55.809> turn<00:00:55.899> these<00:00:56.050> all<00:00:56.230> on<00:00:56.410> that'll<00:00:56.710> be

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.810 

65535<00:01:01.469> that's<00:01:02.469> all<00:01:02.680> of<00:01:02.829> them<00:01:02.859> on<00:01:04.560> and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:06.640> if

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
65535 that's all of them on and then if

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.230 
65535 that's all of them on and then if
I<00:01:06.970> had<00:01:07.090> one<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.480> that<00:01:07.690> it<00:01:08.530> should<00:01:08.890> just<00:01:09.430> cancel

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
I had one to that it should just cancel

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.820 
I had one to that it should just cancel
everything<00:01:10.780> off<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:12.790> all<00:01:12.970> the<00:01:13.090> way<00:01:13.120> down<00:01:13.240> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:29.910 

600<00:01:17.830> or<00:01:19.920> 65535<00:01:20.920> plus<00:01:21.280> 1<00:01:21.550> is<00:01:26.160> 65,536<00:01:27.160> yeah<00:01:28.920> all

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
600 or 65535 plus 1 is 65,536 yeah all

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.750 
600 or 65535 plus 1 is 65,536 yeah all
right<00:01:30.630> just<00:01:31.630> kidding<00:01:31.930> about<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.170> 16-bit<00:01:32.620> part

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.300 

actually

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.890 

128<00:01:43.310> bits<00:01:45.340> sighs<00:01:46.360> okay<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.390> don't<00:01:47.540> want<00:01:47.660> to<00:01:47.720> fall

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
128 bits sighs okay I don't want to fall

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:54.580 
128 bits sighs okay I don't want to fall
off<00:01:48.080> this<00:01:49.360> okay<00:01:50.360> it's<00:01:51.790> eight<00:01:52.790> of<00:01:53.180> these<00:01:53.630> 16-bit

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
off this okay it's eight of these 16-bit

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.790 
off this okay it's eight of these 16-bit
little<00:01:54.890> segments<00:01:55.400> that<00:01:55.550> I<00:01:55.610> made<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.590> I<00:01:57.590> just

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
little segments that I made and I just

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.780 
little segments that I made and I just
copied<00:01:58.040> them<00:01:58.370> and<00:01:58.780> connect<00:01:59.780> them<00:02:00.020> together<00:02:01.900> so

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
copied them and connect them together so

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.490 
copied them and connect them together so
to<00:02:04.790> my<00:02:04.910> knowledge<00:02:04.940> at<00:02:05.420> least<00:02:05.450> this<00:02:05.840> is<00:02:06.080> the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
to my knowledge at least this is the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.470 
to my knowledge at least this is the
largest<00:02:07.190> adder<00:02:07.580> ever<00:02:08.150> created<00:02:08.720> in<00:02:08.960> Minecraft

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.480 
largest adder ever created in Minecraft

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.900 
largest adder ever created in Minecraft
largest<00:02:11.480> by<00:02:11.600> bit<00:02:11.840> number<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.290> I'll<00:02:12.350> by<00:02:12.500> size

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
largest by bit number and I'll by size

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.090 
largest by bit number and I'll by size
Zack<00:02:13.910> it's<00:02:14.390> actually<00:02:14.780> pretty<00:02:15.070> small<00:02:16.070> in

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
Zack it's actually pretty small in

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.470 
Zack it's actually pretty small in
comparison<00:02:16.490> to<00:02:17.060> most<00:02:17.210> adders<00:02:22.210> just<00:02:23.210> to<00:02:23.330> prove

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
comparison to most adders just to prove

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.220 
comparison to most adders just to prove
that<00:02:23.570> it<00:02:23.900> works<00:02:24.050> will<00:02:24.380> go<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:25.870> very<00:02:26.870> top

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
that it works will go to the very top

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:38.260 
that it works will go to the very top
bit<00:02:32.170> which<00:02:33.170> is<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.380> very<00:02:33.650> high<00:02:34.040> up<00:02:36.250> okay<00:02:37.270> who

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
bit which is a very high up okay who

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:51.010 
bit which is a very high up okay who
fail<00:02:38.600> fail<00:02:38.900> fail<00:02:38.930> fail<00:02:39.170> fail<00:02:44.740> yeah<00:02:49.090> well<00:02:50.090> that

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
fail fail fail fail fail yeah well that

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.670 
fail fail fail fail fail yeah well that
was<00:02:51.230> fun<00:02:52.930> anyway<00:02:53.930> i'm<00:02:54.020> sure<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.290> guys<00:02:54.350> believe
