I would plug it in the screen and come

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.940 
I would plug it in the screen and come
up<00:02:42.250> then<00:02:42.430> disappear<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.680> there<00:02:44.680> would<00:02:44.769> be<00:02:44.800> a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
up then disappear and there would be a

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.750 
up then disappear and there would be a
red<00:02:45.280> light<00:02:45.550> I<00:02:46.709> mean<00:02:47.709> not<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.160> red<00:02:48.610> light

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
red light I mean not that red light

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.640 
red light I mean not that red light
means<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.060> recording<00:02:49.630> but<00:02:50.290> there<00:02:50.470> would<00:02:50.620> be

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
means it's recording but there would be

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.620

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
a that yellow light would appear there

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.460 
a that yellow light would appear there
so<00:02:53.350> we'll<00:02:53.470> turn<00:02:53.590> that<00:02:53.769> off<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:55.110> that<00:02:56.110> yellow

so we'll turn that off and that yellow

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.710 
so we'll turn that off and that yellow
light<00:02:56.860> that's<00:02:57.400> what<00:02:57.670> would<00:02:57.760> be<00:02:57.820> there<00:02:58.209> and

and<00:06:22.400> this<00:06:22.669> exporting<00:06:23.330> in<00:06:23.419> that<00:06:23.570> and<00:06:24.020> there<00:06:24.830> was

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 
and this exporting in that and there was

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:29.590 
and this exporting in that and there was
one<00:06:25.370> other<00:06:25.550> thing<00:06:27.940> there's<00:06:28.940> a<00:06:29.030> way<00:06:29.240> to<00:06:29.270> get<00:06:29.480> the

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 
one other thing there's a way to get the

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.760 
one other thing there's a way to get the
light<00:06:29.870> on<00:06:30.139> it<00:06:30.350> so<00:06:31.660> my<00:06:32.660> thing<00:06:33.050> now<00:06:33.200> there<00:06:33.500> used

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
light on it so my thing now there used

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.530 
light on it so my thing now there used
to<00:06:33.860> be<00:06:33.919> a<00:06:34.040> huge<00:06:34.370> blue<00:06:34.639> light<00:06:34.880> when<00:06:35.180> you<00:06:35.240> turn<00:06:35.419> it

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540
