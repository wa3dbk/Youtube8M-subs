00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:12.719
 I thought look and tell people what the ball is 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.880
 stop, I'm here to make one more 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.789
 video for you guys this time I'll bring a 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:23.460
 tutorial tutorial that I will bring today is 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:27.180
 of 1 is how to make a generator of 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:35.730
 August in double stares only stone generator 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:38.370
 double-break which is very easy to do 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.489
 the main reason that continuing the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.890
 main reason for me doing this from here 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.910
 is that the flying saucer worker nani 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.430
 dinner 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.840
 everyone knows and they were 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.710
 playing a map of sky bloch and he 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.440
 there were hours and hours there picking up stone 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:04.460
 with a generator only then I solved 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:07.170
 to teach that I make a dual generator 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.900
 It's very easy for you to do what I 'm doing. 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:15.280
 doing is easy poetry 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:21.460
 I was stride boot side close corner 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:25.270
 here does the same thing here complete and 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.910
 close here is a hole in the hole 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.480
 right here to stay that way here 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:38.080
 you will do the following you will rise 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:40.540
 one more block than if you put the lava 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.290
 on the low block he will see the olp 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.920
 video 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:49.210
 then you will put water here water 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.619
 here and will vote on a lava mean 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.750
 Before you go to stone here. 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.140
 And now it's just water to talk here, I want to. 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.770
 Say she will fall and will try to fall 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.060
 from both sides and the breaking it you can 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.709
 close up here pest do not freeze 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.350
 the lava can leave it open to 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.510
 vary a little bit but that's it guys 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.890
 I wanted to make a quick video where 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.480
 tutorial for you I will finish the 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.480
 video here so said guys
