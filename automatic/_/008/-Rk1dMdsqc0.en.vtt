just like Fred if he's got two little
pushing<00:01:02.190> his<00:01:02.340> roll<00:01:02.609> back<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.660> push<00:01:03.870> it

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
pushing his roll back of the push it

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.490 
pushing his roll back of the push it
there's<00:01:05.519> nothing<00:01:05.610> there's<00:01:06.060> nothing<00:01:06.119> right<00:01:07.110> so
