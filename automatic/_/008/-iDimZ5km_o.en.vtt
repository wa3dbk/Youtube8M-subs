spotlight today we're going to be having
a<00:00:10.139> look<00:00:10.410> at<00:00:10.680> one<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.370> bill<00:00:11.610> craft<00:00:12.050> machines

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
a look at one of the bill craft machines

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.320 
a look at one of the bill craft machines
it's<00:00:14.070> been<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.220> while<00:00:14.460> since<00:00:14.820> we've<00:00:15.030> had<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.180> look

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
it's been a while since we've had a look

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.230 
it's been a while since we've had a look
at<00:00:15.570> anything<00:00:16.139> from<00:00:16.439> BuildCraft<00:00:16.950> but<00:00:17.849> this<00:00:18.060> is

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
at anything from BuildCraft but this is

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.650 
at anything from BuildCraft but this is
the<00:00:18.390> architect<00:00:18.900> table<00:00:19.610> and<00:00:20.610> if<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.180> open<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.600> up

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
the architect table and if we open it up

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.260 
the architect table and if we open it up
and<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.080> look<00:00:22.430> it's<00:00:23.430> got<00:00:23.610> quite<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.880> simple

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
and have a look it's got quite a simple

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.800 
and have a look it's got quite a simple
interface<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:26.160> basically<00:00:26.520> have<00:00:26.880> our<00:00:27.240> inputs

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
interface we basically have our inputs

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.859 
interface we basically have our inputs
lot<00:00:28.080> our<00:00:28.590> output<00:00:29.130> slot<00:00:29.430> and<00:00:29.670> then<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> progress

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
lot our output slot and then a progress

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.400 
lot our output slot and then a progress
bar<00:00:31.790> and<00:00:32.790> that's<00:00:33.030> pretty<00:00:33.510> much<00:00:33.629> all<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.260> these

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
bar and that's pretty much all of these

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.930 
bar and that's pretty much all of these
to<00:00:34.920> the<00:00:35.040> interface<00:00:35.309> very<00:00:36.000> very<00:00:36.300> simple<00:00:36.750> now<00:00:37.940> as

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
to the interface very very simple now as

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.570 
to the interface very very simple now as

it<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.839> little<00:00:43.199> bit<00:00:43.379> more<00:00:43.860> involved<00:00:45.140> more

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
it is is a little bit more involved more

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.899 
it is is a little bit more involved more
expensive<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.860> quite<00:00:47.040> expensive<00:00:47.309> little

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:47.909 
expensive is quite expensive little

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:52.009 
expensive is quite expensive little
machine<00:00:49.040> because<00:00:50.040> what<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.309> will<00:00:50.400> do<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.019> it's

machine because what it will do is it's
quite<00:00:52.379> cool<00:00:52.760> now<00:00:53.900> here<00:00:54.900> we<00:00:55.019> have<00:00:55.140> we've<00:00:55.379> got

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
quite cool now here we have we've got

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.859 
quite cool now here we have we've got
two<00:00:55.710> diamond<00:00:56.070> gears<00:00:56.339> as<00:00:56.699> part<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.119> this<00:00:57.269> recipe

two diamond gears as part of this recipe

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:02.359 
two diamond gears as part of this recipe
and<00:00:59.839> they're<00:01:00.839> going<00:01:01.049> to<00:01:01.110> take<00:01:01.320> four<00:01:01.680> diamond

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:02.369 
and they're going to take four diamond

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:07.060 
and they're going to take four diamond
each<00:01:02.640> for<00:01:03.150> gold<00:01:03.420> each<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.440> iron<00:01:04.890> each<00:01:05.210> so

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
each for gold each and for iron each so

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.410 
each for gold each and for iron each so
fairly<00:01:08.070> expensive<00:01:08.520> you're<00:01:09.000> going<00:01:09.149> to<00:01:09.210> need

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
fairly expensive you're going to need

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.069 
fairly expensive you're going to need
eight<00:01:09.899> diamonds<00:01:11.509> so<00:01:12.509> even<00:01:12.750> think<00:01:12.960> about

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
eight diamonds so even think about

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.830 
eight diamonds so even think about
making<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:14.450> and<00:01:15.450> you've<00:01:15.600> got<00:01:15.719> your

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
making this and you've got your

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.859 
making this and you've got your
dandelion<00:01:16.200> yellow<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.920> your<00:01:17.039> ink<00:01:17.250> sacs

landmark on the top crafting table in

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:22.370 
landmark on the top crafting table in
the<00:01:20.670> middle<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.780> something<00:01:22.020> called<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the middle and it's something called a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.840 
the middle and it's something called a
template<00:01:22.950> underneath<00:01:23.640> now<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.689> template<00:01:25.850> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
template underneath now the template you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.779 
template underneath now the template you
make<00:01:27.060> by<00:01:27.450> putting<00:01:27.810> paper<00:01:28.380> around<00:01:29.189> ink<00:01:29.520> sack

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:29.789 
make by putting paper around ink sack

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.069 
make by putting paper around ink sack
like<00:01:30.570> so<00:01:30.929> and<00:01:32.210> that's<00:01:33.210> because<00:01:33.450> what<00:01:33.869> this

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
like so and that's because what this

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
like so and that's because what this
machine<00:01:34.229> will<00:01:34.590> actually<00:01:34.920> do<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.399> you<00:01:35.549> is<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
machine will actually do for you is it

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.419 
machine will actually do for you is it
will<00:01:37.100> copy<00:01:38.100> an<00:01:38.490> area<00:01:38.999> on<00:01:39.179> to<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.509> template<00:01:40.429> to

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
will copy an area on to a template to

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.700 
will copy an area on to a template to
allow<00:01:41.609> you<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.880> save<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.020> possibly

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
allow you to save it and possibly

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.520 
allow you to save it and possibly
rebuild<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.640> later<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:44.999> using<00:01:45.840> another

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
rebuild it later on using another

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.800 
rebuild it later on using another
BuildCraft<00:01:47.070> machine<00:01:47.429> which<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:48.030> will<00:01:48.210> cover

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
BuildCraft machine which I will cover

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.309 
BuildCraft machine which I will cover
another<00:01:49.079> time<00:01:49.759> so<00:01:50.759> let's<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.960> a<00:01:52.020> quick<00:01:52.289> look

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
another time so let's have a quick look

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:57.499 
another time so let's have a quick look
at<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:52.950> action<00:01:54.679> now<00:01:55.909> in<00:01:56.909> order<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.299> get

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
at this in action now in order to get

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.749 
at this in action now in order to get
this<00:01:57.600> going<00:01:57.869> well<00:01:58.319> I<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.770> saw<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.950> like

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
this going well I just saw I like

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.249 
this going well I just saw I like
something<00:01:59.999> that<00:02:00.270> vaguely<00:02:00.479> resembles<00:02:01.729> my<00:02:02.729> logo

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
something that vaguely resembles my logo

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.510 
something that vaguely resembles my logo
vaguely<00:02:06.139> so<00:02:07.139> to<00:02:07.710> get<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.950> going<00:02:08.160> what<00:02:08.429> we

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
vaguely so to get this going what we

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.979 
vaguely so to get this going what we
need<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.940> do<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.899> make<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.910> cube<00:02:11.910> with<00:02:12.470> our

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
need to do is make a cube with our

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.180 
need to do is make a cube with our
landmarks<00:02:15.989> now<00:02:16.290> if<00:02:16.409> you<00:02:16.530> don't<00:02:16.680> know<00:02:16.799> about

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
landmarks now if you don't know about

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.650 
landmarks now if you don't know about
landmarks<00:02:17.970> if<00:02:18.180> you<00:02:18.269> place

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
landmarks if you place

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.660 
landmarks if you place
one<00:02:18.750> down<00:02:18.990> like<00:02:19.200> that<00:02:19.410> if<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.370> apply<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
one down like that if you apply a

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.230 
one down like that if you apply a
redstone<00:02:21.090> signal<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.980> will<00:02:23.160> shoot<00:02:23.730> blue

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
redstone signal to it it will shoot blue

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.210 
redstone signal to it it will shoot blue
lasers<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.870> every<00:02:25.080> direction<00:02:25.260> and<00:02:25.860> they<00:02:26.070> will

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
lasers in every direction and they will

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.510 
lasers in every direction and they will
go<00:02:26.370> 64<00:02:27.210> blocks<00:02:27.780> in<00:02:28.110> each<00:02:28.200> direction<00:02:28.520> because

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
go 64 blocks in each direction because

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.890 
go 64 blocks in each direction because
that's<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.630> limit<00:02:30.960> of<00:02:31.340> BuildCraft<00:02:32.900> being

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
that's the the limit of BuildCraft being

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.450 
that's the the limit of BuildCraft being
able<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.650> recognize<00:02:37.160> well<00:02:38.160> that's<00:02:38.340> the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
able to to recognize well that's the

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:39.920 
able to to recognize well that's the
biggest<00:02:38.670> any<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.240> bill<00:02:39.390> craft<00:02:39.630> machines

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
biggest any of the bill craft machines

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.890 
biggest any of the bill craft machines
will<00:02:40.110> go<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:41.310> there's<00:02:41.820> no<00:02:42.030> point<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.690> going

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
will go so there's no point in going

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.950 
will go so there's no point in going
more<00:02:43.380> than<00:02:43.530> sixty<00:02:43.890> four<00:02:44.070> blocks<00:02:44.720> these<00:02:45.720> in

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
more than sixty four blocks these in

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.920 
more than sixty four blocks these in
themselves<00:02:46.410> can<00:02:46.740> be<00:02:46.830> quite<00:02:47.070> useful<00:02:47.450> if<00:02:48.450> you

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
themselves can be quite useful if you

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.920 
themselves can be quite useful if you
were<00:02:49.260> trying<00:02:50.070> to<00:02:50.190> say<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:51.330> could<00:02:51.510> use<00:02:51.690> them<00:02:51.810> as

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
were trying to say you could use them as

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.360 
were trying to say you could use them as
laser<00:02:52.170> guides<00:02:52.470> because<00:02:52.620> they<00:02:52.860> will<00:02:53.070> go

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
laser guides because they will go

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.880 
laser guides because they will go
through<00:02:53.850> blocks<00:02:54.810> if<00:02:55.170> we<00:02:55.320> have<00:02:55.470> a<00:02:55.500> look<00:02:55.650> over

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
through blocks if we have a look over

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.920 
through blocks if we have a look over
here<00:02:56.390> we've<00:02:57.390> got<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:58.440> going<00:02:58.560> into<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.100> block

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
here we've got a is going into the block

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.800 
here we've got a is going into the block
it<00:03:00.930> will<00:03:01.170> go<00:03:01.440> straight<00:03:02.190> through<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.720> so<00:03:03.720> you

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
it will go straight through it so you

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.220 
it will go straight through it so you
can<00:03:04.200> use<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.890> line<00:03:05.820> up<00:03:06.360> tunnels<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.080> things

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
can use it to line up tunnels and things

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.500 
can use it to line up tunnels and things
like<00:03:07.410> that<00:03:07.470> if<00:03:07.860> you'll<00:03:08.370> send<00:03:09.060> up<00:03:09.210> quite<00:03:09.480> a

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
like that if you'll send up quite a

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.490 
like that if you'll send up quite a
complex<00:03:10.640> mine<00:03:11.640> or<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.360> want<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.690> pipe<00:03:13.200> through

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
complex mine or you want to pipe through

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.380 
complex mine or you want to pipe through
a<00:03:13.530> wall<00:03:13.740> accurately<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.610> find<00:03:15.000> out<00:03:15.180> where

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
a wall accurately and find out where

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.660 
a wall accurately and find out where
it's<00:03:15.540> going<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.750> come<00:03:15.840> out<00:03:15.960> on<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.140> other<00:03:16.230> side

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
it's going to come out on the other side

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.960 
it's going to come out on the other side
these<00:03:17.670> are<00:03:17.820> quite<00:03:17.970> useful<00:03:18.150> for<00:03:18.510> that

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
these are quite useful for that

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.820 
these are quite useful for that
otherwise<00:03:20.970> we<00:03:21.420> will<00:03:21.540> just<00:03:21.750> set<00:03:21.930> up<00:03:22.080> a<00:03:22.290> cube

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
otherwise we will just set up a cube

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.690 
otherwise we will just set up a cube
here<00:03:23.070> and<00:03:23.640> you<00:03:23.910> need<00:03:24.090> to<00:03:24.270> put<00:03:25.250> them<00:03:26.250> all<00:03:26.430> so

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
here and you need to put them all so

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.080 
here and you need to put them all so
they<00:03:26.820> line<00:03:27.450> up<00:03:27.690> with<00:03:30.140> with<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.170> single<00:03:32.000> with<00:03:33.000> a

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
they line up with with a single with a

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.920 
they line up with with a single with a
single<00:03:34.040> landmark<00:03:35.040> these<00:03:36.030> landmarks<00:03:36.660> such<00:03:36.810> as

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
single landmark these landmarks such as

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.310 
single landmark these landmarks such as
redstone<00:03:37.410> torches<00:03:37.800> with<00:03:38.160> lapis<00:03:38.430> on<00:03:38.730> top<00:03:39.320> right

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
redstone torches with lapis on top right

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.890 
redstone torches with lapis on top right
now<00:03:40.620> what<00:03:40.920> we<00:03:40.950> need<00:03:41.070> to<00:03:41.310> do<00:03:41.670> is<00:03:42.000> we<00:03:42.240> need<00:03:42.270> to<00:03:43.580> to

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
now what we need to do is we need to to

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.400 
now what we need to do is we need to to
get<00:03:45.900> up<00:03:46.459> above<00:03:47.600> so<00:03:48.600> we<00:03:48.720> need<00:03:48.870> to<00:03:50.030> build<00:03:51.030> up<00:03:51.410> so

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
get up above so we need to build up so

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.170 
get up above so we need to build up so
that<00:03:52.560> we<00:03:52.590> can<00:03:52.920> mark<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.640> top<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:56.180> this

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
that we can mark the top of this this

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
that we can mark the top of this this
cube<00:03:57.920> or<00:03:58.920> it<00:03:59.130> will<00:03:59.310> be<00:03:59.489> a<00:03:59.520> cube<00:03:59.910> so<00:04:00.330> drop<00:04:00.959> one

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
cube or it will be a cube so drop one

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.540 
cube or it will be a cube so drop one
there<00:04:01.410> like<00:04:01.590> that<00:04:02.000> now<00:04:03.000> if<00:04:03.270> we<00:04:04.130> if<00:04:05.130> we<00:04:05.190> were<00:04:05.370> to

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
there like that now if we if we were to

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.910 
there like that now if we if we were to
right<00:04:05.760> click<00:04:05.970> this<00:04:06.239> one<00:04:06.300> what<00:04:07.200> it<00:04:07.320> will<00:04:07.470> do<00:04:07.709> is

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
right click this one what it will do is

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.510 
right click this one what it will do is
it's<00:04:08.310> going<00:04:08.489> to<00:04:08.550> draw<00:04:08.790> a<00:04:08.820> line<00:04:09.440> between<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:11.400> and

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
it's going to draw a line between it and

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.520 
it's going to draw a line between it and
the<00:04:11.959> next<00:04:12.959> landmark<00:04:13.950> that<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.850> in<00:04:15.090> line<00:04:15.270> with

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
the next landmark that is in line with

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.390 
the next landmark that is in line with
and<00:04:16.530> if<00:04:16.950> we<00:04:17.489> were<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:18.680> do<00:04:19.680> that<00:04:19.709> on<00:04:20.040> this<00:04:20.190> one

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
and if we were to do that on this one

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.180 
and if we were to do that on this one
here<00:04:20.669> it<00:04:20.850> will<00:04:21.030> connect<00:04:21.450> your<00:04:22.380> red<00:04:22.560> lines<00:04:22.860> with

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
here it will connect your red lines with

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.430 
here it will connect your red lines with
all<00:04:23.460> of<00:04:23.580> them<00:04:23.730> and<00:04:24.360> this<00:04:24.540> is<00:04:24.720> something<00:04:25.410> that

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
all of them and this is something that

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.420 
all of them and this is something that
you<00:04:25.650> need<00:04:25.890> to<00:04:25.919> do<00:04:26.570> in<00:04:27.570> order<00:04:27.750> to

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.510 

get<00:04:31.430> your<00:04:31.840> template<00:04:32.840> working<00:04:33.320> now<00:04:34.040> we<00:04:34.100> can<00:04:34.370> get

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
get your template working now we can get

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.310 
get your template working now we can get
rid<00:04:34.669> of<00:04:34.730> this<00:04:34.880> you<00:04:35.150> don't<00:04:35.360> need<00:04:35.660> the<00:04:35.870> redstone

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
rid of this you don't need the redstone

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.469 
rid of this you don't need the redstone
torch<00:04:36.590> in<00:04:36.919> order<00:04:37.130> to<00:04:37.250> set<00:04:37.490> these<00:04:37.669> landmarks<00:04:38.270> up

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
torch in order to set these landmarks up

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.110 
torch in order to set these landmarks up
it<00:04:39.260> just<00:04:39.500> makes<00:04:39.710> it<00:04:39.889> a<00:04:39.979> bit<00:04:40.130> easier<00:04:40.160> so<00:04:40.820> you<00:04:40.880> can

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
it just makes it a bit easier so you can

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.350 
it just makes it a bit easier so you can
see<00:04:41.419> see<00:04:42.020> what<00:04:42.050> you're<00:04:42.320> working<00:04:42.470> with<00:04:42.940> so<00:04:43.940> once

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
see see what you're working with so once

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.350 
see see what you're working with so once
we've<00:04:44.570> got<00:04:44.600> our<00:04:44.840> keep<00:04:45.229> set<00:04:45.530> up<00:04:45.680> we<00:04:46.520> will<00:04:46.699> take

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
we've got our keep set up we will take

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.909 
we've got our keep set up we will take
our<00:04:48.699> our<00:04:49.699> architect<00:04:50.270> table<00:04:50.690> and<00:04:51.320> just<00:04:51.560> drop<00:04:51.770> it

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
our our architect table and just drop it

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.800 
our our architect table and just drop it
down<00:04:52.100> now<00:04:52.840> where<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:53.870> drop<00:04:54.260> it<00:04:54.410> down<00:04:54.590> is<00:04:55.810> it

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
down now where you drop it down is it

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.800 
down now where you drop it down is it
needs<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.260> be<00:04:57.410> on<00:04:57.560> this<00:04:57.770> some<00:04:58.190> on<00:04:58.430> this<00:04:59.270> pivotal

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
needs to be on this some on this pivotal

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.540 
needs to be on this some on this pivotal
landmark<00:05:01.150> but<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.270> also<00:05:02.419> you<00:05:02.780> need<00:05:03.229> to<00:05:03.520> bear<00:05:04.520> in

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
landmark but it also you need to bear in

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.750 
landmark but it also you need to bear in
mind<00:05:04.810> where<00:05:05.810> that<00:05:06.020> is<00:05:06.229> in<00:05:06.440> relation<00:05:06.470> to<00:05:07.070> what

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
mind where that is in relation to what

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.680 
mind where that is in relation to what
is<00:05:07.910> your<00:05:08.330> building<00:05:09.370> because<00:05:10.370> when<00:05:10.669> you<00:05:10.940> want

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
is your building because when you want

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.390 
is your building because when you want
to<00:05:11.750> build<00:05:11.930> this<00:05:12.110> later<00:05:12.440> it's<00:05:12.889> going<00:05:13.100> to<00:05:13.190> show

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
to build this later it's going to show

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.180 
to build this later it's going to show
up<00:05:13.460> exactly<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.090> same<00:05:14.360> place<00:05:14.990> in<00:05:15.440> relation<00:05:15.979> to

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
up exactly the same place in relation to

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.760 
up exactly the same place in relation to
your<00:05:16.340> builder<00:05:16.960> so<00:05:17.960> if<00:05:18.169> we<00:05:18.260> drop<00:05:18.530> this<00:05:18.710> down

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
your builder so if we drop this down

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.420 
your builder so if we drop this down
Neal<00:05:19.250> what<00:05:20.000> will<00:05:20.120> happen<00:05:20.450> is<00:05:20.570> all<00:05:20.810> these

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
Neal what will happen is all these

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.790 
Neal what will happen is all these
landmarks<00:05:22.430> will<00:05:23.419> fall<00:05:23.690> off<00:05:23.900> so<00:05:24.380> you<00:05:24.440> can<00:05:24.620> go

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
landmarks will fall off so you can go

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.550 
landmarks will fall off so you can go
around<00:05:24.860> and<00:05:25.100> pick<00:05:25.250> those<00:05:25.490> guys<00:05:25.760> up<00:05:26.350> and<00:05:27.350> we'll

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
around and pick those guys up and we'll

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.379 
around and pick those guys up and we'll
get<00:05:27.650> this<00:05:27.710> black<00:05:28.100> and<00:05:28.340> yellow<00:05:28.460> tape<00:05:28.910> showing

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
get this black and yellow tape showing

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.750 
get this black and yellow tape showing
up<00:05:29.630> showing<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.990> area<00:05:33.289> that<00:05:33.500> the<00:05:34.280> architect

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
up showing the area that the architect

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.460 
up showing the area that the architect
table<00:05:35.120> covers<00:05:36.400> now<00:05:37.720> to<00:05:38.720> actually<00:05:38.870> get<00:05:39.169> this<00:05:39.320> to

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
table covers now to actually get this to

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.560 
table covers now to actually get this to
work<00:05:39.500> we<00:05:39.889> do<00:05:40.250> is<00:05:40.430> you<00:05:40.610> drop<00:05:40.669> a<00:05:40.820> blueprint<00:05:41.330> in

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:41.570 
work we do is you drop a blueprint in

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.120 
work we do is you drop a blueprint in
and<00:05:41.810> it's<00:05:42.770> going<00:05:42.979> to<00:05:43.070> get<00:05:43.130> to<00:05:43.280> work<00:05:44.620> now<00:05:45.620> what

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
and it's going to get to work now what

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.870 
and it's going to get to work now what
we<00:05:46.250> can<00:05:46.400> do<00:05:46.550> here<00:05:46.820> is<00:05:47.090> we<00:05:47.330> can<00:05:47.660> name<00:05:48.880> this

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
we can do here is we can name this

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.469 
we can do here is we can name this
template<00:05:50.830> so<00:05:51.830> why<00:05:52.520> there<00:05:52.760> we've<00:05:52.910> got<00:05:52.940> it<00:05:53.240> and

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
template so why there we've got it and

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.990 
template so why there we've got it and
we<00:05:53.599> call<00:05:53.990> it<00:05:55.090> q.q<00:05:56.090> logo<00:05:57.130> and<00:05:58.130> if<00:05:58.700> we<00:05:58.729> take<00:05:58.940> that

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
we call it q.q logo and if we take that

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.450 
we call it q.q logo and if we take that
off<00:05:59.300> actually<00:06:00.080> I<00:06:00.349> maybe<00:06:00.950> should<00:06:01.220> have<00:06:01.250> done

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
off actually I maybe should have done

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.430 
off actually I maybe should have done
that<00:06:01.490> first<00:06:01.910> then<00:06:02.360> you<00:06:02.389> get<00:06:02.630> another<00:06:02.660> template

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 
that first then you get another template

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.360 
that first then you get another template
just<00:06:04.870> simply<00:06:05.870> printing<00:06:06.260> it<00:06:06.470> another

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
just simply printing it another

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.010 
just simply printing it another
blueprint<00:06:07.880> just<00:06:08.090> so<00:06:08.270> we<00:06:08.389> can<00:06:08.539> see<00:06:08.810> that

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
blueprint just so we can see that

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:15.659 
blueprint just so we can see that
hopefully<00:06:10.330> that's<00:06:11.330> going<00:06:11.570> to<00:06:11.660> name<00:06:11.900> it<00:06:11.930> q<00:06:12.740> logo

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.990 

shut<00:06:16.669> it<00:06:16.700> on<00:06:16.910> that<00:06:17.090> version<00:06:17.419> though<00:06:18.880> so<00:06:19.880> then

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
shut it on that version though so then

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.629 
shut it on that version though so then
we<00:06:20.180> will<00:06:20.330> get<00:06:20.539> a<00:06:21.099> blueprint<00:06:22.099> l<00:06:22.340> and<00:06:22.550> the

00:06:22.629 --> 00:06:22.639 
we will get a blueprint l and the

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:24.820 
we will get a blueprint l and the
tooltip<00:06:23.060> there<00:06:23.300> says<00:06:23.570> q<00:06:23.900> logo<00:06:24.260> well<00:06:24.680> the

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
tooltip there says q logo well the

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.210 
tooltip there says q logo well the
blueprint<00:06:25.310> 2<00:06:25.490> will<00:06:25.700> give<00:06:25.729> another<00:06:26.060> one<00:06:27.220> so

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
blueprint 2 will give another one so

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.820 
blueprint 2 will give another one so
there<00:06:28.400> you<00:06:28.520> go<00:06:28.580> that's<00:06:29.090> this<00:06:29.870> blueprint<00:06:30.500> nail

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:30.830 
there you go that's this blueprint nail

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.140 
there you go that's this blueprint nail
we<00:06:31.340> can<00:06:31.990> do<00:06:32.990> various<00:06:33.440> things<00:06:33.500> with<00:06:33.979> we<00:06:34.370> can<00:06:34.760> put

we can do various things with we can put
it<00:06:35.270> in

00:06:37.119 --> 00:06:37.129 
it in

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.149 
it in
a<00:06:37.189> blueprint<00:06:38.119> library<00:06:38.599> or<00:06:39.289> we<00:06:39.770> could<00:06:39.919> put<00:06:40.069> it

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
a blueprint library or we could put it

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.820 
a blueprint library or we could put it
straight<00:06:40.339> into<00:06:40.520> a<00:06:40.639> builder<00:06:41.089> and<00:06:41.409> I<00:06:42.409> will<00:06:42.619> cover

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
straight into a builder and I will cover

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.759 
straight into a builder and I will cover
that<00:06:42.919> another<00:06:43.849> time<00:06:44.089> so<00:06:44.719> thanks<00:06:45.379> for<00:06:45.409> watching
