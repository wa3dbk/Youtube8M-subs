00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 In the Hello is Katayama Shigeruto July 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.219
 But 1000 shape events regulatory events of 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.719
 Please take a look you Yes been recorded of Zenzenchi 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.719
 This is more of combat 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.640
 An excellent ski player 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:23.300
 High 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.930
 I think it's such a convention that the people of Junyoko are 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:31.470
 Because war in Yeah yeah excellent skiing leaders 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:38.489
 Say the screening meeting 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:43.120
 There is an image and I say that the 1000 series of events will be included in that tree practice this time 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:47.000
 When I heard it, I felt that I was really uneasy at first . 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:52.940
 Because the main is the technology selection 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:00.150
 3 events and events of this time that even 1000 system that Tteyuu regulatory events include from qualifying 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:05.700
 It was there , but for that speed area relatively well 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:10.650
 It is in the category of technology selection rather than the one of 1000 type process immediate system until now 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:17.310
 But I received the feeling that I was going to be after all 8 days that ski runs 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:20.170
 From the first part of the beginning I will say that I exchange my ski and snow surface firmly 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.500
 Such things are high 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.260
 Properly while feeling this way in the back of one foot say the back of the ski 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:29.780
 U 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.070
 As a result, the person who can move the skis that you hit is toward the middle of the turn 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:37.310
 Ski moat bridge 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:44.250
 I think that you will feel a sense of warping and the ability to promote other things like solder 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:44.810
 Well towards the other solder skiing so it changed in the valley around the next turn 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.180
 Ah ah ah 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.030
 Run more 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.330
 With people who can 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:57.740
 Clearly the difference between people who can not do that 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.130
 It thinks that it is continued , but only in parallel Ayumi player third place 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.130
 part 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.180
 This technique is good Uchinari Shigeruani months Mt. 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.180
 start 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:48.160
 Keeping the score solid, Pell could use a short ski or even a big turn 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:50.990
 Naturally, the behavior of the ski is very stable and moving smoothly 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:55.790
 I do not come out with a fluttering ski 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:03:02.330
 The was neatly not not you come took the Gunto also the I mean Atsu' of the second half of the power of turn 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:07.010
 Toka's flow in that sense because it must apply a force to the smooth stop and the ski from the first half 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:09.490
 A player who has been able to express ski runs very smoothly is increasing points 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.490
 Maybe 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.820
 First of all 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.820
 Asaho after being blue
