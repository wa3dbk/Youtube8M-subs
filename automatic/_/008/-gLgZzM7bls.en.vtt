in<00:00:00.690> this<00:00:01.589> video<00:00:01.890> we're<00:00:02.250> going<00:00:02.429> to<00:00:02.490> be<00:00:02.610> talking

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
in this video we're going to be talking

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.559 
in this video we're going to be talking
about<00:00:03.200> glycol<00:00:04.200> general<00:00:04.589> basis<00:00:05.220> which<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.299> the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
about glycol general basis which is the

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.720 
about glycol general basis which is the
lysis<00:00:07.230> so<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.040> breaking<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.030> glycogen<00:00:09.990> and

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:10.730 
lysis so the breaking of glycogen and

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.690 
lysis so the breaking of glycogen and
glycogen<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.150> macromolecule<00:00:13.019> so<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:14.130> big

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
glycogen is a macromolecule so a big

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.990 
glycogen is a macromolecule so a big
sized<00:00:15.000> molecule<00:00:15.859> made<00:00:16.859> by<00:00:17.130> many<00:00:17.840> units<00:00:18.840> of

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
sized molecule made by many units of

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.210 
sized molecule made by many units of
glucose<00:00:21.000> even<00:00:21.660> thousands<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.410> molecules<00:00:23.039> of

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
glucose even thousands of molecules of

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.540 
glucose even thousands of molecules of
glucose<00:00:24.050> bond<00:00:25.050> with<00:00:25.769> an<00:00:26.039> alpha<00:00:27.260> 1-4<00:00:28.260> type<00:00:29.250> of

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
glucose bond with an alpha 1-4 type of

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.260 
glucose bond with an alpha 1-4 type of
bond<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.289> glycogen<00:00:31.289> also<00:00:32.070> has<00:00:32.369> branching

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
bond and glycogen also has branching

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.709 
bond and glycogen also has branching
points<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.320> good<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.640> got<00:00:35.910> many<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.510> these

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
points it's good it's got many of these

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.229 
points it's good it's got many of these
points<00:00:38.090> when<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.329> which<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.930> bond<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.500> alpha

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239 
points when in which the bond is alpha

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.229 
points when in which the bond is alpha
one-six<00:00:42.410> so<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.590> carbon<00:00:43.860> one<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.399> our<00:00:44.700> glucose

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
one-six so the carbon one of our glucose

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.750 
one-six so the carbon one of our glucose
molecule<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.079> bond<00:00:46.500> with<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.860> carbon<00:00:46.890> 6<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
molecule is bond with the carbon 6 of

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.720 
molecule is bond with the carbon 6 of
another<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:49.200> fact<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.680> glycogen<00:00:50.250> has<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
another one the fact that glycogen has a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.160 
another one the fact that glycogen has a
lot<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.090> branching<00:00:52.079> points<00:00:52.649> makes<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.030> that

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
lot of branching points makes it so that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.680 
lot of branching points makes it so that
the<00:00:55.170> glycogen<00:00:55.649> molecule<00:00:56.399> ends<00:00:56.940> up<00:00:57.059> by<00:00:57.270> having

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the glycogen molecule ends up by having

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.240 
the glycogen molecule ends up by having
a<00:00:57.809> lot<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.460> reboot<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.640> non-reducing

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
a lot of reboot of non-reducing

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.570 
a lot of reboot of non-reducing
terminals<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.660> just<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:04.229> reducing<00:01:05.040> terminal

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
terminals and just one reducing terminal

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.980 
terminals and just one reducing terminal
which<00:01:05.790> usually<00:01:06.390> bond<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:07.979> protein<00:01:08.960> which<00:01:09.960> is

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
which usually bond to a protein which is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.070 
which usually bond to a protein which is
used<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.100> synthesis<00:01:11.909> at<00:01:12.240> first<00:01:12.750> of

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
used for the synthesis at first of

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.330 
used for the synthesis at first of
glycogen<00:01:13.710> from<00:01:14.369> glucose<00:01:15.710> now<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.280> see

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
glycogen from glucose now as you can see

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.910 
weight of the liver so that's about 100
120<00:02:48.420> grams<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.910> weight<00:02:50.910> with<00:02:51.740> but<00:02:52.740> this

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
120 grams of weight with but this

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.150 
120 grams of weight with but this
happens<00:02:53.430> only<00:02:54.050> immediately<00:02:55.050> after<00:02:55.620> having

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
happens only immediately after having

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.260 
happens only immediately after having
eaten<00:02:56.370> so<00:02:57.240> when<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:58.140> glucose<00:02:58.800> levels<00:02:59.310> in<00:02:59.520> the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
eaten so when the glucose levels in the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.350 
eaten so when the glucose levels in the
blood<00:03:00.510> are<00:03:00.660> pretty<00:03:01.050> high<00:03:01.700> after<00:03:02.700> appeared<00:03:03.180> in

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
blood are pretty high after appeared in

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
blood are pretty high after appeared in
which<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.750> don't<00:03:03.900> eat<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.760> glycogen

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
which you don't eat the the glycogen

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.270 
which you don't eat the the glycogen
lowers<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:08.160> quantity<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:09.150> after<00:03:10.040> one<00:03:11.040> day<00:03:11.250> of

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
lowers and quantity and after one day of

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.610 
lowers and quantity and after one day of
diet<00:03:11.790> it<00:03:12.270> goes<00:03:12.840> practically<00:03:13.620> 20<00:03:14.370> so<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.620> muscle

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
diet it goes practically 20 so in muscle

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.190 
diet it goes practically 20 so in muscle
cells<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.400> in<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.850> liver<00:03:18.120> what<00:03:18.480> happens<00:03:18.930> is

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
cells and in the liver what happens is

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.380 
cells and in the liver what happens is
that<00:03:19.470> glycogen<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:21.350> broken<00:03:22.350> down<00:03:22.560> by<00:03:22.980> a

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
that glycogen is broken down by a

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.720 
that glycogen is broken down by a
glycogen<00:03:24.390> phosphorylase<00:03:25.430> which<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.610> an

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
glycogen phosphorylase which is an

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.460 
glycogen phosphorylase which is an
enzyme<00:03:27.530> which<00:03:28.530> um<00:03:29.720> catalyzes<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.900> pretty

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
enzyme which um catalyzes a pretty

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.750 
enzyme which um catalyzes a pretty
amazing<00:03:32.190> reaction<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:33.480> breaks<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:35.310> sugar

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
amazing reaction it breaks the sugar

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.640 
amazing reaction it breaks the sugar
bond<00:03:36.140> between<00:03:37.140> the<00:03:37.770> alpha<00:03:38.310> 1-4<00:03:39.209> bond<00:03:40.140> between

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
bond between the alpha 1-4 bond between

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.520 
bond between the alpha 1-4 bond between
the<00:03:40.830> molecules<00:03:41.040> of<00:03:41.520> sugar<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.209> what<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.260> does

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
the molecules of sugar and what it does

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.840 
the molecules of sugar and what it does
it<00:03:43.800> breaks<00:03:44.610> it<00:03:44.990> with<00:03:45.990> an<00:03:46.290> inorganic<00:03:46.920> phosphate

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
it breaks it with an inorganic phosphate

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.850 
it breaks it with an inorganic phosphate
so<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.959> end<00:03:49.200> up<00:03:49.440> by<00:03:49.740> having<00:03:50.540> glucose<00:03:51.860> just

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
so you end up by having glucose just

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.080 
so you end up by having glucose just
that<00:03:53.100> it's<00:03:53.310> glucose<00:03:54.209> 1-phosphate<00:03:55.850> so<00:03:56.850> it's

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
that it's glucose 1-phosphate so it's

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.480 
that it's glucose 1-phosphate so it's
already<00:03:57.270> got<00:03:57.660> a<00:03:57.690> phosphate<00:03:58.290> group<00:03:58.320> which<00:03:59.250> will

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
already got a phosphate group which will

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.490 
already got a phosphate group which will
then<00:03:59.670> be<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.709> necessary<00:04:01.709> for<00:04:02.959> for<00:04:03.959> glycolysis

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
then be and necessary for for glycolysis

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.370 
then be and necessary for for glycolysis
and<00:04:05.370> for<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.120> synthesis<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:07.080> new<00:04:08.060> ATP<00:04:09.200> so<00:04:10.200> it's

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
and for the synthesis of new ATP so it's

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
and for the synthesis of new ATP so it's
actually<00:04:10.560> saving<00:04:11.250> energy<00:04:11.760> by<00:04:12.209> doing<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:12.840> and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
actually saving energy by doing this and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.880 
actually saving energy by doing this and
then<00:04:14.400> there's<00:04:14.610> another<00:04:14.670> enzyme<00:04:15.209> which

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
then there's another enzyme which

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.300 
then there's another enzyme which
switches<00:04:16.890> places<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.600> phosphate<00:04:19.140> group

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
switches places to the phosphate group

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.140 
switches places to the phosphate group
moves<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.239> carbon<00:04:21.720> 6<00:04:22.490> so<00:04:23.490> as<00:04:23.790> you<00:04:23.820> can

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
moves it to the carbon 6 so as you can

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.300 
moves it to the carbon 6 so as you can
see<00:04:24.360> in<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.630> picture<00:04:24.930> over<00:04:25.470> here<00:04:25.500> you're

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
see in the picture over here you're

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.140 
see in the picture over here you're
going<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.580> have<00:04:26.700> a<00:04:27.090> glucose<00:04:27.990> 6-phosphate

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
going to have a glucose 6-phosphate

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.960 
going to have a glucose 6-phosphate
which<00:04:30.150> can<00:04:30.480> then<00:04:30.510> enter<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.970> glycolytic

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
which can then enter the glycolytic

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.010 
which can then enter the glycolytic
process<00:04:34.070> if<00:04:35.070> it's<00:04:35.520> in<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:35.970> muscles<00:04:36.450> if<00:04:36.660> it's

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
process if it's in the muscles if it's

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.530 
process if it's in the muscles if it's
in<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.200> liver<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:37.950> phosphate<00:04:38.700> group<00:04:39.060> gets

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
in the liver the phosphate group gets

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.220 
in the liver the phosphate group gets
removed<00:04:40.260> and<00:04:40.850> you<00:04:41.850> have<00:04:42.180> by<00:04:42.600> another<00:04:42.930> enzyme

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
removed and you have by another enzyme

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.220 
removed and you have by another enzyme
and<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.919> have<00:04:44.130> again<00:04:44.580> glucose<00:04:45.270> which<00:04:45.690> can<00:04:45.990> go

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
and you have again glucose which can go

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.050 
and you have again glucose which can go
now<00:04:46.530> in<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:47.010> bloodstream<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.930> reach<00:04:48.930> other

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
now in the bloodstream and reach other

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.230 
now in the bloodstream and reach other
tissues<00:04:51.060> which<00:04:51.480> need<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.700> glucose<00:04:53.700> and<00:04:54.030> which

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
tissues which need a glucose and which

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.110 
tissues which need a glucose and which
need<00:04:54.540> energy<00:04:54.810> in<00:04:55.169> that<00:04:55.320> moment<00:04:55.790> that's<00:04:56.790> mainly

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
need energy in that moment that's mainly

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:01.010 
need energy in that moment that's mainly
brain<00:04:57.600> tissue<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.440> a<00:04:59.360> muscular<00:05:00.360> tissue<00:05:00.630> now

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
brain tissue and a muscular tissue now

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.260 
brain tissue and a muscular tissue now
this<00:05:01.320> happens<00:05:01.590> only<00:05:02.010> when<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.490> need<00:05:02.520> a<00:05:02.729> lot<00:05:03.120> of

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
this happens only when you need a lot of

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.780 
this happens only when you need a lot of
energy<00:05:03.590> immediately<00:05:04.590> and<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:05.400> don't<00:05:05.610> have

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
energy immediately and you don't have

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.280 
energy immediately and you don't have
enough<00:05:06.419> already<00:05:07.410> in<00:05:08.180> the<00:05:09.180> bloodstream<00:05:09.450> so

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
enough already in the bloodstream so

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.240 
enough already in the bloodstream so
there<00:05:11.100> are<00:05:11.150> certain<00:05:12.150> hormones<00:05:13.040> which<00:05:14.040> are

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
there are certain hormones which are

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.450 
there are certain hormones which are
going<00:05:14.460> to<00:05:14.580> catalyze<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.660> lysis<00:05:16.410> of<00:05:16.710> glycogen

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
going to catalyze the lysis of glycogen

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.010 
going to catalyze the lysis of glycogen
and<00:05:18.110> these<00:05:19.110> are<00:05:19.410> like<00:05:20.180> glucagon<00:05:21.180> which<00:05:21.810> is

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.020 
and these are like glucagon which is

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.000 
and these are like glucagon which is
secreted<00:05:22.950> by<00:05:22.979> the<00:05:23.300> alpha<00:05:24.300> cells<00:05:24.600> in<00:05:25.010> the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
secreted by the alpha cells in the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:30.580 
secreted by the alpha cells in the
languor<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.930> islands<00:05:27.930> in<00:05:28.289> the<00:05:28.350> pancreas<00:05:28.860> or

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
languor and islands in the pancreas or

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.490 
languor and islands in the pancreas or
also<00:05:31.590> by<00:05:31.800> a<00:05:31.830> adrenaline<00:05:32.580> it's<00:05:33.479> gonna<00:05:33.810> catalyze

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
also by a adrenaline it's gonna catalyze

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.330 
also by a adrenaline it's gonna catalyze
the<00:05:35.460> lysis<00:05:35.970> of<00:05:36.000> glycogen<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:37.070> all<00:05:38.070> other

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
the lysis of glycogen and all other

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.240 
the lysis of glycogen and all other
hormones<00:05:39.000> which<00:05:39.630> have<00:05:40.250> hyperglycemic

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
hormones which have hyperglycemic

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.520 
hormones which have hyperglycemic
properties<00:05:42.000> which<00:05:42.419> means<00:05:42.720> they<00:05:43.110> have<00:05:43.289> the

the picture we're looking at is the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.629 
the picture we're looking at is the
picture<00:05:51.720> of<00:05:51.750> the<00:05:51.900> molecule<00:05:52.590> of<00:05:52.710> glucose<00:05:53.310> you

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
picture of the molecule of glucose you

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.219 
picture of the molecule of glucose you
can<00:05:53.850> see<00:05:54.090> six<00:05:54.810> atoms<00:05:55.320> of<00:05:55.590> carbon<00:05:55.950> at<00:05:56.370> every

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
can see six atoms of carbon at every

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:02.029 
can see six atoms of carbon at every
point<00:05:58.229> of<00:05:58.590> of<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.580> molecule<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:01.039> this

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 
point of of the molecule and this

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:04.580 
point of of the molecule and this
molecule<00:06:02.340> travels<00:06:03.240> in<00:06:03.510> the<00:06:03.720> bloodstream<00:06:03.990> and

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:04.590 
molecule travels in the bloodstream and

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.750 
molecule travels in the bloodstream and
then<00:06:04.770> it's<00:06:05.780> captured<00:06:06.780> by<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.080> cells

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
then it's captured by the cells

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.840 
then it's captured by the cells
throughout<00:06:08.870> specific<00:06:10.100> transport<00:06:11.100> borders

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
throughout specific transport borders

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.750 
throughout specific transport borders
throughout<00:06:12.360> their<00:06:12.630> membrane<00:06:13.310> which<00:06:14.310> are

throughout their membrane which are
mainly<00:06:15.650> they're<00:06:16.650> called<00:06:17.010> glute<00:06:17.639> loot<00:06:18.330> one<00:06:18.720> two

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
mainly they're called glute loot one two

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.680 
mainly they're called glute loot one two
three<00:06:19.680> and<00:06:19.889> four<00:06:20.280> and<00:06:20.550> then<00:06:21.360> there's<00:06:21.570> also

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:21.690 
three and four and then there's also

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.360 
three and four and then there's also
other<00:06:22.050> types<00:06:22.169> and<00:06:22.800> they<00:06:22.919> have<00:06:23.100> different

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
other types and they have different

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.879 
other types and they have different
properties<00:06:23.880> according<00:06:24.870> to<00:06:24.900> the<00:06:25.139> tissues<00:06:25.590> in

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
properties according to the tissues in

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:28.219 
properties according to the tissues in
which<00:06:26.100> they<00:06:26.520> are<00:06:26.669> found<00:06:26.940> and<00:06:27.300> now<00:06:27.900> we're<00:06:28.080> going

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
which they are found and now we're going

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.100 
which they are found and now we're going
to<00:06:28.320> see<00:06:28.590> a<00:06:28.800> molecule<00:06:29.400> which<00:06:29.970> is<00:06:30.150> a

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
to see a molecule which is a

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:35.570 
to see a molecule which is a
chain<00:06:31.410> it's<00:06:31.890> a<00:06:32.490> Greek<00:06:33.480> argenon<00:06:34.130> which<00:06:35.130> as<00:06:35.400> I

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
chain it's a Greek argenon which as I

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.820 
chain it's a Greek argenon which as I
said<00:06:35.610> before<00:06:35.850> is<00:06:36.570> the<00:06:37.170> primer<00:06:37.530> of<00:06:37.950> a<00:06:39.830> percent

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
said before is the primer of a percent

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.960 
said before is the primer of a percent
for<00:06:41.220> the<00:06:41.310> synthesis<00:06:42.120> of<00:06:42.920> glycogen<00:06:43.920> now<00:06:44.760> what<00:06:44.940> a

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
for the synthesis of glycogen now what a

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.410 
for the synthesis of glycogen now what a
primer<00:06:45.330> is<00:06:45.630> it<00:06:46.140> it's<00:06:46.650> a<00:06:46.950> molecule<00:06:47.370> which<00:06:47.940> helps

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
primer is it it's a molecule which helps

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.600 
primer is it it's a molecule which helps
the<00:06:48.870> book<00:06:49.440> synthesis<00:06:50.370> at<00:06:51.120> first<00:06:51.690> of<00:06:52.610> the

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
the book synthesis at first of the

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.840 
the book synthesis at first of the
molecule<00:06:54.150> in<00:06:54.300> this<00:06:54.450> case<00:06:54.690> of<00:06:55.050> glycogen<00:06:55.530> and

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:55.850 
molecule in this case of glycogen and

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.900 
molecule in this case of glycogen and
the<00:06:56.850> reason<00:06:57.270> for<00:06:57.300> the<00:06:57.720> existence<00:06:57.840> of<00:06:58.910> primers

00:06:59.900 --> 00:06:59.910 
the reason for the existence of primers

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.110 
the reason for the existence of primers
is<00:07:00.240> that<00:07:00.720> not<00:07:01.050> all<00:07:01.350> the<00:07:01.770> enzymes<00:07:02.280> can<00:07:02.790> just

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 
is that not all the enzymes can just

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.710 
is that not all the enzymes can just
work<00:07:03.570> up<00:07:03.900> on<00:07:04.170> a<00:07:04.230> molecule<00:07:05.130> out<00:07:05.820> of<00:07:06.240> nothing

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 
work up on a molecule out of nothing

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.310 
work up on a molecule out of nothing
they<00:07:07.110> need<00:07:07.440> a<00:07:07.680> place<00:07:08.130> to<00:07:08.430> start<00:07:08.730> on<00:07:09.030> and<00:07:09.360> so

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:10.320 
they need a place to start on and so

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.970 
they need a place to start on and so
that's<00:07:10.710> the<00:07:11.070> reason<00:07:11.400> why<00:07:11.430> primers<00:07:12.180> exists<00:07:12.990> now

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:13.980 
that's the reason why primers exists now

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.850 
that's the reason why primers exists now
as<00:07:14.310> the<00:07:14.370> whole<00:07:15.060> point<00:07:15.360> of<00:07:15.600> glycogen<00:07:16.140> Aliza's

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:16.860 
as the whole point of glycogen Aliza's

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.270 
as the whole point of glycogen Aliza's
is<00:07:17.100> to<00:07:17.610> increase<00:07:18.060> the<00:07:18.750> blood<00:07:18.960> levels<00:07:19.440> of<00:07:19.680> sugar

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 
is to increase the blood levels of sugar

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.000 
is to increase the blood levels of sugar
to<00:07:21.270> increase<00:07:21.600> the<00:07:21.840> amount<00:07:22.080> of<00:07:22.200> glucose<00:07:22.680> in<00:07:22.950> the

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.010 
to increase the amount of glucose in the

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:27.170 
to increase the amount of glucose in the
bloodstream<00:07:24.230> so<00:07:25.230> in<00:07:25.980> this<00:07:26.250> image<00:07:26.580> you<00:07:26.850> can<00:07:27.120> see

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:27.180 
bloodstream so in this image you can see

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.990 
bloodstream so in this image you can see
other<00:07:27.630> ways<00:07:28.140> to<00:07:28.650> obtain<00:07:28.770> the<00:07:29.220> same<00:07:29.460> result

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 
other ways to obtain the same result

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.780 
other ways to obtain the same result
unlike<00:07:30.630> all<00:07:30.930> these<00:07:31.170> ways<00:07:31.410> work<00:07:31.980> together<00:07:32.280> to

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:32.790 
unlike all these ways work together to

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.880 
unlike all these ways work together to
increase<00:07:32.970> the<00:07:33.510> level<00:07:33.900> of<00:07:34.020> glucose<00:07:34.590> in<00:07:34.860> the

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:34.890 
increase the level of glucose in the

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.280 
increase the level of glucose in the
blood
