00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.120
 hi everyone in them paraguay 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.740
 pressure and the real about state of the state 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.100
 just like 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.509
 as one of our blog followers 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.679
 he put me the comments 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.599
 nor the player to declare those who help many times acquire such tasks 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.050
 that was and we are seeing how they are processed to hide programs could 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.810
 print the wallpaper 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.919
 different things 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:28.270
 in villa clara a program per hundred so you can 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.399
 see what key exposed besides I'm saying atlas 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:32.560
 that is the first 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.730
 which we are now in order to 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.120
 as you see in the application 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.410
 command or apple for those who have old keyboard plus the n 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.230
 as she says open a new window 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.900
 it lies then open as many as is left repeatedly expelling this 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.190
 and now to close the different windows that we have in sander only 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.309
 we have in vélez 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.090
 They have to be closed one by one as we will have to do 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.460
 apple itv double and as a country apparently all 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.440
 very quickly 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.550
 in this area good form 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.480
 percent 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.820
 some neighbors point and songs 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.579
 how are we here the arbitration is thrown - lazaro calderón 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.260
 or it can also be the scanner 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.150
 CD 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.250
 we will see how we can hide rather 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.240
 to hide an application we do not have to press the command anymore 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.500
 set the boss h 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.290
 the application as it is has been hidden and running but that is 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.320
 hide 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.430
 p 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.710
 the same must count on him 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.789
 with any other clear posing we eat h we would not count 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.050
 and then we have an option 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.840
 what the truth is that it's fine 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.700
 which is the next for example opens another program 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.280
 let's open the calculator 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.870
 And we do not have more than 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.010
 explain 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.800
 command to and click with the mouse in application that we were 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.479
 that citizenship application that will remain open to the rest is hidden 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.689
 maybe I see it 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:12.739
 I'm going to make sure that you are fox keep in the sxc plane hide the rest 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.780
 click or and as you see there are photos pointed the calculator buried the front 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:17.590
 buried 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.549
 and if possible declared 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.680
 we can repeat the relationship with any other fix to do now that 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.259
 the block that in the foreground 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:25.620
 command to 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.290
 option i remember all the panties well flat we found the rest of applications 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:35.319
 we are going to start now another little work 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.179
 another shortcut to overcome 

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.609
 the one 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:40.970
 the delayed fast 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.199
 as you know we made a road blackbird 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:44.349
 I have stopped 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.719
 morakat the morgan rises perera 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:48.199
 in any kind of things 

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:51.150
 it's fine dragging the world's sand where they'll beat 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.130
 but country what is faster than it is 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.769
 pressing the command key 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.739
 was going to that you are pop population devoured 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.549
 the air station 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.809
 As you can see, vilera has moved 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:05.059
 there remains 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:07.539
 by stan you'll know that with him 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.119
 with the command and the tabulator we can pass 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:13.949
 percent from one room to another was left behind we have 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:15.630
 set command tab 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.650
 and we are going 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.350
 well and the probable note that happened to another or with the mouse in the appointment 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.719
 that we want 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.909
 it's pretty simple 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.959
 percent 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.199
 now I'm going to show you the forms of screen henry that we have 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:31.959
 the most 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.129
 the normal 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.469
 percent 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.149
 the command 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:40.799
 by blind option and 4 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:41.870
 and as you see 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.709
 thing looks like a kind of 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.849
 of nvidia so to speak 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.959
 in which you can select what will tolerate you want to print 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.899
 imagine yourself advanced 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:55.349
 welcomes salary 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.459
 we had seen 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.459
 and had done as you see with the capture of that area 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.310
 then to go further then doing the web inoculation using 5 would be created 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:08.359
 a capture of the entire writer everything absolutely everything 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:12.729
 another option that has the commands and ready 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.799
 of the peephole is that a goat stretcher we press the space bar 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:19.249
 and how was he doing a photo camera 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:23.360
 I want to do this only because of the capture of the window area of ​​the 

00:04:23.359 --> 00:04:24.479
 program what we left 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.210
 Figaro knows what is wrong with football 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.309
 Well, see him here 

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.999
 and how they welcomed that area 

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:31.729
 It is very good to send 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:34.620
 in any kind of silver a configuration window to any 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.039
 fellow whatever 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.770
 by ciarán let's see 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.169
 other 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.749
 what is the must the path of a directory for example the blog 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.400
 apart from that I have to dodge it 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.349
 this 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:52.209
 surely the two will appear to us Gandia I will explain how to put it here 

00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:56.009
 We offered to sell it because for him the whole route that the law 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.349
 you have to press the command command fanatik to link up and how 

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:03.319
 they appear the route that if that directory well they can do to you 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:04.680
 in addition to 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.180
 to the readers that contain it for example even user the theme is 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.349
 actually 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.880
 and so with all subsectors that is already clear 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.210
 note that the route assembly 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:17.270
 p 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.410
 let's see now 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.969
 how to activate the savior is honored for those who come is the command 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.459
 in poetry it is very comfortable pressing the menu button but not only 

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:26.680
 you have to press 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.210
 'Vizcaya command' 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.289
 with escape command 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.159
 in taez in disappointed mode 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.139
 and you can talk to him 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:38.139
 in the same way practice it command tinder 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:41.560
 now he teaches us to use percent 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.590
 Quickly access the sleep idle and system start 

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.439
 you know what you do right or wrong for you could do it well then to the 

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.139
 key counted the dt that escape 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.990
 ossa ccoo lab execution c 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.770
 it was parcerisa this menu 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.169
 Restart rest, cancel pay 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:01.119
 it's a faster way 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:03.610
 keyboard shortcuts 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.319
 then we also have 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.439
 percent 

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:10.469
 a bullshit for several publishers 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:14.599
 when least curious did not have any had hair pulsing population control 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.159
 command 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.129
 the whole system becomes negative 

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:23.539
 it is the truth that curious good vih 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:25.300
 for 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.659
 not separated hesitant nephews a little 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:31.249
 Well, this is all about killing deaths but since I liked it and greetings
