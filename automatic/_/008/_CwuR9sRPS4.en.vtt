and explore it just to get this material

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.290 
and explore it just to get this material
to<00:01:21.960> upgrade<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.409> gear<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:22.800> I<00:01:23.040> don't<00:01:23.970> know<00:01:24.090> if

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
to upgrade your gear now I don't know if

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.170 
to upgrade your gear now I don't know if
this<00:01:24.780> only<00:01:25.050> applies<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.500> gear<00:01:26.070> from<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.850> taken

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
this only applies to gear from the taken

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.180 
this only applies to gear from the taken
king<00:01:27.390> or<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.840> also<00:01:28.230> applies<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.560> other<00:01:28.890> gear
