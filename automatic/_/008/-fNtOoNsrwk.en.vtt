want<00:02:03.890> to<00:02:03.950> look<00:02:04.189> like<00:02:04.430> a<00:02:04.610> fierce<00:02:05.090> animal

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
want to look like a fierce animal

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.830 
want to look like a fierce animal
next<00:02:07.860> take<00:02:08.010> this<00:02:08.160> liquid<00:02:08.640> liner<00:02:08.880> by<00:02:09.330> NYX<00:02:09.660> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
next take this liquid liner by NYX and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.170 
next take this liquid liner by NYX and
apply<00:02:10.440> onto<00:02:10.680> your<00:02:10.950> eyelid<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.550> make<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
apply onto your eyelid to make the

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.900 
apply onto your eyelid to make the
leopard<00:02:12.600> print<00:02:12.990> shapes<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:14.190> just<00:02:14.610> kind<00:02:14.850> of

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
leopard print shapes and I just kind of

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.880 
leopard print shapes and I just kind of
did<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.570> shapes<00:02:15.960> or<00:02:16.230> like<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.500> shape<00:02:16.710> of

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
did like you shapes or like the shape of

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.760 
did like you shapes or like the shape of
an<00:02:17.010> eye<00:02:17.250> almost<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:19.140> can<00:02:19.350> be<00:02:19.470> kind<00:02:19.680> of

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
an eye almost and it can be kind of

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.160 
an eye almost and it can be kind of
messy<00:02:19.950> that's<00:02:20.400> all<00:02:20.610> right<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.990> that's

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
messy that's all right and so that's

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.900 
messy that's all right and so that's
just<00:02:22.320> what<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.680> did<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.370> think<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:23.640> came<00:02:23.790> out

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
just what I did and I think it came out

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.900 
just what I did and I think it came out
really<00:02:23.970> good<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.870> again<00:02:25.830> this<00:02:26.250> does<00:02:26.520> not<00:02:26.700> have

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
really good and again this does not have

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.850 
really good and again this does not have
to<00:02:27.060> be<00:02:27.090> perfect<00:02:27.180> also<00:02:28.170> because<00:02:28.410> there's<00:02:28.710> going

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
to be perfect also because there's going

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.740 
to be perfect also because there's going
to<00:02:28.950> be<00:02:28.980> another<00:02:29.340> step<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:30.090> will<00:02:30.420> kind<00:02:30.660> of

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
to be another step that will kind of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.810 
to be another step that will kind of
cover-up<00:02:31.140> if<00:02:31.410> you<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:31.740> any<00:02:31.950> mistakes<00:02:32.460> so

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
cover-up if you have any mistakes so

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.190 
cover-up if you have any mistakes so
keep<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.720> in<00:02:33.900> mind<00:02:35.390> then<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.660> took<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.990> same

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
keep that in mind then I took the same

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.170 
keep that in mind then I took the same
golden<00:02:37.680> shade<00:02:37.980> as<00:02:38.160> before<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.880> applied<00:02:39.150> it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
golden shade as before and I applied it

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.510 
golden shade as before and I applied it
towards<00:02:40.050> my<00:02:40.200> hairline<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.920> downwards

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
towards my hairline and downwards

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.280 
towards my hairline and downwards
because<00:02:41.730> I'm<00:02:42.300> going<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.690> be<00:02:42.780> adding<00:02:42.930> more

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
because I'm going to be adding more

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.950 
because I'm going to be adding more

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
different spot and then I took the liner

my face towards my eye and i love how
this<00:03:05.430> looks<00:03:06.320> then<00:03:07.320> using<00:03:07.740> this<00:03:08.010> brown<00:03:08.370> pencil

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
this looks then using this brown pencil

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.140 
this looks then using this brown pencil
liner<00:03:09.210> by<00:03:09.600> NYX<00:03:10.020> I<00:03:10.350> applied<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.010> into<00:03:11.670> the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
liner by NYX I applied it into the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.630 
liner by NYX I applied it into the
leopard<00:03:12.600> prints<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:13.290> this<00:03:14.070> will<00:03:14.250> make<00:03:14.400> it

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
leopard prints and this will make it

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.630 
leopard prints and this will make it
stand<00:03:15.480> out<00:03:15.660> more<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:16.410> add<00:03:16.650> more<00:03:16.890> detail<00:03:17.130> you

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
stand out more and add more detail you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.070 
stand out more and add more detail you
can<00:03:17.760> either<00:03:17.940> do<00:03:18.180> them<00:03:18.330> really<00:03:18.540> lightly<00:03:18.900> or

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
can either do them really lightly or

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.650 
can either do them really lightly or
darker<00:03:19.770> i<00:03:19.890> did<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.340> mix<00:03:20.970> of<00:03:21.209> both<00:03:21.390> of<00:03:21.450> them

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
darker i did a mix of both of them

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.630 
darker i did a mix of both of them
because<00:03:21.870> i<00:03:22.080> think<00:03:22.140> it<00:03:22.470> looks<00:03:23.010> more<00:03:23.220> realistic

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
because i think it looks more realistic

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.390 
because i think it looks more realistic
if<00:03:24.060> not<00:03:24.660> different<00:03:25.140> colored<00:03:25.470> spots<00:03:25.830> because

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
if not different colored spots because

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.240 
if not different colored spots because
none<00:03:26.970> of<00:03:27.000> them<00:03:27.239> are<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.540> same<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.140> it<00:03:29.040> just

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
none of them are the same and it just

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.940 
none of them are the same and it just
adds<00:03:29.459> more<00:03:29.700> detail<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.690> apply<00:03:31.080> it<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.500> both<00:03:31.739> my

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
adds more detail I apply it to both my

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.910 
adds more detail I apply it to both my
eye<00:03:31.980> and<00:03:32.459> my<00:03:32.670> forehead<00:03:33.090> as<00:03:33.300> you<00:03:33.450> can<00:03:33.630> see<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.200> I

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
eye and my forehead as you can see and I

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.430 
eye and my forehead as you can see and I
also<00:03:35.160> used<00:03:35.430> it<00:03:35.850> to<00:03:36.060> fill<00:03:36.330> in<00:03:36.510> my<00:03:36.690> brows<00:03:36.720> because

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
also used it to fill in my brows because

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.830 
also used it to fill in my brows because
you<00:03:38.280> want<00:03:38.519> your<00:03:38.580> brows<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.090> stand<00:03:39.360> out<00:03:39.570> because

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
you want your brows to stand out because

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.670 
you want your brows to stand out because
you<00:03:40.110> are<00:03:40.320> doing<00:03:41.100> a<00:03:41.280> really<00:03:41.550> dramatic<00:03:41.700> look

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
you are doing a really dramatic look

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.830 
you are doing a really dramatic look
then<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.890> took<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.250> urban<00:03:44.670> decay<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.090> pencil<00:03:45.660> in

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
then I took this urban decay I pencil in

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.960 
then I took this urban decay I pencil in
the<00:03:45.870> shade<00:03:46.200> demolition<00:03:46.980> and<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.459> applied<00:03:47.790> you

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
the shade demolition and I applied you

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.630 
the shade demolition and I applied you
my<00:03:48.090> top<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.390> bottom<00:03:48.660> lash<00:03:49.350> line<00:03:49.380> and<00:03:49.920> I<00:03:50.430> like

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
my top and bottom lash line and I like

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.300 
my top and bottom lash line and I like
this<00:03:50.820> because<00:03:51.060> it<00:03:51.269> makes<00:03:51.450> my<00:03:51.690> eyes<00:03:51.870> pop<00:03:52.040> but<00:03:53.040> it

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
this because it makes my eyes pop but it

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.330 
this because it makes my eyes pop but it
looks<00:03:53.700> better<00:03:54.330> because<00:03:54.930> it's<00:03:55.170> not<00:03:55.410> as<00:03:55.680> defined

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
looks better because it's not as defined

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.410 
looks better because it's not as defined
and<00:03:57.230> perfect<00:03:58.230> as<00:03:58.410> if<00:03:58.830> you<00:03:58.950> did<00:03:59.220> liquid<00:04:00.180> liner

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
and perfect as if you did liquid liner
