versions<00:00:25.390> of<00:00:25.720> my<00:00:26.009> visit<00:00:27.009> extender<00:00:27.430> work<00:00:28.060> a

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:28.360 
versions of my visit extender work a

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.490 
versions of my visit extender work a
designer<00:00:29.079> both<00:00:30.390> if<00:00:31.390> built<00:00:31.869> from<00:00:31.930> scratch<00:00:32.110> was

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
designer both if built from scratch was

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.720 
designer both if built from scratch was
it<00:00:32.649> as<00:00:32.739> a<00:00:32.770> crap<00:00:33.130> by<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.310> work<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:35.430> yet<00:00:36.430> so

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
it as a crap by the work and yet so

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.000 
it as a crap by the work and yet so
basically<00:00:37.570> this<00:00:37.690> one's<00:00:37.960> slightly<00:00:38.500> larger

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
basically this one's slightly larger

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.299 
basically this one's slightly larger
because<00:00:40.170> this<00:00:41.170> one<00:00:41.320> uses<00:00:41.530> a<00:00:41.680> piston<00:00:42.070> to<00:00:42.190> make

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
because this one uses a piston to make

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.729 
because this one uses a piston to make
the<00:00:42.399> post<00:00:42.579> rather<00:00:42.910> them<00:00:43.410> or<00:00:44.410> there's

to build this one pistols under the
transcript<00:00:51.309> this<00:00:51.460> one<00:00:52.199> okay<00:00:53.199> so<00:00:53.429> start<00:00:54.429> off<00:00:54.550> by

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
transcript this one okay so start off by

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.340 
transcript this one okay so start off by
making<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.839> shape<00:00:56.339> blocks<00:00:58.230> with<00:00:59.230> a

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
making the shape blocks with a

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.669 
making the shape blocks with a
restaurant<00:01:00.039> or<00:01:00.219> underneath<00:01:01.469> what's<00:01:02.469> down

restaurant or underneath what's down

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.870 
restaurant or underneath what's down
there<00:01:02.890> and<00:01:03.900> then<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:06.100> just<00:01:06.280> put<00:01:06.430> your<00:01:06.490> Pistons

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
there and then you just put your Pistons

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.510 
there and then you just put your Pistons
where<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.270> want<00:01:07.450> your<00:01:07.830> boot<00:01:08.830> off<00:01:08.980> mystics<00:01:09.400> in

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
where you want your boot off mystics in

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.250 
where you want your boot off mystics in
them<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:09.850> then<00:01:10.330> the<00:01:10.510> block<00:01:10.690> on<00:01:10.720> top<00:01:10.900> of<00:01:11.140> that

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
them and then the block on top of that

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.430 
them and then the block on top of that
you're<00:01:11.440> gonna<00:01:11.530> want<00:01:11.740> to<00:01:11.800> be<00:01:11.890> extended<00:01:13.440> then

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
you're gonna want to be extended then

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.660 
you're gonna want to be extended then
you<00:01:14.620> video<00:01:16.470> now<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:19.540> goes<00:01:19.690> into<00:01:20.670> one

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
you video now and that goes into one

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.770 
you video now and that goes into one
piston<00:01:22.090> own<00:01:22.390> one<00:01:22.930> piston<00:01:23.290> to<00:01:23.350> one<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:25.240> Peter

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
piston own one piston to one and a Peter

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.550 
piston own one piston to one and a Peter
with<00:01:26.470> one<00:01:27.340> tip<00:01:27.550> so<00:01:27.940> just<00:01:28.090> leave<00:01:28.180> it<00:01:28.390> any<00:01:29.320> big

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
with one tip so just leave it any big

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.130 
with one tip so just leave it any big
piston<00:01:29.980> in<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.100> ground<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.420> block<00:01:31.690> on<00:01:31.840> top<00:01:31.870> of

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
piston in the ground the block on top of

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.480 
piston in the ground the block on top of
that<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:33.310> then<00:01:33.520> another<00:01:34.650> repeater<00:01:35.650> it's<00:01:36.310> time

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
that and then another repeater it's time

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.010 
that and then another repeater it's time
with<00:01:36.630> 11<00:01:37.630> click<00:01:38.430> this<00:01:39.430> goes<00:01:39.670> into<00:01:39.850> block<00:01:40.780> here

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
with 11 click this goes into block here

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.890 
with 11 click this goes into block here
and<00:01:41.920> then<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:43.090> should<00:01:43.240> put<00:01:43.360> one<00:01:43.390> piece<00:01:43.690> right

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
and then you should put one piece right

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.170 
and then you should put one piece right
down<00:01:44.080> there<00:01:44.260> and<00:01:45.250> also<00:01:45.520> you<00:01:45.760> want<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.030> put<00:01:46.150> a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
down there and also you want to put a

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.930 
down there and also you want to put a
redstone<00:01:46.390> torch<00:01:46.690> on<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.170> one<00:01:47.760> so<00:01:48.760> they'll

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
redstone torch on this one so they'll

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
redstone torch on this one so they'll
turn<00:01:49.630> off<00:01:49.750> when<00:01:49.930> this<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:50.890> powered<00:01:51.160> on<00:01:51.250> and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
turn off when this is powered on and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.770 
turn off when this is powered on and
this<00:01:52.960> goes<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:54.150> repeater<00:01:55.150> into<00:01:55.450> their<00:01:55.600> with

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
this goes a repeater into their with

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.480 
this goes a repeater into their with
also<00:01:56.260> with<00:01:56.410> 11<00:01:57.130> click<00:01:57.780> engineer<00:01:59.310> so<00:02:00.310> if<00:02:00.370> I

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
also with 11 click engineer so if I

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.660 
also with 11 click engineer so if I
thumb<00:02:00.760> and<00:02:01.060> then<00:02:01.270> you<00:02:01.780> just<00:02:04.440> down<00:02:05.440> up
