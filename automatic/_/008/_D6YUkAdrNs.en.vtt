00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it 20 times within 30 seconds and taking

00:00:33.809 --> 00:01:01.869

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.399 

all<00:01:02.879> right<00:01:03.000> so<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.210> we<00:01:03.329> did<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.540> correctly<00:01:03.719> 20

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
all right so if we did it correctly 20

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.380 
all right so if we did it correctly 20
times<00:01:04.619> within<00:01:04.860> that<00:01:05.070> 30<00:01:05.339> seconds<00:01:05.820> when<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.240> put

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
times within that 30 seconds when we put

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.300 
times within that 30 seconds when we put
the<00:01:06.479> key<00:01:06.630> in<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> start<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:08.100> should<00:01:08.250> get

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the key in and start it we should get

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.630 
the key in and start it we should get
the<00:01:08.490> first<00:01:08.700> round<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.150> chimes<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.520> then<00:01:11.520> it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the first round of chimes and then it

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.180 
the first round of chimes and then it
should<00:01:11.820> stop

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.130 

all<00:01:20.790> right<00:01:20.910> so<00:01:21.090> we<00:01:21.210> haven't<00:01:21.330> got<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.660> second

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
all right so we haven't got the second

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.590 
all right so we haven't got the second
seatbelt<00:01:22.560> chime<00:01:22.800> or<00:01:23.010> warning<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.390> light

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
seatbelt chime or warning or the light

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.720 
seatbelt chime or warning or the light
so<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:24.900> must<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.140> genetics<00:01:25.500> successfully<00:01:26.010> so

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:26.730 
so we must have genetics successfully so

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.160 
so we must have genetics successfully so
if<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.940> can<00:01:27.090> drop<00:01:27.270> me<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.450> comment<00:01:27.720> letting<00:01:28.050> me

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
if you can drop me a comment letting me

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.870 
if you can drop me a comment letting me
know<00:01:28.230> the<00:01:28.530> model<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.250> year<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.730> do

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
know the model and the year that you do

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.250 
know the model and the year that you do
it<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.360> works<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.080> get<00:01:31.170> a

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
it on that it works just so we can get a

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.230 
it on that it works just so we can get a
better<00:01:31.440> idea<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.830> people<00:01:32.370> out<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:33.180> I

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
better idea for people out there but I

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.000 
better idea for people out there but I
believe<00:01:33.480> it's<00:01:33.600> going<00:01:33.690> to<00:01:33.750> work<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> 5<00:01:34.740> to

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.010 
believe it's going to work for a 5 to

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.800 
believe it's going to work for a 5 to
