00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
so that's going to leave thrown out the

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.330 
so that's going to leave thrown out the
window<00:01:06.810> they're<00:01:07.229> very<00:01:07.380> next<00:01:07.500> each<00:01:07.650> other<00:01:07.830> and

window they're very next each other and
that's<00:01:08.670> what<00:01:08.790> system<00:01:09.000> link<00:01:09.180> does<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.630> see<00:01:09.780> the

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
that's what system link does we see the

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.770 
that's what system link does we see the
core<00:01:10.110> gameplay<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.799> nothing<00:01:11.640> else<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.630> that's

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
but we saw with black ops 1 that it was

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.170 
but we saw with black ops 1 that it was

community<00:03:37.690> we<00:03:38.260> saw<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.650> they<00:03:38.769> invited<00:03:39.220> a

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
community we saw that they invited a

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.030 
community we saw that they invited a

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
and apparently it was bad because we saw

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.509 
and apparently it was bad because we saw
a<00:03:46.420> black<00:03:46.660> ops<00:03:46.870> 1<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.380> was<00:03:47.650> bad<00:03:47.829> and<00:03:48.070> they<00:03:48.160> kept

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
a black ops 1 it was bad and they kept

a black ops 1 it was bad and they kept
it<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.700> way<00:03:48.820> they<00:03:49.480> wanted<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.840> make<00:03:49.959> sure

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
it that way they wanted to make sure

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.560 
it that way they wanted to make sure
that<00:03:50.140> snipers<00:03:50.680> were<00:03:51.160> not<00:03:51.489> major<00:03:51.940> in<00:03:52.090> black<00:03:52.360> ops

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.920 
1 I was single black ops 2 that's
completely<00:03:54.880> changed<00:03:55.239> they<00:03:55.329> probably<00:03:55.600> had<00:03:55.810> to

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
completely changed they probably had to

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.140 
completely changed they probably had to
cater<00:03:56.200> to<00:03:56.350> that<00:03:56.410> and<00:03:56.680> actually<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.820> is<00:03:57.940> also

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
cater to that and actually that is also

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.800 
cater to that and actually that is also
a<00:03:58.450> result<00:03:58.930> of<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.170> same<00:03:59.410> exact<00:03:59.920> thing<00:04:00.810> snipers

2 sniping and that's documented and we
saw<00:04:08.860> that<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.340> was<00:04:09.459> probably<00:04:10.450> changed<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.140> we

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
saw that it was probably changed and we

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.670 
saw that it was probably changed and we
see<00:04:12.010> now<00:04:12.160> that<00:04:12.519> this<00:04:12.760> game<00:04:13.000> is<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.239> sniper<00:04:13.959> Haven

now<00:04:17.280> whether<00:04:17.579> that<00:04:17.669> be<00:04:17.849> four<00:04:18.000> bad<00:04:18.120> for<00:04:18.299> good

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
now whether that be four bad for good

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.300 
now whether that be four bad for good
you<00:04:18.959> can<00:04:19.139> judge<00:04:19.349> that<00:04:19.380> on<00:04:19.680> your<00:04:19.769> own<00:04:19.829> and<00:04:20.190> I
