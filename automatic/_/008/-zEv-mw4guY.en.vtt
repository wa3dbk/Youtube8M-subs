00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.280
 everything worthy playboy has to 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.830
 wander in one by the port 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.600
 they are the ultimate expression of luxury and 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.450
 some are bigger than a house 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:17.070
 they cost millions but how are they created 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.070
 these modern status symbols 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.880
 a computerized saw cuts the 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.650
 pieces of wood that will be used to 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.680
 make the mold for the fiber boat 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.680
 glass 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:52.740
 the team of artisans takes about 15 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.740
 months in designing and building the mold 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120
 first build the frame 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.400
 the following is the fiber mold of 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.770
 glass 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.840
 It must be perfect to make a 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.119
 boat without failures or defects 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.880
 the finish of the mold is worked one and 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.399
 again and a paint is applied 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.270
 ultra resistant that will hold up to 8 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.270
 years of moldings 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.630
 once the mold is finished and you can 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.700
 start manufacturing the helmet 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.070
 free fiber 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.780
 the team introduces the fair proportion 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.700
 fiberglass in plastic resin 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.100
 fiberglass as its name indicates 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.590
 It is glass in very fine fibers and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.360
 flexible may seem fragile but 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.720
 These fibers are more resistant than 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.850
 steel and they do not burn or stretch or 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.940
 rot are the perfect material for 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.950
 build boats 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.400
 the operators make sure that the 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.160
 Fiber reach the last crack 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.290
 this is vital because if it does not apply 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.350
 thoroughly the boat will have defects 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:16.660
 structural as they increase the 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.660
 heat fiberglass hardens 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.120
 then a material is applied 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.329
 called robin reinforces the fiber of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.709
 glass and makes it stiffer the 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.590
 wood in the places where most 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.390
 late the team will be assembled finally 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.439
 covers the wood with fiberglass for 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.439
 protect it from moisture 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.620
 an hour later the time comes 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.620
 extract the piece from the mold 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.370
 to lift the helmet a system is used 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.370
 lever 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.360
 holes are made for the elements 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.360
 mechanics 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.360
 then the cover is installed 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.880
 It is placed on the motor and wiring 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.510
 electric for mechanics and 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.510
 plumbing 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.520
 the ship takes its true form in the 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.590
 final assembly part is built 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.040
 top of the ship the deck and the 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.040
 inside 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.690
 Y 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.260
 it's time for the finishes 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.020
 and other components that are placed 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.020
 hand like the instrument panel 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.260
 the last stop is the control of 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.359
 quality a series of tests guarantee 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.340
 that all the mechanics work well and that 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.340
 the boat is absolutely hermetic 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.160
 finally a protective wrapper for 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.160
 take care of the boat during transportation
