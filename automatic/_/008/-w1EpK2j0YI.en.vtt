00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
entirely though until the game comes out

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.160 
entirely though until the game comes out
also<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.890> huge<00:01:47.640> deal<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.329> now<00:01:48.600> they're<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:49.049> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
also a huge deal is now they're going to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.499 
also a huge deal is now they're going to
have<00:01:49.350> co-op<00:01:50.070> seasons<00:01:50.729> now<00:01:50.909> they<00:01:51.060> didn't<00:01:51.329> say

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
have co-op seasons now they didn't say

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.940

this<00:01:51.720> would<00:01:51.810> happen<00:01:52.140> for<00:01:52.320> fifa<00:01:52.560> ultimate<00:01:52.680> team

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
this would happen for fifa ultimate team

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.399 
this would happen for fifa ultimate team
which<00:01:53.640> i'm<00:01:53.850> really<00:01:53.880> hoping<00:01:54.509> will<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.200> case

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
which i'm really hoping will be the case

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.780 
which i'm really hoping will be the case
because<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.920> would<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.130> even<00:01:56.310> more<00:01:56.670> exciting

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
because that would be even more exciting

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.179 
because that would be even more exciting
but<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.840> co-op<00:01:58.320> seasons<00:01:58.799> where<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.040> can

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
but to have co-op seasons where you can

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
but to have co-op seasons where you can
get<00:01:59.310> say<00:01:59.549> one<00:01:59.820> youtuber<00:02:00.360> can<00:02:00.899> get<00:02:01.049> on<00:02:01.170> with

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
get say one youtuber can get on with

thumbnails<00:06:09.720> for<00:06:10.200> so<00:06:10.740> i<00:06:10.770> definitely<00:06:11.040> want<00:06:11.400> to

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
thumbnails for so i definitely want to

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.670 
thumbnails for so i definitely want to
check<00:06:11.520> him<00:06:11.970> out<00:06:12.150> not<00:06:12.930> sure<00:06:13.140> exactly<00:06:13.470> how<00:06:13.620> many

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
check him out not sure exactly how many

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.960 
check him out not sure exactly how many
subscribers<00:06:13.919> he<00:06:14.310> has<00:06:14.400> right<00:06:14.520> now<00:06:14.580> probably

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
subscribers he has right now probably

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.280 
subscribers he has right now probably
like<00:06:15.210> close<00:06:15.480> to<00:06:15.570> five<00:06:15.720> to<00:06:15.870> ten<00:06:16.050> because<00:06:16.140> he

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
like close to five to ten because he

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.360 
like close to five to ten because he
just<00:06:16.530> started<00:06:16.830> it<00:06:16.950> but<00:06:17.040> I<00:06:17.100> think<00:06:17.130> we<00:06:17.340> should

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
just started it but I think we should

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.130 
just started it but I think we should
push<00:06:17.669> him<00:06:17.850> towards<00:06:18.180> that<00:06:18.330> 100<00:06:18.720> subscriber

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.140 
push him towards that 100 subscriber

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.930 
push him towards that 100 subscriber
mark<00:06:19.410> and<00:06:19.680> maybe<00:06:20.190> he'll<00:06:20.400> give<00:06:20.580> you<00:06:20.669> the<00:06:20.760> chance

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
mark and maybe he'll give you the chance

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.159 
mark and maybe he'll give you the chance
