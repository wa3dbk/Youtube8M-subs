00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.609
 Hi guys, welcome to Toys On The Go! 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.520
 Today we are going to play with "Mickey's playground" 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.600
 You will have a great time playing with Minnie in the carousel or on the swing 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.360
 And the sandbox is Toodles 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.700
 In which you can put the disk to discover the mysterious Mickey-Tool! 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.140
 Do not miss it, I'll show you all the details of this fantastic toy! 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.740
 Are we all going to play at the park? 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.900
 We start! 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.940
 This is the box 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.440
 In the back you can see the content and the possibilities of game 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.140
 Now I'm going to take it out of the box and show it to you 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.280
 Here it is 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.320
 This is the figure of Mickey 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.580
 Mickey Mouse: Hello friends! Do you want to play with me in the park? 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.280
 He wears his red shorts and yellow shoes 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.100
 It is an articulated figure 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.760
 Can be folded around the waist to sit 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.840

 Look, this is the sandbox, and as you can see it has the shape of Toodles 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.880
 And this album has the Mickey-Tools 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.580
 To discover which is the mysterious Mickey-Tool we have to introduce the disk in Toodles 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:41.540
 See? 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.620
 And on the other side there is a castle 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.340
 This is the rocker 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.080
 Here is the merry-go-round 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 And on the other side the swing 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.820
 The cylinder in the central part is a slide 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.420
 This is a little flag and it is placed up here 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.560
 Hey! Look, Mickey and Minnie are at home! 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.460
 Minnie: Mickey, do you want us to go play at the park? 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.180
 Mickey: I think it's a great idea 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.040
 Mickey is going to play with Toodles and the mysterious disc 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.680
 Mickey: What fun! 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.580
 Minnie: Did we climb the rocker together? 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.060
 Mickey: Yes! I love the seesaw! 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.300
 Mickey and Minnie are having a great time! 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.900
 Now they are going to climb on the merry-go-round that is also very fun 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.560
 See how they go around again and again! 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.780
 Now they are going to play on the swing 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.940
 First Mickey climbs 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.160
 It's Minnie's turn! 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.980
 What a difference! 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.380
 Meanwhile, Mickey slides down the slide 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:13.140
 Mickey: I had a great time! Are we going to have a snack? 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.460
 Minnie: Of course ...! 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.960
 Mickey has prepared a delicious snack at home 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.040
 Mickey: Goodbye friends, come back to play with me whenever you want!
