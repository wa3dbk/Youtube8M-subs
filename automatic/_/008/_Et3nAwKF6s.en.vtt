00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.990
 or the people were still clumsy and I 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.580
 I bring a new video this time 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.110
 minecraft and it's going to be about one way 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.640
 quite simple and very simple is not 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.230
 no tutorial or anything but humor that 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.730
 I found on the net and it seems to me that 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.349
 can be very useful especially for the 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.180
 people who usually have many mod senel 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.200
 minecraft the first thing to know that to 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.330
 can install this mod 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.150
 it is necessary to have the mod not installed 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.949
 in out items that is like the tumen items 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.839
 but my best opinion I'll leave it 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.610
 also the link in the description and 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.930
 well this mod is called while ay what 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.750
 is something very simple and is that 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.329
 every time you put the cursor over a 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.460
 object then it says the name panel 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.860
 solar and the way it belongs to 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.829
 industrial example craft 2 here we see 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.219
 industrial iron scaffolding kraft or 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:54.559
 minecraft poster Rainbow chest of 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.030
 haendel forestry and it seems to me that 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.309
 It is very useful because many times 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.430
 when are we looking at something 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.260
 to navigate the cne and we go as 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.580
 we usually do a lot we see a lot of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.229
 things that we do not know or what they are and for 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.970
 what's the use and with this we can 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.350
 we then search the internet to 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.630
 what does each thing do and so 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.890
 better learn how to go what mods 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.840
 better in this way is that when 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.820
 we enter 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.920
 I'm going to take myself creative when I went in more 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.810
 to the inventory when we put things 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.820
 over when we put the cursor over 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.690
 of things because it also tells us of 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.880
 what nicknames and the name 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.780
 for example vending machine of the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.900
 industrial this is also the industrial 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.250
 another thing this from the forestry and so and 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.350
 Well the truth I find a 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.940
 very useful way in this regard what is the 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.950
 failure that I see the fault is that you 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.200
 point everything is to say you put it here you 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.160
 says 6 pts grass tells you wood 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.950
 oak tells you oak leaves tells you 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.410
 You were like that and you say sand that 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.000
 says earth and come on this can 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.010
 be a bit heavy but I go for 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.020
 the world and have a little sign there 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.370
 up all the time then that's the 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.840
 only negative point that I see to the 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.360
 so it can be a bit heavy 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.680
 that shows you absolutely everything I think 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.750
 that should have made you 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.820
 will only point out mods but good things 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.940
 as I say it seems to me that it is quite useful 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.380
 especially when we have about 50 that in 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.720
 the fund we only use 10 but that we 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.830
 like to know what everything is for and nothing 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.750
 so far today's video I hope that 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.160
 has served them as I say is a way 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.570
 very simple but I think it can 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.190
 be useful when we have enough 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.210
 mods as always I hope you have 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.900
 liked and see you in the next 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.900
 good video
