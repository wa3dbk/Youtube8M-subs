00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.580
 2011 ago, right after the start in the tenth and thirteenth on the beach 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.890
 We will never fall and you will always be a big one 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.789
 to experience 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.990
 NS is a hammer piece knowing that he doesn't say that difference between the 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:23.269
 modern Art 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.230
 to maintain the Netherlands moisture and council of state 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.979
 but that is also the automation goes 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:34.539
 and there is one of the possible consequences of this coming back this winter 

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:35.430
 let go 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.980
 hungary no special measures i am very curious about the fact because it 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.880
 tested specifically 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.500
 and everyone in the rest of europe has 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.860
 and as soon as I have a rash already 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.179
 a successor too 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.179
 that can give 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.220
 is a contract that states that terrorists 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.440
 A nice gain in being just knowing 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.440
 know the desired human rights from abroad when it 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.710
 railway station 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.869
 hasselt the city government was short of time is what a corrupt ground 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.620

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160

 it is the third geer council today 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.630
 if you have a pleasant experience the country is coming again now there would be one 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.270
 Secondly we do look forward to different results and get to look 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.620
 and what those guys drink for the games during the games on 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.820
 queue to leave this summer 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.920
 along with something more needed than others 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.939
 people with more in-house thinking a competition without an audience for that is it 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.300
 do need the interest of a lot of moisture and 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.420
 as a player I am optimally performing I am really looking forward to the results of 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.819
 wavin if i didn't get a good time in it 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.429
 novum gerard joling marco van der heide by oath 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:17.119
 Fortunately, this brand has significant differences the incident did in the 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:18.709

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.399

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.399

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.749

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.359
