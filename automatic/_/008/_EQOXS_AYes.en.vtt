00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:25.260
 We can now use these values 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:28.010
 back in our replacement two poles and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:35.780
 he looks like this now 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:49.829
 replacement has 52 17 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:50.940
 Replacement has 97 92 want this is this 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:59.520
 is b 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:03.270
 that's four with 12 and so the rest 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.110
 I think is relatively easy we are looking for 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:14.869
 still ii 4 and 4 sophia in the background 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:18.229
 circuit that is rocco replacement by 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:32.479
 replacement + r 4 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:43.130
 that's 97 92 volts through 5217 plus 12 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:43.130
 and there comes out for i4i 0 5 687 ampere 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.570
 so and at 4 we can either over one 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.790
 Determine voltage tyler or over 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.000
 social law i take this here 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.399
 original law so ag with last 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.920
 Now, mind you, we were in earlier 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.869
 the soup position determined during idling 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.630
 what was yahoo replacement 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.539
 so now r4 is connected to it 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:15.519
 the actual ub is here with us 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:21.519
 now here and that is the 4 x 4 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:31.769
 and that's 0 5 687 ampere times r4 were 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:37.810
 twelve rome and that equals 6.8 24 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:41.250
 volt and that was the same with it 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.250
 task solved 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:50.290
 So we know the tension now 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.160
 here the tension and all confess 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.799
 we have with the help of the second theory 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.040
 using the super position 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:02.500
 made a pretty interesting thing 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.720
 I'm in the super position too 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.510
 again and again wonder how the super knows 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.430
 position that you idle the 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.829
 Tension must add up so to speak 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.450
 voltage must switch in series and if 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.430
 we have a short circuit at the super 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.959
 make position then we also add 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.269
 the single effect that would be then 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.019
 however, a knot addition so 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.600
 Also there the currents are acting that is 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.900
 so very interesting in the super 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.430
 position and it belongs to the super 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.790
 position that 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.000
 they do not work in electrical engineering 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:41.340
 Immediately start, I say 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.340
 works until next time
