00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
little bit then about you know the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.750 
little bit then about you know the
metagame<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.710> this<00:01:10.860> adds<00:01:11.130> do<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.460> ever<00:01:11.549> like

throw<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.119> some<00:01:12.299> needles<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.689> stuff<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.080> just

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
throw in some needles and stuff to just

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.460 
throw in some needles and stuff to just
to<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:15.090> under<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> skin<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.869> think

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
to really get get under the skin I think

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.230 
to really get get under the skin I think
actions<00:01:17.100> speak<00:01:17.490> louder<00:01:17.729> than<00:01:18.150> words<00:01:18.299> so

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
actions speak louder than words so

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.520 
actions speak louder than words so
pretty<00:01:21.240> bad<00:01:21.390> hanging<00:01:21.659> for<00:01:21.840> bedding<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.229> think

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
pretty bad hanging for bedding I think

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.870 
pretty bad hanging for bedding I think

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
it's probably a little bit more

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.820 
it's probably a little bit more
