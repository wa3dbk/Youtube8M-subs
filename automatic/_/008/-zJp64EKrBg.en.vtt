a<00:02:18.730> masterpiece<00:02:19.480> I<00:02:19.810> think<00:02:20.260> was<00:02:20.680> made<00:02:20.890> here

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
a masterpiece I think was made here

series of sketches of the stars gallery
that's<00:02:34.459> very<00:02:35.000> appealing<00:02:35.270> because<00:02:35.560> somehow

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
that's very appealing because somehow

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.800 
that's very appealing because somehow

interesting<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:55.970> notation<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:57.020> is

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
interesting is that notation that is

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.970 
interesting is that notation that is
focused<00:02:58.459> on<00:02:58.550> the<00:02:58.760> center<00:02:59.120> element<00:02:59.540> of<00:02:59.780> the<00:03:00.770> of

focused on the center element of the of
the<00:03:01.100> project<00:03:01.489> that<00:03:01.610> is<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.820> internal<00:03:02.690> part

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
the project that is the internal part

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.140 
the project that is the internal part
here<00:03:03.080> that<00:03:03.110> has<00:03:03.680> a<00:03:03.709> circular<00:03:04.100> shape<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.580> which

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
here that has a circular shape and which

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.090 
here that has a circular shape and which
is<00:03:05.269> actually<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.600> path<00:03:05.840> that<00:03:06.170> citizen<00:03:06.680> can<00:03:06.830> use

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
is actually a path that citizen can use

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.729 
is actually a path that citizen can use
to<00:03:07.640> all<00:03:08.030> passes<00:03:08.510> lope<00:03:08.780> of<00:03:09.019> the<00:03:09.440> ins<00:03:09.590> of

without actually having to enter the

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.870 
without actually having to enter the
building<00:03:14.680> so<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.709> found<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.100> very<00:03:16.160> ironic<00:03:16.670> that

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
building so I found it very ironic that

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.060 
building so I found it very ironic that
in<00:03:17.330> in<00:03:17.900> Yale<00:03:18.200> he<00:03:18.620> was<00:03:18.890> inserted<00:03:19.700> into<00:03:19.900> Lukens

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
in in Yale he was inserted into Lukens

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.210 
in in Yale he was inserted into Lukens
building

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
building

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.400 
building
the<00:03:22.430> British<00:03:22.700> Art<00:03:22.880> Center<00:03:23.300> building<00:03:24.260> for

the British Art Center building for

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.110 
the British Art Center building for
which<00:03:24.530> he<00:03:24.709> had<00:03:24.920> actually<00:03:25.489> wanted<00:03:26.060> a

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
which he had actually wanted a

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.470 
which he had actually wanted a

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
with its very strict geometrical

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.780 
with its very strict geometrical
organization<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.380> thought<00:03:33.950> was<00:03:34.130> both<00:03:34.310> ironic

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
organization I thought was both ironic

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.670 
organization I thought was both ironic
and<00:03:35.000> interesting<00:03:35.570> then<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.380> course<00:03:36.560> in

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
and interesting then of course in

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.590 
and interesting then of course in
Britain<00:03:37.010> in<00:03:37.220> London<00:03:37.579> there<00:03:38.180> was<00:03:38.329> the

Britain in London there was the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.500 
Britain in London there was the

exhibition in the core gallery itself

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.100 
exhibition in the core gallery itself
where<00:03:42.410> sterling<00:03:43.070> was<00:03:43.760> entered<00:03:44.150> into<00:03:44.299> sterling

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
where sterling was entered into sterling

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.819 
where sterling was entered into sterling
and<00:03:45.290> here<00:03:46.299> very<00:03:47.299> interestingly<00:03:47.630> sterling<00:03:48.530> is

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:48.829 
and here very interestingly sterling is

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.360 
and here very interestingly sterling is
in<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.340> old<00:03:49.519> starts<00:03:50.180> gallery<00:03:50.480> where<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.980> new
