00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.740
 now this is volume 2 of the worst 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.680
 end in games if you have not seen the 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.059
 first what do you expect viral bay or now and 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:20.680
 Then you come back here, come on, come on, you're 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.860
 we go long ago 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.720
 it's amazing you stayed with me as 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.930
 you can see we could not place all 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.050
 the worst endings in a single count like this 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:36.390
 that therefore here are the five 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.390
 most terrible endings for your delight 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.980
 flowers 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:58.070
 although valuable is one of the 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.659
 best games of all time no 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.839
 there is doubt that each of the three 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:05.780
 final is disappointing after the 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:07.310
 terrible final fight practically you 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.380
 let the player know that his decisions 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.380
 morals mean nothing 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.829
 just as poisoned food is 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:20.899
 delicious when you're eating the 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:25.240
 main saucer but it does not take long 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:25.240
 so everything goes to hell 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.020
 a set 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.979
 silver and zinc so no 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.979
 we're 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.479
 arrive 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.800
 for a franchise so famous for its 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.070
 sequel advertising labels in each 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.140
 final unfinished code yuri goes offered 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.470
 something more than a big slap like 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.470
 final 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.640
 10 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.280
 and we've seen it all and many times 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.650
 the bad guy appears to beat him up and 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.569
 then it is something totally predictable 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.569
 appears shouting sneaks 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.180
 the watch has 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:27.190
 this time is insulting maybe one day 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.190
 they will be bored of being so predictable 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.519
 I know it 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.080
 lakers pinillos 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.080
 but 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.900
 even if Mr. t does not get on a plane 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.819
 for kane and lynch is literally what 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.800
 the only thing they can do to conclude the 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.660
 game after a particularly 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.360
 disappointing shooting in a restaurant 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.489
 Chinese is a race against the clock 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.080
 while the 'dynamic duo' tries to climb 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.080
 to an airplane to escape 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:18.990
 if you expected something else they were a 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.990
 good sign with the middle finger 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.860
 a terrible word 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.460
 we must admit that we feel a little 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.750
 wrong including is in the list 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.770
 considering the history of failure that 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.410
 it was the project 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.410
 whatever the ending was just as miserable 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.680
 and rewarding the hours of adventure 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.070
 with an abrupt black screen and a 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.110
 mediocre wall of text saying 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.630
 will continue so that's how he paints a 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:06.740
 failed project that to be so 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.740
 least they tried 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.390
 talking about trying these guys 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.390
 they really did not even think about it 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.370
 there's absolutely nothing wrong in seeing 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.759
 your enemies gather to sing at 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.759
 end of the game portal 2 did it 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.759
 brightly 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:44.830
 but this is pathetic and extremely 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:48.870
 low in quality showing that 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.870
 they just ran out of ideas 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.870
 comical maybe scary totally this 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.949
 horrible final shows that they should 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.949
 stay in limbo 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:30.069
 that does not help anyone here we go to 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:30.069
 arrive 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.030
 help 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.020
 to 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.030
 and for you to remember it well here goes 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.030
 new 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:14.600
 I want to know how I do it. 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.640
 to be that sensual voice stay with 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.680

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.410
 confidential, no matter what my 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.210
 gestures do not fit my true voice 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.210
 friends the most
