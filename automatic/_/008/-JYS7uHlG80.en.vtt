00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.779
 how much money he spent spent Dirk 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.039
 the car bought there are now needed 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.039
 60 euros spent 

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:30.679
 I visit young people who get along with as little money as possible 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.489
 if I drive next to him without this website the destination they want to be themselves 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.489
 to care 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.030
 the return 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.330
 Washington 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.030
 How does he become a self-sufficient person? 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.440
 why does he imagine it 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.810
 lead the at least four Taliban 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.410
 and then 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.270
 learned there 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.810
 cook and wash one for crack 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.580
 Apple performs during deposits 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.340
 5 percent 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.710
 is developed 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.620
 Min and again YB finally he can 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.550
 only make that was still before 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.440
 of conviction I think that you usually have a life that you just know 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.440
 then it will succeed and then makes it easy 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.780
 half a year the project is running 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.820
 So the two are right at the beginning 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.540
 working every spare minute doesnt help her if she is vegan an experiment she lives 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.550
 that makes the self-catering easier a vegetable patch is finally a lot 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.290
 less complicated than a chicken coop 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.469
 Self-sufficiency 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:31.700
 is a way of life for her 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.689
 anything else that made sure he even comes the business cycle test 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.810
 for Google would have been with the bug 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.370
 with life itself 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.460
 That's healthier this food is giving these founders for many key customers 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.290
 are for me wonderful side effects and to be able to enjoy 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 but also Gustav Peichl I am now - the 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.010
 the ten-headed 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.430
 But this ideology is also economically calculus 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.430
 the two are thereby drastically reducing the cost of living 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.510
 but they do not take a full risk yet 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.510
 we work too we have one coming 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.070
 At the moment everything could go wrong 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.210
 you do not have to starve mentally Hamlets have enough money at the moment 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.859
 and then Aachen is to buy that means they turn out to be 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.420
 Dr and he can just play around problems and 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.999
 learn a lot with the mistake of not being warned much and much 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.999
 can be grateful for the error-free when developing 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:29.670
 currently 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.069
 Together, they need about a thousand euros a month for food and electricity 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.970
 Insurance 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.320
 They are not rented, they help with the farmers and the ovens for that 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.360
 House use it remains the food and the want me because 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.360
 reduce this value as much as possible 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.690
 New York what's in it 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.009
 finally works again 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:58.569
 I've never set an artist's boundaries to the starting blocks 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.220
 a favorite would be 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.859
 after all, lost 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.799
 it is clear who attacks 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.779
 Vienna Geneva at the stands and it is a we are thrilled by the perpetrators 

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:10.929
 used 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:12.599
 PN on 4 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.629
 had on the weekend 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.039
 To be included as possessed has already become our goal 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:20.929
 No 

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:22.970
 Quarter must be completed 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.609
 the climatic journey 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:26.749
 after about half a year 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:29.389
 we are not going to be stressful 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.979
 it should have at least the Taliban should now have expelled Munich 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:39.129
 Up to 5 things never started before were called traders 

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:40.959
 until the 4th 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.790
 again he points to a victory 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.599
 to lie down 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:44.979
 with as little as possible 

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:47.979
 it's about as little consumption as possible 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.079
 m in the so-called 

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:57.119
 presents himself from the dust make Philipp Lahm 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.489
 for Dr 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.479
 now appears 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:04.169
 at the 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.169
 recover on points 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.199
 be placed
