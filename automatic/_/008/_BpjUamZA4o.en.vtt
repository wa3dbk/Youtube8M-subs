00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
 more 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.180
 and 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.239
 little bit distant from a little bit of 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.279
 Discovery sports and mix it 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.570
 pretty amazing we stopped in a 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.480
 little village like there are four women 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.850
 fallen little church 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:40.860
 that's it with the believe that are 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.960
 illuminated and ellis when it's very 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.839
 strange because we have no reference 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.440
 is 12:30 the brightness it is when 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:52.800
 even very weak we did not cross a 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.960
 human being did not cross horses but 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.600
 not a single human being blows and 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.570
 dominique I do not compare with me and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.539
 and then this man's impression 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.649
 Icelandic you realize how far 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.649
 leads us to the aces 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.280
 we'll do something that normally 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.280
 impassable it is written the ars 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.280
 it's not obvious I took a 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.420
 Snow slope because I know the 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.149
 doctors and a layer could not to 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.619
 through it's completely incredible 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.329
 I drive through my smartphone there 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.649
 did not happen to film the river 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:46.509
 that I am here it is to film that 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.830
 give to me it's ice cream it's 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.289
 ice cream and you'll see we're going on 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.070
 discover together discovery goes 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:56.340

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.340
 he will do it 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.409
 explorers 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.040
 he will go there 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.300
 in fact if the whole 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.970
 team that will disappear 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.970
 and in addition there is a current 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.379

 icy river to our expectations landed 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:16.200

 Icelandic hideaway and to show you in 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:06.240

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:08.730
 five-minute life just where is it going 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.830

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:23.460
 bomb so we can see what 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:26.070

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.030
 I love this car is the 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.830
 second day renault has often 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.900
 used to say that I'm racing 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.070
 in the first minutes and then and 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.990
 then the time passing it declines loved the 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:41.010
 ccc really well done and prices 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.460

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.530

 who is here that has been connected 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.490

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.699

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:37.120
 sensitive to the external environment 

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:44.100
