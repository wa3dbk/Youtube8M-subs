00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
on myself and appears with me as I

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.140

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
finally finished my ultimate but we

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.520 
finally finished my ultimate but we
thought<00:01:21.330> what<00:01:21.600> if<00:01:21.689> Shen<00:01:22.020> channels<00:01:22.439> his

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
thought what if Shen channels his

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.109 
thought what if Shen channels his
ultimate<00:01:22.920> sooner<00:01:23.369> well<00:01:23.640> he<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:23.939> randomly

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
ultimate sooner well he just randomly

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.999

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
tunnel a she's using it so first we

to walk on top of the tunnel to destroy

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.910 
to walk on top of the tunnel to destroy
it<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.299> go<00:01:48.540> into<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.960> about<00:01:49.079> halfway<00:01:49.439> through

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
it I go into it about halfway through

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.139 
it I go into it about halfway through
and<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.250> still<00:01:50.460> make<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.880> other<00:01:51.030> side

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
and I still make it to the other side

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.819 
and I still make it to the other side
even<00:01:51.780> though<00:01:51.869> he<00:01:52.020> destroyed<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.500> about

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
even though he destroyed it about

even though he destroyed it about
halfway<00:01:53.070> through<00:01:53.460> my<00:01:53.520> duration<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.450> what<00:01:54.630> if

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
halfway through my duration but what if

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.569 
halfway through my duration but what if
he<00:01:54.840> destroys<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.290> tunnel<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.009> targeted

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
he destroys a tunnel that I targeted

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.550 
he destroys a tunnel that I targeted
with<00:01:56.759> my<00:01:56.909> ultimate<00:01:57.390> same<00:01:57.869> thing<00:01:58.110> he<00:01:58.320> walks

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
with my ultimate same thing he walks

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.020 
with my ultimate same thing he walks
over<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.950> tunnel<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.520> he<00:01:59.640> does<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.000> I

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
over the tunnel and as he does that I

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.639 
over the tunnel and as he does that I
use<00:02:00.240> my<00:02:00.420> ultimate<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:00.990> tunnel<00:02:01.320> he<00:02:01.350> walked

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
use my ultimate on the tunnel he walked

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.770 
use my ultimate on the tunnel he walked
over<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.250> he<00:02:02.310> destroys<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.119> as<00:02:03.240> I'm<00:02:03.540> still

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
over and he destroys it as I'm still

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
over and he destroys it as I'm still
busy<00:02:03.930> channeling<00:02:04.619> but<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:04.979> doesn't<00:02:05.310> seem<00:02:05.430> like

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
busy channeling but it doesn't seem like

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.249 
busy channeling but it doesn't seem like
it<00:02:05.700> disrupts<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.390> long<00:02:06.600> as<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.899> use<00:02:07.110> it

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
it disrupts it as long as I use it

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.859 
it disrupts it as long as I use it
before<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:07.920> actually<00:02:08.129> destroyed<00:02:08.869> the

movements but just for testing purposes
we<00:02:33.380> also<00:02:33.620> tested<00:02:34.250> it<00:02:34.370> with<00:02:34.490> twitches

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
we also tested it with twitches

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.030 
we also tested it with twitches
invisibility<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.810> I<00:02:36.050> can<00:02:36.200> easily<00:02:36.590> see<00:02:36.830> where

invisibility and I can easily see where

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.220 
invisibility and I can easily see where
he<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.370> even<00:02:37.760> though<00:02:37.880> he's<00:02:38.060> beside<00:02:38.450> me<00:02:38.690> or<00:02:38.870> if

he is even though he's beside me or if

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.810 
he is even though he's beside me or if

he goes into the fog while he's

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.880 
he goes into the fog while he's

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
almost anyone or anything passing

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.110 
almost anyone or anything passing
through<00:02:55.010> it<00:02:55.130> but<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.490> would<00:02:55.640> think<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.850> Rex

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
through it but you would think that Rex

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.520 
through it but you would think that Rex
I<00:02:56.270> would<00:02:56.420> be<00:02:56.510> able<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.750> pass<00:02:57.020> through<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.410> but

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
I would be able to pass through it but

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.620 
I would be able to pass through it but
unfortunately<00:02:58.280> she<00:02:58.310> also<00:02:58.730> cannot<00:02:59.300> even

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
unfortunately she also cannot even

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.360 
unfortunately she also cannot even
though<00:02:59.870> she's<00:03:00.080> going<00:03:00.320> underground<00:03:00.620> but

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
though she's going underground but

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.520 
though she's going underground but
anything<00:03:01.760> is<00:03:01.910> she<00:03:02.390> still<00:03:02.660> ends<00:03:02.930> up<00:03:02.990> making<00:03:03.200> a

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
anything is she still ends up making a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.080 
anything is she still ends up making a
tunnel<00:03:03.860> on<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.070> other<00:03:04.220> side<00:03:04.580> even<00:03:04.940> though<00:03:05.030> she

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
tunnel on the other side even though she

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.640 
tunnel on the other side even though she
technically<00:03:05.630> doesn't<00:03:05.960> actually<00:03:06.200> go<00:03:06.470> there

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
technically doesn't actually go there

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.920 
technically doesn't actually go there
and<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.700> next<00:03:07.910> thing<00:03:08.060> is<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.240> test<00:03:08.600> with<00:03:08.840> her

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
and the next thing is a test with her

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.200 
and the next thing is a test with her
ultimate<00:03:09.470> I<00:03:09.650> use<00:03:09.980> it<00:03:10.100> on<00:03:10.220> a<00:03:10.250> tunnel<00:03:10.610> behind<00:03:10.760> the

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
ultimate I use it on a tunnel behind the

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.030 
ultimate I use it on a tunnel behind the
soldiers<00:03:11.630> of<00:03:11.660> a<00:03:11.870> zeros<00:03:12.170> ultimate<00:03:12.680> but<00:03:12.860> this

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
soldiers of a zeros ultimate but this

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.770 
soldiers of a zeros ultimate but this
time<00:03:13.280> I'm<00:03:13.460> easily<00:03:13.880> able<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.300> pass<00:03:14.540> right

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
time I'm easily able to pass right

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.690 
time I'm easily able to pass right
through<00:03:14.840> them<00:03:15.200> take<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.890> as<00:03:16.070> your<00:03:16.220> soldiers

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
through them take that as your soldiers

and<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.630> final<00:03:17.960> myth<00:03:18.080> is<00:03:18.200> asking<00:03:18.590> can<00:03:18.800> rex<00:03:19.070> i

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
and the final myth is asking can rex i

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.950 
and the final myth is asking can rex i
still<00:03:19.580> get<00:03:19.700> knocked<00:03:19.910> up<00:03:20.120> even<00:03:20.510> while<00:03:20.690> she<00:03:20.900> is

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:20.960 
still get knocked up even while she is

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.350 
still get knocked up even while she is
burrowed<00:03:21.350> so<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.400> wouldn't<00:03:22.580> think<00:03:22.820> the<00:03:22.970> rex<00:03:23.240> i

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
burrowed so you wouldn't think the rex i

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.880 
burrowed so you wouldn't think the rex i
could<00:03:23.540> still<00:03:23.750> be<00:03:23.870> knocked<00:03:24.110> up<00:03:24.260> while<00:03:24.560> she<00:03:24.590> is

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
could still be knocked up while she is

could still be knocked up while she is

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360

tornado<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:27.050> answer<00:03:27.410> is<00:03:27.560> of<00:03:27.710> course<00:03:27.740> that<00:03:28.160> she

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
tornado the answer is of course that she

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.920 
tornado the answer is of course that she
can<00:03:28.520> even<00:03:28.760> though<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.090> would<00:03:29.390> expect<00:03:29.690> it<00:03:29.840> to

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
can even though you would expect it to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.960 
can even though you would expect it to
either<00:03:30.110> not<00:03:30.440> be<00:03:30.590> able<00:03:30.770> to<00:03:30.950> knock<00:03:31.190> her<00:03:31.340> up<00:03:31.520> or<00:03:31.760> it

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
either not be able to knock her up or it

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.760 
either not be able to knock her up or it
does<00:03:32.180> knock<00:03:32.480> her<00:03:32.630> up<00:03:32.840> but<00:03:33.080> then<00:03:33.230> it<00:03:33.320> takes<00:03:33.590> her

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
does knock her up but then it takes her

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.010

out of the world state but knocking her

out of the world state but knocking her
up<00:03:36.170> while<00:03:36.380> she's<00:03:36.620> above<00:03:36.920> ground<00:03:37.190> you<00:03:37.370> can<00:03:37.490> see

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
up while she's above ground you can see

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.100 
up while she's above ground you can see
that<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.850> animation<00:03:38.420> while<00:03:38.660> she's<00:03:38.900> in<00:03:38.930> the

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
that the animation while she's in the

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.870 
that the animation while she's in the
air<00:03:39.290> is<00:03:39.560> completely<00:03:40.070> different<00:03:40.460> and<00:03:40.610> here's

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
air is completely different and here's

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.520 
air is completely different and here's
just<00:03:41.060> a<00:03:41.150> still<00:03:41.390> image<00:03:41.570> of<00:03:41.960> the<00:03:42.080> two<00:03:42.260> different

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
just a still image of the two different

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.040 
just a still image of the two different
na<00:03:42.710> Cubs<00:03:42.980> but<00:03:43.580> just<00:03:43.820> to<00:03:43.940> further<00:03:44.270> tested<00:03:44.840> for<00:03:45.020> a

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
na Cubs but just to further tested for a

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.750 
na Cubs but just to further tested for a
fun<00:03:45.320> we<00:03:45.470> decided<00:03:45.890> to<00:03:46.010> test<00:03:46.220> it<00:03:46.370> with<00:03:46.490> yeah<00:03:46.700> she

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
fun we decided to test it with yeah she

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.760 
fun we decided to test it with yeah she
was<00:03:47.000> ultimate<00:03:47.570> as<00:03:47.660> well<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.200> has<00:03:48.440> he<00:03:48.560> knocks

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
was ultimate as well and has he knocks

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.590 
was ultimate as well and has he knocks
her<00:03:48.950> up<00:03:49.010> in<00:03:49.130> the<00:03:49.160> air<00:03:49.370> you<00:03:49.580> see<00:03:49.760> her<00:03:49.910> animation

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
her up in the air you see her animation

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.360 
her up in the air you see her animation
looks<00:03:50.780> somewhat<00:03:51.320> odd<00:03:51.560> because<00:03:51.920> she's<00:03:52.190> still

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
looks somewhat odd because she's still

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.530 
looks somewhat odd because she's still
in<00:03:52.550> the<00:03:52.610> animation<00:03:53.000> of<00:03:53.240> her<00:03:53.360> being

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
in the animation of her being

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.270 
in the animation of her being
underground<00:03:53.840> but<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.530> answer<00:03:54.830> is<00:03:54.980> that<00:03:55.070> she

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
underground but the answer is that she

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.580 
underground but the answer is that she
can<00:03:55.520> be<00:03:55.700> knocked<00:03:55.850> up<00:03:56.090> alright<00:03:57.050> guys<00:03:57.200> hope<00:03:57.470> you
