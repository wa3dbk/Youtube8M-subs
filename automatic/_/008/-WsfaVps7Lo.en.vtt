how to play in the wind and I hope you

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.600 
how to play in the wind and I hope you
can<00:00:07.200> see<00:00:07.379> that<00:00:07.529> my<00:00:07.649> hair<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.890> blowing<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.490> my

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.580 
can see that my hair is blowing and my
shirt<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.000> billowing<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.570> truly<00:00:10.410> there's

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
shirt is billowing and truly there's

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.379 
shirt is billowing and truly there's
many<00:00:10.800> difficulties<00:00:11.550> when<00:00:11.790> playing<00:00:12.150> in<00:00:12.300> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
many difficulties when playing in the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.870 
many difficulties when playing in the
wind<00:00:12.599> but<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.019> think<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.559> most<00:00:14.190> important

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
wind but I think the most important

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.320 
wind but I think the most important
thing<00:00:15.179> about<00:00:16.080> windy<00:00:17.010> days<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.550> most<00:00:18.090> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
thing about windy days is that most of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.779 
thing about windy days is that most of
your<00:00:18.449> opponents<00:00:18.960> hate<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.710> stuff<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.310> if

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
your opponents hate this stuff and if

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.509 
your opponents hate this stuff and if
you<00:00:20.910> can<00:00:21.060> develop<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.660> facility<00:00:22.560> if<00:00:22.710> not<00:00:22.920> look

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
you can develop a facility if not look

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:24.980 
you can develop a facility if not look
forward<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.090> playing<00:00:24.300> in<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.570> wind

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
forward to playing in the wind

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.259 
forward to playing in the wind
you<00:00:25.350> can<00:00:25.500> beat<00:00:25.680> people<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.730> might<00:00:26.910> never

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
you can beat people you might never

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.630 
you can beat people you might never
otherwise<00:00:27.510> beat<00:00:28.199> there's<00:00:28.890> an<00:00:29.039> art<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> playing

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
otherwise beat there's an art to playing

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.490 
otherwise beat there's an art to playing
in<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.880> wind<00:00:30.060> there's<00:00:30.810> some<00:00:31.050> science<00:00:31.439> to

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
in the wind there's some science to

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
in the wind there's some science to
playing<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.009> wind<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:32.940> really<00:00:33.210> there<00:00:33.360> is

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
playing in the wind but really there is

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.720 
playing in the wind but really there is
psychology<00:00:34.230> when<00:00:34.739> playing<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.280> wind<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
psychology when playing in the wind and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.540 
psychology when playing in the wind and
the<00:00:36.360> first<00:00:36.600> one<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.110> will<00:00:37.800> sometimes<00:00:38.309> do

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
the first one that I will sometimes do

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.850 
the first one that I will sometimes do
is<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> changeover<00:00:39.930> in<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.290> warm-up<00:00:40.710> say

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
is on a changeover in the warm-up say

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.010 
is on a changeover in the warm-up say
something<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.219> man<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.180> windy<00:00:42.420> today<00:00:42.809> I

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
you really have to read the wind and I

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.060 
you really have to read the wind and I
mean<00:00:56.550> really<00:00:57.329> read<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.770> could<00:00:59.039> be

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
across the court and in some instances

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.230 
across the court and in some instances
after<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.809> while<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.199> changes<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.939> wind<00:01:06.150> is

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
after a while it changes but the wind is

your<00:01:06.420> friend<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.930> you'll<00:01:07.200> use<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.650> now<00:01:08.159> based

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
your friend if you'll use it now based

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.039 
your friend if you'll use it now based
on<00:01:08.610> how<00:01:08.760> my<00:01:08.909> shirt<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.330> hair<00:01:09.510> are<00:01:09.600> moving<00:01:09.900> I

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
on how my shirt and hair are moving I

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.000 
on how my shirt and hair are moving I
feel<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> wind<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.850> way<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:13.010> there's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
feel the wind going this way so there's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.429 
feel the wind going this way so there's
a<00:01:14.100> whole<00:01:14.369> series<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.210> shots<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.900> want<00:01:16.320> to

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
a whole series of shots I want to

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.520 
a whole series of shots I want to
consider<00:01:16.880> example<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.090> no<00:01:18.810> way<00:01:19.020> do<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.200> want<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
consider example one no way do I want to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.740 
consider example one no way do I want to
play<00:01:19.680> down<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.070> line<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:20.820> one's<00:01:21.630> going

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
play down the line now that one's going

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.179 
play down the line now that one's going
to<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.990> wide<00:01:23.659> cross-court<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.290> makes<00:01:25.560> sense

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
to go wide cross-court that makes sense

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.240 
to go wide cross-court that makes sense
we're<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> other<00:01:27.450> corner<00:01:28.040> floaters<00:01:29.040> make

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
we're on the other corner floaters make

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.399 
we're on the other corner floaters make
sense<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:30.360> really<00:01:30.689> what<00:01:30.840> you're<00:01:30.960> gonna<00:01:31.110> find

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
sense but really what you're gonna find

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.340 
sense but really what you're gonna find
is<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.520> hit<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> ball<00:01:32.970> firm<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
is this if you hit the ball firm the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.010 
is this if you hit the ball firm the
ball<00:01:34.560> tends<00:01:34.860> more<00:01:35.040> often<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.670> fly<00:01:35.939> true<00:01:36.720> and

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
ball tends more often to fly true and

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.530 
ball tends more often to fly true and
that<00:01:37.979> minimizes<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.909> effect<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.390> wind

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
that minimizes the effect of the wind

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.480 
that minimizes the effect of the wind
and<00:01:39.840> so<00:01:40.439> if<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.710> were<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.979> play<00:01:41.220> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
and so if you were going to play a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.520 
and so if you were going to play a
pusher<00:01:42.150> which<00:01:42.659> we've<00:01:42.840> been<00:01:43.079> discussing

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
pusher which we've been discussing

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
pusher which we've been discussing
recently<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.520> windy<00:01:45.180> day<00:01:45.210> ie<00:01:46.880> that<00:01:47.880> player

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
recently on a windy day ie that player

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.600 
recently on a windy day ie that player
really<00:01:48.750> has<00:01:48.930> skill<00:01:49.290> because<00:01:49.619> one<00:01:49.860> they<00:01:50.490> don't

really has skill because one they don't
ever<00:01:50.790> want<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.119> miss<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.600> two<00:01:52.110> they<00:01:52.259> hit<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
ever want to miss and two they hit the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.280 
ever want to miss and two they hit the
ball<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:52.799> darn<00:01:53.009> slow<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.880> wind<00:01:54.140> favors<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
ball so darn slow the wind favors it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.090 
ball so darn slow the wind favors it
moves<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.490> your<00:01:57.090> task<00:01:57.469> first<00:01:58.469> when<00:01:58.829> reading

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
moves it so your task first when reading

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.950 
moves it so your task first when reading
the<00:01:59.340> wind<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.759> then<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.420> create<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.719> whole

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the wind is then to create a whole

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.859 
the wind is then to create a whole
series<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.500> shots<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.920> use<00:02:02.219> with<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.119> wind<00:02:03.329> now

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
series of shots to use with the wind now

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.190 
series of shots to use with the wind now
there's<00:02:04.079> more<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.399> a

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
there's more so this is a

there's more so this is a

the wind and actually as a sophomore in

windiest day ever in Chico but there are

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.650 
windiest day ever in Chico but there are
particular<00:02:34.070> styles<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.220> play<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.760> technique

that<00:02:37.230> will<00:02:37.410> favor<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.860> wind<00:02:38.100> player<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.670> it

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
that will favor a wind player and it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.940 
that will favor a wind player and it
could<00:02:38.970> be<00:02:39.120> perhaps<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:40.080> my<00:02:40.260> own<00:02:40.440> game<00:02:40.740> is

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
could be perhaps that my own game is

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.010 
could be perhaps that my own game is
suited<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.430> I'll<00:02:42.209> discuss<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.959> a

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
suited to that I'll discuss this in a

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.590 
suited to that I'll discuss this in a
moment<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:43.830> it's<00:02:43.950> really<00:02:44.250> saying<00:02:44.600> capture

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
moment but it's really saying capture

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.430 
moment but it's really saying capture
winds<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.550> windy<00:02:47.550> day<00:02:47.870> find<00:02:48.870> an<00:02:48.990> opponent

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
winds on a windy day find an opponent

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.199 
winds on a windy day find an opponent
that's<00:02:50.180> disoriented<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.680> magnify<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.739> so<00:02:53.209> the

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that's disoriented and magnify it so the

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.540 
that's disoriented and magnify it so the
simplest<00:02:54.600> approach<00:02:54.989> I<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.380> give<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.709> has<00:02:56.340> to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
simplest approach I can give you has to

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.050 
simplest approach I can give you has to
do<00:02:56.670> with<00:02:56.880> how<00:02:57.480> to<00:02:57.540> adjust<00:02:57.739> for<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:59.060> slow-moving

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
do with how to adjust for a slow-moving

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.210 
do with how to adjust for a slow-moving
ball<00:03:00.480> that's<00:03:00.750> caught<00:03:00.989> by<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.230> wind<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.770> the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
ball that's caught by the wind and the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.420 
ball that's caught by the wind and the
trick<00:03:02.459> is<00:03:02.700> can<00:03:03.270> you<00:03:03.450> keep<00:03:03.690> your<00:03:03.900> feet<00:03:04.140> moving

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
trick is can you keep your feet moving

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.420 
trick is can you keep your feet moving
can<00:03:05.430> you<00:03:05.610> wait<00:03:05.940> for<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.330> ball<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:07.280> can<00:03:08.280> you

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
can you wait for the ball and can you

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.280 
can you wait for the ball and can you
minimize<00:03:09.000> the<00:03:09.239> length<00:03:09.450> of<00:03:09.630> your<00:03:09.780> stroke<00:03:10.110> and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
minimize the length of your stroke and

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.280 
minimize the length of your stroke and
here's<00:03:10.590> why<00:03:10.800> players<00:03:11.790> that<00:03:12.150> prepare<00:03:12.660> for

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
here's why players that prepare for

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.310 
here's why players that prepare for
massive<00:03:13.739> power<00:03:14.430> shots<00:03:14.910> if<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.690> wind<00:03:15.900> catches

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
massive power shots if the wind catches

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.310 
massive power shots if the wind catches
the<00:03:16.470> ball<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:17.220> very<00:03:17.489> difficult<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.150> adjust<00:03:18.720> a

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
the ball it's very difficult to adjust a

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.320 
the ball it's very difficult to adjust a
stroke<00:03:19.650> whereas<00:03:20.519> if<00:03:20.700> you're<00:03:20.850> playing<00:03:21.150> with

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
stroke whereas if you're playing with

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.810 
stroke whereas if you're playing with
shorter<00:03:21.870> strokes<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.530> more<00:03:23.280> footwork

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
shorter strokes and more footwork

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.180 
shorter strokes and more footwork
if<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.600> ball<00:03:24.780> at<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.019> last<00:03:25.230> minute<00:03:25.560> moves<00:03:25.799> I

if the ball at the last minute moves I

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.300 
if the ball at the last minute moves I
can<00:03:26.549> move<00:03:26.970> too<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:27.959> moved<00:03:28.170> again<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.739> can

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
can move too if it moved again I can

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.100 
can move too if it moved again I can
move<00:03:29.519> but<00:03:30.209> as<00:03:30.360> I<00:03:30.510> know<00:03:30.570> it

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
move but as I know it

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.620 
move but as I know it
wind<00:03:31.980> favours<00:03:32.670> players<00:03:32.970> with<00:03:33.239> shorter

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
wind favours players with shorter

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.100

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
high this should be obvious but it

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.729 
high this should be obvious but it
really<00:03:42.540> seems<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:43.019> me<00:03:43.140> that<00:03:43.320> many<00:03:43.470> players

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
really seems to me that many players

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.759 
really seems to me that many players
could<00:03:43.980> actually<00:03:44.160> develop<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:45.180> serves<00:03:45.510> a<00:03:45.900> high

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
could actually develop to serves a high

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.560 
could actually develop to serves a high
toss<00:03:47.040> if<00:03:47.340> they're<00:03:47.580> comfortable<00:03:48.090> or<00:03:48.209> indoors

but<00:03:49.200> a<00:03:49.260> lower<00:03:49.470> toss<00:03:49.769> in<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.100> wind<00:03:50.280> and<00:03:50.489> I<00:03:50.549> think

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
but a lower toss in the wind and I think

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.970 
but a lower toss in the wind and I think
that<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.180> don't<00:03:51.870> have<00:03:52.019> the<00:03:52.200> stats<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.620> find

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
that I don't have the stats to find

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.640 
that I don't have the stats to find
Steffi<00:03:53.910> Graf<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.360> how<00:03:54.450> higher<00:03:54.720> toss<00:03:55.080> is<00:03:55.350> but<00:03:55.620> I

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
Steffi Graf and how higher toss is but I

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.030 
Steffi Graf and how higher toss is but I
would<00:03:55.920> be<00:03:56.070> sure<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:57.150> Safina<00:03:57.660> or<00:03:58.230> Sharapova

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
would be sure that Safina or Sharapova

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.860 
would be sure that Safina or Sharapova
playing<00:03:59.640> on<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.820> windy<00:04:00.180> day<00:04:00.209> those<00:04:00.570> double

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
playing on a windy day those double

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.570 
playing on a windy day those double
faults<00:04:01.140> would<00:04:01.290> even<00:04:01.530> go<00:04:01.680> higher<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.489> higher

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
faults would even go higher and higher

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.600 
faults would even go higher and higher
yet<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.600> my<00:04:03.780> advice<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.140> you<00:04:04.380> one<00:04:05.160> is<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.489> learn

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
yet so my advice to you one is to learn

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.390 
yet so my advice to you one is to learn
to<00:04:05.790> love<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.150> wind<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.600> two<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:08.220> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
to love the wind and two that the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.610 
to love the wind and two that the
mechanics<00:04:08.880> of<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.120> wind<00:04:09.330> are<00:04:09.630> less<00:04:10.290> power

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
mechanics of the wind are less power

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.520 
mechanics of the wind are less power
less<00:04:11.519> racket<00:04:12.480> back<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:13.019> much<00:04:13.709> much<00:04:14.660> much<00:04:15.660> much

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
less racket back and much much much much

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.240 
less racket back and much much much much
more<00:04:17.459> footwork<00:04:18.530> tennis<00:04:19.530> doesn't<00:04:19.950> always<00:04:20.040> have

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
more footwork tennis doesn't always have

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.370 
more footwork tennis doesn't always have
to<00:04:20.310> be<00:04:20.400> about<00:04:20.579> power<00:04:20.940> it's<00:04:21.269> about<00:04:21.630> minimizing

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
to be about power it's about minimizing

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.100 
to be about power it's about minimizing
errors<00:04:22.710> the<00:04:23.250> wind<00:04:23.490> can<00:04:23.789> help<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.270> minimize

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
errors the wind can help you minimize

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.640 
errors the wind can help you minimize
errors<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.710> you<00:04:26.130> believe<00:04:26.460> it
