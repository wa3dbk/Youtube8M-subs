applicable<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.439> only<00:00:22.580> trilogy<00:00:23.580> some<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.029> these

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
applicable to only trilogy some of these

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.339 
applicable to only trilogy some of these
are<00:00:24.330> only<00:00:25.140> unknown<00:00:25.529> fiction<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.400> mean<00:00:27.349> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
are only unknown fiction but I mean the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.519 
are only unknown fiction but I mean the
most<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.130> them<00:00:29.220> overlap<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.090> let's<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.260> go

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
most of them overlap so let's just go

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.860 
most of them overlap so let's just go
the<00:00:31.920> first<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.790> probably<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.719> most

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
the first one and probably the most

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.290 
the first one and probably the most
common<00:00:34.110> one<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:35.280> love<00:00:35.790> triangle<00:00:37.489> yes<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
common one is a love triangle yes the

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.670 
common one is a love triangle yes the
love<00:00:39.570> triangle<00:00:40.489> Edward<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:42.030> Jacob<00:00:42.420> Peeta<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680

love triangle Edward and Jacob Peeta and
Gale<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.910> love<00:00:45.090> triangle<00:00:45.539> is<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.469> huge

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
Gale the love triangle is really a huge

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.869 
Gale the love triangle is really a huge
thing<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.579> most<00:00:48.120> books<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.789> some<00:00:50.789> of

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
thing it's in most books and some of

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.850 
thing it's in most books and some of
them<00:00:51.059> are<00:00:51.180> more<00:00:51.300> obvious<00:00:51.809> than<00:00:51.960> others<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.559> it

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
them are more obvious than others but it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.580 
them are more obvious than others but it
is<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.370> most<00:00:54.210> everything<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:55.230> thing<00:00:55.410> that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
is in most everything one thing that

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.650 
is in most everything one thing that
goes<00:00:55.710> along<00:00:56.129> with<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.640> knowing<00:00:57.390> who<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
goes along with that is knowing who the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.420 
goes along with that is knowing who the
main<00:00:57.809> character<00:00:58.170> ends<00:00:58.469> up<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.829> some<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.309> them

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
main character ends up with some of them

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.029 
main character ends up with some of them
it's<00:00:59.579> really<00:00:59.760> not<00:01:00.030> obvious<00:01:00.559> like<00:01:01.559> there's<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
it's really not obvious like there's a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.950 
it's really not obvious like there's a
some<00:01:02.940> hints<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.270> our<00:01:03.449> date<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.809> might

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
some hints to our date and you might

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.899 
some hints to our date and you might
think<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.439> would<00:01:04.650> be<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.250> person<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:05.790> then

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
think it would be that person but then

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.760 
think it would be that person but then
it's<00:01:06.060> not<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.960> most<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.260> them<00:01:07.409> it's<00:01:07.590> pretty

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
it's not but most of them it's pretty

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.200 
it's not but most of them it's pretty
obvious<00:01:08.250> who<00:01:08.369> they're<00:01:08.520> gonna<00:01:08.580> end<00:01:08.880> up<00:01:09.000> with

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
obvious who they're gonna end up with

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.640 
obvious who they're gonna end up with
even<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.900> straight<00:01:10.290> from<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.560> beginning

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
even like straight from the beginning

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.500 
even like straight from the beginning
and<00:01:11.040> another<00:01:11.310> one<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.700> leaving<00:01:11.939> home<00:01:12.360> and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.720 
but usually it's in the last book and
there<00:03:17.470> have<00:03:17.739> been<00:03:17.769> series<00:03:18.220> that<00:03:18.340> don't<00:03:18.519> fit

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
there have been series that don't fit

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.930 
there have been series that don't fit
this<00:03:18.880> at<00:03:19.150> all<00:03:19.330> like<00:03:20.019> these<00:03:20.680> two<00:03:20.980> books<00:03:21.190> the

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
this at all like these two books the

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.610 
this at all like these two books the
second<00:03:22.330> book<00:03:22.480> had<00:03:22.660> epilogue<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.440> third

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
second book had epilogue and the third

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.009 
second book had epilogue and the third
would<00:03:23.739> be<00:03:23.799> not<00:03:25.590> but<00:03:26.590> epilogues<00:03:27.489> are<00:03:28.019> sometimes

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
would be not but epilogues are sometimes

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.000 
would be not but epilogues are sometimes
like<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.230> loves<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.560> sometimes<00:03:29.860> I<00:03:29.950> don't

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
like it loves that sometimes I don't

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.949 
like it loves that sometimes I don't
because<00:03:30.459> sometimes<00:03:30.880> it<00:03:31.120> really<00:03:31.299> is<00:03:31.450> helpful

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
because sometimes it really is helpful

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.900 
because sometimes it really is helpful
and<00:03:32.140> it's<00:03:32.320> like<00:03:32.560> ten<00:03:33.040> years<00:03:33.190> later<00:03:33.489> and<00:03:33.820> it

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
and it's like ten years later and it

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:35.250 
and it's like ten years later and it
kind<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.150> gives<00:03:34.330> you<00:03:34.480> a<00:03:34.510> glimpse<00:03:34.780> into<00:03:35.080> the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
kind of gives you a glimpse into the
