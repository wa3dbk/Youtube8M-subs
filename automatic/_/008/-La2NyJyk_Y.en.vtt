00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 Our state is characterized by having 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.109
 an arid semi-desert climate and the greatest 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.210
 amount of littorals in mexico is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.190
 I could think that this destination is little 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.019
 fertile but still in these conditions 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.299
 climatological there are places 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.279
 sustainable we are in the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.170
 Rancho San Diego located about 29 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.480
 kilometers from the city of peace with 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.949
 course to all saints this is the first 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.670
 red deer hatchery on low 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.560
 southern california 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.750
 with jesus cotta is a rancher 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.200
 Californian who ventured into the 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.300
 raising of the bus being the apus or servant 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.670
 red the red deer is a mammal 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.530
 originally from New Zealand for his 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.180
 characteristics of adaptability to 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.400
 different climates and its fast 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.970
 growth is one of the species for 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.370
 breeding par excellence this project already 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.730
 is four years old and initially there 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.730
 many 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:00.070
 Appearances that vary before time 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:02.440
 vary some dead x details that 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.940
 present when when when 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.520
 animals are not adapted and 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.520
 logically then a low population and 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.750
 now the previous one no longer national 80 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.360
 percent 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.369
 we already have about 75 animals maybe 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.170
 the red deer or red deer is a 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.580
 species that can develop around 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:27.550
 of 60 kilos in approximately 14 months 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.280
 to start the project they got a 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.009
 50 and 50 support the government 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.500
 state and federal this consisted of three 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.780
 pairs of animals for breeding and 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.610
 infrastructure says that in time of 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.560
 drought is difficult to carry out the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.520
 sowing of pasture 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.039
 so locked 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.259
 this the case that for example right now 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.750
 As it has not rained, they are coming down 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.600
 the waters and if by the well is 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.820
 resenting the fall of water with Jesus 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.909
 he raises every day to feed his 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.319
 animals and work the field they handle a 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.659
 irrigation system by means of the 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.240
 water extraction with mantle pumps 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.250
 underground aquifers the goal of in 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.190
 this sense here is that you have to 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.780
 produce the pasture to keep your 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:17.150
 clear animal does not produce it is at 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.690
 100% true because it is impossible but if 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.700
 in a 60 to 80 percent 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.180
 I rarely call another ranch's hand with 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.480
 alfalfa this in the case of 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.670
 positioned concentrates we have to 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.680
 buy it although our desire is 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.660
 make 90% what are the 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.280
 concentrated the purpose of this 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.579
 company is to obtain the meat of the animal 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.260
 produced for sale comments that 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.930
 receives visits from children who come from 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.989
 State schools and tourists says 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:51.120
 it is a great satisfaction for him to be the 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.640
 only producer of red deer in low
