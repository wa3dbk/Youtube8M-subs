this<00:01:33.189> was<00:01:33.399> $17.99<00:01:34.149> and<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:35.530> was<00:01:35.740> $17.99

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
this was $17.99 and this was $17.99

this was $17.99 and this was $17.99
which<00:01:37.270> both<00:01:37.569> are<00:01:37.720> pretty<00:01:37.840> expensive<00:01:38.259> for<00:01:39.250> what

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
which both are pretty expensive for what

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.059 
which both are pretty expensive for what
they<00:01:39.549> are<00:01:39.729> but<00:01:40.450> they're<00:01:40.840> good<00:01:41.500> dupes<00:01:41.799> for

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
they are but they're good dupes for

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.730 
they are but they're good dupes for
high-end<00:01:42.929> foundations<00:01:43.929> if<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.380> don't<00:01:44.590> want

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
high-end foundations if you don't want

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.279 
high-end foundations if you don't want
to<00:01:44.799> splurge<00:01:45.009> on<00:01:45.250> high-end<00:01:45.569> one<00:01:46.569> of<00:01:46.719> these<00:01:46.840> will

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
to splurge on high-end one of these will

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.370 
to splurge on high-end one of these will
go<00:01:47.950> really<00:01:48.099> well<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:49.450> hard<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.929> color<00:01:50.170> match

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
go really well it's hard to color match

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.779 
go really well it's hard to color match
because<00:01:50.799> it<00:01:50.950> is<00:01:51.069> drugstore<00:01:51.459> and<00:01:51.549> they<00:01:51.610> don't

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
because it is drugstore and they don't

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:52.800

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
wish you had a pump or something just to

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:54.720 
wish you had a pump or something just to
make<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.590> easier<00:02:53.950> because<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.190> have<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.430> pour

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730
