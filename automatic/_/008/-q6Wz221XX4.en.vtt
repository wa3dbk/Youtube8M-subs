and they just want to get a good

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.899 
and they just want to get a good
commuter<00:02:09.530> bike<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.039> they<00:02:10.159> get<00:02:10.310> excited<00:02:10.640> about

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
commuter bike and they get excited about

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.149 
commuter bike and they get excited about
the<00:02:11.269> whole<00:02:11.420> design<00:02:11.840> process<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.709> they<00:02:12.950> learn

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
the whole design process and they learn

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.690 
the whole design process and they learn
a<00:02:13.190> lot<00:02:13.519> about<00:02:13.760> their<00:02:14.480> bike<00:02:14.780> as<00:02:15.140> we<00:02:16.130> build<00:02:16.459> it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
a lot about their bike as we build it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.090 
a lot about their bike as we build it
and<00:02:16.970> my<00:02:17.630> philosophy<00:02:17.840> is<00:02:18.470> if<00:02:18.500> they're<00:02:18.890> that

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
and my philosophy is if they're that

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.040 
and my philosophy is if they're that
involved<00:02:19.730> in<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:20.000> build<00:02:20.209> process

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
involved in the build process

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.690 
involved in the build process
they're<00:02:21.500> gonna<00:02:21.620> be<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.130> much<00:02:22.340> more

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
they're gonna be that much more

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.600 
they're gonna be that much more
committed<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.450> riding<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.190> typical

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
committed to riding it and the typical

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.500 
committed to riding it and the typical
build<00:02:26.030> on<00:02:26.300> one<00:02:26.570> is<00:02:27.400> fenders<00:02:28.400> upright<00:02:29.330> riding

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
build on one is fenders upright riding

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.640 
build on one is fenders upright riding
position<00:02:30.730> kickstand<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.780> rack<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.470> some
