00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.470
 hello everyone good is ego mantis people 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.330
 we already know that samuel from the beginning 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.689
 I told you many things many words 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.189
 many phrases is very interesting and 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.730
 that as time has gone by 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:34.090
 we have been realizing that those 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:38.200
 phrases those words were taking shape 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:41.590
 and not making sense 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.610
 and now with alistair of berlin the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.830
 words of vÃ­ctor and samuel becoming 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:52.440
 with blue eyes we have understood 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:55.480
 even more history and as soon as they are 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.200
 involved and well in all that good 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:02.380
 Well now I want you to remember a 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.739
 phrase that said when improving the weapon in 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.739
 behind 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.450
 but no 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.760
 in the arch 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.360
 they came and I piro 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.410
 and looking and I looked affinity 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.590
 communication really good after 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.990
 live this there are people who keep thinking 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.920
 that's just plain nonsense like 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.920
 filling of voices 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.040
 it is not possible that it has meaning 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.230
 some good then I from that point of 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.620
 view 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.940
 and as I've analyzed it and so many and 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.430
 I heard many times 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.210
 I believe that this can already have 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.479
 sense 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.979
 because it says about the virus because I'm going to 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:58.860
 say because I think I think that it 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:02.250
 referred to as big foot to droid 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.710
 that there is in the whole game that has those 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.450
 dimensions that is so big and that 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.810
 have such a big foot 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.520
 I think it's spoiler 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.020
 I've listened again and look 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.319
 your 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.170
 looking 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.460
 but on the way 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.870
 and today I piro 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:33.670
 and looking and watching communications 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:36.780
 really clear there was communication but 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.540
 not by voices but by gestures 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.880
 like the characters with leroy but what 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.620
 most important of all this and that is what 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:50.920
 I want you to understand is that samuel already 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.560
 he knew the hero since he already knew him in 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.209
 sometime 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.910
 and that phrase in trans and improving the weapon 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.459
 I was already making you see but of course 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:06.270
 we could not see it until the 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.340
 time and things were not discovered 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.730
 they met yesterday 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.110
 what importance in android in all this 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.660
 history 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.290
 what did leroy do and what 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.290
 contributed 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.800
 in which he contributed to read today in the 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.730
 history 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.170
 I believe that leroy is more important than 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.610
 what we think 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.610
 until the next video
