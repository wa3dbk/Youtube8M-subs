00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.109
 good is one of two still did not live new 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.899
 news so that everyone 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:08.790
 we are angry and it is not for less 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.820
 basically the hollywood actress 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.220
 holly marie combs as she said no more 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.060
 not least the following on twitter as 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:18.300
 I say it has created enough 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.680
 controversy and different news in the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.260
 world of video games and it's not for 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.449
 less basically because it says something like that in 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.680
 this tweet does not basically say take 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.320
 notes the creators of videogames 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:32.489
 violent and that in the end says that the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.910
 violence leads to violence 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:38.970
 virtual leads to real violence something 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.950
 totally stupid really is that it is 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.200
 stupid is something that has not yet been 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.910
 proved neither will be able to demonstrate 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.579
 something that is totally a bullshit 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.519
 huge 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.320
 because there are really many people 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.390
 as much as they play video games 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.339
 violent people do not really go out there 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.799
 killing people or hitting punches to 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:00.229
 other people not even beating up 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.909
 the others nor anything we could say that 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.549
 one of the violent video games by 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.520
 Excellence has been very sold gta 5 and 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.409
 not for that reason we have seen another wave 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.119
 great of murders himself seen a 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.770
 greatest surge of violence or anything 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.509
 like that, not because they're sold 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.759
 many call of duty if we go out there 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:17.990
 hitting shots or anything like that 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.759
 truth is that these issues already begin to 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.679
 tired is not something that we all know 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.360
 which is totally false but it seems to be 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:25.850
 that there are people who keep working 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.500
 in this kind of nonsense if the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.140
 virtual violence according to this person 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.360
 violence leads to real violence 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.789
 in those in the world of cinema because it must 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.470
 lead to super mega mega violence 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.990
 real not because the movies are more 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.049
 realistic than video games so no 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.390
 I know I do not know what to think I do not know if this is already going 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.830
 being a ploy to recreate the 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.229
 market video games because they are a 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.179
 competition even larger than the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.010
 music and the cinema and that's why you have to 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.690
 withdraw some way 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.940
 this type of attacks because it seems that 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.500
 they try to get it from some kind of 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.230
 way and I believe since you start to see 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.650
 here something quite strange of shone 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.810
 it smells pretty bad or suffered this kind of 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.210
 people who are so famous suffer 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.190
 some kind of mental deficiency because 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.050
 it really is that it seems assuring 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.330
 this kind of thing or some conspiracy 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.440
 really against you the videogames 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.570
 no and in the first one I use the word 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.280
 conspiracy because it is already 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.710
 all this kind of thing is that 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.920
 already to freak already smells bad and sings badly 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.810
 or they are stupid or conspire against 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.270
 videogames one of two we go and I stay 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.390
 almost with the first one that are stupid like that 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.910
 of course I say try to follow it the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:37.160
 Ola tries to follow the wave of the 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.450
 events you know that yesterday 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.090
 we had news that the crimes 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.530
 of santa barbara because they had been 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.720
 linked with gold warcraft 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.720
 so nothing to say what 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.519
 you have to follow a little what is fashion 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.340
 and also say that what he left was a 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:58.489
 violent if you do not fall behind so 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.890
 this is nothing more kids are already flipante 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.359
 I have the eggs and everything so nothing 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.840
 see you in the next video will be 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.840
 because our
