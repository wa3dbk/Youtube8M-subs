00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
them to get nice and coated and we are

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.990 
them to get nice and coated and we are
done<00:05:15.199> it's<00:05:15.650> thickened<00:05:16.130> up<00:05:16.250> our<00:05:16.490> chicken<00:05:16.789> is

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
done it's thickened up our chicken is

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.450 
done it's thickened up our chicken is
beautifully<00:05:17.510> coated<00:05:17.750> in<00:05:18.020> it<00:05:18.110> we're<00:05:18.740> warming

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
beautifully coated in it we're warming

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.629 
beautifully coated in it we're warming
through<00:05:19.850> our<00:05:20.389> chicken<00:05:21.199> once<00:05:21.440> more<00:05:21.740> so<00:05:22.250> all<00:05:22.490> we

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
through our chicken once more so all we

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:33.879 
through our chicken once more so all we
have<00:05:22.789> to<00:05:22.910> do<00:05:23.060> is<00:05:23.380> plate<00:05:24.380> this<00:05:24.949> bad<00:05:25.310> boy<00:05:25.580> up

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.210 

so<00:05:34.889> orange<00:05:35.610> chicken<00:05:36.180> this<00:05:36.600> is<00:05:36.750> similar<00:05:37.020> to

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
so orange chicken this is similar to

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.250 
so orange chicken this is similar to
what<00:05:38.220> you<00:05:38.280> would<00:05:38.460> find<00:05:38.520> at<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.180> Panda<00:05:39.450> Express<00:05:39.660> I

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
what you would find at a Panda Express I

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.600 
what you would find at a Panda Express I
don't<00:05:40.860> think<00:05:41.010> we<00:05:41.100> have<00:05:41.250> them<00:05:41.400> here<00:05:41.580> in

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
don't think we have them here in

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.450 
don't think we have them here in
Australia<00:05:42.560> but<00:05:43.560> this<00:05:43.710> would<00:05:43.860> be<00:05:44.010> similar<00:05:44.430> to

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
Australia but this would be similar to

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.280 
Australia but this would be similar to
what<00:05:44.730> you<00:05:44.820> would<00:05:44.910> find<00:05:45.150> there<00:05:45.419> and<00:05:45.660> you<00:05:46.139> would

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:48.110 
what you would find there and you would
serve<00:05:46.500> this<00:05:46.620> up<00:05:46.770> with<00:05:46.950> some<00:05:47.160> obviously<00:05:48.060> some

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
serve this up with some obviously some

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.690 
serve this up with some obviously some
rice<00:05:49.040> you<00:05:50.040> could<00:05:50.160> serve<00:05:50.370> it<00:05:50.430> up<00:05:50.520> with<00:05:50.580> some

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700 
rice you could serve it up with some

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.670 
rice you could serve it up with some
noodles<00:05:51.150> if<00:05:51.240> you<00:05:51.330> wanted<00:05:51.510> to<00:05:51.630> I've<00:05:51.900> also<00:05:52.350> just
