how to do it and I mean I don't think

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.189 
how to do it and I mean I don't think
that<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.660> mean<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.930> kind<00:00:55.079> of

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
that you can do I mean that kind of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.020 
that you can do I mean that kind of
tried<00:00:55.410> unless<00:00:56.070> your<00:00:56.280> honor<00:00:56.399> pretty<00:00:56.940> high

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030

sensitivity<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.170> guy<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.440> completely

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
sensitivity of the guy just completely

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.450 
sensitivity of the guy just completely
oblivious<00:00:59.270> but<00:01:00.270> um<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:01.079> mean<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:02.160> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
oblivious but um I mean I think that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.830 
oblivious but um I mean I think that
they<00:01:02.550> can<00:01:02.609> get<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.059> out<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.449> lot<00:01:03.780> of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
they can get you out of a lot of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.899 
they can get you out of a lot of

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
I don't know some people I guess it is

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
but if you really want to practice a

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.200 
but if you really want to practice a
skill<00:01:28.979> i<00:01:29.009> said<00:01:29.369> i<00:01:29.579> suggest<00:01:29.909> that<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:30.180> to

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
skill i said i suggest that you go to

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.580 
skill i said i suggest that you go to
run<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> food<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.409> I'm<00:01:31.740> right<00:01:32.490> there<00:01:32.520> they<00:01:33.000> just

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
run a food and I'm right there they just

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.260 
run a food and I'm right there they just
spawn<00:01:34.590> right<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.159> our<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.640> what<00:01:35.790> i<00:01:35.820> realize<00:01:36.240> is

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
spawn right at our and what i realize is

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.859 
spawn right at our and what i realize is
that<00:01:36.570> when<00:01:37.470> you're<00:01:37.710> in<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.220> game<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:39.270> two

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
that when you're in a game with two

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.260 
that when you're in a game with two
different<00:01:40.079> bases<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.799> mean<00:01:41.340> obviously<00:01:41.640> in

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
different bases I mean obviously in

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.069 
different bases I mean obviously in
chemical<00:01:42.689> red<00:01:43.259> spawns<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:44.640> um<00:01:44.939> tower<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.049> I

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
chemical red spawns that um tower and I

going down there like from the start of
a<00:05:08.840> game<00:05:09.050> I<00:05:09.199> don't<00:05:09.320> think<00:05:09.349> it's<00:05:09.560> ever<00:05:09.710> a<00:05:10.039> reason

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
a game I don't think it's ever a reason

a game I don't think it's ever a reason
to<00:05:10.760> quit<00:05:11.000> I<00:05:11.180> mean<00:05:11.360> it's<00:05:11.510> just<00:05:11.570> a<00:05:11.720> start<00:05:11.960> of<00:05:12.020> a

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
to quit I mean it's just a start of a

I pick them up a DMR I want helical one
shot<00:05:23.570> and<00:05:23.720> I<00:05:24.020> didn't<00:05:24.229> even<00:05:24.289> realize<00:05:24.500> that<00:05:24.919> so

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
shot and I didn't even realize that so

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.990 
shot and I didn't even realize that so
this<00:05:26.599> guy<00:05:26.870> is<00:05:27.320> right<00:05:27.770> there<00:05:28.039> snapping<00:05:28.699> through

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
this guy is right there snapping through

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.680 
this guy is right there snapping through
smoke<00:05:29.440> and<00:05:30.880> right<00:05:31.880> in<00:05:32.060> this<00:05:32.210> and<00:05:32.419> this<00:05:32.479> is<00:05:32.539> a

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
smoke and right in this and this is a

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.080 
smoke and right in this and this is a
pretty<00:05:33.470> I<00:05:33.590> guess<00:05:33.860> solid<00:05:34.310> gameplay<00:05:34.490> pinnacle

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
pretty I guess solid gameplay pinnacle

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.670 
pretty I guess solid gameplay pinnacle
and<00:05:35.360> kids<00:05:35.810> aren't<00:05:36.080> the<00:05:36.169> best<00:05:36.320> but<00:05:36.470> they're

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
and kids aren't the best but they're

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.779 
and kids aren't the best but they're
actually<00:05:36.979> putting<00:05:37.250> up<00:05:37.370> a<00:05:37.430> pretty<00:05:37.610> good<00:05:37.669> fight

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
actually putting up a pretty good fight

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:39.939 
actually putting up a pretty good fight
got<00:05:38.720> a<00:05:38.750> pretty<00:05:39.229> good<00:05:39.380> quick<00:05:39.560> scope<00:05:39.770> right

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
got a pretty good quick scope right

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.560 
got a pretty good quick scope right
there<00:05:40.190> and<00:05:40.870> I<00:05:42.639> think<00:05:43.639> that<00:05:44.120> my<00:05:44.270> next

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
there and I think that my next

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.749 
there and I think that my next
commentary<00:05:45.050> is<00:05:45.259> probably<00:05:45.500> gonna<00:05:45.620> be<00:05:45.710> on<00:05:46.099> some

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
commentary is probably gonna be on some

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.790 
commentary is probably gonna be on some
halo<00:05:46.970> 4<00:05:47.300> kind<00:05:47.690> of<00:05:47.750> things<00:05:47.960> but<00:05:48.229> they

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
halo 4 kind of things but they

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.710 
halo 4 kind of things but they
understand<00:05:49.130> jokes<00:05:49.340> on<00:05:49.610> I<00:05:49.909> guess<00:05:50.210> the<00:05:50.330> gameplay

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
understand jokes on I guess the gameplay

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.689 
understand jokes on I guess the gameplay
because<00:05:50.840> this<00:05:51.050> is<00:05:51.169> my<00:05:51.259> first<00:05:51.289> commentary<00:05:51.919> so

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:52.699 
because this is my first commentary so

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:54.219 
because this is my first commentary so
when<00:05:52.909> I<00:05:52.970> friend<00:05:53.270> start<00:05:53.570> my<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:53.750> end<00:05:53.990> he<00:05:54.199> just

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:54.229 
when I friend start my the end he just

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.379 
when I friend start my the end he just
cleaned<00:05:55.159> up<00:05:55.250> that<00:05:55.370> guy<00:05:55.520> and<00:05:56.060> this<00:05:56.180> is<00:05:56.300> not

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
cleaned up that guy and this is not

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.939 
cleaned up that guy and this is not
