off up the top cover here you've got the
presentation<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.050> product<00:00:37.289> right<00:00:37.590> here

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
presentation of the product right here

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.130 
presentation of the product right here
now<00:00:39.500> they've<00:00:40.500> given<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.859> sticker<00:00:42.140> some

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
now they've given you a sticker some

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.660 
now they've given you a sticker some
codes<00:00:43.379> some<00:00:43.649> software<00:00:44.010> which<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.250> won't<00:00:44.430> reveal

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
codes some software which I won't reveal

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.110 
codes some software which I won't reveal
on<00:00:44.940> camera<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.890> of<00:00:46.890> course<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.370> getting

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
on camera and of course a getting

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.630 
on camera and of course a getting
started<00:00:48.149> guide<00:00:48.629> right<00:00:49.109> here<00:00:49.500> it<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.340> quite

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
started guide right here it is quite

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.330 
started guide right here it is quite
small<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.359> again<00:00:51.899> this<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.649> no<00:00:52.859> more

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
small but again this is no more

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.130 
small but again this is no more
difficult<00:00:53.579> than<00:00:54.149> installing<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.719> graphics

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
difficult than installing a graphics

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.259 
difficult than installing a graphics
card<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:56.039> should<00:00:56.250> work<00:00:56.280> without<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.120> need

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
card and it should work without the need

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.349 
card and it should work without the need
of<00:00:57.449> drivers<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.440> that's<00:00:59.219> why<00:00:59.370> there's<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.120> small

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
of drivers so that's why there's a small

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.630 
of drivers so that's why there's a small
instruction<00:01:00.660> manual<00:01:01.199> now<00:01:01.920> I'm<00:01:02.250> gonna<00:01:02.399> lift

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
instruction manual now I'm gonna lift

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.360 
instruction manual now I'm gonna lift
this<00:01:02.760> out<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.059> box<00:01:03.830> I'm<00:01:04.830> gonna<00:01:04.980> go<00:01:05.100> over

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:05.370 
this out of the box I'm gonna go over

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.440 
this out of the box I'm gonna go over
some<00:01:05.400> important<00:01:05.910> things<00:01:06.000> here<00:01:08.120> this<00:01:09.120> is<00:01:09.270> an

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
some important things here this is an

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.340 
some important things here this is an
adapter<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.440> gives<00:01:10.620> you<00:01:10.830> x4<00:01:11.340> speeds<00:01:11.880> and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
adapter that gives you x4 speeds and

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.720 
adapter that gives you x4 speeds and
that's<00:01:13.350> good<00:01:13.620> for<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.950> m2<00:01:15.590> SSD<00:01:16.590> because<00:01:17.280> they

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:17.730 
that's good for the m2 SSD because they

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.370 
that's good for the m2 SSD because they
are<00:01:17.820> capable<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.390> much<00:01:18.540> higher<00:01:18.780> speeds<00:01:19.140> than

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
are capable of much higher speeds than

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.550 
are capable of much higher speeds than

here's the half-height one here you can

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.850 
here's the half-height one here you can
basically<00:01:50.880> undo<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:52.830> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
basically undo it this one here with a
