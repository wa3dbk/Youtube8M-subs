00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:05.340 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.080 

I<00:00:06.620> hope<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:08.040> morning<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.610> had<00:00:08.820> allergies

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
I hope this morning and I had allergies

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.090 
I hope this morning and I had allergies
I<00:00:09.980> know<00:00:11.959> the<00:00:12.959> worst<00:00:13.110> part<00:00:13.260> of<00:00:13.469> allergies<00:00:13.920> is

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:14.100 
I know the worst part of allergies is

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.859 
I know the worst part of allergies is
that<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.549> spend<00:00:15.090> most<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.420> your<00:00:15.480> time<00:00:15.690> at

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869 
that you spend most of your time at

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.630 
that you spend most of your time at
least<00:00:16.049> if<00:00:16.170> you're<00:00:16.260> me<00:00:16.440> wondering<00:00:17.010> if<00:00:17.250> really

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
least if you're me wondering if really

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.859 
least if you're me wondering if really
it<00:00:17.940> would<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.180> better<00:00:18.330> if<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.720> had<00:00:18.840> a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
it would be better if you just had a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.720 
it would be better if you just had a
cold<00:00:19.080> because<00:00:19.859> when<00:00:20.220> you<00:00:20.279> have<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.400> cold<00:00:20.640> you

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
cold because when you have a cold you

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.829 
cold because when you have a cold you
know<00:00:20.910> there's<00:00:21.090> an<00:00:21.210> end<00:00:21.359> in<00:00:21.509> sight<00:00:21.539> with

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:21.839 
know there's an end in sight with

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:23.179 
know there's an end in sight with
allergies<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.439> could<00:00:22.529> be<00:00:22.589> fucked<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.070> whole

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
allergies you could be fucked for whole

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.179 
allergies you could be fucked for whole
seasons<00:00:23.640> now<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.199> worst<00:00:25.380> part<00:00:25.589> is<00:00:25.769> with<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
seasons now and the worst part is with a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.009 
seasons now and the worst part is with a
cold<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.789> have<00:00:26.910> low<00:00:27.060> energy<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.810> the

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
cold you have low energy and the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.419 
cold you have low energy and the
trade-off<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.740> that<00:00:29.039> when<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.369> have

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
trade-off is that when you have

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.370 
trade-off is that when you have
allergies<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.269> want<00:00:30.509> to<00:00:30.660> go<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.990> hospital

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
allergies you want to go to the hospital

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.749 
allergies you want to go to the hospital
and<00:00:31.439> have<00:00:31.560> your<00:00:31.710> dose<00:00:31.890> remove<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.550> can<00:00:32.669> get

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
and have your dose remove so you can get

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.350 
and have your dose remove so you can get
to<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.060> itch<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.990> know<00:00:34.110> that's<00:00:34.800> right<00:00:34.950> here

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.730 

and<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.570> spent<00:00:39.930> most<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> day<00:00:40.350> doing

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:40.740 
and so I spent most of the day doing

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.240 
and so I spent most of the day doing
this<00:00:41.990> which<00:00:42.990> from<00:00:43.200> certain<00:00:43.530> angles<00:00:43.830> makes<00:00:44.100> it

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
this which from certain angles makes it

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.810 
this which from certain angles makes it
look<00:00:44.400> like<00:00:44.580> I'm<00:00:44.730> picking<00:00:44.910> my<00:00:45.180> nose<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.640> yes<00:00:47.640> I
