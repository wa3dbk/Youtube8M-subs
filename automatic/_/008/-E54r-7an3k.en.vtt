some of the parts for this set in yellow
are<00:00:53.460> definitely<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.030> little<00:00:54.149> bit<00:00:54.360> more

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
are definitely a little bit more

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.930 
are definitely a little bit more
difficult<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.110> find<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.860> building<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> in

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
difficult to find so building it in

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.979 
difficult to find so building it in
yellow<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.390> little<00:00:57.600> bit<00:00:57.690> more<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.899> a

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
yellow is a little bit more of a

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.319 
yellow is a little bit more of a
challenge<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:59.100> let's<00:00:59.340> get<00:00:59.550> a<00:00:59.609> closer<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.210> look

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
challenge but let's get a closer to look

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.670 
challenge but let's get a closer to look
at<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.809> take<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.020> look<00:01:01.140> at<00:01:01.379> some<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
at it and take a look at some of the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.990 
at it and take a look at some of the
features<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.250> couple<00:01:02.430> more<00:01:02.579> facts<00:01:02.850> about

features so a couple more facts about

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.759 
features so a couple more facts about
