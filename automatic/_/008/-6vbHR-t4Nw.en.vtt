 how about friends today again gustavo 

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.719
 losada the music products and now they 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.299
 I will present the launch more 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.760
 big inside the world of formal dj in 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:22.160
 place what they have here before you 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:25.579
 is ns 72 which is 17 2 based on 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.890
 the success of the original ns 7 which 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.099
 brought for the first time in a controller 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.440
 integrated turntable engines with motor 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.470
 integrated and an analog console in 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.170
 this case this device to the n 7 2 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.600
 includes everything includes of course the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.520
 motorized turntables that not only 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.980
 is the engine if they do not bring the disc 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.960
 torque control is much more accurate and 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.680
 as faithful as possible to the movement of a 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.860
 standard turntable the analog console 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.780
 100% regarding your operation is a 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.940
 totally independent console person 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.520
 can put any external signal and 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.500
 manipulate it or it works digitally 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.710
 receiving signals from the computer 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.630
 it is dual the operation is a console of 4 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.220
 channels each with a meter 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.810
 independent level 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.610
 and the master level 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.670
 what else does he tend to in that 72 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.050
 for the first time we integrated merging 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.480
 the technologies of our own 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:28.540
 companies the famous pads of the mpc 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.850
 are backlit pads from here and from 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.970
 technology companies has eight 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.190
 per side are a total of 16 pads what else 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.790
 we can find we find a bar 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.790
 of effects 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.610
 generally in the n s 7 original not 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.680
 It had an effect knowing that buying the bar 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.830
 of effects they had already integrated and 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.509
 are in code is rotatable with its 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.230
 level indicator which is pretty 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.870
 attractive in sight 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.510
 better yet all the potentiometers of 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.220
 a metal cap that are sensitive to 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.470
 touch you can cut an equalization 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.910
 only with the touch or arm of 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.060
 determined way at a given time 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.810
 for a performance 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.780
 and if you check the table you have the controls 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.810
 of any turntables does not make the 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.030
 bleep with the reverse has the strip sets 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.300
 who became famous in the n-6 and in the 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.380
 force track now well integrated here and 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.810
 of course it is a totally operation 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:29.060
 interesting with engines your console 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.550
 analog four channels your legs of 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.430
 enbici integrated effects strip 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.430
 search this is night number 72
