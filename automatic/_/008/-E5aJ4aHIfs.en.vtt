00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.200
 the idea is to get madrid or million 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.200
 people 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.800
 basically to tell the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.230
 government that has run out of time 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.340
 that you have had enough time 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.080
 you may continue to deceive the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.420
 population and do the opposite what 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.400
 promises because the governments when they do 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.900
 the opposite that they promise and is in 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.670
 against the population is situated in the 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.440
 ethical illegality and morante the game and 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.330
 That is why the people are legitimized to 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.370
 go out to the street peacefully and 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.390
 defeat those contrary policies 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.390
 to the general interest 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.270
 the supports fundamentally come by 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.890
 part of the groups and the 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:05.780
 citizen platforms come from the town 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.970
 very emotional when it arrives 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.130
 some village people do not know 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.110
 you're welcome and they get excited with you and you 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.600
 tell stories related to our 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.040
 thoughts and says you can help 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.259
 Comfort your work that your accent 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.890
 locality because there are other people who 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.890
 they also do it 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.770
 they will not be able to cut many rights but 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.829
 what we are not going to allow us 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.320
 cut and steal us is the dignity and 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.110
 above all the right to keep dreaming 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.100
 in another world that is possible in another 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.100
 world where people 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.130
 and now 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.890
 and we had to rearrange ourselves to make ourselves 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.630
 group stop wondering where from 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.250
 we were coming and start to consider ourselves already 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.049
 colleagues at the moment that 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.280
 we got decided in the assembly that 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.280
 every day we were going to take an action 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.180
 they are going to put obstacles in the way but 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.759
 what we have very clear is the end that 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.590
 unites us to the different movements and 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.650
 groups that we are going to participate in 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.270
 this march where the organizations 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.850
 from below up new positions of 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.170
 agreement to fight all together with 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.640
 very clear claims 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.540
 no to the payment of the debt 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.540
 at the beginning of the government 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.490
 having the government of the troika 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.610
 do not cut it 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.500
 basic straight 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.660
 replacement and modification of the reform 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.280
 labor the idea of ​​a citizen the law 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.470
 of abortion I think something like this is 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.570
 something that nobody nobody having the 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.970
 possibility of doing it should be 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:53.220
 learn because really what we ask 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.930
 here is that our dignity be respected 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.580
 I personally for example I come to 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.170
 represent many people who can not 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.210
 come then in the same way every 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.640
 in each place they received us 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.260
 they received like the people who are going to do what 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.790
 that I can not do at that moment 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.460
 I can not walk for whatever I can not 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.590
 go you take us in the heart 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.970
 that was the thing and very well that's why all 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.040
 dumps very overturned the experience has 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.660
 been very beautiful because of the people who are 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.880
 how you are delivering on 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.250
 villages there are myths we have also 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.470
 found provocations but nothing 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.880
 wonders is one of the people that is 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.470
 indescribable in the life of the most 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.209
 nice that he lived all the pains he 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.209
 they remove when it reaches the villages 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.950
 I hope it is a powerful demonstration 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.520
 and let this government change the 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.520
 attitude 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.810
 what a popular reaction is needed 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:11.270
 after writing the song very 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.220
 pretty the response of the people of madrid 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.720
 that responds to all the peoples of 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.720
 Spain that has requested wine 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:29.810
 I feel a privileged power 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.710
 participate in this march and also 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.710
