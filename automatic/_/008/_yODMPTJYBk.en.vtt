00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
think it was a collaboration between the

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.560 
think it was a collaboration between the
directors<00:05:18.280> mike<00:05:18.550> newell<00:05:18.850> first<00:05:19.120> of<00:05:19.270> all<00:05:19.390> and

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.270 
think JK Rowling also will have it to
say<00:05:24.880> but<00:05:25.270> really<00:05:25.570> i<00:05:25.600> think<00:05:25.780> it<00:05:26.050> was<00:05:26.140> i<00:05:26.440> bought

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.210 
say but really i think it was i bought
something<00:05:27.760> myself<00:05:28.030> I<00:05:28.360> guess<00:05:28.860> what<00:05:29.860> was<00:05:30.070> the

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
something myself I guess what was the

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.590 
something myself I guess what was the
whole<00:05:30.340> experience<00:05:30.460> he<00:05:30.940> said<00:05:31.150> was<00:05:31.300> it<00:05:31.420> was<00:05:31.570> a

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
whole experience he said was it was a

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.230 
whole experience he said was it was a
fun<00:05:31.930> experience<00:05:32.040> was<00:05:33.040> a<00:05:33.070> challenge<00:05:33.850> was<00:05:34.030> used

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
fun experience was a challenge was used

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.910 
fun experience was a challenge was used
there<00:05:34.330> a<00:05:34.450> lot<00:05:34.660> of<00:05:34.690> time<00:05:34.930> in<00:05:35.140> you<00:05:35.590> know<00:05:35.620> and

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:35.920 
there a lot of time in you know and

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.580 
there a lot of time in you know and
makeup<00:05:36.340> and<00:05:36.580> that<00:05:37.480> was<00:05:37.780> that<00:05:38.170> wasn't<00:05:38.350> too<00:05:38.560> bad

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
makeup and that was that wasn't too bad

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.750 
makeup and that was that wasn't too bad
but<00:05:38.770> it<00:05:39.130> I<00:05:39.400> think<00:05:40.300> it<00:05:41.080> seemed<00:05:41.560> to<00:05:41.680> grow<00:05:41.920> as<00:05:42.250> as

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
but it I think it seemed to grow as as

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.220 
but it I think it seemed to grow as as
the<00:05:43.000> film's<00:05:43.300> progressed<00:05:43.750> and<00:05:44.140> that<00:05:44.350> they<00:05:44.980> seem
