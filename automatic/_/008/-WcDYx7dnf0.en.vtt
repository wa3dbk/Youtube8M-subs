00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:32.450
 and I was backstage for more than 30 years, I created 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.860
 weapons for more than 200 artistic 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.910
 films this 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.790
 gunsmith 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.210
 pastor thing is completely ridiculous you 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.820
 blade length of one whole 80 meters and 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.690
 more than thirty centimeters wide 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.920
 the cutting part will be the blade of 1075 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.120
 spring steel 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.480
 this is an aluminum plate class 6061 she 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.699
 will be processed in a form that's wrapped 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.550
 in bronze with the help of chisel technique 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:07.300
 stamping is just plain small 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:11.380
 I have a sword here 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.720
 7075 grade aluminum heard on their 9.5 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.570
 a centimeter one point eight 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.210
 meters by 30 centimeters one edge 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.039
 cut off for the triangular end not 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.070
 invited Bella and brother we call him 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:26.710
 ancient people he machines with foundry 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.399
 I asked the pension to beat the front 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.710
 9.5 centimeters wide and almost deep 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.710
 4 centimeters inside the plate 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.060
 we have a handle or handle 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.790
 made of aluminum with a thickness of two 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.600
 half a centimeter we drilled a groove 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.490
 depth of 7.6 centimeters 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.150
 so ridiculous he just needs 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.070
 longer handle our handle will 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.190
 20 centimeters long 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.040
 made of speaking and take ingot 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.790
 bronze forges his head office 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.130
 and cuffs with bronze everything is not so simple not 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.679
 you need to forge lights but we don't have 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.680
 the time of ebb tide by means of 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.470
 method of digging powder madein therefore 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.420
 i take a big piece of bronze and you field out 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.060
 he ball for hilt 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.390
 also i will take a smaller piece of ingot he 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.459
 apex pipe or collar dropped out of year 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.680
 helped my assistant brain 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.860
 who cranked the head and weights and 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.530
 cuff on the lathe after that i 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.990
 processed rough products on the grinding 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.330
 machine there trim them then again 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.970
 took advantage of belt grinding 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.160
 machine for final processing i 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.650
 removed the clamp from the vertical milling 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.290
 machine and dug there a sheet of aluminum 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.959
 thing spherical end mill I 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.800
 despised decorative lines on the blade 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:58.570
 we need to temper a piece of 1075 steel 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:02.380
 1.8 meters long, 20 wide and thick 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:05.500
 at 7.6 centimeters then sanded edges 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.080
 and after that you can insert the blade of you 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.810
 harvested plate and mount it all 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.480
 riveting 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.489
 Kingu unions and fasting salt 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.830
 because of the size of the sword master i can't 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.959
 cram it up a vertical drill 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.570
 machine when it is fully assembled woof 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:23.120
 so I had to use 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.580
 scientists 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.519
 instead of burning 3 drills while trying 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.010
 drill by hand this piece of aluminum 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.129
 if that how the whole sword was assembled we 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:39.519
 pull it with chemicals to aluminum 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:42.230
 looked like black steel didn't say that 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.780
 freed put down and buster sword from 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.890
 workshop I tore my back and arms 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.349
 gang does she weighs about 34 36 kilograms 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.329
 the boss must be the most ridiculous 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:57.769
 and a huge sword that i ever 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:04:00.260
 did not think that I ever 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:03.109
 make a feeling of comfort and goyle but in my 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.859
 diary you can now note that yes I 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.859
 made him 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:26.980
 translated and voiced by the time team 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.670
