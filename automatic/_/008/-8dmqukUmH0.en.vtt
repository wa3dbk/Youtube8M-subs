00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:15.889
 and hello everyone with you alex and in this 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.420
 Guide I will tell you about the career of fashion 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.000
 industrial craft 2 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.590
 show you how to install it and how it 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.250
 use and so we set a quarry when 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.760
 we stand cameras it appears like this 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.480
 here is the mesh in this mesh garrison 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.519
 fenced 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:41.089
 it will drip and so for us to work 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.949
 career we need love debit you can even 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:47.149
 use wood but it will 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:54.100
 very slowly it is better to use dfs but 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:59.120
 I chose a stone and declare it so we insert 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:05.320
 Item 3 will be enough and not needed 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.030
 ember eluded umber 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.909
 pick up 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:16.280
 here the half crowned so now we 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:22.070
 need a chest that will fall down 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:26.060
 resource set and all include career 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.579
 starts making and grid after 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.719
 he ate and the grid will appear such mountains 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:36.439
 which is introduced to drill in this area 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:41.960
 and so but a career you can put more 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:44.750
 differently for this we need markers 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:49.579
 or rather the method of the common people they 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:54.110
 are called a marker and so on enough 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:59.690
 three stamps put a marker and now I plan 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:01.430
 we neatly video and there is a secret nothing 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.550
 does not happen on magazine 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:09.800
 we right-click on the edge 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:12.410
 sorry i am not connecting and so now 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.900
 we need to put 3 so you can 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.600
 little dig as well and or 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.780
 you can even have such a big 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.560
 do and now come to any 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.270
 marker 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:31.280
 named put our career marker fall out 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:35.360
 and this area is labeled becomes 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.910
 well, so simple and how we see our 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.959
 the quarry has already earned and all the resources 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:45.130
 handbags 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:45.130
 and on this all with you was Alice good luck to all
