in order to do so you just need to get

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.249 
in order to do so you just need to get

captures<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:14.250> believe<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.639> fastest<00:00:14.969> way<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.089> go

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
captures I believe the fastest way to go

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.279 
captures I believe the fastest way to go
ahead<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.420> do<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.719> conquest<00:00:16.170> domination

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
ahead and do this is conquest domination

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.550 
ahead and do this is conquest domination
since<00:00:16.920> it's<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.130> much<00:00:17.310> faster<00:00:17.520> paced<00:00:17.910> game<00:00:18.150> and

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
since it's a much faster paced game and

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.929 
since it's a much faster paced game and
you<00:00:19.560> can<00:00:19.710> course<00:00:19.920> can<00:00:20.070> do<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.250> in<00:00:20.340> conquest<00:00:20.640> but

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
you can course can do it in conquest but

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:21.950 
you can course can do it in conquest but
it's<00:00:21.090> going<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> take<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> little<00:00:21.660> bit<00:00:21.810> more

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
it's going to take a little bit more

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.870 
it's going to take a little bit more
time<00:00:22.230> depending<00:00:22.800> on<00:00:22.890> what<00:00:23.039> map<00:00:23.189> your<00:00:23.369> play

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
time depending on what map your play

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.880 
time depending on what map your play
so<00:00:24.330> let's<00:00:24.480> go<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.630> get<00:00:24.720> into<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> weapon<00:00:25.320> for

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
so let's go and get into the weapon for

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.259 
so let's go and get into the weapon for
the<00:00:25.980> video<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.279> begin<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.910> run<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.150> with

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the video to begin with I run it with

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.700 
the video to begin with I run it with
stock<00:00:27.480> settings<00:00:27.930> I'll<00:00:28.170> go<00:00:28.349> ahead<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.590> change

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
stock settings I'll go ahead and change

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.540 
stock settings I'll go ahead and change
it<00:00:28.890> later<00:00:29.010> on

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
it later on

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.669 
it later on
I<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.510> iron<00:00:30.689> sights<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.140> I<00:00:31.170> keep<00:00:31.500> those

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
I like the iron sights so I keep those

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.310 
I like the iron sights so I keep those
on<00:00:31.890> for<00:00:32.130> throughout<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.550> entire<00:00:32.820> game<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.320> also

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
on for throughout the entire game I also

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.280 
on for throughout the entire game I also
feel<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:34.920> if<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.190> put<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.719> small<00:00:36.719> sites<00:00:36.989> such

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
feel that if you put on small sites such

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.819 
feel that if you put on small sites such
as<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.829> u.s.<00:00:38.640> holo<00:00:38.879> or<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.809> red<00:00:40.020> dot<00:00:40.260> reflex

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
as the u.s. holo or the red dot reflex

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.479 
as the u.s. holo or the red dot reflex
sight<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:42.120> kind<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.899> hinders<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:44.010> hit

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
sight that it kind of hinders the hit

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.160 
sight that it kind of hinders the hit
detection<00:00:44.760> with<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> weapon<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:45.690> that's

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
detection with the weapon so that's

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.990 
detection with the weapon so that's
another<00:00:46.350> reason<00:00:46.559> why<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> leave<00:00:47.010> this<00:00:47.730> stock

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
another reason why I leave this stock

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.740 
another reason why I leave this stock
sight<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.450> it

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
sight on it

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.569 
sight on it
but<00:00:49.320> let's<00:00:49.680> go<00:00:49.770> into<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.010> specs<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> time

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
but let's go into the specs of the time

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.450 
but let's go into the specs of the time
as<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.090> 20<00:00:51.390> volt<00:00:51.510> magazine<00:00:52.110> capacity<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.190> one

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
as a 20 volt magazine capacity with one

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.029 
as a 20 volt magazine capacity with one
action<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> chamber<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.149> make<00:00:54.180> 21<00:00:54.600> total<00:00:55.079> this

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
action the chamber to make 21 total this

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.160 
action the chamber to make 21 total this
would<00:00:56.219> tie<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.430> with<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> SKS<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.570> speaking

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
would tie it with the SKS and speaking

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.670 
would tie it with the SKS and speaking
of<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> SKS<00:00:58.739> these<00:00:59.699> two<00:01:00.059> weapons<00:01:00.539> SKS<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.140> 417

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
of the SKS these two weapons SKS and 417

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.560 
of the SKS these two weapons SKS and 417
are<00:01:01.890> pretty<00:01:02.250> much<00:01:02.430> identical<00:01:02.850> all<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.480> way

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
are pretty much identical all the way

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.299 
are pretty much identical all the way
around<00:01:03.840> there's<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> few<00:01:04.769> differences<00:01:05.159> that

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
around there's a few differences that

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.550 
around there's a few differences that
I'll<00:01:05.430> go<00:01:05.549> ahead<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.820> cover<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.110> will<00:01:07.350> say

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
I'll go ahead and cover but I will say

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.649 
I'll go ahead and cover but I will say
that<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:07.799> do<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.159> m4<00:01:08.430> 17<00:01:08.790> better<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.420> looks

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
that I do like the m4 17 better it looks

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.840 
that I do like the m4 17 better it looks
better<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.170> sounds<00:01:10.860> better<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.369> m416<00:01:11.820> was

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
better it sounds better the m416 was

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.399 
better it sounds better the m416 was
already<00:01:12.330> one<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.479> my<00:01:12.540> favorite<00:01:12.840> weapons<00:01:13.200> so

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
already one of my favorite weapons so

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.960 
already one of my favorite weapons so
that's<00:01:13.590> another<00:01:13.830> thing<00:01:14.100> I<00:01:14.400> know<00:01:14.820> that's

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
that's another thing I know that's

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.880 
that's another thing I know that's
opinion<00:01:15.330> based<00:01:15.509> but<00:01:16.229> let's<00:01:16.439> go<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> get<00:01:16.740> into

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
opinion based but let's go to get into

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.520 
opinion based but let's go to get into
the<00:01:16.950> other<00:01:17.100> specs<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.610> differentiate<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.299> to

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
the other specs that differentiate it to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.170 
the other specs that differentiate it to
the<00:01:19.530> fire<00:01:19.920> rate<00:01:20.189> even<00:01:20.759> though<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.000> is

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the fire rate even though this is

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.469 
the fire rate even though this is
semiotic<00:01:21.479> sign<00:01:21.960> for<00:01:22.170> Apple<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:23.060> 295<00:01:24.060> for<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
semiotic sign for Apple as 295 for the

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.830 
semiotic sign for Apple as 295 for the
m4<00:01:24.630> 17<00:01:25.290> whereas<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.979> SKS<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.460> faster<00:01:27.000> at<00:01:27.090> 333

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
m4 17 whereas the SKS is faster at 333

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.289 
m4 17 whereas the SKS is faster at 333
but<00:01:28.500> at<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.740> same<00:01:28.979> time<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.610> not<00:01:30.000> suggest

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
but at the same time I do not suggest

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.240 
but at the same time I do not suggest
just<00:01:30.720> spamming<00:01:30.960> your<00:01:31.229> trigger<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:31.799> fast<00:01:32.070> as

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
just spamming your trigger as fast as

possible<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:32.880> 17<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> gun<00:01:33.750> that's<00:01:33.960> much

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
possible or 17 this is a gun that's much

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.530 
possible or 17 this is a gun that's much
better<00:01:34.650> off<00:01:34.890> if<00:01:35.520> you're<00:01:35.820> just<00:01:36.090> tapping<00:01:36.240> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
better off if you're just tapping the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.990 
better off if you're just tapping the
trigger<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.740> should<00:01:37.979> say<00:01:38.159> more<00:01:38.460> controlled

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000

with your fire making sure the three

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.149 
with your fire making sure the three
bullets<00:01:40.619> hit<00:01:40.829> what<00:01:41.159> you're<00:01:41.280> aiming<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:41.780> in

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
bullets hit what you're aiming at in

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.130 
bullets hit what you're aiming at in
regards<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:45.299> damage<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:45.750> has<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.869> max

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
regards to the damage it has a max

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.889 
regards to the damage it has a max
damage<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.680> 50<00:01:47.189> with<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> minimum<00:01:48.000> damage<00:01:48.329> of<00:01:48.479> 38

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
damage of 50 with a minimum damage of 38

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.630 
damage of 50 with a minimum damage of 38
it's<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> same<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.500> all<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.649> semi-automatic

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
it's the same as all the semi-automatic

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.640 
it's the same as all the semi-automatic
sniper<00:01:50.759> rifles<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.960> starts<00:01:52.500> dropping

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
sniper rifles it starts dropping

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.850 
sniper rifles it starts dropping
and<00:01:54.460> it<00:01:54.580> stops<00:01:54.880> dropping<00:01:55.300> off<00:01:55.450> at<00:01:55.750> 75

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
and it stops dropping off at 75

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.820 
and it stops dropping off at 75
so<00:01:57.550> that<00:01:58.120> would<00:01:58.750> basically<00:01:58.870> cover<00:01:59.290> the<00:01:59.380> damage

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
so that would basically cover the damage

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.470 
so that would basically cover the damage
there's<00:02:00.040> no<00:02:00.190> difference<00:02:00.610> you<00:02:00.850> can't<00:02:01.240> really

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:01.480 
there's no difference you can't really

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.660 
there's no difference you can't really
differentiate<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.200> two<00:02:02.230> the<00:02:02.920> enforce<00:02:03.220> 17

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.120 
differentiate the two the enforce 17
does<00:02:03.970> have<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.240> faster<00:02:04.720> muzzle<00:02:05.020> velocity<00:02:05.590> for

does have a faster muzzle velocity for

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.190 
does have a faster muzzle velocity for
the<00:02:06.190> bullet<00:02:06.490> but<00:02:06.880> at<00:02:07.150> the<00:02:07.300> same<00:02:07.450> time<00:02:07.600> it's<00:02:07.930> not

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
the bullet but at the same time it's not

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.840 
the bullet but at the same time it's not
much<00:02:08.440> faster<00:02:08.770> than<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.950> SKS<00:02:09.340> and<00:02:09.550> that's<00:02:09.670> not

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
much faster than the SKS and that's not

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.470 
much faster than the SKS and that's not
really<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.360> deciding<00:02:11.200> factor<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.880> big<00:02:13.210> thing

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
really a deciding factor the big thing

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.140 
really a deciding factor the big thing
though<00:02:13.690> would<00:02:13.960> be<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.200> reload<00:02:14.530> time<00:02:15.150> the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
though would be the reload time the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.890 
though would be the reload time the
reload<00:02:16.510> time<00:02:16.540> for<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.890> m4<00:02:18.070> 17<00:02:18.790> would<00:02:19.390> be<00:02:19.600> at

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
reload time for the m4 17 would be at

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.080 
reload time for the m4 17 would be at
one<00:02:20.230> point<00:02:20.410> eight<00:02:20.650> five<00:02:20.860> seconds<00:02:21.460> if<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:21.760> have

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
one point eight five seconds if you have

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.480 
one point eight five seconds if you have
a<00:02:22.120> bullet<00:02:22.450> still<00:02:22.750> left<00:02:22.930> in<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.350> mag<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.770> then

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
a bullet still left in the mag and then

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.940 
a bullet still left in the mag and then
it<00:02:24.640> would<00:02:24.730> be<00:02:24.910> at<00:02:25.630> two<00:02:25.930> point<00:02:26.140> four<00:02:26.350> seconds<00:02:26.800> if

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
it would be at two point four seconds if

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.340 
it would be at two point four seconds if
you<00:02:27.700> had<00:02:27.850> a<00:02:27.880> very<00:02:28.060> empty<00:02:28.600> magazine

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
you had a very empty magazine

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.760 
you had a very empty magazine
now<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.680> SKS<00:02:30.370> it's<00:02:31.180> at<00:02:31.300> 2.3<00:02:31.990> seconds<00:02:32.440> if<00:02:32.650> you

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
now the SKS it's at 2.3 seconds if you

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.050 
now the SKS it's at 2.3 seconds if you
have<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.920> bullet<00:02:33.160> left<00:02:33.280> in<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.520> mag<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.850> it

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
have a bullet left in the mag and it

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.050 
have a bullet left in the mag and it
would<00:02:34.180> be<00:02:34.330> at<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:34.600> 3.5<00:02:35.530> seconds<00:02:36.070> if<00:02:36.459> you<00:02:36.730> don't

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
would be at a 3.5 seconds if you don't

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.240 
would be at a 3.5 seconds if you don't
so<00:02:37.270> that's<00:02:37.390> over<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.870> second<00:02:38.530> difference<00:02:38.709> if

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
so that's over a second difference if

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.740 
so that's over a second difference if
there's<00:02:39.700> no<00:02:39.880> bullet<00:02:40.150> in<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.240> mag<00:02:40.480> if<00:02:40.630> you're

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
there's no bullet in the mag if you're

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.110 
there's no bullet in the mag if you're
running<00:02:40.870> empty<00:02:41.110> on<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:42.010> gun<00:02:42.190> itself<00:02:42.520> so

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
running empty on the the gun itself so

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.360 
running empty on the the gun itself so
that's<00:02:43.600> one<00:02:43.900> big<00:02:43.930> deciding<00:02:44.620> factor<00:02:45.070> for<00:02:45.100> me

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
that's one big deciding factor for me

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.720 
that's one big deciding factor for me
I'm<00:02:45.520> why<00:02:45.670> like<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:45.940> 417<00:02:46.600> as<00:02:46.690> well<00:02:47.730> another

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
I'm why like the 417 as well another

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.790 
I'm why like the 417 as well another
would<00:02:49.209> be<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.360> horizontal<00:02:49.570> recoil<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.590> gun

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
would be the horizontal recoil the gun

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.280 
would be the horizontal recoil the gun
has<00:02:51.610> much<00:02:51.820> less<00:02:51.970> horizontal<00:02:52.510> recoil<00:02:52.600> an<00:02:52.900> SKS

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
has much less horizontal recoil an SKS

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:00.360 
has much less horizontal recoil an SKS
tsks<00:02:54.010> does<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.769> difference<00:03:00.070> is<00:03:00.160> I<00:03:00.220> guess

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
tsks does so the difference is I guess

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.920 
tsks does so the difference is I guess
that<00:03:00.519> goes<00:03:00.670> a<00:03:00.700> little<00:03:00.940> bit<00:03:01.090> in<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.239> SKS<00:03:01.660> favor

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
that goes a little bit in the SKS favor

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.150 
that goes a little bit in the SKS favor
and<00:03:02.170> regards<00:03:02.470> to<00:03:02.560> see<00:03:02.650> if<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:02.800> like<00:03:02.980> the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
and regards to see if you like the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.370 
and regards to see if you like the
vertical<00:03:03.640> recoil<00:03:03.790> but<00:03:04.450> at<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.630> same<00:03:04.810> time<00:03:05.050> I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
vertical recoil but at the same time I

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.229 
vertical recoil but at the same time I
like<00:03:05.650> having<00:03:05.950> less<00:03:06.070> horizontal<00:03:06.400> recoil<00:03:06.730> it's

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
like having less horizontal recoil it's

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.030 
like having less horizontal recoil it's
easier<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.540> control<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.900> vertical<00:03:08.230> side<00:03:08.410> at

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
easier to control the vertical side at

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.370 
easier to control the vertical side at
the<00:03:09.160> same<00:03:09.310> time<00:03:09.580> the<00:03:10.420> vertical<00:03:10.840> recoil<00:03:10.989> on<00:03:11.320> the

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
the same time the vertical recoil on the

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.400 
the same time the vertical recoil on the
m4<00:03:11.650> 17<00:03:12.070> is<00:03:12.250> less<00:03:12.550> than<00:03:12.790> MK<00:03:13.209> 11<00:03:13.480> it's<00:03:13.900> less<00:03:14.260> than

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
m4 17 is less than MK 11 it's less than

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.340 
m4 17 is less than MK 11 it's less than
SVD<00:03:15.070> it's<00:03:15.370> less<00:03:15.550> than<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:15.820> EMR<00:03:16.300> it's<00:03:17.140> less

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
SVD it's less than the EMR it's less

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.250 
SVD it's less than the EMR it's less
than<00:03:17.470> qbu<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.700> basically<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.720> only<00:03:19.870> trails

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
than qbu so basically it only trails

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.790 
than qbu so basically it only trails
behind<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.560> SKS<00:03:20.980> and<00:03:21.220> vertical<00:03:21.610> recoil<00:03:22.800> so

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
behind the SKS and vertical recoil so

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.229 
behind the SKS and vertical recoil so
what's<00:03:23.980> going<00:03:24.160> to<00:03:24.190> sit<00:03:24.430> I'm<00:03:24.640> going<00:03:25.030> to<00:03:25.120> talk

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
especially once you stick the foregrip

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:56.030 
especially once you stick the foregrip
and<00:03:53.670> you<00:03:53.910> stick<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.390> laser<00:03:55.140> on<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.500> which<00:03:55.890> you

first attack of kneeling walk if you

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.640 
first attack of kneeling walk if you
really<00:03:59.970> don't<00:04:00.150> like<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.390> iron<00:04:00.569> sights<00:04:00.870> would

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
really don't like the iron sights would

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.860 
really don't like the iron sights would
be<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.920> ACOG<00:04:02.310> scope<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:03.150> second<00:04:03.600> of<00:04:03.690> which

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
be the ACOG scope the second of which

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.020 
be the ACOG scope the second of which
would<00:04:04.230> be<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.830> laser<00:04:05.310> sight<00:04:05.580> and<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.850> third

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
would be the laser sight and the third

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.250 
would be the laser sight and the third
will<00:04:06.150> be<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.330> fore<00:04:06.510> grip<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.110> walk

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
will be the fore grip so you and walk

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.900 
will be the fore grip so you and walk
some<00:04:07.440> relevant<00:04:07.830> attachments<00:04:08.250> very<00:04:08.370> fast<00:04:08.640> is

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
some relevant attachments very fast is

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.600 
some relevant attachments very fast is
good<00:04:09.120> at<00:04:09.989> 20<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.500> 30<00:04:10.709> kills<00:04:10.980> are<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.459> most

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
good at 20 and 30 kills are the most

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.820 
good at 20 and 30 kills are the most
important<00:04:12.030> for<00:04:12.150> me<00:04:12.300> I<00:04:12.510> always<00:04:12.959> stock<00:04:13.350> sides<00:04:13.650> on

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
important for me I always stock sides on

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.099 
important for me I always stock sides on
as<00:04:14.010> I<00:04:14.130> said<00:04:14.340> just<00:04:14.370> because<00:04:14.700> it's<00:04:14.989> better<00:04:15.989> for

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
as I said just because it's better for

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.099 
as I said just because it's better for
the<00:04:16.290> hit<00:04:16.440> detection<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:17.630> if<00:04:18.630> you<00:04:18.810> really

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
the hit detection and if you really

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.990 
the hit detection and if you really
don't<00:04:19.410> like<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.709> hey<00:04:20.010> cog<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.489> do<00:04:20.669> want<00:04:20.910> a

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
don't like the hey cog you do want a

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.030 
don't like the hey cog you do want a
small<00:04:21.239> sight<00:04:21.510> on<00:04:21.690> such<00:04:21.930> as<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.320> US<00:04:22.560> holo<00:04:22.800> that

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
small sight on such as the US holo that

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.320 
small sight on such as the US holo that
would<00:04:23.160> be<00:04:23.250> the<00:04:23.370> next<00:04:23.610> thing<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.820> do<00:04:23.970> on<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.150> walk

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
would be the next thing you do on a walk

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.560 
would be the next thing you do on a walk
and<00:04:24.360> that'd<00:04:25.200> be<00:04:25.230> at<00:04:25.530> 50<00:04:25.860> kills<00:04:26.270> you<00:04:27.270> don't<00:04:27.450> like

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
and that'd be at 50 kills you don't like

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.000 
and that'd be at 50 kills you don't like
that<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:28.020> get<00:04:28.110> away<00:04:28.320> from<00:04:28.380> more<00:04:28.680> for<00:04:28.950> the

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
that to get away from more for the

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.710 
that to get away from more for the
reflex<00:04:29.510> and<00:04:31.220> this<00:04:32.220> gun<00:04:32.490> once<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.300> put<00:04:33.480> a<00:04:33.510> laser

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
reflex and this gun once you put a laser

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.050 
reflex and this gun once you put a laser
on<00:04:33.840> it<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:34.169> has<00:04:34.290> great<00:04:34.710> hip<00:04:34.890> fire<00:04:35.100> this<00:04:35.610> gun<00:04:35.820> has

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
on it it has great hip fire this gun has

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.530 
on it it has great hip fire this gun has
better<00:04:36.300> aim<00:04:36.479> down<00:04:36.720> sight<00:04:38.060> accuracy<00:04:39.060> than<00:04:39.419> the

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:39.540 
better aim down sight accuracy than the

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.990 
better aim down sight accuracy than the
SKS<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.380> that's<00:04:41.250> if<00:04:41.370> you're<00:04:41.490> standing<00:04:41.669> still

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
SKS and that's if you're standing still

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.260 
SKS and that's if you're standing still
it<00:04:42.540> has<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.720> less<00:04:43.110> accuracy<00:04:43.680> aim<00:04:44.610> down<00:04:44.760> sight<00:04:45.090> if

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
it has a less accuracy aim down sight if

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.390 
it has a less accuracy aim down sight if
you're<00:04:45.419> running<00:04:45.600> gunning<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.770> SKS<00:04:47.220> has

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
you're running gunning the SKS has

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.580 
you're running gunning the SKS has
better<00:04:47.610> for<00:04:47.820> that<00:04:47.850> but<00:04:48.780> it's<00:04:49.350> so<00:04:49.440> doesn't

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
better for that but it's so doesn't

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.650 
better for that but it's so doesn't
differ<00:04:49.830> my<00:04:50.010> opinion<00:04:50.340> the<00:04:50.400> SKS<00:04:50.940> you<00:04:51.210> can<00:04:51.360> spray

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
differ my opinion the SKS you can spray

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.270 
differ my opinion the SKS you can spray
and<00:04:51.840> pray<00:04:51.990> a<00:04:52.080> lot<00:04:52.290> more<00:04:52.530> like<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.800> can<00:04:53.070> tap<00:04:53.250> the

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
and pray a lot more like you can tap the

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.460 
and pray a lot more like you can tap the
trigger<00:04:53.610> but<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.300> like<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.690> ability<00:04:54.960> to<00:04:55.200> go

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
trigger but I like the ability to go

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.050 
trigger but I like the ability to go
ahead<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.890> control<00:04:56.130> my<00:04:56.310> shot<00:04:56.520> I<00:04:56.669> like<00:04:56.850> the

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
ahead and control my shot I like the

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.800 
ahead and control my shot I like the
feel<00:04:57.270> of<00:04:57.300> it<00:04:57.510> much<00:04:57.720> better<00:04:57.930> for<00:04:58.080> the<00:04:58.140> m4<00:04:58.290> 17

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
feel of it much better for the m4 17

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
damage really fast especially with the

damage really fast especially with the
metaphorce<00:05:15.570> mag<00:05:16.289> and<00:05:16.620> the<00:05:17.130> fact<00:05:17.340> that<00:05:17.400> you<00:05:17.550> can

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700
