00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
you have to push the brake in once you

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.690 
you have to push the brake in once you
push<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.530> it'll<00:01:01.890> let<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.070> move<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> gears

pops out once it pops out everything

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
else is pretty easy you kind of have the

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.610 
else is pretty easy you kind of have the
oh<00:04:41.150> this<00:04:41.420> thing<00:04:41.690> you<00:04:42.500> know<00:04:42.620> naked<00:04:44.410> make<00:04:45.410> sure

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
that you're real careful when you're

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.350 
that you're real careful when you're
taking<00:04:47.300> off<00:04:47.690> all<00:04:48.500> these<00:04:48.680> little<00:04:48.980> connectors

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
taking off all these little connectors

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.430 
taking off all these little connectors
these<00:04:50.360> leather<00:04:50.630> connectors<00:04:51.050> they<00:04:51.290> have<00:04:51.410> a

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
these leather connectors they have a

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.680 
these leather connectors they have a
little<00:04:51.590> clip<00:04:51.860> lets<00:04:52.370> you<00:04:52.490> push<00:04:52.760> in<00:04:52.970> and<00:04:53.210> then<00:04:53.360> it

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
little clip lets you push in and then it

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.630 
little clip lets you push in and then it
just<00:04:53.720> comes<00:04:54.020> out<00:04:54.230> the<00:04:54.890> hardest<00:04:55.250> one<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.400> take

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
just comes out the hardest one to take

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.850 
just comes out the hardest one to take
off<00:04:55.790> is<00:04:55.970> probably<00:04:56.240> this<00:04:56.419> one<00:04:56.630> here<00:04:56.870> it's<00:04:57.770> a

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
off is probably this one here it's a

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.780 
off is probably this one here it's a
little<00:04:58.070> small<00:04:58.280> one<00:04:58.720> it's<00:04:59.720> got<00:04:59.870> a<00:04:59.900> little

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
little small one it's got a little

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.120 
little small one it's got a little
plastic<00:05:01.790> thing<00:05:02.140> which<00:05:03.140> is<00:05:03.410> that<00:05:03.710> thing<00:05:03.980> right

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
plastic thing which is that thing right

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:12.550 
plastic thing which is that thing right
there<00:05:06.070> and<00:05:09.160> all<00:05:10.160> it<00:05:10.310> really<00:05:10.430> is<00:05:10.580> is<00:05:11.470> it's<00:05:12.470> a

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
there and all it really is is it's a

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.220 
there and all it really is is it's a
clip<00:05:12.830> that<00:05:13.190> you<00:05:13.340> have<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.580> push<00:05:13.820> out<00:05:14.110> once<00:05:15.110> you

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
clip that you have to push out once you

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.500 
clip that you have to push out once you
push<00:05:15.410> it<00:05:15.530> out<00:05:15.680> then<00:05:16.370> this<00:05:16.550> thing<00:05:16.760> just<00:05:16.910> it

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
push it out then this thing just it

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:19.930 
push it out then this thing just it
comes<00:05:17.780> off<00:05:18.400> that's<00:05:19.400> probably<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:19.910> hardest

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
comes off that's probably the hardest

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.390 
comes off that's probably the hardest
thing<00:05:20.300> it's<00:05:21.229> taking<00:05:21.620> that<00:05:21.650> little<00:05:21.890> thing<00:05:22.220> off

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
thing it's taking that little thing off

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.000 
thing it's taking that little thing off
once<00:05:23.360> that<00:05:23.600> thing<00:05:23.780> comes<00:05:24.050> off<00:05:24.200> everything

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.010 
once that thing comes off everything

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.310 
once that thing comes off everything
else<00:05:25.250> is<00:05:25.400> easy<00:05:25.550> like<00:05:25.820> I<00:05:25.850> said<00:05:26.110> release<00:05:27.110> this

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
else is easy like I said release this

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.420 
else is easy like I said release this
clip<00:05:28.120> number<00:05:29.120> is<00:05:29.330> also<00:05:30.010> two<00:05:31.010> more<00:05:31.220> on<00:05:31.310> this
