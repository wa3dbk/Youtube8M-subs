stuff in here is basically air mixture
valves<00:01:24.470> so<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.500> can<00:01:25.740> mix<00:01:26.460> them<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.790> proper

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
basically the concept and also improve

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.600 
basically the concept and also improve
actually<00:05:26.110> the<00:05:26.260> gasifier<00:05:26.740> itself<00:05:27.250> the

actually the gasifier itself the

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.450 
actually the gasifier itself the
operation<00:05:28.150> to<00:05:28.360> get<00:05:28.510> basically<00:05:29.140> more<00:05:29.470> energy

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
operation to get basically more energy

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.560

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
out per pound of feedstock you're also

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.350 
out per pound of feedstock you're also
not<00:05:34.570> looking<00:05:34.930> also<00:05:35.260> into<00:05:35.850> woody<00:05:36.850> biomass<00:05:37.000> you

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
not looking also into woody biomass you

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.120 
not looking also into woody biomass you
also<00:05:37.660> want<00:05:37.990> to<00:05:38.080> look<00:05:38.320> into<00:05:38.500> making<00:05:38.860> rubber

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.130 
also want to look into making rubber

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.590 
also want to look into making rubber
tiles<00:05:39.430> because<00:05:40.090> rubber<00:05:40.479> tires<00:05:40.979> tires<00:05:41.979> are

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
tiles because rubber tires tires are

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.670 
tiles because rubber tires tires are

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
basically spoon out after the youth

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.650 
basically spoon out after the youth
their<00:05:45.010> usage<00:05:45.340> so<00:05:45.490> they<00:05:45.610> using<00:05:46.000> cement<00:05:46.330> kilns

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
their usage so they using cement kilns

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.380 
their usage so they using cement kilns
for<00:05:46.840> firing<00:05:47.050> them<00:05:47.410> but<00:05:47.919> we<00:05:48.070> also<00:05:48.120> yeah<00:05:49.120> we
