it's just one of those things you know
that<00:04:18.950> you<00:04:19.540> you<00:04:20.540> don't<00:04:20.720> often<00:04:20.930> look<00:04:21.200> for<00:04:21.260> so

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
that you you don't often look for so

I'll<00:04:21.920> just<00:04:21.950> do<00:04:22.310> my<00:04:22.340> visual<00:04:22.760> check<00:04:22.970> again<00:04:23.210> I

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:23.420 
I'll just do my visual check again I

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.870 
I'll just do my visual check again I
will<00:04:24.200> find<00:04:24.470> a<00:04:24.590> little<00:04:24.980> bit<00:04:25.100> slow<00:04:25.340> on<00:04:25.520> the<00:04:25.700> rule

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
will find a little bit slow on the rule

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.980 
will find a little bit slow on the rule
to<00:04:26.060> it<00:04:26.150> when<00:04:26.270> I'm<00:04:26.390> doing<00:04:26.630> at<00:04:26.720> this<00:04:26.840> because

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
to it when I'm doing at this because

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.290 
to it when I'm doing at this because
it's<00:04:27.170> got<00:04:27.290> a<00:04:27.320> lot<00:04:27.470> of<00:04:27.530> stuff<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.740> work<00:04:27.950> out<00:04:28.300> okay

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
it's got a lot of stuff to work out okay

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.950 
it's got a lot of stuff to work out okay
now<00:04:29.480> I<00:04:30.260> ball<00:04:31.040> back<00:04:31.250> in<00:04:31.700> here<00:04:32.090> and<00:04:32.450> we<00:04:32.570> have<00:04:32.690> all

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
now I ball back in here and we have all

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.330 
now I ball back in here and we have all
these<00:04:33.170> selected<00:04:33.650> okay<00:04:35.200> if<00:04:36.200> I<00:04:36.380> changes<00:04:36.890> here<00:04:37.160> I

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
these selected okay if I changes here I

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:44.590 
these selected okay if I changes here I
can<00:04:37.970> move<00:04:38.180> these<00:04:38.860> exactly<00:04:40.990> one<00:04:42.370> unit<00:04:43.370> to<00:04:43.600> the

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
can move these exactly one unit to the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.660 
can move these exactly one unit to the
right<00:04:44.690> so<00:04:45.380> now<00:04:45.530> we<00:04:45.590> have<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.950> UV<00:04:46.220> tails<00:04:46.490> i'll

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
right so now we have to UV tails i'll

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.740 
right so now we have to UV tails i'll
try<00:04:46.790> and<00:04:46.910> have<00:04:47.030> at<00:04:47.150> least<00:04:47.240> so<00:04:47.390> you<00:04:47.450> can<00:04:47.570> see

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
more steam engines will ignore the

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.290 
more steam engines will ignore the
second<00:05:08.270> tale<00:05:08.860> completely<00:05:09.860> alright<00:05:10.400> so<00:05:11.030> what

tails okay junk the second one apply
your<00:05:22.550> first<00:05:23.419> tail<00:05:23.660> which<00:05:23.930> would<00:05:24.080> be<00:05:24.200> over<00:05:24.440> this

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
your first tail which would be over this

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.970 
your first tail which would be over this
section<00:05:25.370> here<00:05:25.660> in<00:05:26.660> your<00:05:27.200> material<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.800> entire

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
section here in your material the entire

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.940 
section here in your material the entire
model<00:05:28.270> problem<00:05:29.270> solved<00:05:29.570> it'll<00:05:30.410> automatically

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
model problem solved it'll automatically

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.260 
model problem solved it'll automatically
move<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:31.910> tales<00:05:32.180> from<00:05:32.450> over<00:05:32.840> here<00:05:33.850> in<00:05:34.850> the

move the tales from over here in the
first<00:05:35.510> UV<00:05:35.750> space<00:05:35.960> okay<00:05:36.530> so<00:05:37.310> it<00:05:37.430> works<00:05:37.640> in

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:37.820 
first UV space okay so it works in

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:39.670 
first UV space okay so it works in
ninety<00:05:38.300> names<00:05:38.479> of<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.840> engines<00:05:39.110> I<00:05:39.260> don't<00:05:39.560> know

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
ninety names of the engines I don't know

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.140 
ninety names of the engines I don't know
an<00:05:39.770> engine<00:05:40.010> that<00:05:40.040> actually<00:05:40.460> automatically

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
an engine that actually automatically

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.909
