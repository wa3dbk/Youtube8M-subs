you have a PC and you're using Windows
to<00:00:28.109> create<00:00:28.439> an<00:00:29.220> engine<00:00:29.760> for<00:00:29.910> example<00:00:30.359> there<00:00:30.900> is

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
to create an engine for example there is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.930 
to create an engine for example there is
two<00:00:31.140> things<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> need<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> know<00:00:31.800> first<00:00:32.369> that

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
two things you need to know first that

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
you don't need to install a different

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.250 
you don't need to install a different
language<00:00:34.680> or<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.399> your<00:00:35.550> keyboard<00:00:35.940> or<00:00:36.030> have<00:00:36.210> a

keyboard secondly that you need to type
a<00:00:41.280> combination<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> keys<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.510> order<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.899> type

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
a combination of keys in order to type

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.279 
a combination of keys in order to type
DNA<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.520> course<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.090> could<00:00:45.210> always<00:00:45.690> copy<00:00:46.110> and

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
DNA of course you could always copy and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.970 
DNA of course you could always copy and
paste<00:00:46.530> from<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> web<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.820> test<00:00:48.329> DD<00:00:48.960> all<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
paste from the web and test DD all the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.000 
paste from the web and test DD all the
way<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.600> many<00:00:51.600> people<00:00:51.899> used<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.230> may<00:00:52.739> find

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
way that many people used to may find

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.860 
way that many people used to may find
that<00:00:53.160> simpler<00:00:53.640> but<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.420> think<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:54.750> is<00:00:54.840> even

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that simpler but I think this is even

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
that simpler but I think this is even
easier<00:00:55.199> if<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.649> can<00:00:55.800> remember<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.250> codes<00:00:56.460> so

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
easier if you can remember the codes so

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.569 
easier if you can remember the codes so
all<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.109> first<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.649> press<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
all you have to do first is press the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.130 
all you have to do first is press the
Alt<00:00:59.789> key<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.329> while<00:01:00.629> you're<00:01:00.809> pressing<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
Alt key press still the numbers that

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.929 
Alt key press still the numbers that
correspond<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> character<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.670> want<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
correspond to the character you want to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.969 
correspond to the character you want to
add<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.020> example<00:01:07.380> let's<00:01:07.500> keep<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> exact

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
add so for example let's keep the exact

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.679 
add so for example let's keep the exact
example<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.549> Nu<00:01:08.880> I'm<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.510> scroll

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
example of the Nu I'm going to scroll

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.690 
example of the Nu I'm going to scroll
down<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.619> all<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.040> codes<00:01:11.369> for

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
down here so you see all the codes for

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.359 
down here so you see all the codes for
the<00:01:11.820> different<00:01:12.150> letters<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.010> case<00:01:14.220> we

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the different letters in this case we

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.420 
the different letters in this case we
will<00:01:14.490> focus<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.030> Nu<00:01:15.439> now<00:01:16.439> before<00:01:17.159> you<00:01:17.280> do

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
will focus on the Nu now before you do

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.359 
will focus on the Nu now before you do
this<00:01:17.869> take<00:01:18.869> into<00:01:19.140> consideration<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.799> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
this take into consideration that it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.630 
this take into consideration that it
only<00:01:20.670> works<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.470> number<00:01:23.040> pad<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.580> your

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
only works with the number pad in your

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.030 
only works with the number pad in your
keyboard<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:24.960> when<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> type<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:25.680> numbers<00:01:25.920> you

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
keyboard so when you type in numbers you

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.410 
keyboard so when you type in numbers you
have<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.189> use<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> number<00:01:26.759> pad<00:01:26.790> for<00:01:27.240> some

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
have to use the number pad for some

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
have to use the number pad for some
reason<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.900> doesn't<00:01:28.080> work<00:01:28.380> with<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.130> numbers

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
reason it doesn't work with the numbers

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.490 
reason it doesn't work with the numbers
on<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:30.060> left<00:01:30.270> side<00:01:30.479> of<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> keyboard<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
on the left side of the keyboard the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.060 
on the left side of the keyboard the
ones<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:33.570> exclamation<00:01:34.140> point<00:01:34.170> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
ones that have the exclamation point the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.969 
ones that have the exclamation point the
add<00:01:35.220> accepted<00:01:36.000> etc<00:01:36.360> so<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.439> number<00:01:37.680> pad<00:01:37.829> has

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
add accepted etc so the number pad has

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.789 
add accepted etc so the number pad has
to<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.220> used<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:39.150> final<00:01:39.630> thing<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.680> you

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
to be used the final thing is that you

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.740 
to be used the final thing is that you
have<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> remember<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.640> also<00:01:42.030> some

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
have to remember is that also some

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.450 
have to remember is that also some
applications<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.070> press<00:01:44.310> the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
applications you have to press the

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.010 
applications you have to press the
number<00:01:44.700> lock<00:01:44.909> so<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> number<00:01:45.509> lock<00:01:45.630> has<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.930> be

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
number lock so the number lock has to be

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.920 
number lock so the number lock has to be
on<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:46.890> your<00:01:47.040> number<00:01:47.310> pad<00:01:47.490> inputs<00:01:48.479> numbers

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
on so your number pad inputs numbers

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.620 
on so your number pad inputs numbers
other<00:01:49.799> applications<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:50.970> try<00:01:51.390> like
