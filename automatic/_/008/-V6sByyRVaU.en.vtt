have a little problem with tangling at
the<00:01:22.500> very<00:01:22.890> back<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.640> hair<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.049> believe

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the very back of the hair but I believe

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.230 
the very back of the hair but I believe
that's<00:01:25.439> normal<00:01:25.860> because<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.430> problem

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that's normal because I have a problem

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.690 
that's normal because I have a problem
with<00:01:27.630> putting<00:01:27.810> a<00:01:28.020> lot<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.290> hair<00:01:29.070> at<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> very

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
with putting a lot of hair at the very

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.330 
with putting a lot of hair at the very
back<00:01:30.409> whenever<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.590> saw<00:01:31.860> my<00:01:32.009> hair<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.700> um

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
back whenever I saw my hair in and um

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.429 
back whenever I saw my hair in and um
there<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.579> shedding<00:01:36.030> but<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> believe<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.229> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
there is shedding but I believe that the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.740 
there is shedding but I believe that the
shedding<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.009> I'm<00:01:38.299> experiencing<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.509> my

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
shedding that I'm experiencing is my

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.859 
shedding that I'm experiencing is my
fault<00:01:40.049> because<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.560> cut<00:01:41.159> my<00:01:41.310> lips<00:01:41.520> what<00:01:42.270> reason

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
fault because I cut my lips what reason

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.480 
fault because I cut my lips what reason
I<00:01:42.990> don't<00:01:43.049> know<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.530> never<00:01:43.680> really

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
I don't know I never really

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.249 
I don't know I never really
cut<00:01:44.759> my<00:01:44.909> love<00:01:45.119> with<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.540> side<00:01:45.810> for<00:01:46.110> some

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
cut my love with this side for some

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.630 
cut my love with this side for some
reason<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.680> cut<00:01:47.070> my<00:01:47.220> wealth<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:49.520> like<00:01:50.520> it

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
reason I just cut my wealth I like it

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.010 
reason I just cut my wealth I like it
lays<00:01:50.820> better<00:01:51.090> when<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.329> cut<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.600> but<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.780> should

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
lays better when I cut it but I should

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.929 
lays better when I cut it but I should
never<00:01:52.259> should<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.159> cut<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.490> because<00:01:53.640> this

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
never should have cut it because this

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.310 
never should have cut it because this
isn't<00:01:54.270> straight<00:01:54.450> hair<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.720> this<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.020> curly
