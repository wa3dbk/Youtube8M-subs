it<00:01:59.790> what's<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.210> ISO<00:02:00.630> setting<00:02:00.869> otherwise<00:02:01.619> and

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
it what's the ISO setting otherwise and

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.560 
it what's the ISO setting otherwise and
some<00:02:02.280> older<00:02:02.579> cameras<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.090> had<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.329> tell<00:02:03.540> it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
some older cameras you had to tell it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.660 
some older cameras you had to tell it
with<00:02:03.780> ice<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.409> don't<00:02:05.040> know<00:02:05.219> if<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.549> do

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
with ice so I don't know if you can do

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.429 
with ice so I don't know if you can do
any<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.180> push<00:02:06.390> processing<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.229> this

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
any kind of push processing with this

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.619 
any kind of push processing with this
camera<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.069> never<00:02:08.429> really<00:02:08.670> did<00:02:08.819> push<00:02:09.090> back<00:02:09.450> in

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
camera I never really did push back in

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.119 
camera I never really did push back in
the<00:02:09.720> day<00:02:09.899> but<00:02:10.140> that's<00:02:10.259> basically<00:02:10.770> where<00:02:11.039> you

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
the day but that's basically where you

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.690 
the day but that's basically where you
tell<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.520> camera

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
tell the camera

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.290 
tell the camera
you<00:02:12.760> have<00:02:12.940> 200<00:02:14.040> ISO<00:02:15.040> or<00:02:15.280> si<00:02:15.819> when<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.090> really

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
you have 200 ISO or si when you really

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.390 
you have 200 ISO or si when you really
have<00:02:16.420> a<00:02:16.450> hundred<00:02:16.690> or<00:02:16.959> four<00:02:17.080> hundred<00:02:17.140> so<00:02:17.620> so<00:02:18.220> on

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
have a hundred or four hundred so so on

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.619 
have a hundred or four hundred so so on
it's<00:02:18.670> kind<00:02:18.849> of<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.180> push<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:20.550> camera<00:02:21.629> anyway

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
it's kind of to push the camera anyway

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.839 
it's kind of to push the camera anyway
push<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.290> film<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:24.250> has<00:02:24.340> to<00:02:24.489> be<00:02:24.580> processed

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
push the film and it has to be processed

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.430 
push the film and it has to be processed
in<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.269> special<00:02:25.569> way<00:02:25.660> so<00:02:25.690> now<00:02:25.900> what<00:02:26.050> we<00:02:26.110> do<00:02:26.200> is<00:02:26.230> we

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
in a special way so now what we do is we

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.500 
in a special way so now what we do is we
pull<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.069> all<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.220> way<00:02:27.400> over<00:02:27.670> to<00:02:27.819> this<00:02:27.940> red<00:02:28.209> dot

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
pull it all the way over to this red dot

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.080 
pull it all the way over to this red dot
and<00:02:28.950> you'll<00:02:29.950> see<00:02:30.160> that<00:02:30.280> there's<00:02:30.489> teeth<00:02:30.760> down

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
and you'll see that there's teeth down

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.860 
and you'll see that there's teeth down
in<00:02:31.300> here<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:32.500> that's<00:02:33.220> where<00:02:33.519> it'll<00:02:34.000> grip<00:02:34.180> and

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
in here and that's where it'll grip and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.780 
in here and that's where it'll grip and
so<00:02:35.260> now<00:02:35.470> we<00:02:35.530> have<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.160> red<00:02:36.310> dot<00:02:36.489> and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
so now we have it to the red dot and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.080 
so now we have it to the red dot and
when<00:02:36.910> we<00:02:37.030> close<00:02:37.300> this<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:41.260> then<00:02:41.319> turn<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.680> on

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
when we close this and then turn it on

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.210 
when we close this and then turn it on
blonde<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.239> on<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:45.489> thinks<00:02:45.760> it's<00:02:45.880> empty<00:02:47.220> it

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
blonde is on it thinks it's empty it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.160 
blonde is on it thinks it's empty it
should<00:02:48.549> load<00:02:50.819> and<00:02:51.819> there<00:02:52.090> it<00:02:52.150> goes<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:53.019> now

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
should load and there it goes so now

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.839 
should load and there it goes so now
it's<00:02:53.440> ready<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.769> take<00:02:53.890> pictures<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.549> don't<00:02:54.610> have

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
it's ready to take pictures I don't have

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.449 
it's ready to take pictures I don't have
a<00:02:54.880> lens<00:02:55.120> on<00:02:55.299> it<00:02:55.329> but<00:02:56.260> if<00:02:56.620> we<00:02:56.799> can<00:02:56.980> zoom<00:02:57.010> in<00:02:57.430> a

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
a lens on it but if we can zoom in a

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.039 
a lens on it but if we can zoom in a
little<00:02:57.640> bit<00:02:57.849> you'll<00:02:58.180> see<00:02:58.209> that<00:02:58.660> instead<00:02:58.870> of

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
little bit you'll see that instead of

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.120 
little bit you'll see that instead of
saying<00:02:59.230> II<00:02:59.530> now<00:02:59.769> it<00:03:00.519> says<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.760> 1<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:02.200> it<00:03:02.380> has<00:03:02.410> film

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
saying II now it says a 1 so it has film

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.870
