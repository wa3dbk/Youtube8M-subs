00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
we've got an insulated top that keeps

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.349 
we've got an insulated top that keeps
the<00:01:30.299> moisture<00:01:30.450> from<00:01:30.810> coming<00:01:31.170> up<00:01:32.329> aware<00:01:33.329> of

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
the moisture from coming up aware of

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.190 
the moisture from coming up aware of
high<00:01:33.780> resiliency<00:01:34.320> phone<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.659> then<00:01:36.659> these<00:01:36.869> are

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
high resiliency phone and then these are

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.029 
high resiliency phone and then these are
the<00:01:37.320> tubes<00:01:37.560> these<00:01:38.100> two<00:01:39.079> way<00:01:40.079> about<00:01:40.319> 50<00:01:40.710> pounds

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:41.039 
the tubes these two way about 50 pounds

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.850 
the tubes these two way about 50 pounds
apiece<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:42.479> carry<00:01:42.780> about<00:01:42.990> six<00:01:43.380> gallons

apiece and they carry about six gallons

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.520 
apiece and they carry about six gallons
of<00:01:43.979> water<00:01:44.189> each<00:01:44.520> tube<00:01:45.240> is<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.569> horizontally<00:01:46.289> so

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
of water each tube is in horizontally so

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.399 
of water each tube is in horizontally so
all<00:01:46.770> your<00:01:47.069> water<00:01:47.280> flow<00:01:48.209> runs<00:01:48.539> head<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.899> toe<00:01:49.079> so

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
all your water flow runs head to toe so

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.770 
all your water flow runs head to toe so
no<00:01:49.590> emotion<00:01:50.069> transfer<00:01:50.459> across<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:50.939> bed<00:01:51.090> each

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
no emotion transfer across the bed each

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.870 
no emotion transfer across the bed each

sure if you can see it but you can fill

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.109 
sure if you can see it but you can fill
each<00:02:00.090> side<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.750> firm<00:02:01.349> as<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.560> would<00:02:01.739> like

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
each side as firm as you would like

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.789 
each side as firm as you would like
another<00:02:03.119> benefit<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.869> tubes<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.530> one

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
another benefit of the tubes is if one

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.979 
another benefit of the tubes is if one
did<00:02:05.039> leak<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.610> would<00:02:05.789> stay<00:02:06.000> inside<00:02:06.539> the

container and it wouldn't even get to
the<00:02:08.970> floor<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.450> even<00:02:09.630> if<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.840> did<00:02:10.019> get<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.289> the
