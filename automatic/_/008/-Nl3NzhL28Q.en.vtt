 Beat Sonic interface cable ifc 14 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.610
 It will be possible if you use this 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:06.560
 When this aiff 14 gathers to the external input terminal of Navi 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.060
 dock cable comes out 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.060
 Connect this and ipod 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.159
 Everyone ask to Mars 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.179

 I would like to install ipod in a car 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:37.670
 I was beat Sonic if 9 bg 8 after the holder 9 ba 19 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:37.670
 I want to use this to fix ipod to this drink holder

 I will insert the stand into this drink folder and turn this dial 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.610
 Therefore 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.610

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.330
