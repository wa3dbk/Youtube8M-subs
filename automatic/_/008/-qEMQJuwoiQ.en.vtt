away on holiday I think it's a 14 to do

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.549 
away on holiday I think it's a 14 to do
so<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.510> long<00:00:48.719> left<00:00:48.930> three<00:00:49.289> weeks<00:00:49.500> near<00:00:50.160> enough

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
so not long left three weeks near enough

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.610 
so not long left three weeks near enough
before<00:00:52.559> oh<00:00:52.770> maybe<00:00:53.399> just<00:00:53.730> three<00:00:54.570> weeks<00:00:54.719> 0<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:55.230> 4

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
before oh maybe just three weeks 0 for 4

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.470 
before oh maybe just three weeks 0 for 4
I<00:00:55.829> don't<00:00:56.160> know<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.550> can't<00:00:57.300> count<00:00:57.590> and<00:00:58.969> I<00:00:59.969> want

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
I don't know I can't count and I want

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.410 
I don't know I can't count and I want
the<00:01:00.960> sims<00:01:01.199> 3<00:01:01.530> finished<00:01:02.309> by<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.910> time<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.359> i

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
the sims 3 finished by that time and i

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.640 
the sims 3 finished by that time and i
also<00:01:03.570> want<00:01:03.920> Fallout<00:01:04.920> finished<00:01:05.189> by<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.150> time

find<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.010> a<00:01:11.070> lot<00:01:11.159> easier<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.700> record<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.770> sims

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
find it a lot easier to record the sims

he'll be much more advanced in terms of

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.270 
he'll be much more advanced in terms of
the<00:02:09.509> story<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:11.629> not<00:02:12.629> really<00:02:12.870> much<00:02:13.080> more<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.500> do

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
the story so not really much more to do

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.500 
the story so not really much more to do
remember<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.370> couple<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:15.909> updates<00:02:16.060> ago<00:02:16.480> I

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
remember the couple of updates ago I

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.479 
remember the couple of updates ago I
talked<00:02:17.469> about<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:19.560> five<00:02:20.560> things<00:02:20.920> that<00:02:21.159> Mike

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
is to do before the selfie finishes and

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.920 
is to do before the selfie finishes and
I<00:02:23.620> picked<00:02:23.890> those<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.370> I've<00:02:24.579> completed<00:02:25.480> the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
I picked those and I've completed the

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.869

of<00:02:38.260> took<00:02:38.349> it<00:02:38.409> down<00:02:38.650> he'll<00:02:38.829> pull<00:02:39.040> MIT<00:02:39.250> as<00:02:39.849> it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
of took it down he'll pull MIT as it

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.170 
of took it down he'll pull MIT as it
technically<00:02:40.599> would<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.920> we<00:02:42.040> need<00:02:42.129> to<00:02:42.219> redo

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
technically would so we need to redo

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.000 
technically would so we need to redo
that<00:02:43.299> one<00:02:43.359> but<00:02:44.019> the<00:02:44.170> marriage<00:02:44.409> has<00:02:44.650> happened

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
that one but the marriage has happened

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.789 
that one but the marriage has happened
just<00:02:45.400> happened<00:02:46.169> Junsu<00:02:47.169> is<00:02:47.200> having<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.590> baby

just happened Junsu is having a baby
it's<00:02:48.159> probably<00:02:48.639> more<00:02:49.090> than<00:02:49.329> likely<00:02:49.569> now

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
it's probably more than likely now

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.470 
it's probably more than likely now
almost<00:02:50.409> certain<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:50.980> that's<00:02:51.189> the<00:02:51.430> case<00:02:51.480> so

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
almost certain that that's the case so

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.270 
almost certain that that's the case so
that's<00:02:52.629> another<00:02:52.870> thing<00:02:53.109> they're<00:02:53.769> about<00:02:54.099> to

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
that's another thing they're about to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.309 
that's another thing they're about to
jet<00:02:54.519> off<00:02:54.549> on<00:02:54.730> honeymoon<00:02:55.180> in<00:02:55.689> the<00:02:55.750> very<00:02:56.230> very

those tasks ticked off which means when

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.289 
those tasks ticked off which means when

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.729 
celebrity status complete his lifetime
goal<00:03:07.959> and<00:03:08.200> that's<00:03:08.769> it<00:03:10.260> wherever<00:03:11.260> we<00:03:11.439> are<00:03:11.590> at

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
goal and that's it wherever we are at

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:13.800 
goal and that's it wherever we are at
the<00:03:11.859> LP<00:03:12.189> when<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.519> happens<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.389> will<00:03:13.510> there

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
the LP when that happens it will there

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.259 
the LP when that happens it will there
enough<00:03:14.049> be<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.469> very<00:03:14.799> very<00:03:15.040> end<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:16.150> be

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
enough be the very very end to be

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.619 
enough be the very very end to be
continued<00:03:16.930> on<00:03:17.169> a<00:03:17.230> later<00:03:17.769> expansion<00:03:18.459> so<00:03:19.120> what

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
continued on a later expansion so what

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:22.020 
continued on a later expansion so what
though<00:03:19.810> isn't<00:03:20.169> really<00:03:20.799> a<00:03:20.919> groom<00:03:21.370> you<00:03:21.579> know<00:03:21.729> not

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
though isn't really a groom you know not

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.699 
though isn't really a groom you know not
too<00:03:22.389> much<00:03:22.629> longer<00:03:22.900> than<00:03:23.169> I<00:03:23.319> reckon<00:03:23.590> it's

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
too much longer than I reckon it's

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.770 
too much longer than I reckon it's
probably<00:03:24.099> about<00:03:24.250> if<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.579> look<00:03:24.669> at<00:03:24.790> Sims<00:03:25.419> game

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
probably about if you look at Sims game

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.110 
probably about if you look at Sims game
days<00:03:26.109> I<00:03:26.260> think<00:03:26.290> maybe<00:03:26.709> we<00:03:26.979> could<00:03:27.129> achieve<00:03:27.549> all

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
days I think maybe we could achieve all

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.280 
days I think maybe we could achieve all
of<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.859> in<00:03:29.859> about<00:03:30.250> seven<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:31.299> ten<00:03:31.569> sim<00:03:31.930> days

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
of that in about seven to ten sim days

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.170 
of that in about seven to ten sim days
and<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.560> think<00:03:32.590> usually<00:03:33.400> an<00:03:33.459> update<00:03:33.819> set<00:03:34.060> of

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
and I think usually an update set of

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.270 
and I think usually an update set of
update<00:03:34.479> of<00:03:34.840> sort<00:03:35.109> of<00:03:35.169> video<00:03:35.590> say<00:03:35.979> three<00:03:36.250> or

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
update of sort of video say three or

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.490 
update of sort of video say three or
four<00:03:36.579> video<00:03:36.790> update<00:03:37.120> usually<00:03:37.540> lasts<00:03:37.930> one<00:03:38.199> sim

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
four video update usually lasts one sim

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.319 
four video update usually lasts one sim
day<00:03:38.739> they<00:03:39.370> lock<00:03:39.549> in<00:03:39.699> with<00:03:39.729> the<00:03:40.000> region<00:03:40.269> of

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
day they lock in with the region of

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.899 
day they lock in with the region of
about<00:03:40.449> thirty<00:03:40.840> videos<00:03:41.319> so<00:03:42.310> at<00:03:42.609> the<00:03:42.699> end<00:03:42.729> of

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:42.909 
about thirty videos so at the end of

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:47.869 
about thirty videos so at the end of
this<00:03:42.970> set<00:03:43.269> of<00:03:45.569> end<00:03:46.569> of<00:03:46.659> this<00:03:46.720> next<00:03:46.989> week

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
this set of end of this next week

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.999 
this set of end of this next week
probably<00:03:48.879> looking<00:03:49.209> at<00:03:49.269> roughly<00:03:49.810> between<00:03:50.229> 20

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:51.009 
probably looking at roughly between 20

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:54.509 
probably looking at roughly between 20
and<00:03:51.040> 25<00:03:51.340> sim<00:03:52.299> videos<00:03:52.689> going<00:03:53.019> up<00:03:53.259> so<00:03:54.040> we<00:03:54.250> might

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
and 25 sim videos going up so we might

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:57.960 
and 25 sim videos going up so we might
finish<00:03:54.819> it<00:03:55.060> into<00:03:55.810> this<00:03:55.930> week<00:03:56.169> if<00:03:56.409> not<00:03:56.790> then<00:03:57.790> it

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
finish it into this week if not then it

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.520 
finish it into this week if not then it
will<00:03:58.060> definitely<00:03:58.509> be<00:03:58.689> like<00:03:59.319> the<00:03:59.409> next

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
will definitely be like the next

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.030 
will definitely be like the next
rotation<00:03:59.909> so<00:04:00.909> that's<00:04:01.569> pretty<00:04:02.560> much<00:04:02.680> it<00:04:02.799> if
