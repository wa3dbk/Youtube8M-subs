00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.389 

and<00:00:37.320> we've<00:00:37.469> worked<00:00:37.620> really<00:00:37.739> hard<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
and we've worked really hard with the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.240 
and we've worked really hard with the
tracks<00:00:38.640> adventure<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.449> create<00:00:40.230> basically<00:00:40.829> a

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
tracks adventure to create basically a

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.229 
tracks adventure to create basically a
super<00:00:42.059> lightweight<00:00:42.719> case<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.239> actually

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
super lightweight case that is actually

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.639 
super lightweight case that is actually
really<00:00:46.170> durable<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.620> strong<00:00:47.000> waterproof<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
really durable and strong waterproof and

00:00:48.649 --> 00:01:00.460 
really durable and strong waterproof and
looks<00:00:49.649> great<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.129> bike

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.470 

so<00:01:01.010> one<00:01:01.250> way<00:01:01.400> we<00:01:01.430> can<00:01:01.760> increase<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.329> strength

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
so one way we can increase the strength

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.600 
so one way we can increase the strength
of<00:01:02.810> the<00:01:02.960> case<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:03.470> durability<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:04.040> lot<00:01:04.339> without

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
of the case and durability a lot without

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.680 
of the case and durability a lot without
increasing<00:01:05.479> the<00:01:05.840> weight<00:01:06.080> is<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:07.479> create<00:01:08.479> many

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
increasing the weight is to create many

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.800 
increasing the weight is to create many
areas<00:01:09.410> of<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.620> case<00:01:09.830> that<00:01:10.070> are<00:01:10.280> formed<00:01:10.910> metal

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
areas of the case that are formed metal

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:32.640 
areas of the case that are formed metal

a complete radicular the concept to

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.880 
a complete radicular the concept to

but is about again a VM so the 3d form

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.220 
but is about again a VM so the 3d form
increases<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.610> strength<00:02:12.880> quite<00:02:13.240> a<00:02:13.300> bit<00:02:13.540> and
