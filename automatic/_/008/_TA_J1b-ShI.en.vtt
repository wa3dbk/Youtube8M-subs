00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.680 
there oh good I can't plant the torch
here<00:03:47.430> because<00:03:47.640> I'm<00:03:47.700> apparently<00:03:47.940> above<00:03:48.450> the

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
here because I'm apparently above the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.980 
here because I'm apparently above the
top<00:03:49.320> level<00:03:49.850> but<00:03:50.850> ok<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.120> this<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.540> interesting

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
top level but ok so this is interesting

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.760 
top level but ok so this is interesting
so<00:03:52.140> there<00:03:52.290> seems<00:03:52.410> to<00:03:52.650> be<00:03:52.770> a<00:03:52.800> magma<00:03:53.459> see<00:03:54.500> up<00:03:55.500> on

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
so there seems to be a magma see up on

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.630 
so there seems to be a magma see up on
top<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.070> everything<00:03:56.310> here<00:03:58.190> different<00:03:59.190> than

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
top of everything here different than

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.620 
top of everything here different than
the<00:03:59.940> other<00:04:00.180> magma<00:04:00.959> see<00:04:01.940> so<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:02.970> wonder<00:04:03.209> how<00:04:03.360> far

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
the other magma see so I wonder how far

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.170 
the other magma see so I wonder how far
I<00:04:03.660> can<00:04:03.840> run<00:04:04.290> in<00:04:04.650> this<00:04:04.860> direction<00:04:05.100> here<00:04:05.580> before

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
I can run in this direction here before

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.910 
I can run in this direction here before
I<00:04:06.209> start<00:04:06.690> running<00:04:06.870> into<00:04:08.150> you<00:04:09.150> know<00:04:09.270> where<00:04:09.920> how

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
I start running into you know where how

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:16.159 
I start running into you know where how

big is this area this is like ungodly
large<00:04:16.579> so<00:04:17.579> am<00:04:17.730> I<00:04:17.790> going<00:04:17.910> to<00:04:18.000> be<00:04:18.090> able<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.299> look

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
large so am I going to be able to look

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.539 
large so am I going to be able to look
down<00:04:18.450> at<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.810> taco<00:04:19.049> there<00:04:19.440> yep<00:04:19.769> so<00:04:20.130> okay<00:04:20.489> so

down at the taco there yep so okay so
there's<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:21.060> taco<00:04:23.540> so<00:04:24.540> I<00:04:24.570> guess<00:04:24.690> I'm<00:04:24.930> getting

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
there's the taco so I guess I'm getting

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.300 
there's the taco so I guess I'm getting
a<00:04:25.200> two-for-one<00:04:25.830> deal<00:04:26.100> on<00:04:26.430> my<00:04:27.860> surveillance<00:04:28.860> or

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
a two-for-one deal on my surveillance or

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.010 
a two-for-one deal on my surveillance or
reconnoitering<00:04:30.060> I<00:04:32.540> wonder<00:04:33.540> if<00:04:33.660> it<00:04:33.750> be<00:04:33.870> any

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
reconnoitering I wonder if it be any

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.110 
reconnoitering I wonder if it be any
faster<00:04:34.530> to<00:04:34.650> try<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.010> go<00:04:35.100> down<00:04:35.280> this<00:04:35.550> way<00:04:35.610> on

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
faster to try and go down this way on

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.680 
faster to try and go down this way on
the<00:04:36.690> taco<00:04:40.760> that's<00:04:41.760> probably<00:04:42.120> a<00:04:42.180> nightmare

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
the taco that's probably a nightmare

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.150 
trying to climb down that edge out and I
don't<00:04:46.200> know<00:04:46.290> that<00:04:46.530> I'd<00:04:46.620> be<00:04:46.770> doing<00:04:46.979> me<00:04:47.100> any

this whole chamber is whatever's in here

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.820 
this whole chamber is whatever's in here
must<00:04:54.120> be<00:04:54.180> massive<00:04:54.780> so<00:04:54.960> it's<00:04:55.140> pretty<00:04:55.350> obvious

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
must be massive so it's pretty obvious

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
huh well I am wondering if there are

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.800 
huh well I am wondering if there are

taco<00:05:32.290> area<00:05:32.770> from<00:05:33.250> above<00:05:35.970> but<00:05:36.970> I<00:05:37.470> feel<00:05:38.470> like

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
taco area from above but I feel like

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.920 
taco area from above but I feel like
it's<00:05:38.889> more<00:05:39.070> likely<00:05:39.370> that<00:05:39.790> i<00:05:40.210> will<00:05:40.330> just<00:05:40.630> fall

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
it's more likely that i will just fall

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.270 
it's more likely that i will just fall
