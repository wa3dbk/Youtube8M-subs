 actions that at first glance are not seen through a computerized system 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.380

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.759
 to tell us at home consists of the analysis of standing the hand 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:32.350
 22 percent 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.380
 that lets you so announced 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.860
 the rest of the part time 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.240
 when the environment minamb 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.770

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.730
 this type to people or to perform this treatment 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.399
 all kinds of people can do the analysis that has 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.519
 through that nation 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:54.620
 my diagnosis 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.400
 since it allows to take computer photography came with the skin 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.310
 totally clean 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.210
 what are the results that they show and with what products we can 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.010

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.960
 percent and visuals 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.829
 because the machines feed with a scare juan 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:13.370
 with more than 100 thousand people 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.380
 that this same analysis has been made effective 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.830
 and that machine what it does is that through the censors 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.970
 evaluate and compare how your skin is facing this world 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.350
 the people who have already signed up ferrer 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.330
 why this machine 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
 what he does is real and elle magazine 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.380

 Heras has indicated to take some pictures when they are taken and for what 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.700
 you take three rooms with different types of not being because we're going to see your 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.049
 skin the machine is going to show us are internal damages therefore we must 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.620
 have specific lights for that 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.650
 nothing else external 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.080
 if we're going to see some external damage lines of expression manchester is what 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.830
 that we really want to see are those internal damages that are causing 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.830
 some external agents in our skin 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:12.090
 We can see it done by anyone with any type of skin

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:28.220
 the skin in age 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.529

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:44.379

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.749
 through this concept is that the woman 

00:03:00.749 --> 00:03:02.869
 feel proud

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:11.219
 phases and stages of life 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.680
