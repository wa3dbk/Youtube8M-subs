00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.130
 well I think it has been 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:08.590
 makes a complicated stage for the 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.910
 puncture or the breakdown that I had in the 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:14.790
 low applied went fifth in the group 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.860
 I all perfect but good I 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.350
 punctured and has given me 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.540
 the wheel was going to overrun the rear 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:26.400
 It takes longer to change and I 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:29.480
 cut my team covered all have 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.150
 burst to throw for me was doing 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.570
 180 pulsations 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.890
 on the plain and I have seen that he has the 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.620
 group in front have been put on top for 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:47.250
 to make differences and good since it goes 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:50.610
 to be a day a complicated day then 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.680
 in the mortirolo I focused to come to me 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.800
 my rhythm know that was against 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.800
 the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.310
 that he could not lose his cool and good in 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.550
 how much of the walk 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:09.000
 I do not see normal that the already 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.620
 attacked maybe Astana has abandoned 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.800
 a little to your leader but good everyone 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:20.160
 he makes his decisions in during during 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.330
 the race but good I see normal well the 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.220
 attack of the walk for me because I see what 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.670
 What I think is week has done a job 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.230
 incredible has not been very strong in 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.630
 normal conditions would have won him 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.890
 but good at the end of cycling every time 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.960
 is that he does not have the interests of 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.460
 everyone has other interests and I 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.110
 respect and I believe that when I have seen what 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.030
 that is left to start the mortirolo and 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.650
 this that the astana were organized by 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.950
 in front of 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.590
 I knew I was going to start with time 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.150
 lost 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.710
 d 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.030
 the problem is not to start with you 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.160
 lost the problem is that when you get 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.510
 it comes as if you had started the 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.510
 port or 10 km before 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.180
 so good in that sense 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.010
 I thought about how difficult it is for me 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.200
 I was posing what 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.970
 it was 45 kilometers ahead of this 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.690
 goal in which I could not have 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:26.569
 a failure or a pÃ¡jara and then 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.370
 on the other hand 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.829
 I knew it was a challenge what they had told me 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.580
 put ahead and then as for the 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.910
 walk 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.740
 the truth that is a broker that is 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.550
 walking very strong here in the turn 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.490
 got two stage wins 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.880
 and the truth is that good what 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:52.220
 if it will be necessary to see how he goes later in 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.940
 other races apart in the spin but 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.710
 if then you have a good future I 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.940
 I think my team have been 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:02.520
 extraordinary 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.440
 when we have started 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.910
 when we have started to raise the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.120
 hammer we call it an average watt 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.780
 amazing 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.750
 in my team has been taking command of 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:19.330
 the race from the first day that he has 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.810
 started this turn of italy and there are times 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.720
 that people forget about it 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.050
 it's only pruning a 10 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.090
 to each and every one of my colleagues if 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.120
 I have this mary thanks to them 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.480
 I knew that in this situation the most 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.260
 probable is that 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.370
 what will happen what happened 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.840
 I'm not going to enter to debate if it is 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.510
 correct if it is not correct 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.780
 the only thing that focused me has been on 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.240
 I personally think that giving today is not 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.300
 is happy 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.070
 I've done it with 34 30 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.450
 changed the bicycle the ivan wheel 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:03.360
 Basso because it had the same development 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.480
 that I and we have changed it 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.370
 and good only to say that I feel 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.910
 proud of being the protagonist of a 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.910
 stage like today
