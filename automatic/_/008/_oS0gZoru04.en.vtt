00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
gonna come sit outside and I think you'd

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.550

be<00:01:18.240> prepared<00:01:18.689> you've<00:01:19.020> been<00:01:19.140> putting<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
be prepared you've been putting in the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.870 
be prepared you've been putting in the
work<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.950> want<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.580> comes<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
work you want that that comes to the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.120 
work you want that that comes to the
outside<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.600> get<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.900> recognition<00:01:22.140> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
outside you can get that recognition so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.030 
outside you can get that recognition so
don't<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.460> trying<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> avoid<00:01:24.600> pressure

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
don't be trying to avoid pressure

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.990 
don't be trying to avoid pressure
actually<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.130> could<00:01:26.220> try<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.460> go<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> pressure

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
actually you could try to go to pressure

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.340 
actually you could try to go to pressure
that's<00:01:27.420> going<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> take<00:01:27.720> everything<00:01:28.020> you've
