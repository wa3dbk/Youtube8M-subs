00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.170
 I'm 27 years old 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.420
 show business what is that 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.750
 success secret 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:34.730
 if I could if I knew it 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.840
 no no rules or no no 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.660
 success secret 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.130
 you can work it and and and 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.440
 to deliver honest work 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.829
 maybe that's not what they are 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.350
 production which show what a pity 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:50.590

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.780
 on-line 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.980
 so i could never care if now 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.090
 which producer comes from germany 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.540
 and say you do the German 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.760
 schlager then whoever it would not 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.290
 end succeeded because I believe that can 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.390
 not selling it so i mean it 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.760
 not from the sale of i feel that 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.670
 not and always believe the music makes 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.840
 the one feels then know that the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.840
 ladder and of course also appreciated 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.250
 with these away 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.670

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.540
 you already have a bit 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.689
 went into the musical life made something 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.670
 is a test for the first time 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.290
 beautiful a nice mental because 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.050
 I never had an acting education 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.479

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.020
 will you so that then have even 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.880
 that is a natural talent 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.210
 is that something nice and it is 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.890
 of course, a spiritual incentive to 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.530
 song lyrics to learn and roll to 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.960
 learning where to play at the same time 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.720
 Practice activities must learn courses 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.130
 must be something else and it is 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.890
 a challenge and a beautiful one 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.700
 challenge and down brings 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.700
 change in my life 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.500
 you are most of the rock'n'roll 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.330
 also prescribed what is the reason 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.680
 been for it 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.780
 coincidence that was really coincidence I am 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.910
 actually a child of the 70s mine 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.190
 my childhood my youth was the 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.099
 70s the disco time was rock'n roll 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.130
 not so mega in chic stevens 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:13.540
 came on but I was in the 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.150
 school asked yes we do one 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.920
 school band played and the part which 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.260
 music direction and they have rock'n roll 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.269
 suggested and then I bought myself 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.810
 my first LP from jerry 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:28.120
 lee lewis and the virus has seized me 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.360
 and it is part of my life 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.360
 become 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:08.670
 marked point to burn out syndrome 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:09.659
 how did you cope it was 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.989
 not a funny time 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.040
 that is clear many have said hey as 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.430
 musician and how can you as a musician 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.139
 bern only has the pressure under us 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.139
 or I myself of course 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.880
 also apply it in general if you are in 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.889
 The public stands when I'm out 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.220
 go anywhere house does not confess 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:31.759
 Under observation that is once 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.759
 huge battlefield 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:44.850
 At some point, the whole thing was too much and 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.590
 Back then I was saying I am 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.810
 a human i can handle very well 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.260
 animals and when I feel bad 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.970
 then I'll look for a country where I am 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.160
 where I'm all alone with the landscape 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.890
 and with her and I am after that 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.480
 that was diagnosed after 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.010
 Central Africa gone after me 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.290
 for the seventh time the movie gorillas im 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:06.510
 mist viewed by preferring 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.030
 the mountain gorilla project started and 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:12.140
 I remember the loneliest spots 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.140
 to go to this planet 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.870
 He waited so long until he finally 

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:30.780
 has been really hungry for the stage 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.340
 changed my environment 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.930
 both now in the management area as well 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.249
 I am also more in the musical field 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.539
 gone on the entertainment track 

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:42.340
 and object ok word so long until it 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:47.199
 just the body says i want to go back 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:50.580
 and was a fun time though 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:50.580
 maybe something important to me 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.020
 a beautiful came with andy long 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.879
 and his band spent many 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.000
