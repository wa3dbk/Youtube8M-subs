00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
I recommend water-based water-based is

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.510 
I recommend water-based water-based is
non-toxic<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:03.210> easy<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.689> clean<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:05.189> with

non-toxic it's easy to clean up and with

non-toxic it's easy to clean up and with

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
Clean Air Act oils are hard to get

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.820 
Clean Air Act oils are hard to get
anyway<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:13.050> certain<00:02:13.379> things

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
anyway for certain things

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.940 
anyway for certain things
so<00:02:14.280> this<00:02:15.090> is<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.300> much<00:02:15.540> nicer<00:02:15.780> solution<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.920> a

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
so this is a much nicer solution to a

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.050 
so this is a much nicer solution to a
lot<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.460> things<00:02:17.960> glaze<00:02:18.960> looks<00:02:19.380> white<00:02:19.910> but<00:02:20.910> it's

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
lot of things glaze looks white but it's

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.300 
lot of things glaze looks white but it's
actually<00:02:21.570> clear<00:02:21.930> see<00:02:22.650> it<00:02:22.920> just<00:02:23.100> goes

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
actually clear see it just goes

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.150 
actually clear see it just goes
completely<00:02:23.610> away<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:25.140> it's<00:02:25.410> nothing<00:02:26.040> more

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
completely away so it's nothing more

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.670 
completely away so it's nothing more
than<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.460> translucent<00:02:27.300> medium<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:28.200> helps<00:02:28.560> you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
than a translucent medium that helps you

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.200 
than a translucent medium that helps you
move<00:02:29.990> move<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.260> color<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.460> you'll<00:02:32.640> pour<00:02:32.910> some

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
move move the color so you'll pour some

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.840 
move move the color so you'll pour some
of<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.480> into<00:02:34.050> a<00:02:34.080> mixture<00:02:34.740> so<00:02:35.070> what<00:02:35.760> you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
of that into a mixture so what you

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.540 
of that into a mixture so what you
basically<00:02:36.150> end<00:02:36.630> up<00:02:36.780> wanting<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.170> do<00:02:37.350> is<00:02:37.680> just

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
basically end up wanting to do is just

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.580 
basically end up wanting to do is just
put<00:02:38.850> a<00:02:38.880> little<00:02:38.970> bit<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:39.540> your<00:02:39.810> color<00:02:40.140> in

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.410 

usually<00:02:43.590> I<00:02:43.620> figure<00:02:44.220> with<00:02:44.490> house<00:02:44.910> paint<00:02:45.300> you

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
usually I figure with house paint you

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.970 
usually I figure with house paint you
want<00:02:45.570> to<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.750> conservative<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.560> probably

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
want to be conservative you probably

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.860 
want to be conservative you probably
don't<00:02:47.250> want<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:47.490> put<00:02:47.550> more<00:02:47.850> than<00:02:47.910> about<00:02:48.330> 25

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
don't want to put more than about 25

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.050 
don't want to put more than about 25
percent<00:02:49.350> into<00:02:49.620> 75<00:02:50.130> percent<00:02:50.460> of<00:02:50.520> glaze<00:02:50.760> to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
percent into 75 percent of glaze to

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.330 
percent into 75 percent of glaze to
start<00:02:51.330> with<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:52.290> see<00:02:52.530> how<00:02:52.709> it's<00:02:52.980> going<00:02:53.220> to

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
start with to see how it's going to

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.730 
start with to see how it's going to
react<00:02:53.670> because<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.630> may<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.320> in<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.530> case

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
react because it may be and in this case

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.770 
react because it may be and in this case
it's<00:02:55.950> really<00:02:56.130> thickening<00:02:56.610> up<00:02:56.760> my<00:02:56.910> glaze<00:02:57.240> you

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
it's really thickening up my glaze you

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.210 
it's really thickening up my glaze you
may<00:02:58.020> have<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.410> water<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.709> down<00:03:00.920> but<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.010> can

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
may have to water it down but you can

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.000 
may have to water it down but you can
see<00:03:02.459> how<00:03:02.670> it's<00:03:02.880> moving<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.170> is<00:03:04.350> actually

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
see how it's moving so this is actually

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.650 
see how it's moving so this is actually
a<00:03:05.040> good<00:03:05.370> consistency<00:03:06.060> what<00:03:06.360> I<00:03:06.390> would

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
a good consistency what I would

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.810 
a good consistency what I would
recommend<00:03:06.810> with<00:03:07.380> house<00:03:07.590> paint<00:03:08.010> after<00:03:08.550> doing

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
recommend with house paint after doing

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.449 
recommend with house paint after doing
that<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.420> having<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.470> little<00:03:10.770> bit<00:03:10.890> of<00:03:10.980> water<00:03:11.220> go

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
that is having a little bit of water go

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:18.320 
that is having a little bit of water go
into<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:15.830> to<00:03:16.830> keep<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.250> moving<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:18.120> that

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
into it just to keep it moving so that

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.410 
into it just to keep it moving so that
you're<00:03:18.480> not<00:03:21.800> so<00:03:22.800> it's<00:03:22.950> not<00:03:23.070> you<00:03:23.580> need<00:03:23.970> your

see<00:03:27.959> how<00:03:28.110> messy<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.500> am<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:28.860> already<00:03:29.070> flying

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
see how messy I am it's already flying

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.690 
see how messy I am it's already flying
all<00:03:29.519> over<00:03:29.550> the<00:03:29.760> place<00:03:29.850> but<00:03:30.830> once<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:32.130> once

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
all over the place but once you once

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.790 
all over the place but once you once
you've<00:03:32.880> got<00:03:33.120> that<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.840> you've<00:03:34.170> decide<00:03:34.590> you

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
you've got that and you've decide you

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.540 
you've got that and you've decide you
like<00:03:35.040> it

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
like it

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.910 
like it
you<00:03:36.239> can<00:03:36.390> see<00:03:36.660> that<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.140> its

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
you can see that you can its

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.920 
you can see that you can its
manipulative<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.970> can<00:03:39.269> do<00:03:39.420> whatever<00:03:39.630> you

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
manipulative you can do whatever you

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.670 
manipulative you can do whatever you
want<00:03:40.110> with<00:03:40.290> it<00:03:40.489> so<00:03:41.489> that<00:03:42.300> is<00:03:42.570> how<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:43.230> glaze

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
want with it so that is how a glaze

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.890 
want with it so that is how a glaze
works<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.280> it<00:03:44.640> works<00:03:44.880> with<00:03:45.090> any<00:03:45.360> house<00:03:45.630> paint

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
works and it works with any house paint

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.780 
works and it works with any house paint
this<00:03:46.019> way<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.440> works<00:03:46.590> with<00:03:46.769> any<00:03:46.950> acrylics<00:03:47.550> this

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
this way it works with any acrylics this

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.180 
this way it works with any acrylics this
way<00:03:48.030> as<00:03:48.870> long<00:03:48.930> as<00:03:49.260> you're<00:03:49.380> staying<00:03:49.560> water<00:03:49.920> to

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
way as long as you're staying water to

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.930 
way as long as you're staying water to
water<00:03:50.430> you're<00:03:50.760> fine<00:03:52.100> you<00:03:53.100> could<00:03:53.250> probably<00:03:53.489> put

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
water you're fine you could probably put

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.970 
water you're fine you could probably put
watercolor<00:03:54.480> in<00:03:54.720> and<00:03:55.050> be<00:03:55.200> fine<00:03:55.410> because<00:03:55.590> this

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
watercolor in and be fine because this

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.860 
watercolor in and be fine because this
medium<00:03:56.400> will<00:03:56.550> then<00:03:56.730> bind<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.390> watercolor

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
medium will then bind the watercolor

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.620 
medium will then bind the watercolor
into<00:03:58.320> it<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.620> tend<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.340> use<00:03:59.400> acrylics<00:04:00.000> or

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
into it I tend to use acrylics or

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.810 
into it I tend to use acrylics or
specific<00:04:01.470> paints<00:04:01.800> that<00:04:01.890> are<00:04:01.980> made<00:04:02.250> straight
