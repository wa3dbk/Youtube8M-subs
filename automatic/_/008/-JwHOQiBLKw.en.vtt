00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
then let's see what else is the actual

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.310 
then let's see what else is the actual
the<00:02:12.060> actual<00:02:12.240> art<00:02:12.900> back<00:02:14.480> counselor<00:02:15.480> want<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:16.140> be

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
the actual art back counselor want to be

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:25.930 
the actual art back counselor want to be
nice<00:02:17.100> and<00:02:17.130> sturdy<00:02:18.470> back<00:02:22.820> here<00:02:23.820> at<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.120> site<00:02:24.510> I

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
nice and sturdy back here at this site I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.430 
nice and sturdy back here at this site I
find<00:02:26.940> another<00:02:27.180> USB<00:02:27.720> cable<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:29.220> is<00:02:30.440> because

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
find another USB cable this is because

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.950 
find another USB cable this is because
that's<00:02:32.310> actually<00:02:32.610> cut<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.090> USB<00:02:33.540> point<00:02:33.840> I

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
that's actually cut the USB point I

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.250 
that's actually cut the USB point I
think<00:02:34.140> if<00:02:34.520> there's<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.610> firmware<00:02:35.970> up<00:02:36.420> greater

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
think if there's a firmware up greater

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.380 
think if there's a firmware up greater
than<00:02:37.650> most<00:02:37.860> probably<00:02:38.190> than<00:02:38.400> 112<00:02:38.820> HP<00:02:39.060> firmware

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
than most probably than 112 HP firmware

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.290 
than most probably than 112 HP firmware
sooner<00:02:39.810> or<00:02:39.900> later<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.350> can<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:41.280> plate<00:02:41.970> into<00:02:42.180> the

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
sooner or later I can of plate into the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.480 
sooner or later I can of plate into the
flash<00:02:42.630> by<00:02:42.870> USB<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.830> is<00:02:43.980> something<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.460> really

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
flash by USB this is something I really

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.610 
flash by USB this is something I really
really<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:46.400> as<00:02:47.400> much<00:02:47.760> as<00:02:48.620> two

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
really like that like as much as two

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.530 
really like that like as much as two
point<00:02:49.860> five<00:02:50.040> millimeter<00:02:50.489> has<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:51.000> check<00:02:51.360> which

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
point five millimeter has to check which

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.820 
point five millimeter has to check which
is<00:02:51.739> just<00:02:52.739> great<00:02:53.330> in<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.510> back<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:55.470> we<00:02:55.680> know
