00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 All together today I show you how 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.020
 I bloody this halloween-inspired 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:11.639
 cupcakes and go with s 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.230
 the sugar glass is 490 here 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.049
 grams of sugar and 100 milliliters of water 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.119
 in the pot at a high temperature 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.689
 Lord on stage 7 did the whole thing 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.220
 until the whole mixture so until the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.820
 has dissolved sugar and the whole thing 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.330
 she jerky will stir now and then 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.289
 so that the whole thing does not burn 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.570
 meantime you catch up 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.890
 baking sheet and put alu foil on it 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.989
 my idea of each not great 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.020
 but enough still that then as a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.489
 small gap arises that gesa sirup 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.770
 then does not want to flow 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.680
 Worries make it all so flat 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.210
 as possible and because press on it 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.510
 because it is already so we put the 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.140
 topping and this takes 460 grams 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.850
 butter this already beaten so that 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.659
 nice creamy is the offspring since four 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:13.350
 tablespoon of milk rhein a sachet 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.030
 vanilla sugar and 250 grams of powdered sugar 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.530
 The recipe was a bit more 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.880
 stated but that was very important to me 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:26.250
 much before and two tablespoons of that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.990
 just cream everything and everything 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.920
 Again, it's nice to have it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.920
 the brother train dissolves 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.240
 now is decorated and easy for this 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.680
 So my machens I naturally 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.650
 pre-baked there you can just 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.310
 take your time at the most 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.920
 whole market will be next 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.340
 our sugar glass after it has dried 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.100
 It takes about two hours to complete 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.360
 up to the time so somehow knife so am 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.710
 best you can just that 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:07.310
 Whole break up the same way until you then 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.170
 so small tips have portier tips 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.760
 then somehow cancel rightly 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.810
 break 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.550
 The whole thing is really great 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.440
 simply from the film of therefore also there 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.950
 actually very simple there are too 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:24.050
 The really clear glass of the recipe 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.610
 but I could not do that 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.220
 to get there so are there 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.840
 any ingredients have been in demand and 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.070
 of which also did not know where I got the 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.990
 herbekomme why I have the 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.640
 easy with this sugar water mixture 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.560
 and that was pretty good 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.830
 works then you do with that 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.770
 a hole in the cafÃ© small and knife 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:48.020
 put in this hole then the sash 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:56.540
 in and so it goes on at all 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:57.260
 Next will be the next one 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.459
 art blood 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:06.110
 in this case, it's just one 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.400
 So cherry is taken for ice cream and me 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.110
 just have a bit something synonymous one 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.870
 given spoon and the very edge of 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.870
 the sharpness then distributed and so on 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.470
 bit dripping moderately on ours too 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.640
 luggage and that again everywhere how one 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.060
 Of course, this is distributed to everyone 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.530
 let alone drown easily 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.660
 it's a pity about this 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.209
 shards is not transparent to him 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.780
 but I think you understand what meant 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.550
 is and what is not necessarily so 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.840
 be weird ingredients 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.130
 Here you really only have sugar and 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.650
 water that can also eat if you like 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:46.620
 from therefore 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:48.540
 I preferred this time over the 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.520
 violated it sometimes without a shard 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.260
 Just tricked down though 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.849
 Of course, they also have similar ones 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.569
 effect and I think so too 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.500
 Roger that 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.870
 the time had come here to get the times 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.260
 result, look at my other 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.180
 halloween inspired videos and that 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.780
 it was against me watching and watching 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.780
 Well
