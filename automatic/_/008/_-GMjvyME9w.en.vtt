00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.260 
it all together with an apple as well I
actually<00:01:46.380> had<00:01:46.680> an<00:01:46.799> apple<00:01:47.189> left<00:01:47.490> from<00:01:48.030> when<00:01:48.240> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
actually had an apple left from when I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.050 
actually had an apple left from when I
did<00:01:48.360> my<00:01:48.600> berry<00:01:48.869> smoothie<00:01:49.579> so<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.640> just<00:01:50.820> put<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
did my berry smoothie so I just put that

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.819 
did my berry smoothie so I just put that
in<00:01:51.149> there<00:01:51.420> then<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.869> is<00:01:52.079> what<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> looks<00:01:52.619> like

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
in there then this is what it looks like

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.740 
in there then this is what it looks like
you<00:01:53.040> can<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.250> put<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> lot<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.180> water<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.720> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
you can just put a lot of water in it to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.719 
you can just put a lot of water in it to
dilute<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.350> down<00:01:55.380> but<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.250> outcome

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
dilute it down but this is the outcome

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.429 
dilute it down but this is the outcome
of<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:58.549> so<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.700> movie<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.119> drink<00:02:00.630> more<00:02:01.079> or<00:02:01.110> less

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
of it so this movie I drink more or less

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.859 
of it so this movie I drink more or less
every<00:02:02.009> other<00:02:02.369> day<00:02:02.939> should<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.270> say<00:02:03.450> because<00:02:03.780> if
