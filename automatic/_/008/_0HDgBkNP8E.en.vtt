here and in this video I'm just going to
show<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.200> how<00:00:04.620> to<00:00:04.680> make<00:00:04.950> this<00:00:05.299> like<00:00:06.299> I'm

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
show you how to make this like I'm

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.890 
show you how to make this like I'm
piston<00:00:07.259> garden<00:00:07.859> kind<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.550> thing<00:00:09.120> so<00:00:09.660> when<00:00:09.809> you

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
piston garden kind of thing so when you

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.919 
piston garden kind of thing so when you
push<00:00:10.139> it<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.590> pushes<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:11.099> cross<00:00:11.370> up<00:00:11.780> so<00:00:12.780> rather

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
push it it pushes the cross up so rather

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.000 
push it it pushes the cross up so rather
and<00:00:13.340> it<00:00:14.420> pushes<00:00:15.420> your<00:00:15.660> crops<00:00:15.900> up<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> don't

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
and it pushes your crops up so you don't

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.480 
and it pushes your crops up so you don't
have<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.369> individually<00:00:17.670> go<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.600> hit<00:00:19.020> them<00:00:19.109> all

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
have to individually go and hit them all

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.040 
have to individually go and hit them all
so<00:00:20.490> first<00:00:20.789> thing<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.060> do<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.539> just<00:00:21.660> make

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
so first thing you do is just make

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:30.650 
so first thing you do is just make
yourself<00:00:24.109> trench<00:00:25.490> like<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:28.039> go<00:00:29.660> three

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
yourself trench like that and go three

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.590 
yourself trench like that and go three
cross<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.470> too<00:00:31.800> deep<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:34.440> i'll<00:00:34.950> just<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.969> let

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
cross and too deep so i'll just do let

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.200 
cross and too deep so i'll just do let
this<00:00:36.780> first<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.469> then<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.670> your<00:00:38.820> sticky

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
this first and then get your sticky

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.560 
this first and then get your sticky
pistons<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.910> put<00:00:41.910> them<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.180> they're<00:00:42.360> facing

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
pistons and put them so they're facing

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.600 
pistons and put them so they're facing
upwards<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.140> this<00:00:45.020> and<00:00:46.399> then<00:00:47.399> i'll<00:00:47.579> just

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
upwards like this and then i'll just

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:55.189 
upwards like this and then i'll just
take<00:00:47.879> out<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.360> section<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:53.719> then<00:00:54.719> put<00:00:54.989> down

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
take out this section and then put down

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.020 
take out this section and then put down
repeaters<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:57.890> then<00:00:58.890> put<00:00:59.100> down<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.489> redstone

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
repeaters and then put down the redstone

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.280 
repeaters and then put down the redstone
and<00:01:00.739> just<00:01:01.739> hook<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.190> up<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.609> switch<00:01:03.290> like

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and just hook that up to switch like

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:14.410 
and just hook that up to switch like
this<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:08.369> i'll<00:01:08.490> get<00:01:08.700> some<00:01:08.850> dirt

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.980 

so<00:01:15.420> hold<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.750> up<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:17.510> and<00:01:18.510> it<00:01:18.690> goes<00:01:18.840> up

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
so hold it up like that and it goes up

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.870 
so hold it up like that and it goes up
and<00:01:19.140> down<00:01:20.540> ok<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.600> now<00:01:22.080> i'm<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.100> name<00:01:23.820> you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
and down ok so now i'm going to name you

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.020 
and down ok so now i'm going to name you
put<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.390> water<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.280> just<00:01:26.460> dig<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.820> this

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
put the water in so just dig out this

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.420 
put the water in so just dig out this
section<00:01:27.510> here<00:01:29.030> to<00:01:30.030> put<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.330> water<00:01:30.479> in<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
section here to put the water in and

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.920 
section here to put the water in and
make<00:01:32.430> sure<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.850> need<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.150> cover<00:01:33.390> up<00:01:33.660> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
make sure you need to cover up the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.960 
make sure you need to cover up the
actual<00:01:34.880> redstone<00:01:35.880> wiring<00:01:36.210> so<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.790> water

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
actual redstone wiring so the the water

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.800 
actual redstone wiring so the the water
doesn't<00:01:39.240> go<00:01:39.479> on<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:40.280> number<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.420> wiring

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
doesn't go on the number of the wiring

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.070 
doesn't go on the number of the wiring
so<00:01:43.050> it<00:01:43.530> breaks<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.009> all<00:01:44.210> so<00:01:45.210> now<00:01:45.300> put<00:01:45.660> the<00:01:45.840> dirt

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:46.080 
so it breaks it all so now put the dirt

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.389 
so it breaks it all so now put the dirt
on<00:01:46.229> pistons<00:01:47.960> like<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:50.780> and<00:01:51.780> i'll<00:01:52.500> put<00:01:53.009> down

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
on pistons like that and i'll put down

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.469 
on pistons like that and i'll put down
the<00:01:53.550> water<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.990> now<00:01:55.140> i'm<00:01:55.320> going<00:01:55.410> to<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.920> the

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
the water so now i'm going to get the

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.550 
the water so now i'm going to get the
sugar<00:01:57.479> cane<00:01:57.810> like<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.899> just<00:02:00.899> put<00:02:01.020> place

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
sugar cane like this and just put place

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.820 
sugar cane like this and just put place
this<00:02:01.740> little<00:02:02.039> can<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:06.020> and<00:02:07.020> now<00:02:07.560> when

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:32.490 
yeah ok so now I need to get myself some
Pistons<00:03:24.439> some<00:03:25.010> grass<00:03:26.590> redstone<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:29.949> torpedo

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
Pistons some grass redstone and torpedo

Pistons some grass redstone and torpedo
so<00:03:33.500> just<00:03:33.680> put<00:03:33.889> down<00:03:34.069> grass<00:03:34.719> here

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.289 

and<00:03:43.099> put<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.219> down<00:03:44.370> piston<00:03:44.909> so<00:03:45.120> they're

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
and put the down piston so they're

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:53.300 
and put the down piston so they're
facing<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.900> like<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:51.739> so<00:03:52.739> now<00:03:52.859> you<00:03:52.920> just

need a hook up the Pistons by putting a

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.270 
need a hook up the Pistons by putting a
repeater<00:03:56.909> behind<00:03:57.299> it<00:03:57.769> so<00:03:58.769> I'll<00:03:58.859> come<00:03:59.099> back

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
repeater behind it so I'll come back

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:22.200 
repeater behind it so I'll come back
when<00:03:59.609> I've<00:04:00.000> done<00:04:00.780> that

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.969 

ok<00:04:23.210> so<00:04:23.270> I've<00:04:23.630> done<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:23.960> now<00:04:24.139> and<00:04:24.440> it<00:04:24.800> should

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
ok so I've done that now and it should

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.820 
ok so I've done that now and it should
look<00:04:25.130> like<00:04:25.190> this<00:04:25.930> so<00:04:26.930> now<00:04:27.050> just<00:04:27.229> go<00:04:27.440> to<00:04:27.560> one<00:04:27.710> of

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
look like this so now just go to one of

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.980 
look like this so now just go to one of
the<00:04:27.949> sides<00:04:28.160> and<00:04:29.710> connect<00:04:30.710> it<00:04:30.800> up<00:04:30.949> to<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.990> button

just want to make the sugarcane grow
this<00:04:44.900> is<00:04:45.080> better<00:04:45.289> fail<00:04:45.620> i<00:04:45.650> use<00:04:46.070> redstone<00:04:46.550> on<00:04:46.940> it

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
this is better fail i use redstone on it

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.830 
this is better fail i use redstone on it
but<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.240> actually<00:04:50.389> need<00:04:50.810> sugar<00:04:51.020> cane<00:04:51.340> ok<00:04:52.840> so

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
but you actually need sugar cane ok so
