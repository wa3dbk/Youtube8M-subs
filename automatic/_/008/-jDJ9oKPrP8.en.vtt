and what we look for to save money and
save<00:03:02.150> time<00:03:02.420> that's<00:03:02.930> my<00:03:03.170> suggestion<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:04.100> just<00:03:04.820> a

save time that's my suggestion in just a
few<00:03:05.180> minutes<00:03:05.510> we've<00:03:05.690> learned<00:03:05.960> that<00:03:06.140> taking

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
few minutes we've learned that taking

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.110 
few minutes we've learned that taking
some<00:03:06.590> time<00:03:06.800> to<00:03:06.980> choose<00:03:07.190> the<00:03:07.340> correct<00:03:07.490> prop<00:03:07.910> is

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
some time to choose the correct prop is

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.270 
some time to choose the correct prop is
important<00:03:08.690> take<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.380> test-drive<00:03:09.680> before<00:03:10.190> you

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
important take the test-drive before you

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.070 
important take the test-drive before you
accept<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.700> boat<00:03:10.880> if<00:03:11.330> it<00:03:11.570> doesn't<00:03:11.930> reach

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
accept the boat if it doesn't reach

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.170 
accept the boat if it doesn't reach
manufacturer's<00:03:12.800> recommended<00:03:13.220> speed<00:03:13.580> or<00:03:13.760> rpm

manufacturer's recommended speed or rpm

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.180 
manufacturer's recommended speed or rpm
then<00:03:14.690> ask<00:03:14.870> to<00:03:14.990> have<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.230> props<00:03:15.470> adjusted<00:03:16.010> or

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
then ask to have the props adjusted or

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.610 
then ask to have the props adjusted or
changed<00:03:16.730> there's<00:03:17.480> far<00:03:17.810> more<00:03:17.840> than<00:03:18.260> we<00:03:18.410> can

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
changed there's far more than we can

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.260 
changed there's far more than we can
cover<00:03:18.830> in<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.130> short<00:03:19.400> segment<00:03:19.640> so<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.000> hope<00:03:20.120> you

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
cover in a short segment so I hope you

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:21.520 
cover in a short segment so I hope you
come<00:03:20.420> back<00:03:20.630> again<00:03:20.930> soon<00:03:21.260> for<00:03:21.290> another

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
come back again soon for another

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.240 
come back again soon for another

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.130 
important tip from power tech propellers
so<00:03:25.250> as<00:03:25.550> you<00:03:25.700> can<00:03:25.880> see<00:03:25.940> with<00:03:26.660> just<00:03:26.870> these<00:03:27.080> three

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
so as you can see with just these three

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.199 
so as you can see with just these three
right<00:03:27.709> here<00:03:27.740> we<00:03:28.100> really<00:03:28.490> generate<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> lot<00:03:29.180> of

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
right here we really generate a lot of

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.850 
right here we really generate a lot of
questions<00:03:29.720> and<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.230> need<00:03:30.410> that<00:03:30.590> really

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
questions and you need that really

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.150 
questions and you need that really
understand<00:03:31.370> props<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:32.240> choose<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.690> right<00:03:32.840> one

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
understand props to choose the right one

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.460 
understand props to choose the right one
so<00:03:34.160> come<00:03:34.370> back<00:03:34.520> to<00:03:34.580> us<00:03:34.880> look<00:03:35.390> for<00:03:35.600> more<00:03:35.810> on<00:03:36.110> how

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
so come back to us look for more on how

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.370 
so come back to us look for more on how
to<00:03:36.500> use<00:03:36.620> your<00:03:36.770> propellers
