hi in this video we are going to discuss

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.810 
hi in this video we are going to discuss
about<00:00:08.230> the<00:00:08.379> next<00:00:08.769> part<00:00:08.980> of<00:00:09.250> the<00:00:09.459> human

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
about the next part of the human

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.599 
about the next part of the human
experience<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:11.170> 'dom<00:00:11.349> before<00:00:11.769> it<00:00:11.950> me<00:00:12.129> having<00:00:12.520> a

previous<00:00:13.029> video<00:00:13.180> we<00:00:13.480> have<00:00:13.660> already<00:00:13.869> discussed

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
previous video we have already discussed

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.769 
previous video we have already discussed
something<00:00:15.100> related<00:00:15.580> to<00:00:16.209> the<00:00:16.330> human<00:00:16.630> it's

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:16.779 
something related to the human it's

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.230 
something related to the human it's
fruity<00:00:17.140> system<00:00:17.560> which<00:00:18.189> consists<00:00:18.699> of<00:00:18.880> that<00:00:19.090> it

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
fruity system which consists of that it

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.050 
fruity system which consists of that it
means<00:00:19.449> you<00:00:20.380> rate<00:00:20.590> in<00:00:20.770> unary<00:00:21.220> travel<00:00:21.700> and<00:00:21.880> then

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
means you rate in unary travel and then

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.320 
means you rate in unary travel and then
your<00:00:22.270> intra<00:00:22.630> now<00:00:23.440> if<00:00:23.949> you<00:00:24.100> see<00:00:24.340> that<00:00:24.369> what

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
your intra now if you see that what

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.540 
your intra now if you see that what
other<00:00:25.600> things<00:00:26.110> other<00:00:26.380> than<00:00:26.560> that<00:00:26.949> is<00:00:27.220> it<00:00:27.400> in

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
other things other than that is it in

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.150 
other things other than that is it in
the<00:00:27.699> kidneys<00:00:28.270> so<00:00:29.080> each<00:00:30.039> kidney<00:00:30.630> consists<00:00:31.630> of

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the kidneys so each kidney consists of

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.090 
the kidneys so each kidney consists of
nearly<00:00:33.809> million<00:00:34.809> of<00:00:35.050> complex<00:00:35.680> tubular

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
nearly million of complex tubular

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.669 
nearly million of complex tubular
structures<00:00:36.609> which<00:00:36.789> are<00:00:36.940> called<00:00:37.149> as<00:00:37.449> the

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:37.679 
structures which are called as the

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.969 
structures which are called as the
nephrons<00:00:39.089> so<00:00:40.089> those<00:00:40.269> all<00:00:40.629> complex<00:00:41.409> tubular

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:41.979 
nephrons so those all complex tubular

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:43.680 
nephrons so those all complex tubular
structures<00:00:42.550> which<00:00:42.760> are<00:00:42.909> present<00:00:43.329> in<00:00:43.510> the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
structures which are present in the

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:59.970 
structures which are present in the
kidneys<00:00:47.819> they<00:00:48.819> are<00:00:48.940> called<00:00:49.239> as<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:53.429> net<00:00:54.429> soft

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.270 

these<00:01:00.550> are<00:01:00.820> nearly<00:01:01.450> 1<00:01:02.140> million<00:01:02.410> in<00:01:02.770> each<00:01:02.950> of

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.280 
these are nearly 1 million in each of

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.710 
these are nearly 1 million in each of
the<00:01:03.690> kidneys<00:01:04.950> so<00:01:05.950> these<00:01:06.820> neutrons<00:01:07.390> are

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
the kidneys so these neutrons are

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.710 
the kidneys so these neutrons are
generating<00:01:08.410> the<00:01:08.530> passional<00:01:09.100> unit<00:01:09.760> these<00:01:10.420> are

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
generating the passional unit these are

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:20.840 
generating the passional unit these are
the<00:01:10.990> functional<00:01:11.500> units<00:01:11.890> of<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.310> kidneys

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.719 

nephrons<00:01:21.850> consists<00:01:22.540> of<00:01:22.780> two<00:01:23.170> parts<00:01:23.729> first

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
nephrons consists of two parts first

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.480 
nephrons consists of two parts first
part<00:01:24.970> is<00:01:25.510> called<00:01:25.810> as<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.140> glomerulus<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:26.979> the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
part is called as the glomerulus and the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.960 
part is called as the glomerulus and the
second<00:01:27.910> part<00:01:28.120> is<00:01:28.330> called<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.840> cell<00:01:29.130> renal<00:01:30.130> tippy

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
second part is called a cell renal tippy

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.930 
second part is called a cell renal tippy
so<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.479> consists<00:01:31.990> of<00:01:32.140> two<00:01:32.410> parts<00:01:32.700> first<00:01:33.700> is

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
so it consists of two parts first is

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:39.180 
so it consists of two parts first is
called<00:01:34.210> as<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.660> glomerulus<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:37.920> second<00:01:38.920> part

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
called as the glomerulus and second part

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:48.990 
called as the glomerulus and second part
is<00:01:39.460> called<00:01:39.790> as<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.330> winner<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:48.340> let<00:01:48.670> us<00:01:48.700> see

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
is called as the winner so let us see

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.719 
is called as the winner so let us see
this<00:01:49.509> diagram<00:01:50.110> is<00:01:50.410> depicting<00:01:51.040> the<00:01:51.190> structure

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
this diagram is depicting the structure

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.840 
this diagram is depicting the structure
of<00:01:52.530> electron<00:01:53.530> which<00:01:53.830> is<00:01:53.860> present<00:01:54.160> in<00:01:54.700> the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
of electron which is present in the

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.630 
of electron which is present in the
evening<00:01:55.210> so<00:01:55.780> yes<00:01:55.960> this<00:01:56.440> time<00:01:56.890> we<00:01:57.040> can<00:01:57.190> see<00:01:57.220> that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
evening so yes this time we can see that

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.040 
evening so yes this time we can see that
the<00:01:57.880> nephron<00:01:58.330> consists<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:59.490> glomerulus<00:02:00.490> and

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
the nephron consists of glomerulus and

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.320 
the nephron consists of glomerulus and
tubules<00:02:02.050> so<00:02:02.890> these<00:02:03.040> are<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.460> two<00:02:03.640> motions<00:02:03.880> of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
tubules so these are the two motions of

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
tubules so these are the two motions of
the<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.770> Tron's<00:02:06.180> demureness<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.690> formed<00:02:08.200> by

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
the the Tron's demureness is formed by

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.590 
the the Tron's demureness is formed by
the<00:02:08.410> tuft<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:09.130> capillaries<00:02:09.399> which<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.269> owned

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
the tuft of capillaries which is owned

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.560 
the tuft of capillaries which is owned
by<00:02:10.660> the<00:02:11.080> efferent<00:02:11.769> arteriole<00:02:12.640> which<00:02:13.390> is

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.570 
by the efferent arteriole which is

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.670 
by the efferent arteriole which is
actually<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.230> network<00:02:14.709> of<00:02:15.510> renal<00:02:16.510> artery<00:02:17.200> so

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
actually the network of renal artery so

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.860 
actually the network of renal artery so
here<00:02:17.860> we<00:02:18.010> can<00:02:18.130> see<00:02:18.400> them<00:02:18.610> through<00:02:18.880> headless<00:02:19.420> is

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
here we can see them through headless is

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.280 
here we can see them through headless is
form<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:21.040> tough<00:02:21.280> cut<00:02:21.730> of<00:02:22.019> capillaries<00:02:23.019> which

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
form of a tough cut of capillaries which

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.000 
form of a tough cut of capillaries which
is<00:02:23.440> formed<00:02:23.920> by<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.510> afferent<00:02:25.510> arteriole<00:02:26.110> the

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
is formed by the afferent arteriole the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.580 
is formed by the afferent arteriole the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
blood from the guarulhos is taken away

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.120 
blood from the guarulhos is taken away
by<00:02:30.580> an<00:02:30.880> event<00:02:31.570> or<00:02:32.260> tedium

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
by an event or tedium

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.640 
by an event or tedium
so<00:02:33.580> what<00:02:33.730> is<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.000> condition<00:02:34.209> of<00:02:34.600> now<00:02:34.989> if

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
so what is the condition of now if

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.140 
so what is the condition of now if
you're<00:02:35.950> not<00:02:36.130> here<00:02:36.340> you're<00:02:36.489> an<00:02:36.670> infant
