complex<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.730> project<00:00:30.119> as<00:00:30.240> well<00:00:30.420> so<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.320> decided

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
complex a project as well so I decided

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.760 
complex a project as well so I decided
to<00:00:31.859> go<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:33.000> one<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.770> affordable

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
to go with the one that was affordable

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.360 
to go with the one that was affordable
compared<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:36.030> few<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.540> others<00:00:37.160> which<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
compared to a few of the others which is

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.690 
compared to a few of the others which is
the<00:00:38.399> super<00:00:39.059> strike<00:00:39.300> project<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.280> ordered

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
the super strike project so I ordered

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.850 
the super strike project so I ordered
this<00:00:41.910> female<00:00:42.450> Spectre<00:00:44.000> spectres<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.120> become

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
this female Spectre spectres have become

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.270 
this female Spectre spectres have become
reasonable<00:00:46.860> in<00:00:47.010> price<00:00:48.140> think<00:00:49.140> back<00:00:49.350> here<00:00:49.680> nice

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
reasonable in price think back here nice

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.810 
reasonable in price think back here nice
and<00:00:50.460> warm<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:52.710> know<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.010> last<00:00:53.190> year<00:00:53.960> so<00:00:54.960> I

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:55.820 
and warm you know in the last year so I

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.010 
and warm you know in the last year so I
figured<00:00:56.820> this<00:00:56.940> was<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.149> way<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.420> go<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:57.750> I

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
figured this was the way to go so I

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.290 
figured this was the way to go so I
heard<00:00:58.199> this<00:00:58.410> girl<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.980> from<00:00:59.430> Jeremy<00:00:59.969> Smith

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
heard this girl up from Jeremy Smith

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:14.810 
heard this girl up from Jeremy Smith
that<00:01:00.629> fireball<00:01:01.379> reptiles<00:01:12.860> so<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.280> guess<00:01:14.490> he<00:01:14.670> had

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
that fireball reptiles so I guess he had

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.800 
that fireball reptiles so I guess he had
made<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.330> handful<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> spectres<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.890> year<00:01:17.250> and

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
made a handful of spectres this year and

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.770 
made a handful of spectres this year and
she<00:01:18.810> was<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.070> last<00:01:20.390> one<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.509> he<00:01:21.540> had

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
she was the the last one that he had

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:37.570 
she was the the last one that he had
left<00:01:22.610> so<00:01:23.610> let's<00:01:23.820> see<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.180> we<00:01:24.270> got<00:01:24.450> here

up a little bit after this shed a really
nice<00:02:20.780> pattern<00:02:21.110> especially<00:02:21.590> for<00:02:22.220> a<00:02:22.250> specter<00:02:23.030> a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
nice pattern especially for a specter a

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.120 
nice pattern especially for a specter a
lot<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.420> specters<00:02:23.810> seem<00:02:24.620> to<00:02:24.709> have<00:02:24.830> kind<00:02:24.980> of<00:02:25.040> a

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
dirty busy pattern I like that she

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.270 
dirty busy pattern I like that she
doesn't<00:02:28.910> have<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.180> ton<00:02:29.480> of<00:02:29.510> dots<00:02:30.010> but<00:02:31.010> enough
