00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
antenna or something but I believe this

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.820 
antenna or something but I believe this
does<00:05:18.099> have<00:05:18.400> built-in<00:05:19.330> digital<00:05:19.569> receiver<00:05:20.500> I

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
does have built-in digital receiver I

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.670
