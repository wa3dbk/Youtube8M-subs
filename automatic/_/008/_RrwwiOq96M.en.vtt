the<00:00:05.290> solar<00:00:05.650> light<00:00:06.069> no<00:00:06.490> longer<00:00:07.359> works<00:00:07.660> I<00:00:08.160> put<00:00:09.160> in

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:09.309 
the solar light no longer works I put in

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:18.330 
the solar light no longer works I put in
a<00:00:09.880> good<00:00:10.600> battery<00:00:11.320> it's<00:00:13.770> one<00:00:14.770> point<00:00:17.100> one<00:00:18.100> point

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.340 
a good battery it's one point one point

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.820 
a good battery it's one point one point
three<00:00:18.760> four<00:00:19.060> volt<00:00:19.390> and<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:21.960> trace<00:00:22.960> it<00:00:23.170> back<00:00:23.410> to

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
three four volt and I trace it back to

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.390 
three four volt and I trace it back to
the<00:00:24.519> switch<00:00:24.910> here<00:00:25.330> without<00:00:26.230> using<00:00:26.800> the<00:00:26.949> switch

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
the switch here without using the switch

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.150 
the switch here without using the switch
when<00:00:27.640> I<00:00:27.759> just<00:00:28.089> cross<00:00:28.480> the<00:00:28.750> wires<00:00:29.050> you<00:00:29.679> can<00:00:29.859> see

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.160 
when I just cross the wires you can see

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.820 
when I just cross the wires you can see
it<00:00:30.279> light<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:34.600> that's<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:35.050> problem

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:37.830 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.160 

this<00:00:38.830> switch<00:00:39.190> over<00:00:39.550> here<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.790> little<00:00:43.170> rusted

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
this switch over here this little rusted

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.100 
this switch over here this little rusted
corroded<00:00:44.650> and<00:00:45.540> it<00:00:46.540> wouldn't<00:00:47.230> work<00:00:47.410> anymore<00:00:47.710> so

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
corroded and it wouldn't work anymore so

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:59.630 
corroded and it wouldn't work anymore so
I<00:00:50.110> don't<00:00:50.770> think<00:00:50.950> I<00:00:51.160> have<00:00:51.400> another<00:00:51.670> switch

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.780 

so<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.450> try<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.900> clean<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.560> wiring<00:01:02.100> connection

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
so I try to clean the wiring connection

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.780 
so I try to clean the wiring connection
as<00:01:02.970> much<00:01:03.210> as<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.630> I'm<00:01:04.350> just<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> tend

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
as much as I can I'm just going to tend

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:15.350 
as much as I can I'm just going to tend
it<00:01:06.920> sort<00:01:07.920> solder<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.090> thee<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:13.970> solve<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.120> to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it sort solder it to thee I solve it to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.500 
it sort solder it to thee I solve it to
the<00:01:15.450> connection<00:01:15.720> there<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.410> it<00:01:16.950> is<00:01:17.420> going<00:01:18.420> to

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
the connection there so it is going to

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.050 
the connection there so it is going to
be<00:01:18.600> common<00:01:19.260> in<00:01:20.900> condition<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:23.700> light

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
be common in condition this is the light

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:32.570 
be common in condition this is the light
is<00:01:24.990> on<00:01:25.290> now<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> that's<00:01:30.570> done<00:01:31.070> now<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.100> don't

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:32.580 
is on now so that's done now you don't

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.990 
is on now so that's done now you don't
have<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:33.119> an<00:01:33.540> electronic<00:01:34.410> expert<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.729> fix

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
have to be an electronic expert to fix

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.480 
have to be an electronic expert to fix
this<00:01:36.330> if<00:01:37.050> there's<00:01:37.410> something<00:01:37.740> wrong<00:01:37.979> with<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
this if there's something wrong with the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.060 
this if there's something wrong with the
chip<00:01:39.090> there's<00:01:39.450> nothing<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.140> do<00:01:40.320> anyway

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
chip there's nothing you can do anyway

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.760 
chip there's nothing you can do anyway
you<00:01:41.820> can't<00:01:42.090> fix<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.380> replace

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
you can't fix that you have to replace

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.219 
you can't fix that you have to replace
it<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.190> no<00:01:45.119> one<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.420> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.720> replace<00:01:46.170> that

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
it and no one is going to replace that

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.050 
it and no one is going to replace that
because<00:01:47.100> where<00:01:47.399> you're<00:01:47.550> going<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.759> find<00:01:47.910> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
because where you're going to find the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.810 
because where you're going to find the
chip<00:01:49.100> but<00:01:50.100> if<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.810> corroded<00:01:52.820> switch

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
chip but if it is the corroded switch

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.100 
chip but if it is the corroded switch
then<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.780> can<00:01:54.960> do<00:01:55.110> something<00:01:55.560> with<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:57.110> so

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
then you can do something with it so

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.580 
then you can do something with it so
that's<00:01:58.800> what<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.040> did<00:02:00.140> was<00:02:01.140> on<00:02:01.380> one<00:02:01.820> double<00:02:02.820> a

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
that's what I did was on one double a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.359 
that's what I did was on one double a
the<00:02:04.590> new<00:02:04.860> units<00:02:05.370> are<00:02:05.640> very<00:02:05.909> inexpensive<00:02:06.330> now

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
the new units are very inexpensive now

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.539 
the new units are very inexpensive now
they<00:02:08.369> are<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:09.290> three<00:02:10.290> dollars<00:02:10.739> two<00:02:10.979> dollars

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
they are like three dollars two dollars

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:17.990 
they are like three dollars two dollars
this<00:02:12.299> one<00:02:12.540> has<00:02:12.780> a<00:02:12.810> three<00:02:13.709> led<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.769> with<00:02:17.000> the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
this one has a three led and with the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.900 
this one has a three led and with the
animu<00:02:18.630> battery<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> put<00:02:20.070> in<00:02:20.220> it<00:02:20.430> can<00:02:20.640> last

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
animu battery that I put in it can last

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.630 
animu battery that I put in it can last
the<00:02:21.120> whole<00:02:21.269> night<00:02:21.510> I<00:02:21.900> have<00:02:22.860> several<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.430> these

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
the whole night I have several of these

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.660 
the whole night I have several of these
outside<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.620> they<00:02:25.620> usually<00:02:25.769> can<00:02:26.250> run<00:02:26.459> all

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
outside and they usually can run all

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.259 
outside and they usually can run all
night<00:02:26.700> and<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:29.250> solar<00:02:29.489> panel<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.030> is

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
night and this solar panel here is

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.710 
night and this solar panel here is
getting<00:02:30.750> worn<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.500> have<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.430> sand<00:02:33.000> pay<00:02:33.239> for<00:02:33.570> it

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
getting worn I have to sand pay for it

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.350 
getting worn I have to sand pay for it
to<00:02:35.000> make<00:02:36.000> it<00:02:36.180> more<00:02:36.390> translucent<00:02:37.220> otherwise

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
to make it more translucent otherwise

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.039 
to make it more translucent otherwise
the<00:02:39.360> work<00:02:39.660> fine<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.890> switch<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.370> there<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:42.480> you

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
the work fine the switch is there if you

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.440 
the work fine the switch is there if you
want<00:02:43.350> to<00:02:43.590> keep<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.370> light<00:02:44.580> from<00:02:44.850> turning<00:02:45.330> on

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
want to keep the light from turning on

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.949 
want to keep the light from turning on
that<00:02:45.660> night<00:02:46.220> it's<00:02:47.220> like<00:02:47.310> when<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.880> first<00:02:48.660> got

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
that night it's like when you first got

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.620 
that night it's like when you first got
it<00:02:49.590> new<00:02:49.830> they<00:02:50.250> recommend<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.090> switch<00:02:51.480> it

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
it new they recommend that you switch it

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.039 
it new they recommend that you switch it
off<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:53.090> sunlight<00:02:54.090> will<00:02:54.360> charge<00:02:54.720> the

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
off so that sunlight will charge the

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.949 
off so that sunlight will charge the
battery<00:02:55.500> and<00:02:55.980> after<00:02:56.730> a<00:02:56.760> day<00:02:56.940> or<00:02:56.970> two<00:02:57.360> then<00:02:57.690> you

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
battery and after a day or two then you

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.789 
battery and after a day or two then you
can<00:02:58.230> switch<00:02:58.440> it<00:02:58.650> back<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.310> and<00:02:59.870> then<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:01.440> unit

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
can switch it back on and then the unit

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.330 
can switch it back on and then the unit
will<00:03:02.010> work<00:03:02.730> automatically<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:04.560> that's<00:03:04.890> what<00:03:05.100> I

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
will work automatically so that's what I

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.180 
will work automatically so that's what I
have<00:03:05.610> done<00:03:05.820> I<00:03:05.880> just<00:03:06.290> eliminated<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.320> switch

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.740 

instead<00:03:11.190> of<00:03:11.310> throwing<00:03:11.760> it<00:03:12.090> away<00:03:12.209> I<00:03:12.360> got

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
instead of throwing it away I got

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:13.530 
instead of throwing it away I got
another

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
another

back to cover up the hole so no water

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.160 
back to cover up the hole so no water
will<00:03:25.209> get<00:03:25.390> into<00:03:25.780> it

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
and this is my $2 like from Target it's

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.130 
and this is my $2 like from Target it's
not<00:03:31.780> too<00:03:31.959> bad<00:03:32.200> but<00:03:32.560> if<00:03:33.430> you<00:03:33.579> compare<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.140> this

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
not too bad but if you compare to this

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.160 
not too bad but if you compare to this

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
stronger light okay so that's the solar
