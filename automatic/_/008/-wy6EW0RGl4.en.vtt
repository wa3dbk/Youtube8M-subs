00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.660
 of the cadet b before the ray majadahonda 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.820

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.830
 tranquility to the white team to play 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.230
 more comfortable but that did not make the 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.580
 rival will lower the arms proof of it 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.400
 is this hand in hand that ruiz 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.620
 anticipating the front very well 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.119
 get kicked out even though the 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.150
 occasions were for the majadahonda ray 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.610

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.460
 central 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.090
 and an Oscar goal that finishes inside the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.980
 2-0 area but no lightning reaction 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.110
 it would take only two minutes to arrive 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.840
 then angel put the 2-1 in the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.440
 scoreboard with this cross throw 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.739
 we go and we go 21 that they are 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.680
 sometimes taking many opportunities 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.890
 of goal but already with our goal

 the match with 2-1 have suffered a 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.760
