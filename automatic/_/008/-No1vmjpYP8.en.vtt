00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 Good day ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.819
 please meet our 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.389
 experiments 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.110
 before you experiment with a post 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.900
 production Italy 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.690
 we see two healthy men 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.570
 becomes the center of this pillar 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.260
 three and a half meters long 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:26.010
 approaching 3 and here they are three trying 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.400
 break and the pillar does not stand up immediately 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.340
 and loads cutting eggs into the center of their 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.250
 section not visible crumbles 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.020
 together with the concrete section centered on 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.350
 failure to 3 mp row 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:43.739
 so famous branded italian 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:47.610
 I would not stand even such 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.910
 load very quickly break down this 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.680
 test now we come 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.620
 let's duplicate the same experiment 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:59.250
 but already with our Ukrainian pillar the same 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.079
 the table itself is only slightly thicker with seven 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.799
 half centimeters up to 7 and a half 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.979
 centimeters section of the edges are trying 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.030
 loosen this table in the middle and we 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.590
 we see that this table is already stronger 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.409
 the fourth participant in the experiment takes 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.680
 its position mass increases even more 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.470
 and we see that this pillar continues 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.320
 hold on and here they are three 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.680
 dancing a little bit shaking this 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.710
 pillar patients section here they are 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.230
 continue to do it and what are we now 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.250
 will see if our table will stand 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:40.770
 we see that the pillar stood ours 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.350
 Ukrainian table he would stand this 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.420
 load 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.160
 having a similar structure like 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.080
 three-wire wire however 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.380
 endures even more years waiting but alas 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.330
 when our members became 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.369
 experiment our second time 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.300
 Ukrainian pillar will see also not 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:07.220
 stands it breaks in the center of its 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.050
 sections we also see the same structure 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:13.020
 concrete that crumbles 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.930
 but at least well, at least they could 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.700
 see the result of these 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.040
 experiments with two pillars 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.040
 the italian table broke right away our 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.330
 Ukrainian, he withstood a heavy load 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.550
 for more time so 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.750
 go to the second part of our 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:37.440
 experiment we will conduct the same 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.489
 experiment with the Ukrainian post but already 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.170
 made by our innovation 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:48.020
 technology boats trying to crush 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.709
 this table dancing five on it 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.640
 man five adult men it's up to 400 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.489
 about 400 kilograms of weight at what they 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.250
 behave very actively will be the sixth 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.850
 a pretty pretty member 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.360
 heavy man who joining 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:11.150
 also starts to dance for 6 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.790
 rum six healthy men try 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.640
 break this table and we see that table 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.519
 safe and sound ladies and gentlemen if you 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:23.569
