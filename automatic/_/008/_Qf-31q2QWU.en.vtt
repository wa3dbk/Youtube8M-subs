00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.170
 and the truth is that I am very happy 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.090
 as I said in other occasions 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.820
 it is a goal a dream that I fulfilled coming to 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.680
 a club as big as it is America and 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.060
 when also for the reception of 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.880
 the co-workers of the coaching staff and 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.250
 leader of the hobby now that he 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.730
 they made me feel very fast and good happy 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.730
 for being here 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:39.680
 a song or a color a forward 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.020
 with goal and with goal but more thrown a 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.350
 little back plus a playmaker with arrival 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.180
 to the goal 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.610
 I consider myself good I like obviously 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.640
 having a lot of the ball did not try too 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.220
 to hold back from pivoting I think 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.490
 What can I give you? 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.490
 team 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.379
 I think it's good that everyone has their 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:04.629
 way differently knows that maybe 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.580
 share in the same position combined 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.310
 with other forwards each one has its 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.500
 particularity your goals your your way of 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.500
 train their way of being out and 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.509
 inside the court it seems to me that I have 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.820
 very eager to succeed I know that 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:21.490
 when that alone does not reach but as 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.380
 I always say that the player should talk 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.909
 within the field of play so in the 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.909
 I'll try to do it 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.550
 last year I had come I had a good year 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.100
 thank God I was surprised by the 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.810
 greatness of the team and good now that I 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.280
 I put content founded with my family together 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.590
 with my representative because of the fact that 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.220
 you can go take this step I do not know what 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.670
 because everything is already finished one what 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.670
 enjoy more 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.520
 I always try to set myself short goals 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.830
 I think it's such an important league and 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.980
 with clubs so strong with big 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.860
 names play with hierarchy in what 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.290
 staff I've thought of turning 10 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.119
 goals up I think if one comes 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:11.680
 big teams like is america has 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.050
 to be demanded in a big way too 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.670
 so let's hope it can be given and 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.910
 obviously that one is going to train for 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.910
 that 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.489
 If I had the opportunity to face them 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.060
 in 2008 with river by cup liberators 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.530
 and I played and I was telling my 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.629
 representative if at the time 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.560
 I had to enter about 10 minutes I think no 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.599
 I remember badly I felt a 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.400
 something something beautiful was usually a 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.770
 match by cup I think it's a little more 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.230
 but also when I see my classmates 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.180
 see my companions felt roasted 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.640
 I also liked how big the 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.810
 people who are all painted yellow 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.980
 good that the team had a match 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.420
 excellent the truth that I am not very 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:56.170
 happy and happy to have 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.170
 or so
