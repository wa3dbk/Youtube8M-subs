00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.549
 hi friends and friends look today we are going to 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.019
 make a necklace the truth is that necklace 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.730
 it's an excuse to make a pompom 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:16.200
 decorated is a bit what we can put 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:21.720
 in the doors on the cushions as hike 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:23.820
 cloths in a thousand things, I'm going to 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.490
 teach to see that I incorporate a 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.470
 little bit so you can see it 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:35.280
 It is a double cited necklace that well what 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 we can put either long 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.400
 you see that the tree is like that 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.380
 we would put it with a long dress or 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.970
 well we can put it as I do 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.460
 had now been bent over 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.430
 passing it here is worth and here the 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.460
 little head or we could put it then 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:02.300
 in an intermediate way then doing 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.320
 a turn around the neck 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.320
 a single turn 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:14.929
 and dropping the pompom the important thing 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:18.469
 of the matter is that we learn to do 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:21.950
 these little pits that can not be served 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:23.929
 so to make the pumpkin decorate a 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.530
 cushion in order for many things I hope 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.530
 I wish you like it 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:33.290
 we turn a piece of yarn 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.690
 to make a cord that once 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.080
 you've done a lot of laps, wind up alone 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:41.120
 we make a little nudite and we put it 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.060
 crossed over a cardboard this carton 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.100
 It is about 20 centimeters depending on 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.260
 how big you want to do as long as 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.470
 You want to make the pompom 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.619
 bigger or shorter in what is the 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.810
 cardboard we start to spin and you 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.479
 we give enough I have given him as 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.399
 about 100 laps that you want it to be more 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.380
 fine because less than you want that is more 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:05.930
 thick more then once we have already 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.780
 done now what we do is with the 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.290
 lace that we have crossed tie it well 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.780
 strong as much as you can and you 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.840
 we give a couple of knots that look good 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.480
 insured and we take them out of the cardboard that 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.310
 we have used as a template now for 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.230
 make the head of the pompom 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:29.909
 what we do is again with a thread 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:34.830
 so we give it a few laps we do 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:36.659
 a good knot and now we are going to give 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.709
 a few more laps so they remain 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:43.080
 well insured very well and we tie it very 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.530
 strong once you've done the knot 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.120
 you cut the ends and we would have 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.129
 practically the pompom almost done 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.769
 we are going to decorate it 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.079
 that would be fine already but we're going to 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.150
 decorate to make it look better with 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.680
 a wire is a very man 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.370
 finite that they sell to make 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.250
 crafts you see what I do is that what 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.470
 hooked I give him a few turns to 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.590
 that does not escape me and we're going to 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.500
 use then as if it were thread and needle 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:16.010
 we are stringing glass beads in 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.810
 this case of the color that you like the most 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.209
 so we insert about 8 or 10 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.849
 accounts just once we have already 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.130
 skewered those eight or ten accounts what 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.160
 what we will do is make a stitch 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.670
 catching if it can be just a thread 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.530
 so you can barely notice what it is 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.239
 we want to do with this as what 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:44.810
 we want to go around everything 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.060
 would be the head of the pompom voucher and 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.420
 we repeat the operation now what 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:54.380
 you will see much better how it is going 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:58.340
 eight or ten accounts and we return to give a 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:02.170
 stitch and we will go up while 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.540
 let's be in the thick part of the pompom 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.650
 let's go up doing all the 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.650
 time is 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.870
 this this same work once I already 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.570
 we are a little bit taller and already 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.410
 start the pompom you see the pompom starts 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.560
 to make it narrower what 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:27.520
 we will do instead of putting 8 or 10 accounts 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:32.500
 in each in each stitch as we will put 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:38.320
 a few less we will put 6 7 first and 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:40.390
 then 6 5 then 6 4 in order so that 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.330
 are very large and in the end they will be 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.580
 of only once here I have already finished and 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.680
 what I do is with the thread left over 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.870
 We keep winding wire so that 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:55.000
 get well attached and cut the tip 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.680
 so we have the little head 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.639
 as this is already what we do is 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.990
 cut a wing 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:04.389
 length that we like the pompom 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.900
 as you see you're done this we 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:10.930
 would serve for a hike cloths for 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.669
 decorate a door for a cushion 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.650
 what I'm doing here is to dye 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:19.190
 give him a gradient 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.070
 well this is already finished here what 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:25.430
 What we do is a necklace 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.789
 passing accounts to the tuntÃºn as such 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:31.639
 it seemed to me and the only thing we do 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:34.759
 final is to sew it to the pompom although as 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.550
 I said to you then you can use it for a 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:40.039
 cushion for him there has been a door 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.080
 for a drawer unit for a curtain in 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:46.190
 end for what you want I hope that you 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:50.139
 like the result that is this and that you 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.139
 encourage to make a kiss
