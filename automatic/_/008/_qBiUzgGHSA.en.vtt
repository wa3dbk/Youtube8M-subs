00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
to go to the sink and get a glass of

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.719 
to go to the sink and get a glass of
water

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
water

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.820

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
I mean well after the heavy metal

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.440 
I mean well after the heavy metal
toxicity<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.250> thing<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.759> they<00:01:17.880> said<00:01:18.090> about<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
toxicity a thing like they said about a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.820 
toxicity a thing like they said about a
polar<00:01:18.689> water<00:01:18.930> machine<00:01:19.229> stuff<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.680> but

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
polar water machine stuff like that but

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.170 
polar water machine stuff like that but
who<00:01:19.950> has<00:01:20.130> all<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> money<00:01:20.460> for<00:01:20.700> polar<00:01:20.909> water

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
who has all the money for polar water

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.560 
who has all the money for polar water
machine<00:01:21.509> so<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:22.500> we've<00:01:22.740> been<00:01:23.070> using<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.180> Brita

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
machine so then we've been using a Brita

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:34.700 
machine so then we've been using a Brita
to<00:01:26.689> make<00:01:27.689> water<00:01:27.960> okay<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:30.030> uses<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:33.710> Brita

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
to make water okay so it uses the Brita

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.390 
to make water okay so it uses the Brita
cartridge<00:01:35.520> in<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:37.380> filters<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> water

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
cartridge in it that filters the water

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.480 
cartridge in it that filters the water
all<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.590> toxic<00:01:40.590> chemicals<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.100> stuff<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.340> get

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
all the toxic chemicals and stuff I get

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.210 
all the toxic chemicals and stuff I get
they're<00:01:42.030> supposed<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> last<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:43.590> 70<00:01:44.070> gallons

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
they're supposed to last like 70 gallons

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.499 
they're supposed to last like 70 gallons
or<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:45.780> months<00:01:46.110> but<00:01:47.000> we<00:01:48.000> have<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.210> change<00:01:48.360> them

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
or two months but we have to change them

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.670 
or two months but we have to change them
a<00:01:48.570> lot<00:01:48.689> more<00:01:48.720> often<00:01:49.049> okay

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
a lot more often okay

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.090 
a lot more often okay
now<00:01:49.799> anyhow<00:01:50.579> as<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.000> know<00:01:51.710> water<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.860> supposed

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
now anyhow as you know water is supposed

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.190 
now anyhow as you know water is supposed
to<00:01:53.189> be<00:01:53.310> clear<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:54.270> course<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:54.869> came

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
to be clear of course this is just came

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.139 
to be clear of course this is just came
around<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.409> refrigerator<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:56.729> frosting

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
around the refrigerator so it's frosting

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.880 
around the refrigerator so it's frosting
up<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.960> me<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.390> I'm<00:02:00.390> gonna<00:02:00.540> hold<00:02:00.780> up<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.460> mean<00:02:02.460> I

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
up on me so I'm gonna hold up I mean I

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.639 
up on me so I'm gonna hold up I mean I
went<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.100> thought<00:02:05.430> I<00:02:05.579> didn't<00:02:05.850> flush<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> toilet

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
went I thought I didn't flush the toilet

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.540 
went I thought I didn't flush the toilet
that's<00:02:07.649> how<00:02:07.829> bad<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.190> was

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
that's how bad it was

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.109 
that's how bad it was
so

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
so

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.449 
so
this<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> white<00:02:10.019> sheet<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.319> paper<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.649> it's

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
this is a white sheet of paper here it's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.979 
this is a white sheet of paper here it's
the<00:02:11.670> back<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.910> something<00:02:12.420> else<00:02:12.510> has<00:02:12.690> something
