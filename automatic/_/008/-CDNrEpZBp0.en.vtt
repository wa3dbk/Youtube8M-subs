loved ones I make it an update for my

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.929 
loved ones I make it an update for my
cables<00:00:18.500> that<00:00:19.500> are<00:00:19.550> upgraded<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.760> my<00:00:20.939> system<00:00:21.769> I

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:22.939 
cables that are upgraded on my system I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.330 
cables that are upgraded on my system I
took<00:00:23.939> all<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.420> six<00:00:24.990> gauge<00:00:25.230> cables<00:00:25.769> out<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.189> my

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
took all the six gauge cables out of my

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.050 
took all the six gauge cables out of my
system

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
system

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.240 
system
and<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:28.050> put<00:00:28.289> four<00:00:28.949> gauge<00:00:29.900> from<00:00:31.279> the<00:00:32.279> breaker

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
and I put four gauge from the breaker

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.670 
and I put four gauge from the breaker
box<00:00:35.250> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.180> solar<00:00:36.420> panels<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.320> charge

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
box of the solar panels to the charge

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.549 
box of the solar panels to the charge
controller<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:39.140> from<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> charge

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
controller and from the charge

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.170 
controller and from the charge
controller<00:00:41.989> to<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.200> battery<00:00:44.070> breaker<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.910> to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
controller to the battery breaker and to

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.840 
controller to the battery breaker and to
the<00:00:45.300> batteries<00:00:47.539> and<00:00:48.539> also<00:00:48.719> I<00:00:49.460> replaced<00:00:50.460> all

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the batteries and also I replaced all

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.439 
the batteries and also I replaced all
the<00:00:51.559> six<00:00:52.559> gauge<00:00:52.829> cables<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.730> put<00:00:53.940> zero<00:00:54.180> gauge

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the six gauge cables and put zero gauge

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.650 
the six gauge cables and put zero gauge
cables<00:00:54.960> on<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.230> batteries<00:00:56.270> on<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.420> upper

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
cables on the batteries on the upper

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:07.420 
cables on the batteries on the upper
bank<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.969> on<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.120> lower<00:01:00.300> bank<00:01:01.489> on<00:01:02.489> both<00:01:02.730> sides

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.920 

as<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.270> see<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.540> added<00:01:09.900> two<00:01:10.260> batteries

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
as you can see I added two batteries

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:20.149 
as you can see I added two batteries
down<00:01:12.930> here<00:01:15.380> and<00:01:16.939> I'm<00:01:17.939> gonna<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.920> moving<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
down here and I'm gonna be moving the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.240 
down here and I'm gonna be moving the
charge<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:21.180> inverter<00:01:21.960> from<00:01:22.590> down<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
charge the inverter from down here and

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.929 
charge the inverter from down here and
put<00:01:24.180> two<00:01:24.360> more<00:01:24.570> batteries<00:01:25.369> over<00:01:26.369> here<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.880> you

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
put two more batteries over here so you

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.609 
put two more batteries over here so you
have<00:01:27.090> 12<00:01:27.930> batteries<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.619> together<00:01:29.990> it<00:01:30.990> made<00:01:31.350> a

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
have 12 batteries all together it made a

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.429 
have 12 batteries all together it made a
big<00:01:32.189> significant<00:01:32.939> difference<00:01:34.460> of<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.840> change

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
big significant difference of the change

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.380 
big significant difference of the change
and<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.159> can<00:01:38.220> see<00:01:39.619> better<00:01:40.939> response<00:01:41.939> from<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
and I can see better response from the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.190 
and I can see better response from the
charge<00:01:42.689> controller<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.740> batteries<00:01:45.200> from

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
charge controller to the batteries from

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.789 
charge controller to the batteries from
the<00:01:46.350> batteries<00:01:48.140> to<00:01:50.960> the<00:01:51.960> monitors<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.530> I

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the batteries to the monitors that I

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.999 
the batteries to the monitors that I
have<00:01:56.509> I'm<00:01:57.509> working<00:01:58.020> on<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> new<00:01:58.530> project

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
