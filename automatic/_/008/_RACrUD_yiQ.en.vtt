00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
expert in them he's been in I guess

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.030 
expert in them he's been in I guess
dealing<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.079> them<00:01:49.229> for<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> last<00:01:49.590> twenty

years or so and he actually you know
hand-picked<00:01:53.399> each<00:01:53.610> fish<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.200> could

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
they swim a lot more so they tend to eat

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.790

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:04.260 
so when you see of eating them spin the

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.350 
so when you see of eating them spin the
food<00:05:04.410> back<00:05:04.680> out<00:05:04.920> they're<00:05:05.640> pretty<00:05:05.970> much<00:05:06.090> saying

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.940 
a good job on them
and<00:06:07.640> he<00:06:08.640> cleaned<00:06:08.970> the<00:06:09.060> tank<00:06:09.240> free<00:06:09.900> so<00:06:10.590> I<00:06:10.620> guess

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
and he cleaned the tank free so I guess

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:16.030 
and he cleaned the tank free so I guess
I'd<00:06:11.100> deal<00:06:11.310> with<00:06:11.340> his<00:06:13.370> ferocious<00:06:14.370> appetite<00:06:15.270> for

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.040 
I'd deal with his ferocious appetite for

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.280 
I'd deal with his ferocious appetite for
pestering<00:06:17.040> people<00:06:17.510> because<00:06:18.510> he<00:06:18.660> does<00:06:18.900> a<00:06:18.930> great

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
pestering people because he does a great

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:23.450 
pestering people because he does a great
