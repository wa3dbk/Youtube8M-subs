00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
to increase its electrical potential we

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.560 
to increase its electrical potential we
need<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.920> break<00:01:47.340> down<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.610> clustering<00:01:48.210> effect

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
need to break down the clustering effect

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.060 
need to break down the clustering effect
which<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.840> very<00:01:49.049> simple<00:01:49.320> when<00:01:49.590> we<00:01:49.710> remove<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
which is very simple when we remove the

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.609 
which is very simple when we remove the
acid<00:01:50.670> because<00:01:50.820> well<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.240> i<00:01:51.630> said<00:01:51.840> earlier<00:01:51.869> acid

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
acid because well as i said earlier acid

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.830 
acid because well as i said earlier acid
causes<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.490> molecules<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.180> water<00:01:54.210> to<00:01:54.600> stick

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
causes the molecules of water to stick

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.010 
causes the molecules of water to stick
together<00:01:55.280> we<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.460> break<00:01:56.729> those<00:01:57.030> down<00:01:57.060> into

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
together we can break those down into

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.500 
together we can break those down into
smaller<00:01:58.440> molecular<00:01:59.159> states<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:00.510 
smaller molecular states so that the

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.190 
smaller molecular states so that the
water<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.140> wetter<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:02.280> we're<00:02:02.460> looking<00:02:02.549> for

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
water is wetter so we're looking for

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.170 
water is wetter so we're looking for
more<00:02:04.200> bioavailable<00:02:04.619> water<00:02:05.430> water<00:02:05.760> that<00:02:06.060> can

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
more bioavailable water water that can

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.530 
more bioavailable water water that can
permeate<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> cell<00:02:07.020> membranes
