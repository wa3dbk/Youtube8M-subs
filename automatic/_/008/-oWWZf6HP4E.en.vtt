00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.520
 The skate wing from my local 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.899
 fish shop that reminds me of the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.899
 holiday on the belgian coast 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.769
 It's been quite a while now 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.410
 that we in the navi go to the national 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.779
 fishing museum in austin guy 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.020
 at that time the children were still small and 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.119
 We visited this museum often 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.760
 a museum full of life with many 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.820
 activities where the fisherman live in 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.489
 The reason is also the collection 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.790
 itself is going up 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.100
 Of course they stand 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.870
 world famous shrimp fisherman to horse 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 in the center of interest 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.610
 and also the North Sea aquariums are one 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.440

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.530
 from close proximity and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.690

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.500
 a skate or a cat shark too 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.850

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.539

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.539

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.030

 Fresh fish is never far away on the coast 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.500

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.140
