00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:13.980
 Hello in this idea with them to introduce a possibility as they 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.460
 Applications they have in the taskbar like 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.349
 in the example you currently the desktop 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.320
 how does it all look like all in the Callebaut system 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:25.140
 can let 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.449
 that means it will then be displayed to me with this tab but also 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.669
 that everyone knows 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.790
 and that ICANN will then 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.920
 the net is them to be and no longer in the cashier 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.210
 This only makes sense if you have a program 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.910
 that is needed but not all the time should be open and 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.330
 space to be taken away, so to speak 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.100
 must can 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.270
 Firefox &amp; Property should have a blog thats the whole thing too 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.700
 that's why it's worth it 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.920
 in the programs 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.700
 Nothing 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.700
 That began to save what she wants to introduce today 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.660
 everyone and so is this program what the most possible lives we may 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.700
 our standard nature except and give in the port town of National Sheen in the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.630
 Case Google 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.840
 trained 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.190
 What can she do while off 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.750
 wearing 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.280
 Google's search 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.380
 and then he should be the first to hit Triet by Citi Reichow 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.700
 Team sees it coming there 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.210
 we'll pick it 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.340
 and ladies 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.250
 we have here a download link current version 4 6 5 5 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.160
 is also available in German 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.860
 when kicking more then we get one 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.890
 zip file 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.640
 the ip data down here in the case I already have the file 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.380
 SWG race 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.490
 70 fast 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.190
 to the folder here who is she we open again shows rejects 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.330
 To run 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.340
 and then we have 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.690
 Normal case is such a window 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.610
 It may be that there is still a window in front of them that is took lead 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.000
 they can also rookie 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.320
 Way we've got her now and also saw preview window in the moment the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.389
 Programs are displayed 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:15.639
 On the run it makes sense that he once was Firefox and once our body 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.439
 I get it's normal program 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.029
 and prince was that's what it means 

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:23.449
 again the Explorer 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.219
 however, the start menu 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:27.850
 I would like to observe that now 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.359
 not out 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.799
 Also, it does not want to close that's why not the part easy 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:34.570
 Sawkill here by means 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.870
 that is always the fresh Bartens that the program should update 

00:02:39.089 --> 00:02:42.369
 «Now all programs are displayed which are currently active and there 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:44.159
 then the start would be there too 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.439
 I do not want to have the city area above Fab anymore but you 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.159
 quite wins system wears 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.159
 it's easy I like her 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.809
 So the start menu the explorer 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.949
 and g on this are 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:01.949
 Hawking her perisan system wears 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:05.159
 neither does it disappear 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.340
 explorer window from Manhattan broke out 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.340
 Take a look at the CWE system 

00:03:11.029 --> 00:03:14.029
 not there anymore but here 

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.450
 System Fred see her here 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.660
 our computer with an atze further comes because one has determined the 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.779
 Racing team on Sion 

00:03:21.779 --> 00:03:23.790
 the same he window 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.900
 For example, years should be bundled here, for example 2 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.569
 Explorer window bundled 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.229
 are they also because they are doing this case since isses com 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:37.220
 from me before and that here is this McPhail 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.970
 that means the time is currently system are still wearing windows 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.379
 as a food they also bundled because of it 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.939
 there is the 2 behind 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:47.309
 if you are now 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.179
 this up 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:50.870
 Click on the explorer window 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.560
 With it we get a selection window what we can open 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.700
 I created the start menu so I want to minimally minimize open Sekic 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.369
 here also states with it and then Portman start menu 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:02.710
 back on with the corresponding ones 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.359
 Teply above 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:07.459
 An advantage of the bastion is that you can close asphalt 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.440
 It used to be earlier and leave the program open 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.159
 has the SG Render fortunately 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.619
 that means you can do it 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:17.109
 just decide 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:17.910
 Venier 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.350
 If we want to get away from this whole option then we have to do the following 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.350
 Let's kick our sweet again 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:29.289
 Well, come on, cheerfully, and now it's time for Feil 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:32.139
 in the gate 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.590
 there we get on it then only one part has poured the served Seppi 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.930
 can it there 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.930
 «We are asked if we are safe 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.940
 and it fits the program quit and the function are gone again 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.150
 if you want to change the language is also very easy 

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:53.590
 Dan I go around here under Feil Selek Lengerich around 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.509
 W-lan here Schermann oysters 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.050
 she puts the program on Deutschtum are a few technical 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.310
 Have Berta with you 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.830
 but probably translate correctly 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.059
 definitely 

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:05.779
 these were on the Zeil 

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:08.879
 are also very interesting to read Sammy Spanish meanwhile 

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:13.199
 cares Barnes I have no idea I want to Yemen and everything here one 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:15.439
 German user interface 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.439
 besides, the program has many options 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:21.080
 on the whole are self-explanatory 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.000
 I do not have much to say about that now, among others 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.969
 Ette her options 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.240
 There are a few 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.710
 Options that can adjust the Sievert world and the Saudis No, I all 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.069
 self-explanatory 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:34.490
 I do not have to say much about that, I think 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.740
 and what's the matter with the program 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.200
 ask us 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.559
 we will 

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:43.559
 who are sure to want to answer 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:47.689
 as I said this to the program 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:48.680
 and 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.680
 the wars 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.550
 the 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.550
 mouth 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.550
 is 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:03.919
 Mainz 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.719
 Neuss 

00:06:05.719 --> 00:06:09.149
 the
