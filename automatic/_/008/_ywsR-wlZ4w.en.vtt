00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
gun noises and black ops 2 but in this

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:36.060 
gun noises and black ops 2 but in this
case<00:04:34.630> I<00:04:34.690> actually<00:04:34.960> think<00:04:35.289> the<00:04:35.530> gun<00:04:35.680> noise<00:04:35.860> is

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.469 
case I actually think the gun noise is
in<00:04:36.220> mw2<00:04:36.700> is<00:04:36.970> superior

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
in mw2 is superior

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.809 
in mw2 is superior
so<00:04:38.410> which<00:04:38.680> gun<00:04:38.860> is<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.099> winner

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
so which gun is the winner

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:44.839 
so which gun is the winner

the scar-h from mw2 normally the weapons
from<00:04:44.970> mw2<00:04:45.449> win<00:04:45.810> hands<00:04:46.020> down<00:04:46.169> but<00:04:46.830> in<00:04:46.919> this<00:04:47.009> case

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
from mw2 win hands down but in this case

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.610 
from mw2 win hands down but in this case
it<00:04:47.400> was<00:04:47.520> actually<00:04:47.669> quite<00:04:47.970> close<00:04:48.360> but<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.110> mw2

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
it was actually quite close but the mw2

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.589 
it was actually quite close but the mw2

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:51.599 
is 3 shot kill range is what ultimately

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:53.240 
is 3 shot kill range is what ultimately
put<00:04:51.900> it<00:04:51.990> over<00:04:52.139> the<00:04:52.289> edge<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:53.009> slightly

put it over the edge the slightly

put it over the edge the slightly
smaller<00:04:53.639> magazine<00:04:53.909> size<00:04:54.419> can<00:04:54.870> be<00:04:55.020> an<00:04:55.110> issue

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
smaller magazine size can be an issue

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.379 
smaller magazine size can be an issue
but<00:04:55.740> considering<00:04:56.190> you<00:04:56.310> can<00:04:56.490> kill<00:04:56.699> in<00:04:56.819> such<00:04:57.060> few

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
but considering you can kill in such few

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.140 
but considering you can kill in such few
shots<00:04:57.629> it's<00:04:57.960> usually<00:04:58.139> not<00:04:58.470> a<00:04:58.530> problem<00:04:59.150> so

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
shots it's usually not a problem so
