00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.009
 the semtran sole are made of various materials 

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:09.600
 by whoopi faioli 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.029
 are the most common materials used in the tennis printers in the team 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:16.150
 the material is beaten and mixed 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.169
 forming a mass that will be tried in a little hill 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.189
 the mixture passes through several rollers to achieve uniformity 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.880
 the most basic material among the sole 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.349
 is the itil vinyl acetate better known as send 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.220
 to produce the does not need stacked blades of iva 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:37.339
 which are placed in a mold and are compressed 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.469
 the result of the material and a 300% expanded printer 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.469
 and consequently much lighter than opel 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:50.330
 look at this pile of twisting blades and see the difference and immaterial before 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.570
 compression 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.510
 The result is a girl's turn to go through a machine to 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.820
 thinner 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.080
 cut ends are cut ready to form the printer 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.960
 the excess material will be used in the production of insole and lining 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 other areas of tennis 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.670
 the end is placed in molds that will make the cut in the exact size and shape of the 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.050
 midsole 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.590
 then goes through the process that precisely delineates the space 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.590
 where air bubbles will be placed 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.270
 the prey is placed in boxes 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.299
 waiting to be measured to confirm they are in standard size 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.159
 then inserted into a solution 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.210
 which will facilitate their mold accommodation 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.930
 then are pressed in the final mold to acquire the actual shape 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.330
 among the lonely 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.910
 the last type of end is the injectable 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.150
 this process has many advantages is cheaper the final product is very 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.780
 more consistent and there is no waste of material at the time of cutting 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.060
 in the final molded injected blades are ground and form a grain the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.570
 which are dried fired injected directly into the mold 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:14.319
 after seven minutes the final injected liquid is withdrawn and overdue list 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.999
 formed 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:18.969
 is a similar process of opel production 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:22.360
 injected fagan put back into shape 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.360
 to gradually acquire shape and size 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.769
 after being removed from the form 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.219
 and goes through an inspection to detect if the size is correct and so that the 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:35.119
 burrs are removed 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:39.429
 then in trasona it goes through a machine that detects its quality the 

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:41.919
 Good are clean packed in bags 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.919
 and sent to the shoe factory 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.869
 some air bags undergo several processes 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:53.790
 they are clean and then receive a very thin layer of quintÃ£o base 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.000
 explored with water 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.579
 and stay at rest 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.819
 until dry 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.450
 then a thin layer of Paraiba glue 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.120
 is applied to ensure that the bag is fastened midsole dpu 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.749
 the Libyan midsole is made with liquid polyurethane placed in molds 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:14.739
 the air bag and placed on a motorcycle and then the liquid polyurethane is 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.739
 played on top of the girl 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:22.809
 the machine they produce is printed, they have 48 stations and each one is 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.809
 responsible for a printer pair 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.599
 in another case 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.390
 the machine is predetermined by the computer and the worst the liquid is 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.389
 equally distributed in each shape 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.819
 calore chemical reaction occurs within the mold and opium or solidifies it is 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.819
 removed from the engine undergoing a cleaning 

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:49.310
 to insert the bag had river end midsole 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.089
 she should be encapsulated year bill 

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:56.409
 the do is not put in the mold with the bag there was river that hu is dumped in 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.209
 return 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.209
 the clean midsole to eliminate excess material 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.879
 this joint operation in the intersolar the solado 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:11.599
 the inspectors receives in kind or not the printers and soles separately the 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.419
 cleaned midsole are cleaned so that the glue is applied in place 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.609
 exact junction of the sole 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.889
 the beach crown 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.099
 is applied between the units to help but are not 

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:26.270
 ultraviolet light allows operators to be from exactly where the glue 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.330
 must be applied 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.240
 the midsole goes through a small warm up and then which after all is 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.180
 applied separately to our side and in the midsole 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.850
 the two components go to a hot runner and go through a check 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.850
 in the end 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.970
 the worker line the pieces with great skill 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.770
 and places the parties the struggles in a press machine to hold the strong 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.219
 junction 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.279
 after the shutdown of the isolated printer undergoes a cooling process 

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.039
 inspection 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.139
 faulty units can be placed properly and pressed 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.100
 again 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.860
 if the second time they offer defects will be destroyed those that do not 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.050
 present human defect in ballads
