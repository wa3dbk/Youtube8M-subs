00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.780
 hello today there will be an boxing 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:12.019
 Basik playing cards so we get 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.750
 red years 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.680
 here so here looks sealed goals 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.590
 Corbos call that is absolutely clean with 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:28.410
 days is not that so in theory we need 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:38.120
 open the red ribbon rip off 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:41.940
 this red ribbon of your case is in the way 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:49.200
 Well, actually we made it easier 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:51.829
 to open the cards the knife is not simple not 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:59.149
 they will interfere with these magical ones 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:05.489
 boy scissors so this is not the main 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:16.189
 clumsy ok let's go over the well 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:30.350
 black sealed really wait you 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:45.509
 watch this is it okay boxing with you 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:52.820
 teeth open forces 1 close we all 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:59.140
 we get absolutely clean deck of cards 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.140
 everything is a good box is good 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.600
 the new one slides perfectly that is 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.180
 one over the other the card slide well and their 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.480
 itâ€™s very convenient to make tapes 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.850
 that is, with old decks if you 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.070
 Mahadevan two weeks already spends it 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.650
 it was not very long on top we see two 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.110
 bonus cards 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:34.700
 below we see the joker and 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:37.120
 advertising joker that's garbage full then 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.600
 there is a deck that's called what 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.510
 the king 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.970
 in all obey the king whether when 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.220
 called in america i don't remember exactly but 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.620
 there is some kind of name for it 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.630
 not very traditional not in general 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:57.160
 if this is the storeroom they bought first 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.160
 time I go to get comfortable 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:06.860
 because the cards again repeat by 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.600
 on each other in a circle or that is on 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.150
 it is very convenient to put breaks on them 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.840
 have good elasticity ie need 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.200
 move two cards show some sort 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.630
 3 before initially it is about but 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.870
 I have not shown the master 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:26.780
 Okay, in general, what can you say as you 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.810
 worth buying that is among the cards for 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.360
 tricks plastic these cards owns 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.829
 in great demand and they own because 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.730
 they software saying the cheapest tel 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:39.680
 tally hall is worth twice as much as I 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.489
 good cards in general Basik I think 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.739
 build any novice magician 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:52.250
 ending there I don't know yes 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:56.269
 cool cards they should be bought 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:58.850
 they cost a penny there but they are worth it 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.530
 so that bullfights almost forgot here 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.300
 boxes with 12 decks 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.920
 eat decorate at least six red 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:10.440
 I think it costs 1300 rubles 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.900
 1200 1300 something like this all the boxes but I 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.480
 I will say that it will be more profitable to buy 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.910
 boxes than 12 decks of cards but believe me 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.480
 if you buy at least three decks then you 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.880
 already understand what to buy later boxes already 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.940
 because the cards will go bad every 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.830
 maybe a month more and tricks like 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.870
 the Internet appears more and more 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.240
 learn more and more cards 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.810
 spoil and it is better to buy new 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.600
 cards and did the same tricks with them, Well 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.500
 there was at such 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.910
 plainly you can say dunbar 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.740
 to sell some 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.030
 toy which I once did so now 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.040
 he can do this thing with them 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:52.040
 owls are especially very cool 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:05:01.050
 total destroy advise you to buy that deck 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:03.889
 and I was with you so good luck everyone 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.889
 until
