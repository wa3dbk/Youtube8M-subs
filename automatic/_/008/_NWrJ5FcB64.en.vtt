00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.990
 after being seduced by the four 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.510
 doors then surprised by the 5 doors 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.349

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.290
 break 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.640
 the recipe remains the same 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.590
 satisfactory dynamics 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.250
 a high level of equipment and the 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:30.080
 unbeatable rates 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.300
 breaks represent 15% of sales 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.580
 in france of chevrolet had to 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.650
 position the cruz on this segment she 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.899
 which is already available in two other 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.520

 the world the cruze is a vehicle 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.010
 global and should therefore please everyone 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.050
 aesthetically the American as well 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.300
 lengthen does not do in extravagance 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.850
 but its front is the imposing 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.120
 grille with the logo chebbi rest 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.160
 always very characteristic with its 4 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.640
 meter sixty-eight long by 1 meter 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.680
 80 wide and 1 meter 50 3 2 to the sw 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.539
 may be part of the big jigs 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.670
 of the segment the 500 to 1478 liters of 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:17.149
 available trunk are not for 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.920
 as much as the best scores found at 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.050
 edge of the American it's always a 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.849
 atmosphere to the transformers with 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.560
 brushed aluminum and lighting 

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:26.060
 bluish 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.649
 despite all the interior style remains 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.050
 strictly identical to the others 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.860
 declinations of cruz and the quality the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.110
 adjustments is not better 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.030
 nevertheless the sw and generous in space 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.220
 storage whatever the finish 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.979
 with an armrest in the back 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.080
 and a compartmented chest floor 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.020
 the latter, however, offers a beautiful space 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.819
 with an almost flat floor 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.459
 equipment side note that the system 

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:55.910
 mylink is now available from 

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:58.220
 ltz version bluetooth compatibility 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.069
 smartphone reading mp3 photos but also 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.220
 video all controlled by drag 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.330
 must smartphone way the mylink fills 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.849
 perfectly his role 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.069
 only navigation seemed good 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.750
 little responsive to modifications or 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.360
 route recalculation 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.790
 the cruze sw also hosts two 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.070
 new engines a block 1 liter 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.290
 4 gasoline and generously downsized 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.770
 thanks to the addition of overeating and 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.800
 the block to the revenue it VCDI 231 horses 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.360
 our test model in this case 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.000
 supercharged too and enjoying the 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.860
 stop and start 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.900
 this engine does the work with good 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.459
 times in the towers even though it is missing 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.800
 cruelly low flexibility 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.870
 Consumption of 1 liter is chase 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.880
 have however satisfactory with 6 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.940
 liters 3 or without finding on average 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.670
 on a varied course with 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.920
 1400 75 kg on the scale 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:54.989
 the cruze sw is not the lightest of 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.390
 its category but its comfort on the road 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.730
 remains pleasant thanks to a 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.709
 soft cushioning we would like him a 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.400
 firmer direction at high speed 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.100
 especially 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.050
 but in return the cruze sw attack 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.650
 well turns and becomes even easy 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.510
 alive about choosing the version 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.150
 ideal would be the ltz 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.530
 from 22 thousand 900 euros which 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.200
 already has an excellent level 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.209
 equipment including the famous mylink itself 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.519
 if bluetooth and usb jack jacks 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.090
 are available in series whatever 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:29.510
 either the hat deer version the 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.920
 renault megan estate a micro 9 dci130 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:35.670
 dynamic energy starts for example at 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.330
 27000 350 euros is much more 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.850
 the Volkswagen golf sw tdi140 comfortline 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.340
 it's accurate to 29 1150 euros 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.180
 short whatever the price to finish 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.769
 equivalent 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.500
 no other manufacturer offers 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.850
 as many equipment as a system to 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.830
 the image of mali 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.780
 the chevrolet cruze sw is not 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.390
 irreproachable so far but she 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.930
 offers a price / benefit ratio 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.930
 truly relevant
