00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.170
 hello girls I will find you 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.580
 in a video about my eyebrows 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.730
 so you have been a lot to me 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.680
 request this video 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.900
 so I'm doing it to you then it is necessary 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.400
 know that already put on cl I have them 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.720
 made to permanent makeup 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:29.009
 so there for example handle a genius fact 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:32.040
 pencil or powder or anything 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.630
 it's dermopigmentation it's me 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.940
 seems to say like that 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.679
 in the pigmentation example then already 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.519
 to give you my opinion on on her on 

00:00:40.679 --> 00:00:43.559
 permanent makeup 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.929
 in any case at the eyebrows I 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.510
 am super satisfied 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:51.149
 it's been five years since I made them and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:56.390
 I did a single editing 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:01:01.440
 two years ago at my wedding so here we go 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:03.359
 it's good it's still so that's it 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.820
 does not hurt to be a cream 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.890
 anesthesia anyway and 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.420
 that's really no regrets I had 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.710
 scared at first I said yes but that 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.200
 will not change what it really changes 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.570
 a sail look to those who have the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.760
 eyebrows not filled enough or the form does not 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.820
 not fit according to the face or 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.880
 what do you take the lead to put 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.220
 his time drawing a word on sky 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.930
 frankly do these parks have found a 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.190
 good institute that will not make us 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.660
 because I've seen some who have 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:36.509
 very weird eyebrows really i get 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.220
 ask how they paid for that I 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.000
 go to you so I put you ramparts 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.320
 info the address 12 the effects for 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.399
 those who are not very far who 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.580
 want to go see 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:55.289
 it's the jasmine institute so in mulhouse 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.420
 in the alsace and and that's otherwise 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.430
 what else are you going to tell you 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.020
 very satisfied, that's all satisfied 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.450
 because I 'm not going to take the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.950
 head when I make up for to 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.539
 sources and weight if I miss me and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.950
 trait it's going to be too dark etc 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:12.540
 on the other hand when I do makeup 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.330
 quite pronounced or when I go in 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.220
 evening what and I have time I 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.730
 take my time it is true that I 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.709
 games the relay goes over with the 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.930
 powder I will still show you 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.630
 how do I do for those 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.820
 interested but I was not really 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.420
 I want to intensify a little the color 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.160
 I use black go I have black hair 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.160
 I take it in this kit so has these 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.930
 lollipop kits it's a smokey kit 1 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.140
 it's a simple lighthouse and I take 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.610
 this dead because he is dull and I 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:49.450
 I'm applying the 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.150
 the lighthouse with a ghz brush with a 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.300
 beveled brush a small step simply 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.860
 a little bit of material and I will trace the 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:00.850
 line 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.710
 so me she is already drawn so 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.040
 I just need two tracks in 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.040
 below 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.769
 here 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.799
 and I just fill 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:50.200
 and I come leucophÃ©e with a bottle brush 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:52.770
 a good clean piont a clean bottle brush 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.770
 and I'm just going 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.270
 stock market and my name is my sourcing 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.410
 what it gives 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.209
 - cana which is darker than the other 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:21.320
 and to hold the hair I use 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:26.590
 so a kit of so serves the revlon focus 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:31.070
 and so fix it to who you make it 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.860
 for sarah leave for eyebrows 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.360
 on the other hand, it's too clear for me and 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:44.919
 I come to take with me always 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:44.919
 same brush wax and with wax 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:51.899
 I will come fix but missiles but 

00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:51.899
 on his steps 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.840
 so that's it does not really take me 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.200
 a lot of time not a lot of time 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.200
 at all 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.810
 so we see we can see that one who 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:16.970
 is darker than the other 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.539
 I did not need to redesign what 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:21.590
 whether it's because I already have my line 

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:24.590
 which is very so that's the result 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:27.289
 when I made them both so there 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.000
 it's still pretty dark but 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:31.759
 this is the brown it's too clear the 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.889
 black marble mix that's not going either 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.810
 so I 'm doing death anyway 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:38.870
 it's the color of my hair that makes 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:42.050
 a look at 7 years not severe enough but 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:43.759
 that's after, as it says it's really 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.320
 do it really when I have a look a 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:47.930
 makeup loaded at eye level 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.040
 if not daily I really do not 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:55.240
 the usefulness of doing later eyebrows 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:57.620
 permanent makeup frankly c 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.710
 it's revolutionary 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.320
 here we learn more about the head 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:07.700
 missed our hair removal or what 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.200
 frankly I am for 200% your 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.500
 dreams 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:15.440
 so here and thank you for watching 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.180
 this video I hope she answered to 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.880
 your expectations for the one who wanted 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:25.010
 to know how I was doing my eyebrows 

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:26.960
 but I do not even do that anymore 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.060
 not too much time was going to make 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.260
 and if I can in pencil I was preparing a 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.810
 filled game just in fact 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.360
 Finally I go for it and a little more 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.000
 color because otherwise they are already 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:41.540
 drawn they are already filled so 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.070
 here for this tutorial we will say I 

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.920
 thank you very much for watching 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:48.320
