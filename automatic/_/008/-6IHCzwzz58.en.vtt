cover<00:00:05.930> first<00:00:06.930> we<00:00:07.500> want<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.770> do<00:00:07.890> is<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.189> carpet

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
cover first we want to do is this carpet

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.919 
cover first we want to do is this carpet
here<00:00:08.760> where<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.030> vent<00:00:09.269> comes<00:00:09.510> out<00:00:09.660> underneath

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
here where the vent comes out underneath

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.810 
here where the vent comes out underneath
the<00:00:10.050> seat<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.500> passenger<00:00:10.950> side<00:00:11.010> we<00:00:11.639> don't

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
the seat on the passenger side we don't

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.310 
the seat on the passenger side we don't
have<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.969> wiring<00:00:12.269> harness<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.809> fold<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.170> under

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
have a wiring harness to fold it under

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.220 
have a wiring harness to fold it under
so<00:00:14.130> what<00:00:15.059> I've<00:00:15.179> done<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.360> taking<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> lip<00:00:16.080> and

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
so what I've done is taking the lip and

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.400 
so what I've done is taking the lip and
folded<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.250> back<00:00:17.550> so<00:00:18.270> it<00:00:18.449> smashes<00:00:18.900> down<00:00:19.020> holds

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
folded it back so it smashes down holds

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.830 
folded it back so it smashes down holds
itself<00:00:19.650> down<00:00:19.890> in<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.550> way<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.689> won't

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
itself down in that way that that won't

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.370 
itself down in that way that that won't
be<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.109> way<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.529> vent<00:00:24.230> first<00:00:25.230> where

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
be in the way of that vent first where

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.689 
be in the way of that vent first where
to<00:00:25.470> take<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.740> computer<00:00:25.920> make<00:00:26.310> sure<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.550> got<00:00:26.640> it

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
to take the computer make sure we got it

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.490 
to take the computer make sure we got it
lined<00:00:26.939> up<00:00:27.119> right<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.510> three<00:00:27.720> mounting<00:00:28.109> points

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
lined up right the three mounting points

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.130 
lined up right the three mounting points
and<00:00:28.650> check<00:00:29.580> our<00:00:29.730> electric<00:00:30.090> connectors<00:00:30.510> and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and check our electric connectors and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.470 
and check our electric connectors and
just<00:00:31.380> start<00:00:31.590> we'll<00:00:31.740> go<00:00:31.859> from<00:00:31.980> left<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.369> right

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
just start we'll go from left to right

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.020 
just start we'll go from left to right
this<00:00:33.480> large<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.410> first<00:00:34.680> push<00:00:35.520> it<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.790> till<00:00:35.969> it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
this large one first push it in till it

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.569 
this large one first push it in till it
clicks<00:00:36.270> do<00:00:37.079> not<00:00:37.260> force<00:00:37.649> these<00:00:37.860> make<00:00:38.160> sure<00:00:38.340> they

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
clicks do not force these make sure they

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.220 
clicks do not force these make sure they
go<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.879> correctly<00:00:39.300> they<00:00:39.540> should<00:00:39.750> slide<00:00:40.020> in

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
go in correctly they should slide in

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.229 
go in correctly they should slide in
normally<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.829> click<00:00:41.399> when<00:00:41.579> they<00:00:41.700> lock<00:00:41.910> if

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
normally and click when they lock if

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.779 
normally and click when they lock if
they're<00:00:42.750> real<00:00:43.020> hard<00:00:43.350> check<00:00:44.190> make<00:00:44.460> sure<00:00:44.489> you

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
they're real hard check make sure you

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.100 
they're real hard check make sure you
got<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.030> in<00:00:45.120> line<00:00:45.300> crackling<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.840> don't<00:00:45.989> have

them<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.829> place<00:00:53.070> then<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.640> want<00:00:53.789> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
them all in place then we just want to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.270 
them all in place then we just want to
slide<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.300> over<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:55.680> where<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.860> bolts<00:00:56.010> down

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
slide it over to where it bolts down

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.799 
slide it over to where it bolts down
it's<00:00:56.579> going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.760> use<00:00:56.940> three<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.360> these<00:00:57.480> six

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
it's going to use three of these six

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.349 
it's going to use three of these six
millimeter<00:00:58.289> bolts<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:59.670> ten<00:00:59.910> millimeter

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
now I've got a 10 millimeter deep socket

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.740 
now I've got a 10 millimeter deep socket
I<00:01:31.220> don't<00:01:31.369> need<00:01:31.490> it<00:01:31.640> for<00:01:31.790> this<00:01:31.880> application<00:01:32.119> is

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
I don't need it for this application is

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.510 
I don't need it for this application is
just<00:01:33.290> handy<00:01:33.650> it<00:01:33.740> gets<00:01:33.890> it<00:01:34.010> up<00:01:34.100> a<00:01:34.190> little<00:01:34.310> higher

step<00:01:58.220> is<00:01:58.399> a<00:01:58.460> cover<00:01:59.560> and<00:02:00.560> it's<00:02:01.039> going<00:02:01.220> to<00:02:01.280> come

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
step is a cover and it's going to come

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.310 
step is a cover and it's going to come
and<00:02:01.700> cover<00:02:02.119> this<00:02:02.330> wiring<00:02:02.630> harness<00:02:03.140> assembly

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
and cover this wiring harness assembly

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.699 
and cover this wiring harness assembly
and<00:02:07.239> it's<00:02:08.239> going<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.450> go<00:02:08.630> into<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.019> machine

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
and it's going to go into that machine

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.340 
and it's going to go into that machine
portion<00:02:10.429> of<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.759> computer<00:02:11.690> itself<00:02:11.810> so<00:02:12.230> it's

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
portion of the computer itself so it's

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.790
