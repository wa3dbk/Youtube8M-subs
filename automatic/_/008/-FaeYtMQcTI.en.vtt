00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
fact we can take the after pictures that

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.960 
fact we can take the after pictures that
day<00:03:07.020> that's<00:03:07.500> how<00:03:07.770> healthy<00:03:08.220> that<00:03:08.250> tissue<00:03:08.670> is

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
day that's how healthy that tissue is

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.210 
day that's how healthy that tissue is
and<00:03:09.420> so<00:03:09.930> most<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.500> time<00:03:10.680> we<00:03:10.830> like<00:03:11.010> to<00:03:11.100> have
