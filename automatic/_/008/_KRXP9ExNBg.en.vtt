00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 if you think that caroline opens this 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.830
 time 7 look now I do it more 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.360
 little more in history than these comparison 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.280
 two problems you know that in 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.049
 he was absolutely thinking of in 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.809
 this moment really because yesterday 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.800
 carolina in my opinion had a 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.080
 result 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.300
 I'm glad even werner is 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.670
 appreciated the same because I always have 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.769
 said a great skater though 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.990
 really must find the solution to 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.990
 its problems and I must find it must 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.040
 we talked about carolina snakes 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:41.489
 carolina tranches yesterday were 761 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.620
 skin transition in theory are not 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.440
 influenced by the performance we say 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:51.719
 because the steps are there or are not there 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.460
 however the interpretation of this has done 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.680
 a third of what was expected in 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:59.250
 that choreography because he gave up 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.289
 has also renounced that written in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.879
 film goes well sure high because 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.089
 however your ability to skate 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.770
 remains 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:11.079
 even with a bad performance though 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.240
 let's follow along with alexander.ma 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:16.689
 golden was happy instead of his 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.750
 result the eighth right on the soft 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:18.750
 rock 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.810
 the products 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.690
 double the look 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.200
 the second half of the program starts with 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.000
 triple flip triple toe loop very well 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.000
 the fourth jumping element 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.640
 we always remember that there are eight jumps 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.379
 or rather the jump elements from 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.379
 include second triple axel 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.140
 other triple flip combination col 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.960
 double talk and another double tholut 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.060
 so many technical points is scoring 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.430
 this guy in the second half of the 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:09.100
 core many not because there is the whole bonus 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.430
 for the jumps of the section of 10 for 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:15.130
 hundred compared to the base value and we'll see 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.970
 that almost all top athletes have 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.680
 opted for this construction formula 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.620
 of the program with three jump elements 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.620
 in the first half and 5 in the second half 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:48.120
 a last double axel very well too 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:48.120
 this excellent free I would say great free 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.770
 this is the sequence of steps 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.770
 choreographic 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:38.080
 great free but then it really is look 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.490
 he also thinks that after what 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.740
 he said I never managed to do 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.050
 Russian so well in a competition as well 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.639
 important says two had happened to me 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.630
 minor leagues but the competition 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:48.669
 European 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:52.300
 so important and I certainly must have 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:54.430
 also gained some experience and 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.110
 among other things he is one of practical canvases 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.250
 had problems with the pacts in the sense that 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.020
 the agreements reached them only 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.990
 Wednesday morning he never was 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:03.039
 could train in the drinks to do the 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.050
 tracks here 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:07.120
 before the race of ours says okay 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.449
 no matter I arrived and I immediately 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.370
 had excellent feedback from the trip 

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:14.500
 in short, he really made a great one 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.690
 try alexander.ma the road really 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.669
 really and look at this of the problem of 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.860
 skates in flight 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:22.569
 really a problem for athletes who 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.520
 must travel half the world with 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:29.530
 maybe fast connections between one 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.030
 another losing shoes at least 

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:34.120
 two days of training 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.039
 hope the pacts will arrive 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.440
 indeed that's why in fact maybe 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:41.180
 we have to put it home is not another 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.180
 fingers takes the first pair of powers that 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.580
 it's all about talking all right 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:50.710
 each to his own pair of skates that 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:54.050
 it must be modeled on itself the blades go 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.240
 mounted in a certain way under the shoe 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:07:00.349
 to find the passetto the balance 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:03.199
 very precise but one speaks of mm to mm 

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:06.139
 forward mm back right left the 

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:09.430
 blade edge each skater to his 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:12.289
 particular thread and usually there are 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:17.659
 very few people really at the 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:19.669
 world able to intervene on the skate 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:23.539
 because it's not a lot of equipment 

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:25.520
 common and therefore it takes just the 

00:07:23.539 --> 00:07:27.340
 right person to take care of this 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.480
 thing 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.919
 we score for him is well 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:36.850
 welcomed by a big applause e 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:40.120
 aggravated the technician 72 and 89 64 70 for 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:45.040
 the presentation 137 59 its new 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:49.780
 best site for a total of 211 and 88 

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:52.630
 race that really matters is almost a bit between 

00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:56.380
 the incredulous and the really happy 

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:59.350
 important result for this boy 

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.479
 which as you see is trained by the Pope e 

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:05.669
 from mum while this year though 

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:05.669
 thanks also to the collaboration of Catania
