00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.780
 today a very special game 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.540
 it is about the move to the 8th 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.760
 And also the constellation is explosive 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.559
 it's the us team of a former 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.570
 german bundestrainers klinsmann against 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.670
 jogi löw's team 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.090
 the picture newspaper is quite safe 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.149
 how does it end up heading today 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.190
 they go today you see stars like 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.989
 actually goes out there we'll see the same 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.210
 and now we have something to do with them 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.070
 to type and give to spectators 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.260
 it in the reddish stellwerk yesterday 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.229
 Thursday night a holistic 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.909
 number around 1200 in a good mood 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.320
 People here together 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.290
 sparkling communal 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.270
 footballing experience was looking for open air 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.869
 free sky 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.600
 overall there was tension 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.759
 Expectations of the game rumored 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:26.869
 Nobody likes coach arrangements here 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:32.869
 believe i'm both on 21 your tip 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:35.610
 So definitely Germany wins 3 2 1 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.369
 among the German fans only a few Americans 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.920
 but even that falls to him very little 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.020
 optimistic I think that a clear 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.649
 superspiel a win-win-situation for 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.840
 both 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.850
 if the usa can win it on 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.430
 If Germany wins today, there is 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.110
 Here a big party believed that it 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.820
 An agreement between the trainers 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.890
 has given a desired 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.880
 draw 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.820
 Germany wants to win and the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.729
 United States also a tip me 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.820
 think to 1 for Germany 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.770
 point 18 o'clock the game begins 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.080
 team is from the beginning at the pusher 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.210
 and almost permanently in the American 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.850
 third in spite of the outstanding 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:16.250
 percentage of possession over 80 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.470
 percent and a number of good opportunities 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.080
 at the front a gate graduation with the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.810
 German team failed 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.390
 lament in the audience 0 to 0 then to 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.970
 Half time for many after the 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.220
 nerve-racking 45 minutes only 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.190
 to strengthen for once against the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.070
 heat and sweetest stomach instead of sweet 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.560
 ball arts then opinions on the game 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.600
 but very different unity at 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.880
 the overall assessment of the German 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.910
 audience prevails optimism 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.560
 how did you like the game so far ? 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.400
 boring but i think that 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.620
 win germany 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.720
 So it should be a bit strong 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.100
 So, of course, Germany better 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.130
 Germany will win the case and what 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.550
 is your tip in the end 2 1 for 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.550
 Germany 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.900
 two new ones for germany so everybody 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.360
 case a victory has to come 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.220
 against the amis must be easy until 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.489
 Now much to my opinion 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.220
 to 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.530
 and how are you I think 1 0 for 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:21.590
 america what is your tip for being 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:23.840
 result 10 germany then took that 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.470
 play again on and also the 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.160
 tension 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.730
 ten minutes later the 55 minute and 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.730
 this scene 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.660
 Thomas Müller laughs a spell 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.630
 The current location was not broken 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.130
 single jubilee at the entrance of the 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.800
 German team go 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.810
 Eighth finals have few left 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.300
 doubt 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.650
 nevertheless a 20 would from the view of the fans 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.320
 Do not hurt now 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.500
 but these demands remain unheard of 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.030
 except for a few inattentions remains 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.140
 the German eleven in ball possession dominant 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.690
 and leaves nothing to burn 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.940
 shortly before 8 o'clock then the final whistle 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.630
 today is the eighth-finals for the fans 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.690
 secured 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:14.720
 this is germany group-first and 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:20.989
 also the german influenced us selection is 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:22.910
 continue super cool game 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.040
 top mood here so great 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.360
 played was found to be ok 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.190
 be a bit more behind 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.010
 but have to say jürgen klinsmann 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.419
 nor jogi lion because the German and 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.750
 have given in the gas and so must 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.480
 his 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.550
 great location everything great is how it works for 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.140
 the team 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:43.130
 for the team goes to the semi-finals and 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.830
 a final world champion Germany 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.419
 best team of the world 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.780
 Germany has to give gas because of 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.850
 Germany a few hundred later 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.430
 meter further away turns 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.570
 the closed corner karlstraße 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.840
 wilhelmstraße again quite traditional 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.660
 in a single football party zone 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.870
 the eighth-finale is certainly the mood 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.320
 is good 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.320
 hormonal fans from 2006 through the city
