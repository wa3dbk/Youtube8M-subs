00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.500
 hello kids I'm 88 and today I'm going to 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.080
 talk about how to protect yourself from 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.270
 attack of the kestrel 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.760
 the kestrel is a bird of prey of a 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.369
 he's looking for food all day 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.009
 is protected by law throughout 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.690
 the untouchable year is untouchable asks 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:35.680
 bushes and in fields 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:38.830
 of course we have field animals 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.620
 in cages what happens that the whole field 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.280
 he is coming 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.430
 and their diet to their base diet are mice 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:50.040
 ankles frogs worms and insects in 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.790
 general and also pick up some small 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.879
 sparrow and little else but as a supplement 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.620
 now add light canaries diamonds 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.690
 pennants and every living creature that 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.180
 they are in cages on a balcony the advantage 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.489
 to be in advantage for her is that she 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.780
 build a nest does not build or anything 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.479
 that is, it is 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.610
 a rock with a hole there that teva there 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.220
 to make nests a tree with a hole 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.990
 There are issues that have to be nested 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.320
 high building that has has been a 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.049
 outgoing there make nest buried in 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.050
 any supposed site is usually between 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:30.170
 April and June puts three to five 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.860
 eggs and incubate them about 28 days a 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:37.130
 those babies come out in about 30 days 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.049
 approximately already grandma so a 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.840
 Once we have talked about more or less how 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.539
 this is already we are going to tell you how 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.320
 prevent the attack of this first thing 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.210
 cover the cage with a metal mesh 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.630
 a metal mesh to prevent the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.860
 claws and beak can enter between 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.060
 bars the second 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:03.420
 a statue a wooden figure of 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:06.660
 outside of a raptor is greater than 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.440
 this or greater or larger I by 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.550
 example 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:15.310
 I have something gregorio the spare added 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.980
 then because I do not know why he has a face 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.100
 glory and good and it has worked for me 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.220
 I have it on the balcony, I have some 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.680
 how many birds do I have the owl on top of? 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.470
 a cage and there brings us a little closer 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.670
 before these attacks can not be done 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.020
 much or protect with a mesh or 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.850
 proteins with a figure that I 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.800
 I personally recommend the mesh 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.140
 metal because for example our 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.900
 friend Juan Antonio is from Granada 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:47.380
 we have sent this image that is like the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.350
 protect your birds in this case I think 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.630
 that canary bear iker but it's fine 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.730
 protection no no the choice is the 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.120
 his wife Carmen and in the and we do not have 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.370
 also this other image that comes from 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.680
 barcelona that has sent us josep 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.190
 You see how perfectly the frame 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.550
 what he has done is removable and that is to say 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.350
 you can take that frame or remove it and 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.510
 there they are without without any kind of 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.390
 protection and then place them 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.409
 it's very easy to be able to change the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.319
 water the food can clean them and so on 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.819
 these two options are great then 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.129
 also for those who do not want to work 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.290
 So therefore one morning put by 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.140
 on the front on the sides 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:36.489
 well covered everything with that also we 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.129
 we avoid the attack if in the mesh it is 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.489
 about 5 centimeters apart from the 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:45.129
 better better cage because that's how they do not arrive 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.959
 nor to touch them but well what is all not 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:49.150
 you can avoid too much so little 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.560
 more I hope you have served the video 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.739
 I hope it applied 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.240
 this before they attack your 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.400
 little birds 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.410
 and you already know how to like it if it has 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.320
 liked to subscribe if you are not 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.980
 subscribed and a hug kids until the 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.980
 next video
