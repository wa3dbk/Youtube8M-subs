00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:03.100

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.390
 well here going up 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.320
 a new video 

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:10.500
 and then on this occasion emotions recommendations my recommendation this 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.449
 case 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.319
 I do not know if it has happened to you with a device 

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:18.550
 who spend it on the internet looking for games that are fun for 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.300
 this model is the most present 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.300
 from 55 30 and that kind of events was achieved 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.280
 its employees that are not so complicated since on the screen it is tactile it is not 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.279
 can do as many things as a physical keyboard 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.270
 just the past that are on the internet for the next two meetings for a 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.510
 month after a lot 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 just starting as a fun pattern but 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.430
 we do not have much 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.640
 so it is worth it to be a recommendation is that of games that 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.580
 They found 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.900
 he found them in the ovi store 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.630
 locked in a world since in saying it seen from ovi store has very games 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.120

 you have not seen many incidents 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.970
 I like their singles since the screen is tactile and culÃ©s commerce 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.400

 the goal is that all means 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.879
 We are all getting to know each other's origin 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.879
 they fought bulls 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:58.919

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:14.199
