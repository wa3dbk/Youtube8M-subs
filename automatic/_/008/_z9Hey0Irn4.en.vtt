00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:12.120
 the ponds with the cave and the 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.120
 I traveled to her to here 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.520
 from departure 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.770
 t 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.980
 or 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.279
 and as we can see 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.930
 He made a group entrance where that 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.930
 object there 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.220
 we see it is dark 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.650
 here 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.050
 we have no other entries 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.550
 on the other hand 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.550
 here is a path 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:51.650
 way but it does not take us 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.650
 nowhere unoci 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.989
 where I went by a while ago she sees light 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:04.790
 It has a vent that looks we can 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.790
 see the entrance on the other hand 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:12.360
 here we see that it also has output 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.650
 a small passageway 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:25.330
 here we have enough traces of 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:27.340
 tennis shoes sneakers shoes 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.100
 man's woman 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.030
 everything there is the other entry that we have 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.350
 gone over there 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.870
 so we can see some bottles 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:43.360
 sky blue 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.360
 with the cookie wrappers 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.030
 Up there 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.760
 we see that it is closed does not happen 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.960
 all 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.960
 we are dark here 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.380
 for here 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.380
 We can see 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:17.560
 and now based on coca pets and is the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.560
 catwalk that would not be on the other side 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.010
 or 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.430
 here we can see a ball that's a 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.430
 ball 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.760
 here 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.299
 but it does not turn around 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:55.860
 we can see a vent 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.970
 it's down there and we can see what 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:04.340
 the one that has the most beer bottle 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.340
 soda water chips 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:09.280
 there are people who have come here 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.190
 marker 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.030
 3 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.030
 will that 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.880
 we went to this other entrance where 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.510
 I had to pass because it 's high here 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.510
 I could not go up 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.400
 this can not go up I had to give it the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.569
 return 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:34.810
 and we feel how the air comes in that already 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.890
 we are close to each other 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.100
 in another entry 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.140
 bags 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.140
 more beer containers 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.540
 over here 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.440
 what we have 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.550
 a blanket with is a dress 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.550
 It's a dress 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.680
 but no 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:01.680
 and there we go 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.849
 ah 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.020
 and a little bit more light because 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.950
 we are here from the other entry in your 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.800
 defect the output 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.160
 here what's in it and what can not go up 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:29.310
 you can see this the difference is 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:31.640
 higher but here is our side there 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.260
 there are other entrances here there is more light 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:37.520
 our oxygen 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.520
 this is where you can not go up right now 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:44.760
 I could not go up and as we can see 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.680
 many energies move 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.289
 if they move here in the camera I'm 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.629
 detecting 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:52.629
 that have been following me for a while 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.500
 you feel a chill 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:02.050
 and it's already broken they're following me in the 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.050
 camera looks like how are they going 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.529
 here is more light no longer 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.560
 full 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.280
 but they follow me 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.180
 but they follow me is already more light 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.580
 and we left 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.090
 Hello 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.090
 ah 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.409
 here we are doing but I had to give 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.219
 the turn 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.219
 While 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.600

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.500
 we went through it, I went back out if I came here 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.890
 now 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.860
 this is where several tickets are but 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.750
