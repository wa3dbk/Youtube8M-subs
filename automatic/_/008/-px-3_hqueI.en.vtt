00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.800 
and when I logged on I kind of looked
over<00:00:25.700> to<00:00:25.730> the<00:00:25.939> left<00:00:26.150> and<00:00:26.300> I'm<00:00:26.390> like<00:00:26.419> yeah<00:00:26.660> what

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
over to the left and I'm like yeah what

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.019 
over to the left and I'm like yeah what
is<00:00:26.900> that<00:00:27.050> little<00:00:27.169> film<00:00:28.099> looking<00:00:28.520> thing<00:00:28.790> so

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
is that little film looking thing so

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.609 
is that little film looking thing so
this<00:00:29.150> is<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.419> pain<00:00:29.689> Manning's<00:00:30.200> highlight

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.520 
this is the pain Manning's highlight
film<00:00:30.950> and<00:00:31.300> I<00:00:32.300> guess<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.689> added<00:00:32.960> some<00:00:33.110> new<00:00:33.230> stuff

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
film and I guess to added some new stuff

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.650 
film and I guess to added some new stuff
I<00:00:33.680> didn't<00:00:33.860> even<00:00:33.950> noticed<00:00:34.250> that<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:34.700> if<00:00:35.450> you<00:00:35.540> go

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
I didn't even noticed that and if you go

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.690 
I didn't even noticed that and if you go
to<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.960> sets<00:00:36.380> let's<00:00:36.920> go<00:00:37.100> ahead<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:37.370> go<00:00:37.460> to<00:00:37.489> the

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
to the sets let's go ahead and go to the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.619 
to the sets let's go ahead and go to the
sets<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:38.649> yeah<00:00:39.649> look<00:00:39.860> we<00:00:40.190> go<00:00:40.310> under<00:00:40.610> sets<00:00:41.300> live

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
sets and yeah look we go under sets live

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.069 
sets and yeah look we go under sets live
events<00:00:42.079> and<00:00:42.340> where<00:00:43.340> the<00:00:43.730> road<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.719> the<00:00:44.840> ring

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
events and where the road to the ring

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.349 
events and where the road to the ring
would<00:00:45.289> have<00:00:45.410> been<00:00:45.590> them<00:00:46.579> they<00:00:46.850> replaced<00:00:47.210> it

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
would have been them they replaced it

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.979 
would have been them they replaced it
with<00:00:47.420> this<00:00:47.660> season's<00:00:48.320> highlights<00:00:49.059> so<00:00:50.059> I<00:00:50.480> guess

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
with this season's highlights so I guess

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.660 
with this season's highlights so I guess
this<00:00:51.230> kind<00:00:51.469> of<00:00:51.559> replaced<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.190> road<00:00:52.399> to<00:00:52.550> the

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
this kind of replaced the road to the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.639 
this kind of replaced the road to the
ring<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:53.600> kind<00:00:53.899> of<00:00:53.960> sucked<00:00:54.350> that<00:00:54.500> we're

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
ring so that kind of sucked that we're

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:55.750 
ring so that kind of sucked that we're
probably<00:00:54.859> not<00:00:55.100> gonna<00:00:55.219> get<00:00:55.370> a<00:00:55.399> road<00:00:55.550> to<00:00:55.670> the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
probably not gonna get a road to the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.310 
probably not gonna get a road to the
ring<00:00:55.879> this<00:00:56.059> month<00:00:56.300> because<00:00:56.420> we're<00:00:56.839> halfway

football outside players plus two silver

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.080 
football outside players plus two silver
trophies<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:39.460> that's<00:01:40.460> a<00:01:40.580> little<00:01:40.700> weird

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
trophies so that's a little weird

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.290 
trophies so that's a little weird
you<00:01:41.630> could<00:01:41.870> you<00:01:42.110> put<00:01:42.320> in<00:01:42.470> two<00:01:42.820> gold<00:01:43.820> trophies

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
you could you put in two gold trophies

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.500 
you could you put in two gold trophies
and<00:01:44.510> an<00:01:45.020> elite<00:01:45.350> trophy<00:01:45.800> to<00:01:46.040> get<00:01:46.220> one<00:01:46.790> player

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
and an elite trophy to get one player

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.570 
and an elite trophy to get one player
team<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.140> week<00:01:48.290> player<00:01:48.560> or<00:01:48.800> it's<00:01:49.520> a

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
team of the week player or it's a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.310 
team of the week player or it's a
football<00:01:49.820> outsider<00:01:50.270> player<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:50.930> get<00:01:51.110> two

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
football outsider player to get two

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.140 
football outsider player to get two
silver<00:01:51.710> trophies<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:52.370> I<00:01:52.400> kind<00:01:52.790> of<00:01:52.820> find<00:01:53.000> that<00:01:53.030> a

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
silver trophies so I kind of find that a

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.540 
silver trophies so I kind of find that a
little<00:01:53.300> odd<00:01:53.390> plus<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.500> don't<00:01:54.620> always<00:01:54.860> get<00:01:55.280> out

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
little odd plus you don't always get out

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.210 
little odd plus you don't always get out
an<00:01:55.790> elite<00:01:56.380> team<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:57.530> weak<00:01:57.650> player<00:01:57.920> or

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
an elite team the weak player or

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.580 
an elite team the weak player or
football<00:01:59.120> outsider<00:01:59.660> players<00:01:59.990> so<00:02:00.260> but<00:02:00.440> let's

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
didn't know that

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.339

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.140 
so yeah just I'll just do that five
times<00:03:09.379> it<00:03:09.890> should<00:03:10.220> get<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.400> touchdown<00:03:10.670> every

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
times it should get a touchdown every

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.539 
times it should get a touchdown every
time<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:11.680> click<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.829> wrong<00:03:12.950> bun

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:13.549 
time I click the wrong bun

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.520 
time I click the wrong bun
so<00:03:14.120> we<00:03:14.209> messed<00:03:14.390> up<00:03:14.569> there<00:03:14.780> but<00:03:15.019> that's<00:03:15.109> fine<00:03:15.349> we

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
so we messed up there but that's fine we

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.170 
so we messed up there but that's fine we
still<00:03:15.709> got<00:03:15.859> two<00:03:16.819> tries<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.870> mess<00:03:18.049> up<00:03:18.819> and<00:03:19.819> we'll

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
still got two tries to mess up and we'll

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.599 
still got two tries to mess up and we'll
just<00:03:20.390> wait<00:03:20.569> for<00:03:20.599> him<00:03:21.109> to<00:03:21.260> get<00:03:21.379> open<00:03:21.799> and<00:03:22.069> boom

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:22.609 
just wait for him to get open and boom

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.699 
just wait for him to get open and boom
so<00:03:23.150> he<00:03:23.510> usually<00:03:23.599> always<00:03:23.989> catches<00:03:24.379> it<00:03:24.500> that's

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
so he usually always catches it that's

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.089 
so he usually always catches it that's
why<00:03:24.829> this<00:03:25.239> this<00:03:26.239> play<00:03:26.629> is<00:03:26.930> probably<00:03:27.859> my

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
doing that over and over again it might

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.080 
doing that over and over again it might
be<00:03:33.139> repetitive<00:03:33.650> but<00:03:33.919> it<00:03:34.549> gets<00:03:34.790> us<00:03:34.940> that
