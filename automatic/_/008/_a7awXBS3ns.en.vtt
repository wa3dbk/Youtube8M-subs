00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.420 
through them all at least once so next

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.260

we<00:06:09.630> have<00:06:09.780> our<00:06:09.810> ship<00:06:10.260> not<00:06:11.130> too<00:06:11.550> much<00:06:11.760> detail<00:06:12.240> on

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 
we have our ship not too much detail on

we have our ship not too much detail on
there<00:06:12.660> but<00:06:12.810> there<00:06:12.930> really<00:06:13.020> wasn't<00:06:13.350> too<00:06:13.620> much

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
there but there really wasn't too much

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.440 
there but there really wasn't too much
on<00:06:14.010> the<00:06:14.100> original<00:06:14.580> model<00:06:14.940> I<00:06:15.060> think<00:06:15.240> this<00:06:15.390> is

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:15.450 
on the original model I think this is

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.050 
on the original model I think this is
almost<00:06:15.660> based<00:06:15.960> directly<00:06:16.200> off<00:06:16.650> of<00:06:16.680> it<00:06:16.950> the<00:06:17.820> cool

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 
almost based directly off of it the cool

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.590 
almost based directly off of it the cool
part<00:06:18.360> is<00:06:18.510> they<00:06:18.750> actually<00:06:18.960> got<00:06:19.440> the

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
part is they actually got the

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.050 
part is they actually got the
bird-of-prey<00:06:21.600> insignia<00:06:22.260> on<00:06:22.440> there<00:06:22.910> which<00:06:23.910> I

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
bird-of-prey insignia on there which I

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.240 
bird-of-prey insignia on there which I
think<00:06:24.090> sneaked<00:06:24.540> and<00:06:25.380> loved<00:06:25.800> to<00:06:25.830> make<00:06:26.070> a

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
think sneaked and loved to make a

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.000 
think sneaked and loved to make a
