2k15<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.519> know<00:00:15.360> there<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.080> only<00:00:16.460> one<00:00:17.460> month<00:00:17.640> left

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
2k15 I know there is only one month left

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.500 
2k15 I know there is only one month left
in<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.539> game<00:00:18.750> it's<00:00:19.050> kind<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.500> dead<00:00:20.449> so<00:00:21.449> I

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
in the game it's kind of dead so I

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.439 
in the game it's kind of dead so I
thought<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.750> would<00:00:21.810> be<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.500> good<00:00:23.100> time<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.449> let

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
thought this would be a good time to let

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.050 
thought this would be a good time to let
this<00:00:24.599> go<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.039> out<00:00:26.160> because<00:00:26.670> there's<00:00:27.029> only

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
this go it out because there's only

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.759 
this go it out because there's only
one<00:00:27.300> my<00:00:27.420> left<00:00:27.599> in<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> game<00:00:27.929> I<00:00:28.170> mean<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.619> not

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
one my left in the game I mean it's not

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.249 
one my left in the game I mean it's not
really<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.189> big<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> deal<00:00:29.849> like<00:00:30.090> I'm<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:31.080> know
