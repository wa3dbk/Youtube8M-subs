00:07:14.409 --> 00:07:20.369 
out of the grain stirring it until it's
all<00:07:15.330> stops<00:07:16.330> bubbling<00:07:18.750> actually<00:07:19.750> need<00:07:19.900> all<00:07:20.169> the

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:20.379 
all stops bubbling actually need all the

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:23.939 
all stops bubbling actually need all the
water<00:07:20.590> and<00:07:20.979> that<00:07:21.729> is<00:07:22.469> it's<00:07:23.469> going<00:07:23.650> to<00:07:23.740> be<00:07:23.800> a

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:23.949 
water and that is it's going to be a

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:32.579 
water and that is it's going to be a
pretty<00:07:24.340> full<00:07:24.699> mash<00:07:25.449> tun<00:07:28.889> so<00:07:30.060> 37<00:07:31.060> or<00:07:31.509> 38<00:07:31.589> degree

00:07:32.579 --> 00:07:32.589 
pretty full mash tun so 37 or 38 degree

00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:37.140 
pretty full mash tun so 37 or 38 degree
Celsius<00:07:33.159> or<00:07:33.610> about<00:07:35.610> hundred<00:07:36.610> degree<00:07:36.879> fun

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.150 
Celsius or about hundred degree fun

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.869 
Celsius or about hundred degree fun
right<00:07:37.389> that's<00:07:37.569> pretty<00:07:38.139> good<00:07:38.349> for<00:07:38.710> a<00:07:38.740> an<00:07:39.099> acid

00:07:39.869 --> 00:07:39.879 
right that's pretty good for a an acid

00:07:39.879 --> 00:07:42.959 
right that's pretty good for a an acid
rest<00:07:40.529> so<00:07:41.529> I<00:07:41.710> will<00:07:41.949> now<00:07:42.099> wait<00:07:42.370> a<00:07:42.400> few<00:07:42.759> minutes

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:42.969 
rest so I will now wait a few minutes

00:07:42.969 --> 00:07:46.260 
rest so I will now wait a few minutes
and<00:07:43.360> so<00:07:43.629> I<00:07:43.659> measure<00:07:44.379> the<00:07:44.650> pH<00:07:44.979> of<00:07:45.009> the<00:07:45.729> mash<00:07:45.940> and

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:46.270 
and so I measure the pH of the mash and

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.540 
and so I measure the pH of the mash and
then<00:07:46.569> maybe<00:07:46.810> gonna<00:07:47.199> have<00:07:47.469> to<00:07:47.650> correct<00:07:48.009> it<00:07:48.279> or

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:48.550 
then maybe gonna have to correct it or

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.729 
then maybe gonna have to correct it or
let<00:07:48.699> it<00:07:48.729> just<00:07:48.969> sit<00:07:49.710> there<00:07:50.710> to<00:07:50.979> lower<00:07:51.219> itself
