we<00:03:10.800> can<00:03:10.950> also<00:03:11.069> do<00:03:11.280> some<00:03:11.459> custom<00:03:11.760> programming

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
with the video and whatnot but let's

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
with the video and whatnot but let's
fire<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:14.940> up

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.030 

looks<00:03:50.690> like<00:03:50.900> we<00:03:51.050> will<00:03:51.200> need<00:03:51.379> to<00:03:51.470> pick<00:03:51.590> up<00:03:51.739> GPS

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
looks like we will need to pick up GPS

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.339 
looks like we will need to pick up GPS
signal<00:03:52.909> we<00:03:53.060> don't<00:03:53.239> have<00:03:53.390> signal<00:03:53.870> just<00:03:54.049> yet

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
signal we don't have signal just yet

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.410 
signal we don't have signal just yet
because<00:03:54.560> we<00:03:54.650> got<00:03:54.799> a<00:03:54.830> real<00:03:55.069> cloudy<00:03:55.340> sky<00:03:55.790> it's

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420
