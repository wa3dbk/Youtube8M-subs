00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.480 
bronzer
which<00:02:12.660> i<00:02:12.870> think<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.260> probably<00:02:13.650> nicer<00:02:14.340> than

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
which i think is probably nicer than

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.850 
which i think is probably nicer than
that<00:02:14.550> one<00:02:14.700> so<00:02:15.300> I<00:02:15.330> might<00:02:16.050> might<00:02:16.290> give<00:02:16.470> those<00:02:16.620> a

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
that one so I might might give those a

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.280 
that one so I might might give those a
try<00:02:16.890> when<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.700> kind<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:18.030> will<00:02:18.360> do<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.840> does<00:02:19.080> kind

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
try when it kind of will do it does kind

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.710 
try when it kind of will do it does kind
of<00:02:19.350> dust<00:02:19.590> off<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> loss<00:02:20.190> and<00:02:20.550> when<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.390> swirl

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
of dust off a loss and when you swirl

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.210 
of dust off a loss and when you swirl
the<00:02:22.020> powder<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.530> brush<00:02:22.770> which<00:02:23.010> is<00:02:23.190> a

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
the powder and the brush which is a

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.490 
the powder and the brush which is a
downside<00:02:23.490> but<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.120> think<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:25.200> color<00:02:25.410> is

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
downside but I think and the color is

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.410 
downside but I think and the color is
quite<00:02:26.010> nice<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.610> next<00:02:26.910> thing<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.090> something

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
quite nice the next thing is something

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.590 
quite nice the next thing is something
that<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.570> really<00:02:27.750> like<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.340> it's<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.880> contour

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.690 
that I really like and it's the contour

isn't natural let's not go to show me
that<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:27.390> don't<00:03:27.450> spill<00:03:28.050> it<00:03:28.140> everywhere<00:03:28.260> so

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.750 

i'll<00:03:32.400> put<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.730> up<00:03:32.820> here<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.300> can't<00:03:34.580> it's<00:03:35.580> like

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
i'll put it up here I can't it's like

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.280 
i'll put it up here I can't it's like
that<00:03:35.940> can<00:03:36.300> you<00:03:36.390> see<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.720> shoe<00:03:36.900> or<00:03:37.080> a<00:03:37.140> bit

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
that can you see the shoe or a bit

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.500 
that can you see the shoe or a bit
though<00:03:37.500> this<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.220> really<00:03:38.250> pretty<00:03:38.670> it's<00:03:39.270> really

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
though this is really pretty it's really

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.620 
though this is really pretty it's really
similar<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.590> kind<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.010> its<00:03:41.880> it's<00:03:42.239> similar

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
similar on the kind of its it's similar

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.710 
similar on the kind of its it's similar
in<00:03:42.780> tone<00:03:43.080> to<00:03:43.440> all<00:03:43.770> the<00:03:43.920> glitters<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.720> I'm

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
in tone to all the glitters and I'm

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.260 
in tone to all the glitters and I'm
shadow<00:03:46.050> by<00:03:46.260> Mac<00:03:46.500> but<00:03:47.040> it's<00:03:47.160> just<00:03:47.370> more<00:03:47.610> sparkly

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
shadow by Mac but it's just more sparkly

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.720 
shadow by Mac but it's just more sparkly
and<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.620> a<00:03:49.650> really<00:03:49.800> good<00:03:50.100> i<00:03:50.250> think<00:03:50.280> for

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
and so this is a really good i think for

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.449 
and so this is a really good i think for
nighttime<00:03:51.120> and<00:03:51.390> or<00:03:52.380> as<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.590> base<00:03:52.830> maybe<00:03:53.160> if<00:03:53.340> you

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
nighttime and or as a base maybe if you

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.850 
nighttime and or as a base maybe if you
want<00:03:53.670> to<00:03:53.820> kind<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.150> perk<00:03:54.989> up<00:03:55.230> any<00:03:55.410> kind<00:03:55.739> of

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
want to kind of perk up any kind of

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.500 
want to kind of perk up any kind of
boring<00:03:56.070> eyeshadow<00:03:56.489> you<00:03:56.610> have<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:57.270> would<00:03:57.390> be

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
boring eyeshadow you have that would be

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.150 
boring eyeshadow you have that would be

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
by itself I think I feel like it needs a

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.590 
by itself I think I feel like it needs a
little<00:04:50.330> bit<00:04:50.540> of<00:04:50.600> glass<00:04:50.840> and<00:04:51.639> but<00:04:52.639> I<00:04:52.669> I<00:04:53.150> quite

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
little bit of glass and but I I quite

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.140 
little bit of glass and but I I quite
like<00:04:53.810> it<00:04:53.960> it<00:04:54.830> kind<00:04:55.250> of<00:04:55.310> gets<00:04:55.430> creamy<00:04:55.820> and<00:04:56.440> it

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
like it it kind of gets creamy and it

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.580 
like it it kind of gets creamy and it
the<00:04:59.150> next<00:04:59.479> thing<00:04:59.750> is<00:05:00.139> a<00:05:01.600> seer<00:05:02.600> the<00:05:03.200> next<00:05:03.470> thing

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:03.590 
the next thing is a seer the next thing

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:06.219 
the next thing is a seer the next thing
is<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:04.100> waterproof<00:05:05.110> lengthening<00:05:06.110> and

it<00:06:05.599> has<00:06:05.990> a<00:06:06.020> small<00:06:06.470> applicator<00:06:07.220> so<00:06:07.760> you<00:06:07.849> can

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
it has a small applicator so you can

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000 
it has a small applicator so you can
kind<00:06:08.150> of<00:06:08.210> go<00:06:08.360> behind<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.930> lashes<00:06:09.260> to<00:06:09.470> curl<00:06:09.830> it

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
kind of go behind the lashes to curl it

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.610 
kind of go behind the lashes to curl it
up<00:06:10.099> and<00:06:10.490> I<00:06:10.610> like<00:06:10.880> that<00:06:11.120> this<00:06:11.330> is<00:06:11.570> kind<00:06:12.470> of<00:06:12.500> a

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
up and I like that this is kind of a

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.159 
up and I like that this is kind of a
square<00:06:13.039> of<00:06:13.070> shape<00:06:13.669> so<00:06:14.510> that<00:06:14.539> he<00:06:14.900> can<00:06:15.050> get<00:06:15.139> a

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
square of shape so that he can get a

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:16.779 
square of shape so that he can get a
good<00:06:15.349> grip<00:06:15.560> in<00:06:15.740> it<00:06:15.830> so<00:06:15.950> when<00:06:16.070> you're<00:06:16.190> twisting

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
good grip in it so when you're twisting

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:18.909 
good grip in it so when you're twisting
it's<00:06:17.000> much<00:06:17.450> easier<00:06:17.479> it<00:06:17.960> doesn't<00:06:18.289> slip<00:06:18.440> you

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
it's much easier it doesn't slip you

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:20.500 
it's much easier it doesn't slip you
don't<00:06:19.130> get<00:06:19.280> a<00:06:19.310> whole<00:06:19.520> lot<00:06:19.580> of<00:06:19.910> product<00:06:20.270> i<00:06:20.389> would

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:20.510 
don't get a whole lot of product i would

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.659 
don't get a whole lot of product i would
say<00:06:20.660> that<00:06:20.900> but<00:06:21.380> then<00:06:21.590> you're<00:06:21.740> only<00:06:21.889> paying<00:06:22.190> I

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
say that but then you're only paying I

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:23.700 
say that but then you're only paying I
don't<00:06:23.240> even<00:06:23.360> know<00:06:23.510> what

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:23.710 
don't even know what

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.460
