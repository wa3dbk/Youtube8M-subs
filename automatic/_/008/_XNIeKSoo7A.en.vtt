00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
releases overachiever in Origins

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.940 
releases overachiever in Origins
complete<00:01:59.939> all<00:02:00.149> four<00:02:00.540> challenges<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.259> one<00:02:01.680> game

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
complete all four challenges in one game

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.560 
complete all four challenges in one game
hmm<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.790> looks<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.030> we're<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.420> be

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
hmm so it looks like we're going to be

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.450 
hmm so it looks like we're going to be
getting<00:02:03.960> some<00:02:04.200> objectives<00:02:04.979> while<00:02:05.250> we're

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
getting some objectives while we're

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.119 
getting some objectives while we're
killing<00:02:05.759> zombies<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.750> there's<00:02:07.320> four<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.950> them

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
killing zombies so there's four of them

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.859 
killing zombies so there's four of them
and<00:02:08.429> you<00:02:08.849> need<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.060> complete<00:02:09.420> them<00:02:09.599> in<00:02:09.720> one

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
and you need to complete them in one

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.160 
and you need to complete them in one
game<00:02:10.110> try<00:02:10.500> to<00:02:11.009> get<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.550> achievement<00:02:12.170> Master

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
game try to get that achievement Master

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.700 
game try to get that achievement Master

in Origins wield all of the ultimate
staffs<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.920> one<00:02:17.250> game<00:02:18.050> hmm<00:02:19.050> that's<00:02:19.740> kind<00:02:20.130> of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
staffs in one game hmm that's kind of

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.090 
staffs in one game hmm that's kind of
weird<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.910> mentions<00:02:21.480> elemental<00:02:22.350> staffs<00:02:22.710> in

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
weird it mentions elemental staffs in

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.010 
weird it mentions elemental staffs in
playing<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.270> plane<00:02:24.540> with<00:02:24.570> power

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
playing in the plane with power

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.200 
playing in the plane with power
achievement<00:02:25.920> but<00:02:26.430> then<00:02:26.610> we<00:02:26.700> go<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.000> master

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
achievement but then we go to the master

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.270 
achievement but then we go to the master
wizard<00:02:27.720> achievement<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:28.500> says<00:02:28.710> ultimate

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
wizard achievement and it says ultimate

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.380 
wizard achievement and it says ultimate
staffs<00:02:30.140> hmm<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:32.520> little<00:02:32.790> theory<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.240> my

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
staffs hmm that the little theory in my

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.750 
staffs hmm that the little theory in my
head<00:02:33.660> is<00:02:33.810> maybe<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.770> elemental<00:02:35.400> staffs

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
head is maybe the elemental staffs

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.970 
head is maybe the elemental staffs
become<00:02:36.390> ultimate<00:02:36.840> staffs<00:02:37.260> when<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:37.740> pack<00:02:37.950> a

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
become ultimate staffs when you pack a

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.510 
become ultimate staffs when you pack a
punch<00:02:38.340> them<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:40.560> elemental<00:02:40.980> staffs<00:02:41.220> will

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
punch them so the elemental staffs will

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.830 
punch them so the elemental staffs will
be<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.730> wonder<00:02:41.970> weapons<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.540> then<00:02:42.660> maybe

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
be the wonder weapons and then maybe

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.600 
be the wonder weapons and then maybe
when<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.200> pack<00:02:43.440> a<00:02:43.470> punch<00:02:43.860> them<00:02:44.100> they<00:02:44.550> become

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
when you pack a punch them they become

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.820 
when you pack a punch them they become
ultimate<00:02:45.270> staffs<00:02:45.630> i'm<00:02:46.080> not<00:02:46.260> sure<00:02:46.320> but<00:02:46.500> that's

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
ultimate staffs i'm not sure but that's

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.680 
ultimate staffs i'm not sure but that's
just<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.160> little<00:02:47.370> theory<00:02:47.790> flowing<00:02:48.390> through<00:02:48.570> my

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
just a little theory flowing through my

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.570 
just a little theory flowing through my
head<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.100> i<00:02:50.100> think<00:02:50.880> i<00:02:51.000> mentioned<00:02:51.240> all<00:02:51.570> of<00:02:51.600> them

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
head and i think i mentioned all of them

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.850 
head and i think i mentioned all of them
yes<00:02:53.580> I<00:02:53.700> did<00:02:53.880> um<00:02:54.030> but<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.140> want<00:02:55.350> to<00:02:55.440> quickly

theory video coming out that will be

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.870 
theory video coming out that will be
about<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.940> giant<00:03:21.390> robot<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.900> the<00:03:22.020> map<00:03:22.200> and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
did the commentary of the theory before

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.220 
did the commentary of the theory before
this<00:03:28.940> but<00:03:29.940> I'm<00:03:30.090> going<00:03:30.240> to<00:03:30.330> release<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.810> theory

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
this but I'm going to release the theory

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.630 
this but I'm going to release the theory
after<00:03:31.380> this<00:03:31.680> video<00:03:32.010> if<00:03:32.160> you<00:03:32.280> know<00:03:32.400> what<00:03:32.490> I<00:03:32.520> mean

release because this actually helps back
up<00:03:37.320> my<00:03:37.590> theory<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.220> Origins<00:03:39.180> release<00:03:39.780> Samantha

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
up my theory in Origins release Samantha

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.460 
up my theory in Origins release Samantha
so<00:03:40.920> stay<00:03:41.130> tuned<00:03:41.370> for<00:03:41.550> my<00:03:41.670> robot<00:03:42.570> theory<00:03:43.080> that

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
so stay tuned for my robot theory that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.060 
so stay tuned for my robot theory that
is<00:03:43.860> connected<00:03:44.580> with<00:03:44.610> Samantha<00:03:45.600> so<00:03:46.140> hopefully

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
is connected with Samantha so hopefully

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.100 
is connected with Samantha so hopefully
you<00:03:47.190> enjoy<00:03:47.520> that<00:03:47.550> stay<00:03:48.030> tuned<00:03:48.300> and<00:03:48.510> hopefully

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
um so yeah I can't wait for the map

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.280 
um so yeah I can't wait for the map
thank<00:03:54.240> you<00:03:54.300> well<00:03:54.450> thank<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.960> all<00:03:55.140> for
