00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
lance's louvers and ribs but in this

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.730 
lance's louvers and ribs but in this
case<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> want<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.960> use<00:01:16.049> an<00:01:16.170> emboss<00:01:16.409> I'll

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
case here I want to use an emboss I'll

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.770 
case here I want to use an emboss I'll
use<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.009> circular<00:01:17.220> emboss<00:01:17.610> it's<00:01:18.450> pretty<00:01:18.659> easy

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
use the circular emboss it's pretty easy

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990 
use the circular emboss it's pretty easy
to<00:01:19.020> use<00:01:19.170> we<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.409> drag<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.009> drop<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.850> can

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
to use we just drag and drop so we can

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.399 
to use we just drag and drop so we can
drag<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.270> out<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.720> we<00:01:21.900> drag<00:01:22.110> over<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
drag it out here we drag over to this

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.289 
drag it out here we drag over to this
face<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:22.830> it'll<00:01:23.009> place<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:24.119> we<00:01:24.180> can

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
place it down here as soon as you let go

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.789 
place it down here as soon as you let go
of<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.130> Mouse<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:27.420> places<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.900> on<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.049> face<00:01:28.350> and

of it Mouse it places it on the face and

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.560 
of it Mouse it places it on the face and
I<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.159> flip<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.520> tool<00:01:29.670> over<00:01:29.939> if<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.150> like<00:01:30.299> or

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
I can flip the tool over if it like or

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.410 
I can flip the tool over if it like or
flip<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.409> back<00:01:31.560> and<00:01:31.860> I<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.729> rotate<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.210> if<00:01:33.329> I

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
flip it back and I can rotate it if I

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.850 
flip it back and I can rotate it if I
need<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:33.960> it's<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.200> circle<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:34.799> not

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
need to but it's a circle so it's not

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770 
need to but it's a circle so it's not
going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.130> much<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.270> can<00:01:36.420> modify

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
going to do much there and I can modify

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.270 
going to do much there and I can modify
a<00:01:36.930> couple<00:01:37.259> other<00:01:37.350> features<00:01:37.890> down<00:01:38.009> here<00:01:38.159> at<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
a couple other features down here at the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.590 
a couple other features down here at the
bottom<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.640> tool<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.210> most<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
bottom of the tool but most of the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
bottom of the tool but most of the
defaults<00:01:40.020> are<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.290> fine<00:01:40.470> if<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.310> go<00:01:41.490> over<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
defaults are just fine if I go over to

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.840 
defaults are just fine if I go over to
the<00:01:41.880> positions<00:01:42.270> tab<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:43.860> click<00:01:44.729> on

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850
