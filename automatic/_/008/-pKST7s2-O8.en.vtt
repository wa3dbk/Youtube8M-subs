00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
chance right it's just completely

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.039 
chance right it's just completely
counterproductive<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> two<00:01:27.750> sports

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
counterproductive and the two sports

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.429 
counterproductive and the two sports
should<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.619> be<00:01:28.740> any<00:01:28.890> different<00:01:29.130> um<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.390> so

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
should not be any different um and so

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:32.690
