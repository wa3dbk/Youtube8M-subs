00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:05.250
 good families how are you and how are you 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.519
 today it's Saturday, good bricomania 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.679
 art crafts is good then 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.269
 nothing I have decided that I will customize 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.860
 a ladder that I had surely seen 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.500
 in urging that I've seen it in videos 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.539
 that it's nothing two steps that I bought in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.310
 the ikea they serve then to get on 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.230
 high to me what do I know I use it for 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.359
 attend and then good at it and that there 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.880
 to deposit to sell in plan is that is 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.089
 Cheaper comes treated and prepared 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.949
 so that you can do something with 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:33.660
 she so that I paint her is so that the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.650
 varnishes for whatever you want then 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.630
 well I have decided that I am going to hit 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.610
 some pictures that I found online 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.890
 I have trimmed the printers 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.330
 cut by fixed we go to it with the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.310
 better heart attack than if you do not know what 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.230
 which is right now I 'm going to teach you and 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.060
 well I hope you like this video what 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.890
 do because many then when the upload 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.270
 picture is a mini video on Instagram is 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.950
 as a game but I want to see how 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.600
 you have done but such then well 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.860
 I think it's a good idea that even at 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.390
 those who have little ones in cases 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.640
 can help do it because it's a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.860
 bullshit in fact I think it's meet me 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.020
 will help me see if it will be easy 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.790
 and nothing because that is not a video 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.620
 typical of inverted lady but I think 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.420
 Good thing we sometimes find things 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.910
 in stores that you say oh my god what 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.130
 pretty and they sell it to you for me that I'm from 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.670
 a hundred euros and well could you do something 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.680
 same better resemblance and much more homemade 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.660
 much more beautiful by choosing the photos that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.610
 you want because of course on the internet 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.190
 the universe of the millions of photos that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.080
 you want me chosen as a kind of photos 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.660
 erotic vintage that I like a lot 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.300
 but you can choose car hearts 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.830
 motorcycles phrases whatever it is so that 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.720
 let's go 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.280
 to make the best heart attacks that I 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.840
 I call it that because it's like that almost 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.350
 he knows everything thanks to the famous 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.909
 program is done with paste queue and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.950
 White glue 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.340
 with the white for wood in this case 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.560
 but let's say that in Chinese so 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.780
 I say water 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.610
 and then a bowl to mix it 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.860
 there is usually no exact measurement 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.960
 but well here I have the photos I'm going 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.479
 to paste and I would recommend you to use 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.729
 Well, some brushes of those that do not 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.830
 that you are already seeing spe struggled that no 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.840
 are you going to use for something else and so on 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.840
 Well, we're not going to do anything 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:35.989
 good as everything in this life is not always 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.000
 out things first and this 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.069
 I hope it serves as an example for 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.349
 you see that not all the videos that come out 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.170
 on YouTube or all the things that the 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.780
 people go up are perfect in the first 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.480
 moment then good the problem that 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.239
 I've had has been that the photos that 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.950
 I wanted to put are of a grammage 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.400
 as it is a folio the grammage is very hard 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.400
 and it costs a lot to adapt it to the piece that 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.970
 you want then the one of copei that 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.379
 so called the technique by which 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.659
 I was doing that basically it 's like 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:11.329
 a collage is usually done or with 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.700
 napkins or with magazine sheets 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.340
 comics things more end a sheet a little bit 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:20.400
 more finite than the folio so good 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:23.450
 I have decided to change the style 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.450
 and good 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.690
 what better than my own style of 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.700
 polka dots that you know that I love these 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.200
 are napkins the truth is that I do not know 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.530
 exactly where are I think they are from 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.480
 workshop may be I do not know and nothing then 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.040
 same in the same technique is worth so 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.290
 let's see if this time it does not 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.700
 It works and what I said I wanted to show you 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:48.260
 the file in the decoration file so that 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.640
 do not pass to you or eat any 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.990
 thing because there are many videos in 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.980
 internet that they say give to catch any 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:57.650
 Not because you are really going to take 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.239
 a bad time a time and money lost 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.150
 because maybe I have to go back to 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.150
 buy cola or whatever and so 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.090
 i 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.090
 to me
