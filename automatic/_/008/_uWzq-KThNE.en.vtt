argue<00:02:25.230> that's<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.680> be<00:02:25.770> expected<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:26.610> still<00:02:26.670> it

argue that's to be expected but still it

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.540 
argue that's to be expected but still it
means<00:02:27.600> any<00:02:27.900> headshot<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.590> get<00:02:28.830> is<00:02:29.250> because

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
means any headshot you get is because

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.520 
means any headshot you get is because
you<00:02:29.970> just<00:02:30.270> happened<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.870> hit<00:02:30.990> the<00:02:31.020> enemy<00:02:31.440> in

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
from the buckshot range and you can get

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.770 
from the buckshot range and you can get
a<00:03:07.739> one-hit<00:03:08.190> kill<00:03:08.430> up<00:03:08.550> close<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.180> drop<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.750> a

off<00:03:16.920> even<00:03:17.790> so<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.510> problem<00:03:18.900> here<00:03:19.110> should<00:03:19.350> be

off even so the problem here should be
very<00:03:19.770> evident<00:03:20.400> yeah<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.690> range<00:03:21.959> was<00:03:22.080> doubled

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
very evident yeah the range was doubled

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.510 
very evident yeah the range was doubled

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
is the power is insane with each shot

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.229 
is the power is insane with each shot
but<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.320> range<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.830> highly<00:03:47.370> limiting<00:03:47.820> the

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
but the range is highly limiting the

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.970 
but the range is highly limiting the
rate<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.540> fire<00:03:48.840> honestly<00:03:49.380> ain't<00:03:49.620> too<00:03:49.739> bad

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
rate of fire honestly ain't too bad

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.430 
rate of fire honestly ain't too bad
considering<00:03:50.550> a<00:03:50.820> single<00:03:51.000> shot<00:03:51.330> can<00:03:51.600> kill<00:03:51.840> but

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
considering a single shot can kill but

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.740 
considering a single shot can kill but
again<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:53.310> range<00:03:53.610> makes<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.239> high<00:03:54.420> damage

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
again the range makes the high damage

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.830 
again the range makes the high damage
less<00:03:55.320> than<00:03:55.590> practical<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:56.850> what<00:03:57.690> does<00:03:57.810> that

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
less than practical but what does that

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.170 
less than practical but what does that
