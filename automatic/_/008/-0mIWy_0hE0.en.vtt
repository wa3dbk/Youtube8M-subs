where that paddle is at all times so

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.020 
where that paddle is at all times so
we're<00:01:55.409> in<00:01:55.500> first<00:01:55.710> gear<00:01:56.010> I'm<00:01:56.460> going<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.700> take<00:01:56.850> my

anywhere<00:01:59.990> once<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.140> start<00:02:01.440> to<00:02:01.530> give<00:02:01.650> the<00:02:01.680> car

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
anywhere once I start to give the car

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.760 
anywhere once I start to give the car
gas<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.580> when<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.540> car<00:02:03.720> physically<00:02:04.290> starts<00:02:04.590> to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
gas is when the car physically starts to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.110 
gas is when the car physically starts to
move<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.220> like<00:02:05.280> you're<00:02:05.549> sitting<00:02:05.729> there<00:02:05.970> with

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
move it's like you're sitting there with

move it's like you're sitting there with
your<00:02:06.299> foot<00:02:06.479> on<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.720> clutch<00:02:07.009> but<00:02:08.009> once<00:02:08.190> you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
start to give it gas is when you start

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.199 
start to give it gas is when you start
to<00:02:10.200> release<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.619> clutch<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.670> everything

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
to release the clutch but everything

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.030 
to release the clutch but everything
works<00:02:12.450> in<00:02:12.659> this<00:02:12.780> car<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.170> throttle<00:02:13.409> position

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
works in this car on throttle position

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.440 
works in this car on throttle position
so<00:02:14.190> when<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.400> start<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.760> give<00:02:14.849> it<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.000> little

it<00:02:16.080> starts<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.590> release<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:17.010> clutch<00:02:18.860> you'll

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
it starts to release the clutch you'll

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.380 
it starts to release the clutch you'll
feel<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.220> clutch<00:02:20.430> release<00:02:20.610> as<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.030> start<00:02:21.269> to

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
feel the clutch release as you start to

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.750 
feel the clutch release as you start to

just pull the up paddle one time and it
shifts<00:02:26.340> instantaneously<00:02:27.090> it's<00:02:27.330> not<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:27.720> an

downshift for you so what I'm going to
do<00:03:52.640> is<00:03:52.760> I'm<00:03:52.879> going<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.030> push<00:03:53.180> automatic<00:03:53.780> take

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
do is I'm going to push automatic take

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.170 
do is I'm going to push automatic take
it<00:03:54.680> back<00:03:54.860> out<00:03:55.040> of<00:03:55.190> the<00:03:55.280> automatic<00:03:55.760> mode<00:03:55.970> and

it back out of the automatic mode and

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.320 
it back out of the automatic mode and
then<00:03:56.810> you'll<00:03:56.959> see<00:03:57.170> when<00:03:57.349> I<00:03:57.379> start<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.799> go<00:03:58.299> all<00:03:59.299> I

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
then you'll see when I start to go all I

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.720 
then you'll see when I start to go all I
have<00:03:59.599> to<00:03:59.720> do<00:03:59.840> is<00:04:00.019> option<00:04:00.470> my<00:04:01.069> go<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.280> take<00:04:01.519> off

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
have to do is option my go to take off

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.900 
have to do is option my go to take off
here<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:03.200> I<00:04:03.410> am<00:04:03.950> only<00:04:04.129> giving<00:04:04.310> it<00:04:04.519> a<00:04:04.579> little<00:04:04.730> bit

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
here if I am only giving it a little bit

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.259 
here if I am only giving it a little bit
of<00:04:05.000> throttle<00:04:05.470> and<00:04:06.470> I<00:04:06.620> go<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:06.829> shift<00:04:07.129> it's<00:04:08.030> going

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
of throttle and I go to shift it's going

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:09.910 
of throttle and I go to shift it's going
to<00:04:08.329> shift<00:04:08.450> much<00:04:08.720> slower<00:04:09.019> everything<00:04:09.709> in<00:04:09.829> this

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
to shift much slower everything in this

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.500 
to shift much slower everything in this
car<00:04:10.160> like<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.489> said<00:04:10.700> works<00:04:10.940> on<00:04:11.120> throttle

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
car like I said works on throttle

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.640 
car like I said works on throttle
position<00:04:11.629> so<00:04:12.110> if<00:04:12.200> I'm<00:04:12.319> giving<00:04:12.590> it<00:04:12.680> more<00:04:12.799> gas

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.770 

it's<00:04:16.160> going<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.370> shift<00:04:16.519> much<00:04:16.760> faster<00:04:17.299> I'm

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
it's going to shift much faster I'm

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.470 
it's going to shift much faster I'm
giving<00:04:18.079> it<00:04:18.169> less<00:04:18.290> gas<00:04:19.060> it's<00:04:20.060> going<00:04:20.239> to<00:04:20.299> shift

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
giving it less gas it's going to shift

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.740 
giving it less gas it's going to shift
slower<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.590> everything<00:04:22.240> works<00:04:23.240> on<00:04:23.480> throttle

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
slower so everything works on throttle

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.600 
slower so everything works on throttle
position<00:04:24.290> you<00:04:24.410> have<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.620> remember<00:04:24.889> that<00:04:25.130> if<00:04:25.460> I

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
position you have to remember that if I

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.870 
position you have to remember that if I
go<00:04:25.760> to<00:04:25.820> downshift<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:28.370> was<00:04:28.490> a<00:04:28.520> normal

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
go to downshift that was a normal

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.640 
go to downshift that was a normal
downshift<00:04:29.360> with<00:04:29.510> my<00:04:29.630> foot<00:04:29.870> off<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.139> gas<00:04:30.290> but

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
downshift with my foot off the gas but

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.060 
downshift with my foot off the gas but
if<00:04:30.740> I<00:04:30.830> stay<00:04:31.070> on<00:04:31.100> the<00:04:31.400> gas

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:43.559 

see<00:04:35.730> you<00:04:35.820> get<00:04:35.970> a<00:04:36.000> much<00:04:36.270> more<00:04:36.510> aggressive<00:04:36.660> down
