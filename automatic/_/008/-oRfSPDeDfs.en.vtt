00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
a machine that employs a lot of Fujifilm

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.779 
a machine that employs a lot of Fujifilm
unique<00:00:45.180> technology<00:00:46.050> what<00:00:46.800> we<00:00:46.829> can<00:00:47.160> see<00:00:47.399> here

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
unique technology what we can see here

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.439 
unique technology what we can see here
is<00:00:47.940> our<00:00:48.600> LED<00:00:49.200> inkjet<00:00:50.010> heads<00:00:50.239> traversing<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
is our LED inkjet heads traversing and

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.229 
is our LED inkjet heads traversing and
one<00:00:52.289> important<00:00:52.890> place<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.129> start<00:00:53.610> first<00:00:53.910> is

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
one important place to start first is

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.229 
one important place to start first is
the<00:00:54.780> rail<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:56.100> printhead<00:00:57.000> is

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

the rail that the printhead is
traversing<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.680> heavy<00:00:59.129> engineering

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
traversing on that is heavy engineering

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.840 
traversing on that is heavy engineering
in<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.390> printer<00:01:00.899> that<00:01:01.109> looks<00:01:01.559> perhaps<00:01:02.370> somewhat

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
in a printer that looks perhaps somewhat

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.219 
in a printer that looks perhaps somewhat
lightweight<00:01:03.390> we<00:01:03.570> shouldn't<00:01:03.870> be<00:01:03.989> confused

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
lightweight we shouldn't be confused

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.880 
lightweight we shouldn't be confused
here<00:01:04.890> there's<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.369> lot<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.760> unique<00:01:06.890> engineering

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
here there's a lot of unique engineering

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.350 
here there's a lot of unique engineering
going<00:01:08.280> on<00:01:08.520> so<00:01:09.270> we<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.810> eight<00:01:10.140> independent

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
going on so we have eight independent

people<00:02:23.800> are<00:02:23.890> stopping<00:02:24.130> by<00:02:24.340> we're<00:02:25.060> able<00:02:25.210> to

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
people are stopping by we're able to

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.790 
people are stopping by we're able to
show<00:02:25.840> our<00:02:26.680> ability<00:02:27.460> to<00:02:27.490> Jet's<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.660> clear<00:02:29.080> ink<00:02:29.470> on

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
show our ability to Jet's a clear ink on

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.050 
show our ability to Jet's a clear ink on
to<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.460> substrate

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
to the substrate

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:37.900 
to the substrate
let<00:02:31.540> me<00:02:31.660> get<00:02:32.080> a<00:02:32.110> little<00:02:32.290> sample<00:02:32.680> here

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.700 

so<00:02:38.420> I<00:02:38.450> don't<00:02:38.660> know<00:02:38.750> whether<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:39.080> camera<00:02:39.500> can

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
so I don't know whether the camera can

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.700 
so I don't know whether the camera can
see<00:02:39.740> this<00:02:40.190> but<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:40.940> can<00:02:41.120> see<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.720> there<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.680> a

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
see this but you can see that there is a

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.880 
see this but you can see that there is a
clear<00:02:43.130> varnish<00:02:43.870> enhancing<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.140> the<00:02:45.560> print

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
clear varnish enhancing the the print

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.730

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
that and the feedback we're having from

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.930 
that and the feedback we're having from
the<00:02:55.850> show<00:02:56.060> is<00:02:56.210> that<00:02:56.240> this<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.940> distinct

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
the show is that this is a distinct

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.770 
the show is that this is a distinct

which incidentally is water-cooled

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.390 
which incidentally is water-cooled
that's<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.360> very<00:03:11.600> high<00:03:11.810> power<00:03:12.080> device<00:03:12.500> allows

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
that's a very high power device allows

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.180 
that's a very high power device allows
his<00:03:13.640> system<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.270> run<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:15.050> up<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.380> 20<00:03:15.860> square
