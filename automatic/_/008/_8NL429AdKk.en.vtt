00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
another way of doing dodging and burning

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.679 
another way of doing dodging and burning
but<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.269> non-destructive<00:00:25.080> way<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:26.039> know

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
but in a non-destructive way you know

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.900 
but in a non-destructive way you know
typically<00:00:27.689> if<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.260> use<00:00:28.500> just<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.820> example

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
typically if we use just the for example

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.450 
typically if we use just the for example
the<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.960> burn<00:00:31.170> tool<00:00:31.410> here<00:00:32.210> in<00:00:33.210> Photoshop<00:00:34.460> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
the the burn tool here in Photoshop it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.220 
the the burn tool here in Photoshop it
works<00:00:35.700> okay<00:00:36.120> but<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.690> see<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.079> go

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
works okay but you can see if I go

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.049 
works okay but you can see if I go
really<00:00:37.500> far<00:00:37.710> here<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.670> gives<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:38.969> a

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
really far here it just gives it a

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.270 
really far here it just gives it a
really<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> ssin<00:00:39.930> type<00:00:40.170> look<00:00:40.440> it's<00:00:40.649> not<00:00:40.800> just

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
really a ssin type look it's not just

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.880 
really a ssin type look it's not just
darkening<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> area<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.960> kind<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.290> changes

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
darkening the area it kind of changes

darkening the area it kind of changes
the<00:00:43.920> color<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.399> little<00:00:44.640> bit<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:44.969> well<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.420> we're

image where we can't go back and change

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.580 
image where we can't go back and change
it<00:00:59.309> later<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.750> here's<00:01:01.170> how<00:01:01.320> we're<00:01:01.500> going

with 50% gray hit OK
right<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> can<00:01:31.979> see<00:01:32.009> our<00:01:32.159> images<00:01:32.729> under

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
right here you can see our images under

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.929 
right here you can see our images under
nays<00:01:33.090> we've<00:01:33.299> got<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.600> gray<00:01:34.430> layer<00:01:35.430> on<00:01:35.670> top

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
nays we've got this gray layer on top

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.429 
nays we've got this gray layer on top
but<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.420> can't<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.320> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
but we can't see it because of the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.760 
but we can't see it because of the
blending<00:01:37.860> mode<00:01:38.150> setting<00:01:39.150> there<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.320> it's

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
blending mode setting there so it's

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.340 
blending mode setting there so it's
there<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.549> we<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.270> work<00:01:42.509> on<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.140> we'll

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
there and we can work on it and we'll

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.929 
there and we can work on it and we'll
see<00:01:43.619> our<00:01:43.649> results<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.460> we<00:01:44.579> don't<00:01:44.759> actually

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
see our results but we don't actually

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
see our results but we don't actually
see<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.479> gray<00:01:45.810> which<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.170> kind<00:01:46.380> of<00:01:46.439> cool<00:01:46.619> so

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
see that gray which is kind of cool so

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.260 
see that gray which is kind of cool so
let<00:01:46.890> me<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.189> zoom<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> little<00:01:47.790> bit<00:01:48.060> here

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
let me just zoom in a little bit here

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.550 
let me just zoom in a little bit here
and<00:01:49.520> what<00:01:50.520> we're<00:01:50.700> gonna<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:51.149> whoops<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.750> try

to kind of draw the focus into the
center<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.650> little<00:04:35.770> bit<00:04:35.920> just<00:04:36.250> like<00:04:36.340> that<00:04:36.490> not

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
center a little bit just like that not

center a little bit just like that not
too<00:04:36.880> much<00:04:37.060> just<00:04:38.040> enough<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.280> kind<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:39.580> bring<00:04:39.760> in

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
too much just enough to kind of bring in

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.240 
too much just enough to kind of bring in
the<00:04:39.970> focus<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.360> little<00:04:40.540> bit<00:04:40.630> so<00:04:40.720> there<00:04:40.870> we<00:04:40.990> go<00:04:41.250> so

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
the focus a little bit so there we go so

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.830 
the focus a little bit so there we go so
there<00:04:42.610> okay<00:04:42.850> we've<00:04:43.030> got<00:04:43.210> it<00:04:43.330> all<00:04:43.390> worked<00:04:43.660> up

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
there okay we've got it all worked up

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.640 
there okay we've got it all worked up
and<00:04:45.300> let's<00:04:46.300> look<00:04:46.480> at<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.750> before<00:04:47.320> and<00:04:47.530> after

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
and let's look at the before and after

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.930 
and let's look at the before and after
because<00:04:47.890> you<00:04:48.010> can't<00:04:48.250> really<00:04:48.490> see<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.790> it

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
because you can't really see it it

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.640 
because you can't really see it it
doesn't<00:04:48.970> look<00:04:49.420> like<00:04:49.720> we've<00:04:49.900> done<00:04:50.050> any<00:04:50.320> drastic

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
doesn't look like we've done any drastic

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.150 
doesn't look like we've done any drastic
work<00:04:51.220> here<00:04:51.550> but<00:04:52.290> you<00:04:53.290> can<00:04:53.440> flip<00:04:53.680> it<00:04:53.770> off<00:04:53.920> like

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
work here but you can flip it off like

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.540 
work here but you can flip it off like
that<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.550> see<00:04:54.820> that<00:04:55.420> it<00:04:56.410> really<00:04:56.710> does<00:04:57.070> give<00:04:57.400> it

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
that and see that it really does give it

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.280 
that and see that it really does give it
a<00:04:57.670> much<00:04:57.880> more<00:04:57.960> three-dimensional<00:04:58.960> look<00:04:59.140> and

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
a much more three-dimensional look and

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.510 
a much more three-dimensional look and
if<00:04:59.350> you<00:04:59.440> decide<00:04:59.740> that's<00:04:59.919> a<00:05:00.040> little<00:05:00.190> too<00:05:00.310> much

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
if you decide that's a little too much

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.940 
if you decide that's a little too much
you<00:05:00.550> just<00:05:00.880> come<00:05:01.000> right<00:05:01.120> here<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.450> opacity

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
you just come right here to the opacity

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.020 
you just come right here to the opacity
bring<00:05:02.950> that<00:05:03.100> down<00:05:03.340> a<00:05:03.400> little<00:05:03.550> bit<00:05:03.730> like<00:05:04.000> that

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
bring that down a little bit like that

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.380 
bring that down a little bit like that
right<00:05:04.570> down<00:05:04.690> to<00:05:04.840> about<00:05:04.930> 70%<00:05:05.380> and<00:05:07.890> there<00:05:08.890> you<00:05:08.980> go

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
right down to about 70% and there you go

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.580 
right down to about 70% and there you go
again<00:05:10.390> it<00:05:10.540> doesn't<00:05:10.750> have<00:05:11.020> an<00:05:11.169> overly

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
again it doesn't have an overly

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.110 
again it doesn't have an overly
retouched<00:05:11.980> look<00:05:12.250> but<00:05:12.430> when<00:05:12.550> you<00:05:12.640> look<00:05:12.820> at<00:05:12.970> it

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
retouched look but when you look at it

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.390 
retouched look but when you look at it
with<00:05:13.360> the<00:05:13.450> before<00:05:13.720> and<00:05:13.810> after<00:05:14.169> really<00:05:15.160> gives

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
with the before and after really gives

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.909 
with the before and after really gives
it<00:05:15.520> a<00:05:15.610> much<00:05:15.910> more<00:05:16.140> three-dimensional<00:05:17.140> feeling

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
it a much more three-dimensional feeling

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.370 
it a much more three-dimensional feeling
and<00:05:18.100> a<00:05:18.400> lot<00:05:18.669> more<00:05:18.850> impact<00:05:19.210> so<00:05:19.990> I<00:05:20.020> hope<00:05:20.350> that
