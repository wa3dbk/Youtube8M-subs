the<00:00:28.360> great<00:00:28.540> things<00:00:28.750> about<00:00:28.840> the<00:00:29.110> Oxford<00:00:29.410> EQ<00:00:29.710> is

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
the great things about the Oxford EQ is

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.350 
the great things about the Oxford EQ is
it<00:00:29.890> comes<00:00:30.070> with<00:00:30.250> four<00:00:30.489> different<00:00:30.520> EQ<00:00:31.090> types

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360 
it comes with four different EQ types

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.970 
it comes with four different EQ types
let's<00:00:32.169> take<00:00:32.349> a<00:00:32.380> look<00:00:32.559> at<00:00:32.680> them

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
let's take a look at them

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.209 
let's take a look at them
so<00:00:33.820> type<00:00:34.030> 1<00:00:34.239> sounds<00:00:34.600> a<00:00:34.660> bit<00:00:34.780> like<00:00:34.989> a<00:00:35.350> TS<00:00:35.800> concert

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
so type 1 sounds a bit like a TS concert

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.420 
so type 1 sounds a bit like a TS concert
bit<00:00:36.430> like<00:00:36.550> an<00:00:36.730> SSL<00:00:37.120> 4000<00:00:37.750> for<00:00:37.870> example<00:00:38.430> its

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
bit like an SSL 4000 for example its

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.430 
bit like an SSL 4000 for example its
boost<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:40.059> cut<00:00:40.089> identical<00:00:41.019> we<00:00:41.170> call<00:00:41.320> it<00:00:41.410> a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
boost and cut identical we call it a

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.130 
boost and cut identical we call it a
reciprocal<00:00:42.039> curve<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.690> we<00:00:43.750> have<00:00:43.839> two<00:00:43.929> type

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
reciprocal curve and we have two type

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.619 
reciprocal curve and we have two type
two<00:00:44.469> it's<00:00:45.190> similar<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.609> type<00:00:45.910> 1<00:00:46.149> but<00:00:46.390> you'll

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
two it's similar to type 1 but you'll

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.739 
two it's similar to type 1 but you'll
notice<00:00:46.809> that<00:00:46.929> the<00:00:47.199> cut<00:00:47.469> is<00:00:48.010> a<00:00:48.039> lot<00:00:48.280> tighter

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
notice that the cut is a lot tighter

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:51.869 
notice that the cut is a lot tighter
than<00:00:49.749> the<00:00:49.929> boost<00:00:50.280> so<00:00:51.280> this<00:00:51.429> would<00:00:51.579> be<00:00:51.670> very

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
than the boost so this would be very

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.979 
than the boost so this would be very
useful<00:00:52.179> for<00:00:52.210> taking<00:00:52.570> up<00:00:52.690> problem<00:00:53.109> frequencies

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
useful for taking up problem frequencies

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.419 
useful for taking up problem frequencies
type<00:00:55.989> 3<00:00:56.260> is<00:00:56.379> more<00:00:56.559> of<00:00:56.649> a<00:00:56.739> British<00:00:57.070> sounding

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
type 3 is more of a British sounding

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:59.309 
type 3 is more of a British sounding
curve<00:00:57.670> it<00:00:58.059> sounds<00:00:58.659> a<00:00:58.719> bit<00:00:58.749> like<00:00:58.899> a<00:00:59.019> Neve

00:00:59.309 --> 00:00:59.319 
curve it sounds a bit like a Neve

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.569 
curve it sounds a bit like a Neve
console<00:00:59.949> for<00:01:00.129> example<00:01:00.519> and<00:01:01.120> type<00:01:01.839> 4<00:01:02.230> is<00:01:02.579> kind

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
console for example and type 4 is kind

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.530 
console for example and type 4 is kind
of<00:01:03.609> a<00:01:03.699> mastering<00:01:04.210> EQ<00:01:04.300> has<00:01:05.110> very<00:01:05.470> very<00:01:05.560> wide

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
of a mastering EQ has very very wide

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.510 
of a mastering EQ has very very wide
curves<00:01:07.540> so<00:01:08.110> it's<00:01:08.290> great<00:01:08.590> for<00:01:08.620> gentle<00:01:09.250> fills

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
curves so it's great for gentle fills

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.050 
curves so it's great for gentle fills
and<00:01:09.909> cuts<00:01:10.150> perfect<00:01:11.110> for<00:01:11.229> mastering<00:01:12.060> and

gain<00:02:11.879> which<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.420> very<00:02:12.660> useful<00:02:13.019> for<00:02:13.049> when<00:02:13.260> I'm

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
gain which is very useful for when I'm

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.410 
gain which is very useful for when I'm
boosting<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.920> lot<00:02:14.069> like<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.400> am<00:02:14.430> here<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:15.269> don't

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
boosting a lot like I am here you don't

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.820 
boosting a lot like I am here you don't
want<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.660> back<00:02:15.840> off<00:02:16.049> the<00:02:16.230> input<00:02:16.500> getting<00:02:16.739> to

want to back off the input getting to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.890 
want to back off the input getting to
compensate<00:02:17.430> wise<00:02:18.120> you'll<00:02:18.269> end<00:02:18.420> up<00:02:18.480> clipping

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
compensate wise you'll end up clipping

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.360 
compensate wise you'll end up clipping
people<00:02:19.440> just<00:02:19.590> think<00:02:19.680> they<00:02:19.769> can<00:02:19.950> boost<00:02:20.099> and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
people just think they can boost and

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.460 
people just think they can boost and
boost<00:02:20.629> and<00:02:21.629> get<00:02:21.780> away<00:02:21.870> with<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.140> but<00:02:22.319> of<00:02:22.410> course

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
boost and get away with it but of course

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.509 
boost and get away with it but of course
you're<00:02:22.739> going<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:22.920> overload

you're going to overload

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.970 
you're going to overload
so<00:02:24.030> always<00:02:24.269> remember<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.690> back<00:02:25.349> off<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.709> input

let's<00:02:39.660> have<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.810> listen<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.079> this<00:02:40.170> guitar<00:02:40.319> track

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
let's have a listen to this guitar track

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.650 
let's have a listen to this guitar track
we've<00:02:40.980> got<00:02:41.129> two<00:02:41.370> different<00:02:41.519> EQ<00:02:41.940> setups<00:02:42.420> or<00:02:42.569> we

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
we've got two different EQ setups or we

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.390 
we've got two different EQ setups or we
can<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.989> be<00:02:43.200> between<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.680> two<00:02:43.709> and<00:02:44.129> see<00:02:44.280> which

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
can a be between the two and see which

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.220 
can a be between the two and see which
we<00:02:44.519> like<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.760> best<00:02:46.760> so<00:02:47.760> this<00:02:47.910> is<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.209> using<00:02:49.019> type

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
we like the best so this is a using type

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.180 
we like the best so this is a using type
to<00:02:49.470> switch<00:02:50.220> to<00:02:50.430> be<00:02:51.349> ready<00:02:52.349> figure<00:02:52.680> than<00:02:52.829> using

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
to switch to be ready figure than using

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.229 
to switch to be ready figure than using
type<00:02:53.549> one<00:02:53.900> very<00:02:54.900> different<00:02:55.200> sounding<00:02:55.440> guitar

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
type one very different sounding guitar

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.910 
type one very different sounding guitar
we<00:02:57.239> can<00:02:57.390> flip<00:02:57.540> tool<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.079> switch<00:02:58.530> we<00:02:58.680> like<00:02:58.829> the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
we can flip tool to switch we like the

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.540 
we can flip tool to switch we like the
best

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
best

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.850 
best
no<00:03:01.550> clicks<00:03:01.880> or<00:03:02.090> pops<00:03:02.120> for<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.900> switch

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
no clicks or pops for the switch

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.580 
no clicks or pops for the switch
can<00:03:05.670> even<00:03:05.880> automate<00:03:06.030> between<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.690> two<00:03:06.870> so

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
can even automate between the two so

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.730 
can even automate between the two so
it's<00:03:07.950> very<00:03:08.100> useful<00:03:08.340> having<00:03:08.820> a<00:03:08.970> B<00:03:09.120> buttons<00:03:09.740> okay

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
it's very useful having a B buttons okay

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.780 
it's very useful having a B buttons okay
so<00:03:10.800> finally<00:03:11.190> let's<00:03:11.340> have<00:03:11.370> a<00:03:11.460> look<00:03:11.610> at<00:03:11.700> the

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
so finally let's have a look at the

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.660 
so finally let's have a look at the
Oxford<00:03:12.120> EQ<00:03:12.480> as<00:03:12.660> a<00:03:12.690> mastering<00:03:13.200> EQ<00:03:13.490> we've<00:03:14.490> talked

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
Oxford EQ as a mastering EQ we've talked

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.220 
Oxford EQ as a mastering EQ we've talked
earlier<00:03:14.970> about<00:03:15.000> type<00:03:15.360> for<00:03:15.690> being<00:03:15.930> the<00:03:16.020> best

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
earlier about type for being the best

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.420 
earlier about type for being the best
for<00:03:16.410> mastering<00:03:16.800> because<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.070> got<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> very

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
for mastering because it's got a very

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.610 
for mastering because it's got a very
wide<00:03:17.640> q<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:18.780> I'm<00:03:18.840> just<00:03:18.930> gonna<00:03:19.020> play<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.230> stereo

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
wide q so I'm just gonna play a stereo

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.360 
wide q so I'm just gonna play a stereo
mix<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.130> see<00:03:20.250> what<00:03:20.340> we<00:03:20.400> can<00:03:20.550> do<00:03:20.670> that<00:03:22.100> so<00:03:23.100> first

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
mix and see what we can do that so first

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.190 
mix and see what we can do that so first
off<00:03:23.520> I'm<00:03:23.700> going<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:23.910> use<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.270> LF<00:03:24.570> section<00:03:24.990> to

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
off I'm going to use the LF section to

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.080 
off I'm going to use the LF section to
boost<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.710> little<00:03:25.740> bit

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
boost a little bit

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.030 
boost a little bit
I'm<00:03:28.599> gonna<00:03:28.750> use<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.080> as<00:03:29.170> parametric<00:03:29.530> actually

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
I'm gonna use it as parametric actually

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
I'm gonna use it as parametric actually
around<00:03:30.940> 70<00:03:31.510> 80<00:03:31.660> Hertz<00:03:32.640> I'll<00:03:33.640> get<00:03:33.910> I'll

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
around 70 80 Hertz I'll get I'll

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.339 
around 70 80 Hertz I'll get I'll
exaggerate<00:03:34.330> a<00:03:34.599> little<00:03:34.810> bit<00:03:35.050> just<00:03:35.200> for

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
exaggerate a little bit just for

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:37.470 
exaggerate a little bit just for
demonstration<00:03:35.980> purposes<00:03:36.010> of<00:03:36.550> boost<00:03:37.239> this

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
demonstration purposes of boost this

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.030 
demonstration purposes of boost this
much<00:03:37.720> normally<00:03:40.080> and<00:03:41.080> I<00:03:41.319> just<00:03:41.500> wanna<00:03:41.620> roll<00:03:41.860> off

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
much normally and I just wanna roll off

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.880 
much normally and I just wanna roll off
a<00:03:42.069> lot<00:03:42.340> of<00:03:42.459> a<00:03:42.870> real<00:03:43.870> sub<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.860> clean<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:45.310> up

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
a lot of a real sub to clean it up

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.600 
a lot of a real sub to clean it up
because<00:03:47.890> we're<00:03:48.099> not<00:03:48.190> going<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.370> meet<00:03:48.459> you

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
because we're not going to meet you

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.280 
because we're not going to meet you
think<00:03:48.819> down<00:03:48.940> there<00:03:49.120> anyway<00:03:49.300> I'm<00:03:49.510> using<00:03:49.690> 18<00:03:50.050> DB

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
think down there anyway I'm using 18 DB

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.040 
think down there anyway I'm using 18 DB
per<00:03:50.440> octave<00:03:50.620> just<00:03:51.959> something<00:03:52.959> like<00:03:53.110> that

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
per octave just something like that

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.300 
per octave just something like that
they've<00:03:56.050> got<00:03:56.140> a<00:03:56.170> nice<00:03:56.410> lift<00:03:56.680> table<00:03:57.099> and<00:03:57.190> it's

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
they've got a nice lift table and it's

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.300 
they've got a nice lift table and it's
just<00:03:57.459> rolling<00:03:57.640> off<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:58.150> inaudible<00:03:59.310> nasty

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
just rolling off the inaudible nasty

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.660 
just rolling off the inaudible nasty
rumbles<00:04:00.780> should<00:04:01.780> be<00:04:01.870> fine<00:04:02.370> there<00:04:03.370> was<00:04:03.459> a<00:04:03.519> lot

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
rumbles should be fine there was a lot

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.650 
rumbles should be fine there was a lot
of<00:04:03.700> kind<00:04:03.880> of<00:04:04.140> boxiness<00:04:05.140> here<00:04:06.040> I<00:04:06.420> slip<00:04:07.420> it<00:04:07.540> up

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
of kind of boxiness here I slip it up

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.949 
of kind of boxiness here I slip it up
below<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.260> cue<00:04:08.560> because<00:04:08.860> it's<00:04:09.010> very<00:04:09.190> wide

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
below that cue because it's very wide

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.800 
below that cue because it's very wide
it's<00:04:10.959> a<00:04:10.989> bit<00:04:11.140> of<00:04:11.230> boxing<00:04:11.440> us<00:04:11.739> around<00:04:11.980> this

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
it's a bit of boxing us around this

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.120 
it's a bit of boxing us around this
mid-level<00:04:13.810> just<00:04:14.170> needs<00:04:14.349> quite<00:04:14.860> a<00:04:14.890> bit<00:04:15.040> of

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
mid-level just needs quite a bit of

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.330 
mid-level just needs quite a bit of
space<00:04:15.370> there<00:04:15.700> so<00:04:16.019> I'd<00:04:17.019> find<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.709> would<00:04:17.950> reduce

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
space there so I'd find it would reduce

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.990 
space there so I'd find it would reduce
this

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.990 

basically<00:04:22.000> Poseidon<00:04:22.510> fine

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.379 

it<00:04:25.630> surrounds<00:04:25.810> of<00:04:27.180> 455<00:04:28.180> it<00:04:28.390> hurts

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.260 

something<00:04:32.229> like<00:04:32.409> that<00:04:32.620> I'm<00:04:32.800> gonna<00:04:32.919> cut<00:04:33.280> that

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.070 

exaggerate<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.389> again<00:04:37.629> make<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.050> nice<00:04:39.870> hole<00:04:40.870> in

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
exaggerate it again make a nice hole in

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.760 
exaggerate it again make a nice hole in
the<00:04:41.199> mid<00:04:41.379> they're<00:04:43.110> just<00:04:44.110> crazy<00:04:44.319> a<00:04:44.469> little<00:04:44.680> bit

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
the mid they're just crazy a little bit

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.500 
the mid they're just crazy a little bit
more<00:04:44.919> space<00:04:45.189> now

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.470 

yeah<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:49.810> we're<00:04:50.080> going<00:04:50.230> to<00:04:50.290> use<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:51.480> height

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
yeah and we're going to use the height

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.410 
yeah and we're going to use the height
mitts<00:04:52.770> just<00:04:53.770> gonna<00:04:53.920> give<00:04:54.100> a<00:04:54.130> slight<00:04:54.820> subtle

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
mitts just gonna give a slight subtle

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:57.890 
mitts just gonna give a slight subtle
base<00:04:55.540> throughout<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.020> four<00:04:56.170> or<00:04:56.260> five<00:04:56.410> K<00:04:56.710> just

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
base throughout and four or five K just

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.160 
base throughout and four or five K just
not<00:04:58.900> much<00:04:59.080> at<00:04:59.260> all

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
not much at all

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.660 
not much at all
again<00:05:02.170> for<00:05:02.350> demonstration<00:05:02.860> purposes<00:05:03.220> I'll<00:05:03.400> do

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
again for demonstration purposes I'll do

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:04.890 
again for demonstration purposes I'll do
a<00:05:03.700> little<00:05:03.850> bit<00:05:04.120> more<00:05:04.300> than<00:05:04.450> I<00:05:04.510> would<00:05:04.870> normally

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
a little bit more than I would normally

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:16.220 
a little bit more than I would normally
I<00:05:05.260> only<00:05:05.320> really<00:05:05.650> want<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.890> do<00:05:05.980> about<00:05:06.070> half<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:06.370> DB

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.560 

okay<00:05:16.800> so<00:05:16.860> nuts<00:05:17.100> now<00:05:17.790> create<00:05:18.150> a<00:05:18.180> little<00:05:18.390> bit<00:05:18.510> of

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
okay so nuts now create a little bit of

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.780 
okay so nuts now create a little bit of
space<00:05:18.840> in<00:05:18.900> the<00:05:19.140> mids<00:05:19.320> given<00:05:19.620> a<00:05:19.680> nice<00:05:19.860> boost<00:05:20.550> in

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
space in the mids given a nice boost in

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:28.050 
space in the mids given a nice boost in
the<00:05:20.850> low<00:05:21.000> let's<00:05:21.840> compare<00:05:22.200> it<00:05:22.260> with<00:05:22.380> flat

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.350 

now<00:05:29.020> with<00:05:29.200> EQ<00:05:30.720> yeah<00:05:31.720> no<00:05:31.960> sir

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
now with EQ yeah no sir

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.330 
now with EQ yeah no sir
what<00:05:33.990> my<00:05:34.139> son

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
what my son

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.559 
what my son
with<00:05:37.340> very<00:05:37.550> little<00:05:37.699> effort<00:05:37.879> we've<00:05:38.180> managed<00:05:38.419> to

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:38.569 
with very little effort we've managed to

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:41.140 
with very little effort we've managed to
clean<00:05:38.840> up<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.110> track<00:05:39.909> everything<00:05:40.909> has<00:05:41.029> its

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
clean up the track everything has its

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.800 
clean up the track everything has its
own<00:05:41.300> space<00:05:41.689> sounds<00:05:42.499> more<00:05:42.680> rounded<00:05:43.629> so<00:05:44.629> that's

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:44.810 
own space sounds more rounded so that's

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.600 
own space sounds more rounded so that's
the<00:05:44.900> much-loved<00:05:45.349> Oxford<00:05:45.770> EQ<00:05:46.069> very

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
the much-loved Oxford EQ very

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.429 
the much-loved Oxford EQ very
transparent<00:05:47.409> natural<00:05:48.409> sounding<00:05:48.770> equalizer

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:50.439 
transparent natural sounding equalizer

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:52.989 
transparent natural sounding equalizer
so<00:05:51.439> to<00:05:51.499> summarise<00:05:52.009> the<00:05:52.279> Oxford<00:05:52.580> EQ<00:05:52.849> is<00:05:52.909> a

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:52.999 
so to summarise the Oxford EQ is a

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:55.209 
so to summarise the Oxford EQ is a
