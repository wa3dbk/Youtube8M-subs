00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
diamonds i put that right in the middle

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.360 
diamonds i put that right in the middle
if<00:03:30.330> you<00:03:30.930> watch<00:03:31.290> this<00:03:31.470> tape<00:03:31.709> bike<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.100> will<00:03:32.190> see

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
if you watch this tape bike you will see

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.740 
if you watch this tape bike you will see
that<00:03:32.489> actually<00:03:32.910> started<00:03:33.239> that<00:03:33.360> right<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.660> the

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
that actually started that right in the

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.720 
that actually started that right in the
middle<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.680> reason<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.070> put<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.430> there<00:03:35.459> is

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
middle and the reason I put it there is

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.710 
middle and the reason I put it there is
because<00:03:36.350> 150<00:03:37.350> square<00:03:37.610> solid<00:03:38.610> number<00:03:38.970> the

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
because 150 square solid number the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.570 
because 150 square solid number the
color<00:03:39.959> blue<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.560> that<00:03:41.130> mark<00:03:41.340> was<00:03:41.459> about

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
color blue and that mark was about

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.260 
color blue and that mark was about
doesn't<00:03:43.000> but<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:44.350> TT<00:03:44.980> on<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.190> end<00:03:45.430> that<00:03:46.120> have

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
doesn't but the TT on the end that have

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.690 
doesn't but the TT on the end that have
a<00:03:46.300> certain<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:47.680> know<00:03:47.800> a<00:03:47.830> definite<00:03:48.340> enter

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
a certain you know a definite enter

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.400 
a certain you know a definite enter
anyway<00:03:49.120> and<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:49.300> thought<00:03:49.540> if<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:50.050> put<00:03:50.230> it<00:03:50.320> in<00:03:50.350> the

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
anyway and I thought if I put it in the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.780 
anyway and I thought if I put it in the
middle<00:03:50.560> that's<00:03:50.800> probably<00:03:51.130> they're<00:03:51.520> not<00:03:51.670> worth

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
middle that's probably they're not worth

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.220 
middle that's probably they're not worth
the<00:03:51.880> new<00:03:52.030> dead<00:03:52.180> because<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.810> nitrile<00:03:53.110> fight

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
the new dead because the nitrile fight

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.620 
the new dead because the nitrile fight
had<00:03:53.440> wrought<00:03:53.620> on<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:54.190> two<00:03:54.880> clubs<00:03:55.150> my<00:03:55.390> little

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.160 
had wrought on the two clubs my little
