there's<00:00:43.980> two<00:00:44.190> different<00:00:44.340> ways<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.640> do<00:00:44.970> this

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
there's two different ways to do this

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.000 
there's two different ways to do this
one<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> cut<00:00:46.020> out<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.200> strip<00:00:46.470> of<00:00:46.650> duct<00:00:46.890> tape

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
one is to cut out a strip of duct tape

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.520 
one is to cut out a strip of duct tape
and<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.550> bend<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> over<00:00:48.180> itself<00:00:48.690> sticky<00:00:49.290> side

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
and then bend it over itself sticky side

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.410 
and then bend it over itself sticky side
to<00:00:49.559> sticky<00:00:49.770> side<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> easiest

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
to sticky side this is the easiest

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.360 
to sticky side this is the easiest
method<00:00:51.690> but<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.200> only<00:00:52.350> allows<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.010> loops<00:00:53.190> of

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
method but it only allows the loops of

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.160 
method but it only allows the loops of
your<00:00:53.520> bow<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> be<00:00:53.970> one<00:00:54.239> color<00:00:54.480> which<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.989> why<00:00:55.140> I

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
your bow to be one color which is why I

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.260 
your bow to be one color which is why I
recommend<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> second<00:00:56.250> option<00:00:56.610> take<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:56.970> piece

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
recommend the second option take a piece

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.120 
recommend the second option take a piece
of<00:00:57.300> duct<00:00:57.690> tape<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:58.200> lay<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.470> sticky<00:00:58.680> side<00:00:59.100> down

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130

the<00:01:38.459> next<00:01:38.789> step<00:01:38.940> is<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.209> I<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.569> call<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
the next step is what I like to call the

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.320 
the next step is what I like to call the
fold<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.380> pinch<00:01:40.649> because<00:01:40.890> well<00:01:41.789> you're<00:01:42.090> going

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
fold and pinch because well you're going

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.790 
fold and pinch because well you're going
to<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.600> folding<00:01:43.050> and<00:01:43.229> then<00:01:43.259> pinching<00:01:43.679> your

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
to be folding and then pinching your

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.460 
to be folding and then pinching your
fabric<00:01:44.160> together<00:01:44.539> what<00:01:45.539> can<00:01:45.690> I<00:01:45.780> say<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.050> keep<00:01:46.350> my

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
fabric together what can I say I keep my

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.870 
fabric together what can I say I keep my
creativity<00:01:47.039> more<00:01:47.160> on<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.340> craft<00:01:47.580> than<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.819> do

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
creativity more on the craft than I do

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.240 
creativity more on the craft than I do
step<00:01:48.149> titles<00:01:48.509> anyway<00:01:49.259> there<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.709> again<00:01:49.979> two

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
step titles anyway there are again two

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.830 
step titles anyway there are again two
different<00:01:50.340> ways<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.149> one<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.690> to

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
different ways to do this one is to

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.779 
different ways to do this one is to
simply<00:01:52.020> fold<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.679> strip<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.100> thirds<00:01:53.399> with

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
simply fold your strip in thirds with

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.460 
simply fold your strip in thirds with
the<00:01:53.880> ends<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.420> fabric<00:01:54.660> meeting<00:01:55.259> at<00:01:55.349> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
of the other continuing until all of the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.559 
of the other continuing until all of the
material<00:02:28.230> has

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
material has

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.599 
material has
unfolded<00:02:29.049> then<00:02:29.290> pinch<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.799> material<00:02:30.340> at<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.559 
middle of your fabric letting the
outside<00:02:32.650> folds<00:02:33.129> fan<00:02:33.400> out<00:02:33.639> to<00:02:33.879> create<00:02:34.120> your<00:02:34.389> bow

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
outside folds fan out to create your bow

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.270 
outside folds fan out to create your bow
the<00:02:34.930> next<00:02:35.230> step<00:02:35.409> is<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.680> bind<00:02:35.920> your<00:02:36.069> boat

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
the next step is to bind your boat

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.520 
the next step is to bind your boat
together<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:37.030> yes<00:02:37.299> there<00:02:37.689> are<00:02:37.719> again<00:02:38.230> two

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
together and yes there are again two

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.559 
together and yes there are again two
different<00:02:38.620> ways<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.159> do<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.400> listen<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.420> is

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
different ways to do this listen it is

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.140 
different ways to do this listen it is
all<00:02:40.840> about<00:02:41.109> the<00:02:41.799> options<00:02:42.189> right<00:02:42.700> for<00:02:43.120> a

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
all about the options right for a

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.240 
all about the options right for a
thicker<00:02:43.450> bow<00:02:43.749> Center<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.530> first<00:02:44.769> method<00:02:45.159> is

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
thicker bow Center the first method is

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.979 
thicker bow Center the first method is
to<00:02:45.310> cut<00:02:45.609> out<00:02:45.639> a<00:02:45.760> piece<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.030> duct<00:02:46.420> tape<00:02:46.450> that's<00:02:46.900> a

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
to cut out a piece of duct tape that's a

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.170 
to cut out a piece of duct tape that's a
few<00:02:47.230> inches<00:02:47.379> long<00:02:47.739> fold<00:02:48.219> the<00:02:48.400> strip<00:02:48.609> over<00:02:48.819> on

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
few inches long fold the strip over on

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.179 
few inches long fold the strip over on
itself<00:02:49.540> in<00:02:49.840> half<00:02:50.079> or<00:02:50.319> thirds<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.859> create<00:02:51.159> a

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
itself in half or thirds to create a

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.399 
itself in half or thirds to create a
sort<00:02:51.519> of<00:02:51.609> fabric<00:02:51.879> strap<00:02:52.420> then<00:02:52.870> wrap<00:02:53.139> that

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:53.409 
sort of fabric strap then wrap that

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
locking it in place with one last piece

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:58.979 
locking it in place with one last piece
of<00:02:57.189> duct<00:02:57.579> tape<00:02:57.639> for<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> cleaner<00:02:58.450> look<00:02:58.749> the

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
of duct tape for a cleaner look the

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.659 
of duct tape for a cleaner look the
other<00:02:59.109> method<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.650> still<00:02:59.889> to<00:03:00.040> cut<00:03:00.249> out<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.400> piece

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:00.669 
other method is still to cut out a piece

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:02.339 
other method is still to cut out a piece
of<00:03:00.849> duct<00:03:01.120> tape<00:03:01.180> that's<00:03:01.450> a<00:03:01.629> few<00:03:01.840> inches<00:03:02.109> long

of duct tape that's a few inches long

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.080 
of duct tape that's a few inches long
but<00:03:02.769> this<00:03:02.919> time<00:03:03.219> you'll<00:03:03.400> continue<00:03:03.849> cutting

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
but this time you'll continue cutting

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.550 
but this time you'll continue cutting
your<00:03:04.329> strip<00:03:04.629> so<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.810> it's<00:03:05.049> an<00:03:05.169> inch<00:03:05.379> or<00:03:05.530> less
