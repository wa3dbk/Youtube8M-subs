00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.369 
without taking a boot of the binding so
that's<00:00:39.570> a<00:00:39.660> little<00:00:39.780> bit<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.110> bummer<00:00:40.290> but

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that's a little bit of a bummer but

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.229 
that's a little bit of a bummer but
other<00:00:40.739> than<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.950> they're<00:00:41.910> pretty<00:00:42.030> darn

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
other than that they're pretty darn

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.450 
other than that they're pretty darn
sweet<00:00:42.480> I've<00:00:43.200> got<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.379> few<00:00:43.680> different<00:00:43.710> heel

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
sweet I've got a few different heel

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.979 
sweet I've got a few different heel
adjustment<00:00:45.180> heights<00:00:45.360> here<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:47.489> lower<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
adjustment heights here the lower the

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.869 
adjustment heights here the lower the
middle<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.739> upper<00:00:49.770> those<00:00:50.670> are<00:00:50.789> all

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
middle and the upper those are all

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.160 
middle and the upper those are all
pretty<00:00:51.090> good<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.510> could<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.809> tiny<00:00:52.050> bit

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
pretty good this could be a tiny bit

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.750 
pretty good this could be a tiny bit
higher<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.739> I<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:53.010> for<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.190> new<00:00:53.340> binding

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
higher but I think for the new binding

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.069 
higher but I think for the new binding
next<00:00:54.030> year<00:00:54.180> they've<00:00:54.360> addressed<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.899> which

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
next year they've addressed that which

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.869 
next year they've addressed that which
is<00:00:55.230> sweet<00:00:55.500> they<00:00:55.980> might<00:00:56.160> have<00:00:56.280> also<00:00:56.430> addressed

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
is sweet they might have also addressed

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.639 
is sweet they might have also addressed
the<00:00:56.969> step<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.420> step<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:57.809> thing<00:00:58.109> as<00:00:58.230> well<00:00:58.410> so

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the step in step out thing as well so

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.660 
the step in step out thing as well so
that<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.920> be<00:00:59.010> pretty<00:00:59.190> cool

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that can be pretty cool

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.209 
that can be pretty cool
yeah<00:01:00.149> easy<00:01:00.390> to<00:01:00.660> adjust<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.680> is<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> fairly

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
yeah easy to adjust this is a fairly

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.759 
yeah easy to adjust this is a fairly
random<00:01:02.430> note<00:01:02.789> but<00:01:03.090> I've<00:01:03.270> been<00:01:03.480> stripping<00:01:04.439> the

feel like you're a racer who's lost the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.820 
feel like you're a racer who's lost the
race<00:01:20.759> course<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:22.049> far<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.409> good<00:01:22.439> nice<00:01:22.799> and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
race course so far so good nice and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.010 
race course so far so good nice and
solid<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.610> put<00:01:24.060> them<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.210> these<00:01:24.390> skis<00:01:24.600> mainly

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
solid I put them on these skis mainly

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.780 
solid I put them on these skis mainly
because<00:01:25.350> everyone<00:01:25.830> else<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.189> group<00:01:26.369> has

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
because everyone else on the group has

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.789 
because everyone else on the group has
the<00:01:26.939> same<00:01:27.119> bindings<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.170> wanted<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> share

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the same bindings and I wanted to share

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.710 
the same bindings and I wanted to share
their<00:01:29.009> spare<00:01:29.220> parts<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.759> that's<00:01:30.540> already

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
their spare parts and that's already

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270 
their spare parts and that's already
been<00:01:30.930> used<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.619> guess<00:01:31.860> that's<00:01:32.009> irrelevant

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
been used so I guess that's irrelevant

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.550 
been used so I guess that's irrelevant
now<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.060> they've<00:01:33.780> been<00:01:33.900> skiing<00:01:34.110> really<00:01:34.350> good

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
extra binding material that's going up

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.560 
extra binding material that's going up
and<00:01:46.560> down<00:01:46.680> as<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.399> are<00:01:47.670> touring<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
really efficient motion really easy for

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.289 
really efficient motion really easy for
you<00:01:52.320> know<00:01:52.409> cross-country<00:01:52.979> touring<00:01:53.399> or<00:01:53.579> say

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
Baffin Island where you've got to go 25k

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.819 
Baffin Island where you've got to go 25k
across<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.299> flat<00:01:57.570> frozen<00:01:58.049> ocean<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.649> to

across the flat frozen ocean to get to

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.530 
across the flat frozen ocean to get to
your<00:01:58.950> cooler<00:01:59.399> for<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.640> day<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.180> they're<00:02:00.450> nice

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.230 
your cooler for the day and they're nice
and<00:02:00.600> light<00:02:00.869> which<00:02:01.590> is<00:02:01.740> good<00:02:01.920> because<00:02:02.790> I'm<00:02:03.060> so

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
and light which is good because I'm so

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.450 
and light which is good because I'm so
heavy

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
heavy

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.820 
heavy
maybe<00:02:05.300> my<00:02:05.510> favorite<00:02:05.690> train<00:02:06.080> binding<00:02:06.380> so<00:02:06.560> far

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
maybe my favorite train binding so far

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.790 
maybe my favorite train binding so far
but<00:02:07.190> I<00:02:07.460> think<00:02:07.640> if<00:02:08.090> they<00:02:08.300> had<00:02:08.960> a<00:02:08.990> higher<00:02:09.289> heel

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
but I think if they had a higher heel

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.620 
but I think if they had a higher heel
piece<00:02:10.039> and<00:02:10.369> go<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:10.910> and<00:02:11.030> out<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.120> walk<00:02:11.390> mode

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
piece and go in and out of walk mode

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.260 
piece and go in and out of walk mode
which<00:02:12.200> next<00:02:12.500> years<00:02:12.680> probably<00:02:12.860> do<00:02:13.280> then<00:02:14.090> they'd

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
which next years probably do then they'd

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.010 
which next years probably do then they'd
be<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.510> winner<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.080> check<00:02:15.800> them<00:02:15.920> out
