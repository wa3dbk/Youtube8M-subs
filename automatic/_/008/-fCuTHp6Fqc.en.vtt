Chargers<00:01:39.729> dr.<00:01:40.090> Tesla<00:01:40.539> what<00:01:40.990> the<00:01:41.740> drones<00:01:42.039> took

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
Chargers dr. Tesla what the drones took

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.209 
Chargers dr. Tesla what the drones took
them<00:01:42.579> for<00:01:42.759> money<00:01:43.289> after<00:01:44.289> she<00:01:44.710> discovered

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
them for money after she discovered

them for money after she discovered
where<00:01:45.369> I<00:01:45.460> had<00:01:45.610> hidden<00:01:45.819> them<00:01:46.000> I<00:01:47.310> altered<00:01:48.310> your

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
where I had hidden them I altered your

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:49.980 
where I had hidden them I altered your
medication<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.240> render<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.689> on<00:01:49.869> the

medication to render you on the

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.789 
medication to render you on the
conscious<00:01:51.840> then<00:01:52.840> I<00:01:52.869> took<00:01:53.200> control<00:01:53.380> of<00:01:53.619> your

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
conscious then I took control of your

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.969 
conscious then I took control of your
bio<00:01:54.039> suit<00:01:54.340> I<00:01:56.250> took<00:01:57.250> these<00:01:57.459> other<00:01:57.819> charges<00:01:58.060> and

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
bio suit I took these other charges and

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.410 
bio suit I took these other charges and
replace<00:01:59.979> them<00:02:00.280> with<00:02:00.310> powerless<00:02:00.909> duplicates

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
replace them with powerless duplicates

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.419 
replace them with powerless duplicates
he<00:02:02.259> was<00:02:02.409> following<00:02:02.799> orders<00:02:03.039> from<00:02:03.250> the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
reprogramming attempts then it was you

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.390 
reprogramming attempts then it was you
who<00:02:13.780> showed<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.260> silencers<00:02:14.860> how<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.069> enter
