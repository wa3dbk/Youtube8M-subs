00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.879 
going to be even better so you want to
make<00:04:10.790> sure<00:04:10.820> that<00:04:11.060> you<00:04:11.180> enclose<00:04:11.660> your<00:04:12.380> filling

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
make sure that you enclose your filling

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.680 
make sure that you enclose your filling
completely<00:04:13.549> in<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.940> dough<00:04:14.120> and<00:04:14.510> then

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
completely in the dough and then

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.170 
completely in the dough and then
roll<00:04:15.840> it<00:04:16.019> into<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.440> ball<00:04:16.820> and<00:04:17.820> we<00:04:17.880> have<00:04:18.090> the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
roll it into a ball and we have the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.009 
roll it into a ball and we have the
fryer<00:04:18.390> at<00:04:18.660> about<00:04:19.130> 350<00:04:20.130> degrees<00:04:20.570> mm-hmm<00:04:21.660> okay

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
fryer at about 350 degrees mm-hmm okay

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.380 
fryer at about 350 degrees mm-hmm okay
so<00:04:22.080> you<00:04:22.890> roll<00:04:23.100> them<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.460> then<00:04:23.610> set<00:04:24.210> them<00:04:24.300> aside

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
so you roll them and then set them aside

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:42.020 
so you roll them and then set them aside
for<00:04:24.540> 10<00:04:24.840> minutes<00:04:24.870> on<00:04:25.200> them<00:04:25.350> around<00:04:41.030> special

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
for 10 minutes on them around special

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.020 
for 10 minutes on them around special
paleo<00:04:42.630> dough<00:04:43.380> ball<00:04:43.620> you<00:04:44.370> can<00:04:44.520> see<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:44.850> dough

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
paleo dough ball you can see the dough

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.760 
paleo dough ball you can see the dough
looks<00:04:45.300> a<00:04:45.390> little<00:04:45.510> bit<00:04:45.750> different<00:04:46.170> than<00:04:46.560> the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
looks a little bit different than the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.260 
looks a little bit different than the
traditional<00:04:46.800> dough<00:04:47.490> because<00:04:47.940> it's<00:04:48.090> made<00:04:48.240> from

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
traditional dough because it's made from

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.410 
traditional dough because it's made from
yucca<00:04:49.020> root<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.650> tapioca<00:04:50.310> flour<00:04:50.490> so<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.360> is

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
yucca root and tapioca flour so it is

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.110 
yucca root and tapioca flour so it is
fairly<00:04:51.960> high<00:04:52.200> in<00:04:52.230> carbohydrates<00:04:53.010> but<00:04:53.670> for

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
fairly high in carbohydrates but for

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.720 
fairly high in carbohydrates but for
special<00:04:54.390> occasions<00:04:54.840> you<00:04:55.590> know<00:04:55.620> it's<00:04:56.310> a<00:04:56.460> it's<00:04:56.640> a

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:56.730 
special occasions you know it's a it's a

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.160 
special occasions you know it's a it's a
nice<00:04:56.850> alternative<00:04:57.060> so<00:04:57.690> that<00:04:57.840> I<00:04:57.870> can

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 
nice alternative so that I can

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.830 
nice alternative so that I can
participate<00:04:58.530> in<00:04:58.890> my<00:04:59.070> family<00:04:59.400> tradition<00:05:02.840> yeah

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
be careful when you're frying so we

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.410 
be careful when you're frying so we
don't<00:05:06.630> have<00:05:06.750> it<00:05:06.870> full<00:05:07.290> too<00:05:07.830> high<00:05:08.190> with<00:05:08.490> oil<00:05:08.670> and

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
don't have it full too high with oil and

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:18.080 
don't have it full too high with oil and
never<00:05:10.010> stand<00:05:11.010> with<00:05:11.310> your<00:05:11.490> face<00:05:16.010> it's<00:05:17.010> true<00:05:17.310> so

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
never stand with your face it's true so

never stand with your face it's true so
dad<00:05:18.390> says<00:05:18.750> if<00:05:19.500> you<00:05:19.650> have<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:19.800> fry<00:05:20.040> daddy<00:05:20.340> maybe

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
dad says if you have a fry daddy maybe

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.340 
dad says if you have a fry daddy maybe
four<00:05:21.720> at<00:05:22.110> a<00:05:22.770> time<00:05:23.120> because<00:05:24.120> when<00:05:24.930> you<00:05:25.020> put<00:05:25.200> too

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
four at a time because when you put too

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:26.600 
four at a time because when you put too
many<00:05:25.470> in<00:05:25.590> at<00:05:25.740> once<00:05:25.919> it<00:05:26.130> drops<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.550> temperature

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
many in at once it drops the temperature

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.070 
many in at once it drops the temperature
of<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.120> oil<00:05:27.150> and<00:05:27.540> then<00:05:27.630> that's<00:05:27.810> what<00:05:27.930> makes

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
of the oil and then that's what makes

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.140 
of the oil and then that's what makes
things<00:05:28.260> taste<00:05:28.470> greasy<00:05:28.710> okay<00:05:29.280> and<00:05:29.490> you<00:05:30.030> just

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
things taste greasy okay and you just

things taste greasy okay and you just
let<00:05:30.330> them<00:05:30.419> go<00:05:30.540> until<00:05:30.720> they're<00:05:31.020> a<00:05:31.350> pleasing

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
let them go until they're a pleasing
