00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
into place for a bra like this it has

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.390 
into place for a bra like this it has
seams<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.110> it's<00:01:22.710> going<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.979> give<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
seams in it and it's going to give a

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.320 
seams in it and it's going to give a
different<00:01:23.759> shape<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:25.220> each<00:01:26.220> seam<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.970> part<00:01:27.299> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
different shape so each seam is part of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.660 
different shape so each seam is part of
a<00:01:27.420> panel<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.960> pushes<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.950> breast<00:01:29.189> tissue<00:01:29.400> in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
a panel that pushes the breast tissue in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.899 
a panel that pushes the breast tissue in
a<00:01:29.729> certain<00:01:30.030> direction<00:01:31.220> for<00:01:32.220> bust<00:01:32.460> your<00:01:32.610> women

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
a certain direction for bust your women

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.370 
a certain direction for bust your women
I<00:01:33.000> recommend<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> seams<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.290> will

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
I recommend the seams because it will

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.520 
I recommend the seams because it will
make<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> look<00:01:34.710> narrower<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.729> sides<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
make you look narrower on the sides and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.670 
make you look narrower on the sides and
not<00:01:37.530> so<00:01:37.950> spread<00:01:38.369> out<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.759> wide<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:40.320> type<00:01:40.530> of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
not so spread out and wide this type of

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
not so spread out and wide this type of
bra<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> non<00:01:41.400> molded<00:01:41.610> bra<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.240> has<00:01:42.420> seams

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
bra is a non molded bra and it has seams

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.139 
bra is a non molded bra and it has seams
I<00:01:43.049> recommend<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.860> style<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.310> bigger<00:01:44.759> women

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149
