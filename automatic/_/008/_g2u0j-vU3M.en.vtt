00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.439
 lucky type farm I found the 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.780
 palettes within the very eye shadows 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.109
 shimmer and inside we also find one 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.689
 very intense black pencil the first 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.629

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.540

 cards with looks to make 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:14.229
 we complain about this packaging 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.940
 with shapes to the relief 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:19.159
 I find this palette really very beautiful 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.220
 for the texture of the eye shadows for them 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:23.300
 writing and also for their course 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.600
 pigmentation especially also for the 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.910
 pencil that really very much valid 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.710

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.880

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.130
 lower part we have products for 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.290
 the face in the top of the products 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.970
 for the eyes 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.970
 as you can see the eye shadows are 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.310
 very different we have both bio.medi shimmer 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.100
 that of the impact eye shadows have of 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.050
 colors very very pigmented 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.729

 lower part instead of two 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.100
 blush lands an illuminating one 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.580
 card brush always with tea

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.370
 very nice I like it both for the 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.330
 packaging but above all for the 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:19.370
