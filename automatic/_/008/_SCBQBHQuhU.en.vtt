00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.900
 a market of meg matthews i welcome 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.209
 welcome you to a new one 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.810
 direction this time I test the couch 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.400
 Masters is a piece of furniture for gamers 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.830
 So part of the planned purchase 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.630
 can take to relaxed there with 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.880
 Mouse and keyboard I play 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.039
 not only interesting for pc players 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.210
 also for the console games there 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.279
 now also a small one 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.649
 adapter using the mouse and keyboard 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.739
 can at the xbox 360 or playstation 3 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:43.199
 So the unboxing wish you much fun 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.760
 and we will be the couch master 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.069
 unpack some more words 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.350
 there is a basic version there is one 

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:52.050
 premium version the premium version 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.210
 differs in that way 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.109
 the premium version still a usb hub 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:02.100
 it is 3.0 usb with extension cable 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:04.440
 so you can get your rates directly to the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.440
 USB hub can connect the one below 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.710
 stowed in the cellar and this will then 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.420
 everything connected with a USB cable 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.100
 and thus reaches the pc on the man 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.750
 you can already see when playing 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.130
 Unpack the workmanship is very good 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.450
 that's all very stable and very 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.149
 valued those are the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.119
 palm rest that is that 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.939
 longer cable and that is the usb hub 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.130
 Exactly and then we put the whole time 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.810
 Together that she is Velcro the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.469
 Velcro you can the palm rest 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.050
 newa still marvelous that are 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.430
 they fold down 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.780
 and on top a small pimple you can 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.620
 Lay the cable inwards 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.540
 So really only one cable looks out 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:49.080
 and so is the couch master 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.630
 wonderful to play on the pc 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.370
 on the tv device nice on the couch 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.720
 or just to his laptop in front of him 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.730
 set and use 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.950
 just as I said for the consoles 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.990
 owner yes we have that extensively 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.820
 tested with a round battlefield thing 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.830
 synonymous else and the link to the couch master 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.010
 of course you get below intervideo 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:13.500
 description can play as high as ours 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.350
 Conclusion of the couch from the spd stand yes 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.780
 So I belong with relatively big as 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.220
 four meters 94 and I just sit very much 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.750
 have practiced living room table if I have 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.570
 just surf the internet or play 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.860
 want to be on tv and with this cluster 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.000
 Here you feel like in sap 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.190

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.570
 you have everything right in front of you 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.520
 keyboard does not do it all right now 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.170
 easily reach us very easily 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.250
 The palm rest really is 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.600
 super so who plays the tv device and 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.940
 can hardly blame water and even on it 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.520

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.840

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.610
