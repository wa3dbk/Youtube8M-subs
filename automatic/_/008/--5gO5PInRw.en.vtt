together this team this ragtag team of
misfits<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:14.120> save<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.290> world<00:02:15.530> which<00:02:16.100> sounds

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
misfits to save the world which sounds

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.980 
misfits to save the world which sounds
crazy<00:02:16.850> but<00:02:17.120> she<00:02:17.240> doesn't<00:02:17.390> think<00:02:17.540> like<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
crazy but she doesn't think like the

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.370 
crazy but she doesn't think like the
rest<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.320> them<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.709> I<00:02:19.810> think<00:02:20.810> that's<00:02:20.990> what<00:02:21.170> he

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
rest of them and I think that's what he

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.870 
rest of them and I think that's what he
really<00:02:21.680> loves<00:02:21.980> about<00:02:22.250> her<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.580> I<00:02:22.640> think

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
really loves about her and I think

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.949 
really loves about her and I think
that's<00:02:23.060> what<00:02:23.239> other<00:02:23.420> people<00:02:23.720> are<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.840> little

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
that's what other people are a little

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.430 
that's what other people are a little
bit<00:02:24.110> hesitant<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.970> films<00:02:26.420> all<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:27.410> a

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
bit hesitant the films all have a

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.930 
bit hesitant the films all have a
superhero<00:02:28.130> that<00:02:28.310> they're<00:02:28.459> following

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
superhero that they're following

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.000 
superhero that they're following
whereas<00:02:29.270> our<00:02:29.420> show<00:02:29.690> is<00:02:29.900> about<00:02:30.050> living<00:02:30.560> in<00:02:30.890> the

whereas our show is about living in the
world<00:02:31.220> where<00:02:31.430> there<00:02:31.610> are<00:02:31.640> superheroes<00:02:32.360> but

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
world where there are superheroes but

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.170 
world where there are superheroes but
being<00:02:32.959> a<00:02:33.080> regular<00:02:33.410> person<00:02:33.440> and<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.790> we've

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
being a regular person and and we've

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.910 
being a regular person and and we've
tried<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.570> build<00:02:35.690> a<00:02:35.810> cast<00:02:36.020> of<00:02:36.200> characters<00:02:36.650> that

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
tried to build a cast of characters that

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.250 
tried to build a cast of characters that
are<00:02:37.040> relatable<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.790> people<00:02:38.260> internationally

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
are relatable to people internationally

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.640 
are relatable to people internationally
and

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
and

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.220 
and
because<00:02:41.160> they're<00:02:41.970> just<00:02:42.120> people<00:02:42.330> just<00:02:42.870> like<00:02:43.020> us

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
because they're just people just like us

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.960 
because they're just people just like us
they're<00:02:43.560> experts<00:02:44.100> and<00:02:44.460> they're<00:02:44.670> amazing

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
they're experts and they're amazing

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.860 
they're experts and they're amazing
right

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
right

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.010 
right
but<00:02:46.170> our<00:02:46.340> tagline<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.910> not<00:02:48.240> all<00:02:48.420> heroes<00:02:48.690> are

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
but our tagline is not all heroes are

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.800 
but our tagline is not all heroes are
super<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:50.700> think<00:02:51.150> that's<00:02:51.300> something<00:02:51.570> that

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
super and I think that's something that

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.110 
super and I think that's something that
will<00:02:52.290> resonate<00:02:52.620> it<00:02:53.220> is<00:02:53.370> about<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.760> little<00:02:53.880> guy

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
will resonate it is about the little guy

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.210 
will resonate it is about the little guy
it<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:54.750> about<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.140> know<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:55.770> take<00:02:55.950> place

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
it is about you know if we do take place

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.770 
it is about you know if we do take place
after<00:02:56.460> the<00:02:56.790> Battle<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.120> New<00:02:57.300> York<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
after the Battle of New York so the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.230 
after the Battle of New York so the
general<00:02:58.140> population<00:02:58.710> is<00:02:58.830> aware<00:02:59.130> of<00:02:59.460> gods<00:02:59.970> and

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
general population is aware of gods and

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.180 
general population is aware of gods and
monsters<00:03:00.330> exist<00:03:00.990> there<00:03:01.110> was<00:03:01.170> a<00:03:01.320> portal<00:03:01.710> to<00:03:01.890> an

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
monsters exist there was a portal to an

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.650 
monsters exist there was a portal to an
alien<00:03:02.580> universe<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.450> they're<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.630> bit

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
alien universe so they're a bit

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.620 
alien universe so they're a bit
shell-shocked<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:04.590> I<00:03:05.370> think<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.670> big<00:03:05.910> goal<00:03:06.300> of

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
shell-shocked and I think a big goal of

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.540 
shell-shocked and I think a big goal of
our<00:03:06.780> team<00:03:07.050> is<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.530> go<00:03:07.680> out<00:03:07.890> there<00:03:08.190> in<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.430> world
