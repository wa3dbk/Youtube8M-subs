that's<00:03:58.390> hard<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.780> tell<00:03:59.020> it<00:03:59.560> depends<00:03:59.920> on<00:03:59.980> what

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
that's hard to tell it depends on what

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.400 
that's hard to tell it depends on what
you<00:04:00.280> do<00:04:00.430> I<00:04:00.460> guess<00:04:00.850> the<00:04:01.420> processor<00:04:01.900> does<00:04:02.110> allow

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
you do I guess the processor does allow

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.580 
you do I guess the processor does allow
for<00:04:02.440> eighty<00:04:03.100> percent<00:04:03.370> more<00:04:04.560> processing<00:04:05.560> power

you're surfing on the internet I think

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.900

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
that will I think allow it to be very

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.140 
that will I think allow it to be very

uh<00:06:21.540> and<00:06:22.229> then<00:06:22.979> I<00:06:23.340> think<00:06:23.760> that<00:06:23.880> price<00:06:24.150> is<00:06:24.330> going

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450 
uh and then I think that price is going

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.420 
uh and then I think that price is going
to<00:06:24.510> really<00:06:24.870> help<00:06:25.169> with<00:06:25.440> the<00:06:25.530> mass<00:06:25.770> appeal<00:06:26.190> of
