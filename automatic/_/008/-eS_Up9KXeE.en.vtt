yeah<00:00:26.810> now<00:00:27.810> this<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.650> dual<00:00:29.130> boiler<00:00:29.400> machine

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
yeah now this is a dual boiler machine

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.560 
yeah now this is a dual boiler machine
yeah<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.750> PID<00:00:31.489> so<00:00:32.489> you've<00:00:32.610> got<00:00:32.759> really<00:00:33.239> precise

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
yeah a PID so you've got really precise

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.959 
yeah a PID so you've got really precise
temperature<00:00:34.170> control<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.800> both<00:00:35.190> bonus<00:00:35.579> for

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
temperature control for both bonus for

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.119 
temperature control for both bonus for
both<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.570> both<00:00:36.719> boilers<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.380> now<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
both for both boilers and now one of the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.770 
both for both boilers and now one of the
things<00:00:38.280> when<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:38.460> first<00:00:38.730> started<00:00:39.090> using<00:00:39.600> this

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
things when I first started using this

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.869 
things when I first started using this
machine<00:00:40.170> is<00:00:40.320> I<00:00:40.829> just<00:00:40.890> love<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.370> display<00:00:41.700> up

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
machine is I just love the display up

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.479 
machine is I just love the display up
front<00:00:42.149> when<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> pull<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> shot<00:00:43.489> it

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
front when you go to pull a shot it

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.610 
front when you go to pull a shot it
gives<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.910> timer<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.660> yeah<00:00:46.350> that's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
gives you a timer in that yeah that's

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.260 
gives you a timer in that yeah that's
something<00:00:47.280> really<00:00:47.640> nice<00:00:47.760> which<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.120> have

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
the machine is just idle it's going to

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.460 
the machine is just idle it's going to
alternate<00:01:03.390> between<00:01:03.539> showing<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.290> the

chrome can go on it's kind of yeah
actually<00:01:53.189> come<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.240> yeah<00:01:54.420> that's<00:01:54.659> why

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
actually come out of it yeah that's why

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.330 
actually come out of it yeah that's why
we<00:01:54.990> use<00:01:55.110> dynasty<00:01:55.500> which<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:55.829> also<00:01:56.130> something

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
we use dynasty which is also something

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.490 
we use dynasty which is also something
which<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.090> used<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.659> most<00:01:57.899> of<00:01:58.079> commercial

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
which is used in most of commercial

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.770 
which is used in most of commercial
machines<00:01:58.740> which<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.460> also<00:01:59.759> assigned<00:02:00.540> for

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
machines which is also assigned for

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.760 
machines which is also assigned for
quality<00:02:01.110> yeah

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
quality yeah

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.760 
quality yeah
and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.790> you've<00:02:02.939> got<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:04.259> valves

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
and then you've got the the valves

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.100 
and then you've got the the valves
themselves<00:02:04.920> they're<00:02:05.549> sprung<00:02:05.850> valves<00:02:06.420> yeah

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
themselves they're sprung valves yeah

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.699 
themselves they're sprung valves yeah
they'd<00:02:07.469> gotten<00:02:07.680> more<00:02:07.890> reliable<00:02:08.550> over<00:02:08.700> time

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:09.709 
they'd gotten more reliable over time

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.789 
they'd gotten more reliable over time
yeah<00:02:10.099> so<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:10.819> can't<00:02:11.180> over<00:02:11.719> drill<00:02:12.079> them<00:02:12.290> you

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
yeah so you can't over drill them you

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.099 
yeah so you can't over drill them you
can't<00:02:13.010> over<00:02:13.250> crank<00:02:13.519> them<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:14.109> sacrificing

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:15.109 
can't over crank them and sacrificing

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:17.050 
can't over crank them and sacrificing
valve<00:02:15.290> seats<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.980> yeah<00:02:16.400> kind<00:02:16.609> of<00:02:16.700> thing<00:02:16.849> and

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
valve seats and yeah kind of thing and

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.110 
valve seats and yeah kind of thing and
we<00:02:17.769> shortly<00:02:18.769> have<00:02:18.920> our<00:02:19.129> new<00:02:19.310> valves<00:02:19.609> they<00:02:20.000> are

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
we shortly have our new valves they are

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.209 
we shortly have our new valves they are
Squared's<00:02:20.599> to<00:02:20.810> give<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.349> nicer<00:02:21.709> look<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.129> the

Squared's to give it a nicer look to the

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:25.679 
Squared's to give it a nicer look to the
Machine<00:02:22.489> like<00:02:23.090> profit<00:02:23.329> Hank<00:02:23.629> and<00:02:23.930> has<00:02:24.219> all

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
capito

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.839 
capito
just<00:02:30.439> to<00:02:30.500> give<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> complete<00:02:31.310> image<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.730> the

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
just to give a complete image of the

just to give a complete image of the
product<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:32.389> really<00:02:32.599> the<00:02:32.959> aesthetics<00:02:33.560> of<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
product so really the aesthetics of the

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.470 
product so really the aesthetics of the
machine<00:02:34.040> are<00:02:34.280> complemented<00:02:34.849> by<00:02:34.879> the<00:02:35.060> by<00:02:35.420> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
machine are complemented by the by the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.649 
machine are complemented by the by the
valves<00:02:35.870> themselves<00:02:36.439> and<00:02:36.650> and<00:02:36.799> these<00:02:37.510> come<00:02:38.510> out

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
valves themselves and and these come out

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.959 
valves themselves and and these come out
far<00:02:39.139> enough<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:39.620> there's<00:02:39.859> no<00:02:40.010> knocking<00:02:40.549> yeah

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
far enough so there's no knocking yeah

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.860 
far enough so there's no knocking yeah
of<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.420> machine<00:02:41.829> with<00:02:42.829> with<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.280> wands<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
of the machine with with the wands and

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.720 
of the machine with with the wands and
then<00:02:45.379> around<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.739> outside<00:02:45.769> I<00:02:46.159> mean<00:02:46.459> a<00:02:46.489> lot<00:02:46.700> of

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
then around the outside I mean a lot of

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.949 
then around the outside I mean a lot of
machines<00:02:47.060> will<00:02:47.209> just<00:02:47.359> spit<00:02:47.599> you<00:02:47.720> know<00:02:47.810> they

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
machines will just spit you know they

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.330 
machines will just spit you know they
put<00:02:48.079> the<00:02:48.169> panels<00:02:48.470> on<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.769> just<00:02:48.889> slice<00:02:49.129> them

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
put the panels on and just slice them

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.190 
put the panels on and just slice them
now<00:02:49.459> we've<00:02:49.609> got<00:02:49.760> all<00:02:49.939> nicely<00:02:50.269> wrapped<00:02:50.750> and

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
now we've got all nicely wrapped and

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.009 
now we've got all nicely wrapped and
finished<00:02:51.620> yeah<00:02:52.310> corners<00:02:53.120> nothing<00:02:53.599> sharp<00:02:53.870> at

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
finished yeah corners nothing sharp at

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.929 
finished yeah corners nothing sharp at
all<00:02:54.109> no<00:02:54.500> that's<00:02:55.099> difficult<00:02:55.459> to<00:02:55.730> produce

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 
all no that's difficult to produce

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.149 
all no that's difficult to produce
because<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.900> have<00:02:57.139> the<00:02:57.290> bendings<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.889> then

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
because you have the bendings and then

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.979 
because you have the bendings and then
you<00:02:58.400> have<00:02:58.519> to<00:02:58.639> weld<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:59.090> polish<00:02:59.480> afterwards

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
you have to weld and polish afterwards

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.899 
you have to weld and polish afterwards
so<00:03:00.530> it's<00:03:00.739> a<00:03:00.950> much<00:03:01.370> more<00:03:01.549> work<00:03:01.760> or

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
so it's a much more work or

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.330 
so it's a much more work or
craftsmanship<00:03:02.900> which<00:03:03.169> goes<00:03:03.409> into<00:03:03.769> these<00:03:03.889> body

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
craftsmanship which goes into these body

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.289 
craftsmanship which goes into these body
work<00:03:04.849> of<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.120> pro<00:03:05.239> 700<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.340> yeah<00:03:07.340> but<00:03:07.579> in<00:03:08.120> the

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
work of the pro 700 and yeah but in the

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.000 
work of the pro 700 and yeah but in the
end<00:03:08.389> it<00:03:08.870> gives<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.319> a<00:03:09.349> different<00:03:09.409> product

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
end it gives you a different product

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.459 
end it gives you a different product
yeah<00:03:10.459> I<00:03:10.669> mean<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.419> really<00:03:11.659> just<00:03:11.810> notice<00:03:12.290> all

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 
yeah I mean you really just notice all

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.469 
yeah I mean you really just notice all
the<00:03:12.620> touches<00:03:12.980> all<00:03:13.189> throughout<00:03:13.549> I<00:03:13.879> mean<00:03:14.299> right

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:14.479 
the touches all throughout I mean right

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.509 
the touches all throughout I mean right
even<00:03:14.750> into<00:03:15.079> the<00:03:15.199> internals<00:03:15.859> of<00:03:16.069> a<00:03:16.159> drip<00:03:16.370> tray

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
even into the internals of a drip tray

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:18.610 
even into the internals of a drip tray
which<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:16.819> not<00:03:17.479> something<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:18.049> lot<00:03:18.229> of<00:03:18.379> people

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
which is not something a lot of people

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.009 
which is not something a lot of people
really<00:03:18.829> look<00:03:19.099> at<00:03:19.310> but<00:03:19.489> you<00:03:19.639> even<00:03:19.970> inside<00:03:20.750> the

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
really look at but you even inside the

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.199 
really look at but you even inside the
drip<00:03:21.229> tray<00:03:21.409> you<00:03:22.159> go<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.489> extra<00:03:22.549> mile<00:03:22.879> tell<00:03:23.120> me

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
drip tray you go the extra mile tell me

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.030 
drip tray you go the extra mile tell me
about<00:03:23.299> you<00:03:23.479> know<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:23.989> when<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.769> drip<00:03:24.919> tray

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
about you know like when the drip tray

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.740 
about you know like when the drip tray
is<00:03:25.159> getting<00:03:25.519> valid<00:03:25.849> today<00:03:25.939> as<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.269> special<00:03:26.419> gas

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
is getting valid today as a special gas

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.500 
is getting valid today as a special gas
which<00:03:27.079> put<00:03:27.319> into<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.829> welding<00:03:28.250> to<00:03:28.909> avoid<00:03:29.329> the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
which put into the welding to avoid the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.629 
which put into the welding to avoid the
oxidation<00:03:29.959> already<00:03:30.439> bubbling<00:03:30.620> so<00:03:31.340> that<00:03:31.489> means

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:31.639 
oxidation already bubbling so that means

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.129 
oxidation already bubbling so that means
if<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:31.879> take<00:03:31.909> it<00:03:32.150> out<00:03:32.269> you<00:03:32.299> don't<00:03:32.510> you<00:03:32.989> have<00:03:33.109> a

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
if you take it out you don't you have a

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.770 
if you take it out you don't you have a
clean<00:03:33.409> surface<00:03:33.939> and<00:03:34.939> if<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.329> problem<00:03:35.659> being

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
clean surface and if the problem being

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.050 
clean surface and if the problem being

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
you get some acid in there your decal

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.439 
you get some acid in there your decal
spying<00:03:39.919> your<00:03:40.099> machine<00:03:40.430> you're<00:03:41.060> gonna<00:03:41.150> start

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
spying your machine you're gonna start

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.659 
spying your machine you're gonna start
corroding<00:03:41.659> some<00:03:42.259> of<00:03:42.379> those<00:03:42.470> exposed<00:03:42.919> welds<00:03:43.549> he

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
corroding some of those exposed welds he

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:44.170 
corroding some of those exposed welds he
can't<00:03:43.879> happen

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
can't happen

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.569 
can't happen
yeah<00:03:44.479> so<00:03:44.870> another<00:03:45.259> touch<00:03:45.650> where<00:03:46.250> you've

yeah so another touch where you've
really<00:03:46.849> gone<00:03:46.970> for<00:03:47.209> the<00:03:47.269> quality<00:03:47.629> no<00:03:47.750> yeah<00:03:47.959> now

00:03:48.369 --> 00:03:48.379 
really gone for the quality no yeah now

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.890 
really gone for the quality no yeah now
let's<00:03:48.530> talk<00:03:48.650> about<00:03:48.949> inside<00:03:49.479> again<00:03:50.479> dual

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
let's talk about inside again dual

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.679 
let's talk about inside again dual
boiler<00:03:51.340> very<00:03:52.340> large<00:03:52.579> how<00:03:52.819> big<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.389> the<00:03:53.479> steam

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
boiler very large how big is the steam

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.960 
boiler very large how big is the steam
boiler<00:03:53.840> it's<00:03:54.349> too<00:03:54.530> neat<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.799> 2<00:03:55.220> liter<00:03:55.459> stand

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
boiler it's too neat a 2 liter stand

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.909 
boiler it's too neat a 2 liter stand

coffee<00:04:00.949> boy<00:04:01.159> off<00:04:01.340> on<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.939> brew<00:04:02.120> boiler<00:04:02.299> and

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
coffee boy off on the brew boiler and

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:04.300 
coffee boy off on the brew boiler and
both<00:04:02.930> have<00:04:03.139> that<00:04:03.290> really<00:04:03.530> nice<00:04:03.739> insulating

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
both have that really nice insulating

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.640 
both have that really nice insulating
jacket<00:04:04.340> yeah<00:04:04.939> which<00:04:05.540> helps<00:04:06.139> keep<00:04:06.290> some<00:04:06.470> heat

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
jacket yeah which helps keep some heat

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.189 
jacket yeah which helps keep some heat
inside<00:04:07.129> but<00:04:07.609> also<00:04:07.720> what<00:04:08.720> about<00:04:08.930> it's

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
inside but also what about it's

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.839 
inside but also what about it's
important<00:04:09.620> like<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:09.829> parts<00:04:10.310> like<00:04:10.549> solar

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
important like the parts like solar

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.860 
important like the parts like solar
valves<00:04:11.299> other<00:04:12.139> actual<00:04:12.829> components<00:04:13.340> are<00:04:13.459> not

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
valves other actual components are not

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.099 
valves other actual components are not
be<00:04:14.870> heated<00:04:15.199> or<00:04:15.880> having<00:04:16.880> the<00:04:17.030> being<00:04:17.570> so<00:04:17.810> close

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
be heated or having the being so close

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.319 
be heated or having the being so close
to<00:04:18.139> the<00:04:18.469> heat<00:04:18.650> yeah<00:04:19.039> that's<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.519> idea<00:04:19.549> in<00:04:20.029> that

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
to the heat yeah that's the idea in that

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.480 
to the heat yeah that's the idea in that
now<00:04:20.599> when<00:04:20.779> you<00:04:20.810> open<00:04:20.870> one<00:04:21.349> of<00:04:21.469> these<00:04:21.560> up

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
now when you open one of these up

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.580 
now when you open one of these up
the<00:04:23.330> thing<00:04:23.509> I<00:04:23.600> noticed<00:04:23.900> right<00:04:23.930> away<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.320> just

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
the thing I noticed right away is just

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.890 
the thing I noticed right away is just
how<00:04:25.100> logically<00:04:25.699> it's<00:04:25.910> laid<00:04:26.120> out<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.660> amount

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
how logically it's laid out the amount

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.040 
how logically it's laid out the amount
of<00:04:26.960> space<00:04:27.289> it's<00:04:27.620> in<00:04:27.800> there<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.690> mean<00:04:29.690> like<00:04:29.900> the

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
of space it's in there I mean like the

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.230 
of space it's in there I mean like the
jakar<00:04:30.680> boxes<00:04:31.639> yeah

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
jakar boxes yeah

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.719 
jakar boxes yeah
if<00:04:32.630> tell<00:04:32.930> me<00:04:33.020> about<00:04:33.139> why<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.530> located<00:04:34.220> those

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
if tell me about why you located those

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:36.580 
if tell me about why you located those
where<00:04:35.090> they<00:04:35.270> are<00:04:35.449> within<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:35.960> machine<00:04:36.259> to

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
where they are within the machine to

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.529 
where they are within the machine to
protect<00:04:36.979> him<00:04:37.160> away<00:04:37.490> from<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:37.820> boiler<00:04:38.120> like<00:04:38.389> we

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 
protect him away from the boiler like we

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.390 
protect him away from the boiler like we
have<00:04:38.660> a<00:04:38.690> special<00:04:38.900> sheet<00:04:39.289> and<00:04:39.860> they<00:04:40.100> are<00:04:40.190> placed

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
like to build machines like also from

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.550 
like to build machines like also from
the<00:04:55.699> internal<00:04:56.150> parts<00:04:56.389> looking<00:04:56.720> nice<00:04:56.930> not<00:04:57.289> only

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
I mean really one of the easiest

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.350 
I mean really one of the easiest
machines<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.680> would<00:05:03.860> think<00:05:04.039> to<00:05:04.160> work<00:05:04.280> on<00:05:04.550> that

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
machines I would think to work on that

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.939 
machines I would think to work on that
I've<00:05:05.479> seen<00:05:05.750> everything<00:05:06.080> is<00:05:06.169> very<00:05:06.349> logical<00:05:06.590> and

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
I've seen everything is very logical and

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.990 
I've seen everything is very logical and
in<00:05:07.160> its<00:05:07.310> place<00:05:07.900> all<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:09.139> internal<00:05:09.560> plumbing

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
in its place all the internal plumbing

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.640 
in its place all the internal plumbing

machine now and you've even done

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.670 
machine now and you've even done
something<00:05:17.570> there<00:05:17.750> to<00:05:17.930> make<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.169> Machine<00:05:18.470> more

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
something there to make the Machine more

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.499 
something there to make the Machine more
reliable<00:05:19.220> what<00:05:19.400> tell<00:05:19.580> me<00:05:19.669> about<00:05:19.759> that<00:05:19.970> yeah<00:05:20.270> if

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:20.509 
reliable what tell me about that yeah if

00:05:20.509 --> 00:05:23.080 
reliable what tell me about that yeah if
you<00:05:20.690> want<00:05:20.870> to<00:05:20.960> decide<00:05:21.199> to<00:05:21.639> use<00:05:22.639> the<00:05:22.789> machine<00:05:23.000> as

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
you want to decide to use the machine as

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.649 
you want to decide to use the machine as
a<00:05:23.180> direct<00:05:23.479> water<00:05:23.660> you<00:05:24.199> have<00:05:24.410> to<00:05:25.009> switch<00:05:25.190> it<00:05:25.220> to

00:05:25.649 --> 00:05:25.659 
a direct water you have to switch it to

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.420 
a direct water you have to switch it to
to<00:05:26.659> turn<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:26.990> valve<00:05:27.169> and<00:05:27.409> it's<00:05:27.830> a<00:05:27.979> manual<00:05:28.220> of

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
to turn the valve and it's a manual of

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.640 
to turn the valve and it's a manual of
instead<00:05:28.849> of<00:05:28.880> using<00:05:29.389> two<00:05:29.840> solenoid<00:05:30.260> valves<00:05:30.500> to

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
instead of using two solenoid valves to

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.379 
instead of using two solenoid valves to
make<00:05:30.680> the<00:05:30.979> other<00:05:31.130> direction<00:05:31.460> and<00:05:31.760> you<00:05:32.180> think

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:32.389 
make the other direction and you think

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:35.170 
make the other direction and you think
it's<00:05:32.510> the<00:05:32.570> better<00:05:32.750> system<00:05:33.229> in<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.940> long<00:05:35.150> run

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.180 
it's the better system in the long run

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.029 
it's the better system in the long run
because<00:05:35.720> what<00:05:36.080> happens<00:05:36.409> on<00:05:36.590> a<00:05:36.620> solenoid<00:05:36.919> valve

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:37.039 
because what happens on a solenoid valve

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:40.089 
because what happens on a solenoid valve
on<00:05:37.400> scale<00:05:38.090> or<00:05:38.360> other<00:05:39.050> particles<00:05:39.770> which<00:05:39.889> are<00:05:40.039> in

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:40.099 
on scale or other particles which are in

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.089 
on scale or other particles which are in
the<00:05:40.250> water<00:05:40.400> will<00:05:41.150> once<00:05:41.449> and<00:05:42.260> causing<00:05:42.710> problems

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:43.099 
the water will once and causing problems

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:45.430 
the water will once and causing problems
yeah<00:05:43.760> and<00:05:43.970> that's<00:05:44.300> manual<00:05:44.720> you<00:05:44.930> open<00:05:45.260> and

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
yeah and that's manual you open and

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.350 
yeah and that's manual you open and
close<00:05:45.620> it<00:05:45.800> right<00:05:46.310> and<00:05:46.460> that's<00:05:46.669> that's<00:05:47.000> it

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
close it right and that's that's it

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.360 
close it right and that's that's it
yeah<00:05:47.599> so<00:05:48.080> a<00:05:48.110> couple<00:05:48.560> less<00:05:48.770> points<00:05:49.130> of<00:05:49.250> failure

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
yeah so a couple less points of failure

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.089 
yeah so a couple less points of failure
by<00:05:49.699> using<00:05:49.909> that<00:05:50.150> manual<00:05:50.599> valve<00:05:51.169> there<00:05:51.500> yeah

00:05:52.089 --> 00:05:52.099 
by using that manual valve there yeah

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:54.399 
by using that manual valve there yeah
and<00:05:52.190> now<00:05:52.430> up<00:05:52.699> front<00:05:53.300> you've<00:05:53.630> got<00:05:53.840> there's

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:54.409 
and now up front you've got there's

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:56.710 
and now up front you've got there's
couple<00:05:54.590> rocker<00:05:54.860> switches<00:05:55.250> behind<00:05:55.699> the<00:05:55.909> drip

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:56.720 
couple rocker switches behind the drip

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.540 
couple rocker switches behind the drip
tray<00:05:56.900> one<00:05:57.349> you<00:05:57.590> can<00:05:57.740> turn<00:05:57.889> off<00:05:58.099> the<00:05:58.340> steam

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
tray one you can turn off the steam

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.060 
tray one you can turn off the steam
boiler<00:05:58.789> e/m<00:05:59.449> completely<00:06:00.080> and<00:06:00.740> then<00:06:00.830> the<00:06:00.949> other

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
boiler e/m completely and then the other

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.200 
boiler e/m completely and then the other
one<00:06:01.250> is<00:06:01.370> just<00:06:01.400> to<00:06:01.669> turn<00:06:01.849> off<00:06:02.030> the<00:06:02.180> water

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
one is just to turn off the water

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.399 
one is just to turn off the water
sensing<00:06:02.960> in<00:06:03.080> me

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:03.409 
sensing in me

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:04.839 
sensing in me
yeah<00:06:03.560> reservoir<00:06:04.039> it's<00:06:04.220> only<00:06:04.340> for<00:06:04.550> the<00:06:04.610> floater

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
yeah reservoir it's only for the floater

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.700 
yeah reservoir it's only for the floater
which<00:06:05.060> is<00:06:05.240> inside<00:06:05.539> of<00:06:05.690> also<00:06:05.900> water<00:06:06.289> reservoir

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
which is inside of also water reservoir

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.790 
which is inside of also water reservoir
you<00:06:07.070> have<00:06:07.220> to<00:06:07.370> yeah<00:06:08.360> switch<00:06:08.630> it<00:06:08.780> off<00:06:08.900> if<00:06:09.530> you

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
you have to yeah switch it off if you

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.749 
you have to yeah switch it off if you
use<00:06:09.830> the<00:06:10.039> diet<00:06:10.220> water

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 
use the diet water

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:13.270 
use the diet water
yeah<00:06:11.570> and<00:06:11.810> the<00:06:12.229> short<00:06:12.409> count<00:06:12.620> of<00:06:12.770> what<00:06:12.860> is<00:06:12.979> also

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
yeah and the short count of what is also

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.860 
yeah and the short count of what is also
nice<00:06:13.520> on<00:06:13.699> the<00:06:13.789> machine<00:06:14.060> yes

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
nice on the machine yes

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.560 
nice on the machine yes
like<00:06:15.199> if<00:06:15.830> you<00:06:15.949> prepare<00:06:16.280> the<00:06:16.400> coffee<00:06:16.610> here<00:06:17.360> you

you notice is just I mean just from from

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.080 
you notice is just I mean just from from
the<00:06:24.440> base<00:06:24.650> I<00:06:24.919> mean<00:06:25.099> a<00:06:25.130> lot<00:06:25.340> of<00:06:25.370> a<00:06:25.699> lot<00:06:25.909> of<00:06:25.970> other

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
the base I mean a lot of a lot of other

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.060 
the base I mean a lot of a lot of other
manufacturers<00:06:26.539> a<00:06:26.810> weld<00:06:27.169> on<00:06:27.349> that<00:06:27.650> drip<00:06:27.860> tray

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
manufacturers a weld on that drip tray

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:30.370 
manufacturers a weld on that drip tray
support<00:06:28.550> you've<00:06:28.699> got<00:06:28.849> one<00:06:29.120> solid<00:06:29.750> rail<00:06:29.960> front

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:30.380 
support you've got one solid rail front

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.080 
support you've got one solid rail front
to<00:06:30.529> back<00:06:30.680> on<00:06:30.889> the<00:06:31.010> machine<00:06:31.099> to<00:06:31.849> make<00:06:32.000> the

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
to back on the machine to make the

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.800 
to back on the machine to make the
machine<00:06:32.330> solid<00:06:32.659> right<00:06:33.260> also<00:06:33.740> what<00:06:34.039> I<00:06:34.340> like<00:06:34.669> is

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:35.810 
machine solid right also what I like is

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.450 
machine solid right also what I like is
if<00:06:35.960> you<00:06:36.110> install<00:06:36.500> the<00:06:36.590> port<00:06:36.770> of<00:06:36.830> it<00:06:36.980> that<00:06:37.130> you

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460 
if you install the port of it that you

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.000 
if you install the port of it that you
don't<00:06:37.700> have<00:06:37.910> a<00:06:38.180> lot<00:06:39.050> of<00:06:39.200> movement<00:06:39.590> of<00:06:39.860> the

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
don't have a lot of movement of the

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.010 
don't have a lot of movement of the
complete<00:06:40.460> machine<00:06:40.630> because<00:06:41.630> that<00:06:41.840> it's

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
complete machine because that it's

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.350 
complete machine because that it's
something<00:06:42.410> which<00:06:42.680> is<00:06:42.860> also<00:06:43.070> it<00:06:44.030> need<00:06:44.180> to<00:06:44.270> be

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
something which is also it need to be

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.970 
something which is also it need to be
built<00:06:44.690> solid<00:06:45.050> to<00:06:45.350> last<00:06:45.530> longer

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:45.980 
built solid to last longer

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.940 
built solid to last longer
yeah<00:06:46.220> right<00:06:46.730> right<00:06:47.020> and<00:06:48.020> anything<00:06:48.620> else<00:06:48.800> about

yeah right right and anything else about

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.770 
yeah right right and anything else about
the<00:06:49.220> machine<00:06:49.550> that<00:06:50.000> people<00:06:50.300> should<00:06:50.540> know<00:06:50.750> that

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
the machine that people should know that

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.320 
the machine that people should know that
what<00:06:51.770> we<00:06:51.919> have<00:06:52.070> changed<00:06:52.430> on<00:06:52.550> the<00:06:52.610> pro<00:06:52.760> 700
