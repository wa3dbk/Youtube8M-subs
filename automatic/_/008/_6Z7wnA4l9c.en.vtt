00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:08.839 

we're<00:00:07.649> going<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.980> get<00:00:08.099> into<00:00:08.340> a<00:00:08.370> new<00:00:08.580> type<00:00:08.820> of

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
we're going to get into a new type of

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.610 
we're going to get into a new type of
game<00:00:09.269> which<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> top-down<00:00:10.320> action

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
game which is the top-down action

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.280 
game which is the top-down action
adventure<00:00:11.340> puzzle<00:00:11.730> game<00:00:12.059> like<00:00:12.360> Zelda<00:00:12.809> but

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
adventure puzzle game like Zelda but

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.930 
adventure puzzle game like Zelda but
those<00:00:13.440> can<00:00:13.620> be<00:00:13.650> kind<00:00:13.950> of<00:00:14.040> complicated<00:00:14.670> so

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
those can be kind of complicated so

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.519 
those can be kind of complicated so
we're<00:00:15.120> going<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.509> learn<00:00:15.660> some<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.170> basic

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
we're going to learn some of the basic

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.740 
we're going to learn some of the basic
concepts<00:00:17.220> through<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> few<00:00:17.789> other<00:00:17.940> games<00:00:18.210> first

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
concepts through a few other games first

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.260 
concepts through a few other games first
and<00:00:19.020> ease<00:00:19.500> ourselves<00:00:19.980> into<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.880> first<00:00:21.090> one

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
and ease ourselves into it the first one

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.599 
and ease ourselves into it the first one
we're<00:00:21.480> going<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.779> make<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.170> Sokoban<00:00:22.890> which<00:00:23.369> if

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
we're going to make is Sokoban which if

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.910 
we're going to make is Sokoban which if
you're<00:00:23.789> unfamiliar<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:25.050> puzzle<00:00:25.470> game<00:00:25.619> where

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
you're unfamiliar is a puzzle game where

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.679 
you're unfamiliar is a puzzle game where
you<00:00:26.039> push<00:00:26.279> boxes<00:00:26.789> around<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.300> try<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.599> get

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
you push boxes around and try and get

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.320 
you push boxes around and try and get
them<00:00:27.900> into<00:00:28.289> their<00:00:28.439> proper<00:00:28.980> places<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:30.090> over

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
them into their proper places so over

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.970 
them into their proper places so over
here<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.630> assets<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.320> created<00:00:31.590> a

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
here in the assets I have created a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.299 
here in the assets I have created a
sprite<00:00:32.369> player<00:00:32.669> which<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.660> 32<00:00:34.350> by<00:00:34.680> 32<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
sprite player which is 32 by 32 and the

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.889 
sprite player which is 32 by 32 and the
origin<00:00:35.640> point<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:36.090> at<00:00:36.300> 0<00:00:36.540> 0<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:37.550> has<00:00:38.899> 4

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
origin point is at 0 0 it has 4

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.680 
origin point is at 0 0 it has 4
different<00:00:40.170> sub<00:00:40.620> images<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.570> with<00:00:42.570> as

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
different sub images in it with as

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.770 
different sub images in it with as
little<00:00:42.809> bulldozer<00:00:43.290> pointing<00:00:44.010> down<00:00:44.309> up<00:00:44.780> left

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
little bulldozer pointing down up left

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.229 
little bulldozer pointing down up left
and<00:00:45.960> right<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:47.370> order<00:00:47.700> is<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.090> be

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
and right and this order is going to be

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.940 
and right and this order is going to be
important<00:00:48.809> because<00:00:48.989> we<00:00:49.289> need<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> keep<00:00:49.649> track

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
important because we need to keep track

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.740 
important because we need to keep track
of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.370> sub<00:00:50.940> images<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:53.420> then<00:00:54.420> I've<00:00:54.570> also

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
of the sub images and then I've also

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.410 
of the sub images and then I've also
created<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.620> sprite<00:00:56.100> wall<00:00:56.430> which<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
created a sprite wall which is just the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.650 
created a sprite wall which is just the
32<00:00:57.870> by<00:00:58.020> 32<00:00:58.410> block<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.250> some<00:00:59.609> color<00:00:59.969> we're<00:01:00.510> not

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
32 by 32 block of some color we're not

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.450 
32 by 32 block of some color we're not
going<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.350> wall<00:01:01.649> so<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> doesn't

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
going to see this wall so it doesn't

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
going to see this wall so it doesn't
really<00:01:02.520> matter<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> origin<00:01:04.260> point<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.619> at

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
really matter but the origin point is at

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.450 
really matter but the origin point is at
0<00:01:05.010> 0<00:01:05.100> I've<00:01:06.049> also<00:01:07.049> created<00:01:07.350> objects<00:01:08.159> from<00:01:08.250> them

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
0 0 I've also created objects from them

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.760 
0 0 I've also created objects from them
an<00:01:08.640> object<00:01:08.820> player<00:01:09.360> which<00:01:10.080> is<00:01:10.229> visible<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
an object player which is visible and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.080 
an object player which is visible and
solid<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.869> object<00:01:13.229> wall<00:01:13.470> which<00:01:14.220> for

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
solid and the object wall which for

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.730 
solid and the object wall which for
right<00:01:15.240> now<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:16.170> visible<00:01:16.560> will

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
right now is going to be visible will

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.100 
right now is going to be visible will
turn<00:01:16.950> this<00:01:17.100> off<00:01:17.280> later<00:01:17.640> but<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.540> also<00:01:18.810> solid

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
turn this off later but it's also solid

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.149 
turn this off later but it's also solid
and<00:01:20.150> then<00:01:21.150> I've<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.509> created<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:22.140> room<00:01:22.590> called

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and then I've just created a room called

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.880 
and then I've just created a room called
room<00:01:23.369> level<00:01:23.610> 1<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.930> let's<00:01:25.110> start<00:01:25.409> by<00:01:25.680> adding

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
room level 1 so let's start by adding

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.620 
room level 1 so let's start by adding
the<00:01:26.159> movement<00:01:26.670> actions<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.360> player<00:01:27.600> so

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the movement actions to the player so

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.200 
the movement actions to the player so
open<00:01:28.200> object<00:01:28.409> player<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:31.790> the<00:01:32.790> first<00:01:33.030> thing

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
open object player and the first thing

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.719 
open object player and the first thing
we<00:01:33.329> need<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.020> establish<00:01:34.380> its<00:01:35.040> initial

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
we need to do is establish its initial

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.390 
we need to do is establish its initial
sprite<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.930> 4<00:01:37.259> sub<00:01:37.590> images<00:01:38.070> in<00:01:38.220> our

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
sprite we have 4 sub images in our

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.039 
sprite we have 4 sub images in our
sprite<00:01:38.820> player<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
sprite player so it's just going to

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.260 
sprite player so it's just going to
cycle<00:01:40.259> through<00:01:40.439> them<00:01:40.860> unless<00:01:41.700> we<00:01:41.820> tell<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.240> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
cycle through them unless we tell it to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.620 
cycle through them unless we tell it to
stop<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.439> let's<00:01:43.619> add<00:01:43.770> an<00:01:43.920> event<00:01:44.009> create<00:01:44.880> come

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
stop so let's add an event create come

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.580 
stop so let's add an event create come
over<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.990> main<00:01:46.229> one<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.850> change<00:01:47.850> sprite<00:01:48.590> we

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
over to main one and change sprite we

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.830 
over to main one and change sprite we
will<00:01:49.740> set<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> sprite<00:01:50.310> to<00:01:50.520> sprite<00:01:50.939> player<00:01:51.210> sub

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
will set the sprite to sprite player sub

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.859 
will set the sprite to sprite player sub
image<00:01:52.140> 0<00:01:52.439> speed<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.460> 0<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.720> default

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
image 0 speed of 0 so the default

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.370 
image 0 speed of 0 so the default
setting<00:01:55.470> will<00:01:55.649> be<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.219> down<00:01:56.520> position<00:01:57.380> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
setting will be in the down position and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.929 
setting will be in the down position and
before<00:01:58.710> we<00:01:58.829> start<00:01:58.890> adding<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.520> movement

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
before we start adding the movement

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.700 
before we start adding the movement
actions<00:02:00.420> we<00:02:00.540> need<00:02:00.570> to<00:02:00.750> consider<00:02:01.200> how<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.439> game

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
actions we need to consider how the game

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.310 
actions we need to consider how the game
will<00:02:01.860> work<00:02:02.149> Sokoban<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.390> basically<00:02:03.810> a<00:02:03.930> maze

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
will work Sokoban is basically a maze

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.870 
will work Sokoban is basically a maze
game<00:02:04.710> where<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.070> have<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.280> precisely

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
game where you have to precisely

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.029 
game where you have to precisely
navigate<00:02:06.689> your<00:02:06.840> way<00:02:07.110> through<00:02:07.649> various

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
navigate your way through various

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.100 
navigate your way through various
passages<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.479> means<00:02:09.690> we're<00:02:09.869> going<00:02:10.020> to

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
passages so that means we're going to

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.290 
passages so that means we're going to
have<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.440> line<00:02:10.679> our<00:02:10.890> player<00:02:11.340> up<00:02:11.640> precisely

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
have to line our player up precisely

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.340 
have to line our player up precisely
because<00:02:12.989> we

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
because we

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.990 
because we
want<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.680> player<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.890> have<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.310> struggle<00:02:14.610> with

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
want the player to have to struggle with

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.750 
want the player to have to struggle with
moving<00:02:15.600> themselves<00:02:15.860> pixel-perfect<00:02:16.860> that'll

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
moving themselves pixel-perfect that'll

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.520 
moving themselves pixel-perfect that'll
just<00:02:17.940> create<00:02:18.240> frustration<00:02:18.570> and<00:02:19.170> no<00:02:19.260> one<00:02:19.410> will

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
just create frustration and no one will

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.380 
just create frustration and no one will
want<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.800> play<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.070> game<00:02:20.280> fortunately<00:02:21.240> it's

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
want to play the game fortunately it's

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.690 
want to play the game fortunately it's
very<00:02:21.630> simple<00:02:22.110> we'll<00:02:22.320> just<00:02:22.500> have<00:02:22.710> object<00:02:23.400> snap

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
very simple we'll just have object snap

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.630 
very simple we'll just have object snap
itself<00:02:24.210> to<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.750> grid<00:02:24.960> in<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.200> room<00:02:25.500> so<00:02:26.490> let's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
itself to the grid in the room so let's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.750 
itself to the grid in the room so let's
add<00:02:26.820> an<00:02:26.970> event<00:02:27.350> keyboard<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.560> we'll<00:02:29.490> start

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
add an event keyboard and we'll start

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.150 
add an event keyboard and we'll start
with<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.150> down<00:02:30.510> key<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.410> first<00:02:31.650> action<00:02:32.040> we

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
with the down key the first action we

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.270 
with the down key the first action we
need<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.340> set<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.850> another<00:02:33.240> change<00:02:33.600> sprite

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
need to set is another change sprite

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.220 
need to set is another change sprite
change<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.460> into<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.120> sprite<00:02:36.360> player<00:02:36.660> sub

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
change it into the sprite player sub

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.840 
change it into the sprite player sub
image<00:02:37.500> 0<00:02:37.800> speed<00:02:38.430> of<00:02:38.580> 0<00:02:40.310> so<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.400> get<00:02:41.520> the<00:02:41.640> player

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
image 0 speed of 0 so to get the player

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.730 
image 0 speed of 0 so to get the player
to<00:02:42.030> snap<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.570> grid<00:02:42.600> we<00:02:43.170> could<00:02:43.320> just<00:02:43.470> use

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
to snap to the grid we could just use

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.620 
to snap to the grid we could just use
our<00:02:43.950> jump<00:02:44.370> to<00:02:44.520> position<00:02:45.380> movement<00:02:46.380> action<00:02:46.590> and

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
our jump to position movement action and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.170 
our jump to position movement action and
bring<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.750> player<00:02:48.960> down<00:02:49.320> 32<00:02:50.010> pixels<00:02:50.250> some

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
bring the player down 32 pixels some

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.080 
bring the player down 32 pixels some
Sokoban<00:02:51.720> games<00:02:52.020> do<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:53.010> 32<00:02:53.370> pixels<00:02:53.730> is

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
Sokoban games do that but 32 pixels is

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.940 
Sokoban games do that but 32 pixels is
actually<00:02:54.450> quite<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> lot<00:02:54.990> the<00:02:55.440> jump<00:02:55.740> is<00:02:55.890> going

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
actually quite a lot the jump is going

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.580 
actually quite a lot the jump is going
to<00:02:56.220> be<00:02:56.310> very<00:02:56.580> noticeable<00:02:57.240> since<00:02:57.870> my<00:02:58.050> player<00:02:58.350> is

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
to be very noticeable since my player is

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.680 
to be very noticeable since my player is
a<00:02:58.620> bulldozer<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.550> would<00:03:00.090> like<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.420> have<00:03:00.660> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
a bulldozer I would like it to have a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.260 
a bulldozer I would like it to have a
smooth<00:03:01.170> movement<00:03:01.770> down<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.220> screen<00:03:02.520> so

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
smooth movement down the screen so

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.030 
smooth movement down the screen so
instead<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.630> using<00:03:03.870> jump<00:03:04.290> to<00:03:04.410> position<00:03:04.860> I'm

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
instead of using jump to position I'm

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.760 
instead of using jump to position I'm
going<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.400> come<00:03:05.550> up<00:03:05.670> here<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.910> move<00:03:06.360> fixed<00:03:06.960> drag

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
going to come up here to move fixed drag

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.980 
going to come up here to move fixed drag
that<00:03:07.920> down<00:03:07.980> I'm<00:03:08.910> going<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.480> set<00:03:09.630> it<00:03:09.720> in<00:03:09.810> the

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
that down I'm going to set it in the

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.220 
that down I'm going to set it in the
down<00:03:10.200> direction<00:03:10.260> at<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> speed<00:03:11.250> of<00:03:11.280> 4<00:03:12.020> in<00:03:13.020> this

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
down direction at a speed of 4 in this

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.960 
down direction at a speed of 4 in this
case<00:03:13.500> we'll<00:03:13.740> have<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.070> do<00:03:14.190> something<00:03:14.580> else<00:03:14.730> to

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
case we'll have to do something else to

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.720 
case we'll have to do something else to
keep<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.510> object<00:03:15.900> aligned<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.920> grid<00:03:17.130> so

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
keep the object aligned to the grid so

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.370 
keep the object aligned to the grid so
we're<00:03:17.880> only<00:03:18.030> going<00:03:18.300> to<00:03:18.360> allow<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:19.110> player<00:03:19.350> to

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
we're only going to allow the player to

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.800 
we're only going to allow the player to
move<00:03:19.800> if<00:03:20.130> it's<00:03:20.580> already<00:03:20.910> in<00:03:21.180> alignment<00:03:21.480> and

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
move if it's already in alignment and

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.350 
move if it's already in alignment and
the<00:03:22.320> way<00:03:22.440> we<00:03:22.620> check<00:03:23.070> for<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.430> is<00:03:23.700> over<00:03:23.910> in<00:03:24.240> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
the way we check for that is over in the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.630 
the way we check for that is over in the
control<00:03:24.810> tab<00:03:25.050> up<00:03:25.560> in<00:03:25.800> our<00:03:25.920> questions<00:03:26.400> and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
control tab up in our questions and

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.950 
control tab up in our questions and
we're<00:03:26.970> looking<00:03:27.240> here<00:03:27.390> in<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.510> bottom<00:03:27.660> right

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:27.960 
we're looking here in the bottom right

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.470 
we're looking here in the bottom right
check<00:03:28.320> grid<00:03:28.710> drag<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.610> above<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.150> move

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
check grid drag that above the move

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.200 
check grid drag that above the move
fixed<00:03:30.990> and<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.920> need<00:03:32.100> to<00:03:32.250> set<00:03:32.460> this<00:03:32.640> to<00:03:32.970> our

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
fixed and we need to set this to our

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.980 
fixed and we need to set this to our
grid<00:03:33.570> now<00:03:34.200> my<00:03:34.350> room<00:03:34.590> is<00:03:34.770> 640<00:03:35.310> by<00:03:35.430> 480<00:03:35.960> with<00:03:36.960> a

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:36.990 
grid now my room is 640 by 480 with a

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.980 
grid now my room is 640 by 480 with a
grid<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.410> 32<00:03:37.950> like<00:03:38.550> I<00:03:38.670> normally<00:03:38.760> do<00:03:39.240> so<00:03:39.450> we<00:03:39.870> want

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
grid of 32 like I normally do so we want

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.200 
grid of 32 like I normally do so we want
the<00:03:40.200> snap<00:03:40.500> horizontal<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.310> snap<00:03:41.520> vertical<00:03:42.030> to

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:42.210 
the snap horizontal and snap vertical to

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.180 
the snap horizontal and snap vertical to
match<00:03:42.390> that<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.230> we'll<00:03:43.350> change<00:03:43.590> from<00:03:43.890> 16<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.610> 32

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
match that so we'll change from 16 to 32

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.470 
match that so we'll change from 16 to 32
so<00:03:47.190> now<00:03:47.400> we're<00:03:47.580> only<00:03:47.700> going<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.060> get<00:03:48.240> this

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
so now we're only going to get this

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.630 
so now we're only going to get this
movement<00:03:49.140> if<00:03:49.320> we're<00:03:49.740> already<00:03:49.890> aligned<00:03:50.430> to<00:03:50.550> the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
movement if we're already aligned to the

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.700 
movement if we're already aligned to the
grid<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.030> what<00:03:51.510> that's<00:03:51.810> going<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.170> do<00:03:52.410> is

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:52.710 
grid and what that's going to do is

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.160 
grid and what that's going to do is
basically<00:03:53.220> keep<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:54.000> object<00:03:54.120> aligned<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.080> the

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
basically keep the object aligned to the

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.170 
basically keep the object aligned to the
grid<00:03:55.410> because<00:03:55.920> as<00:03:56.040> soon<00:03:56.220> as<00:03:56.370> it<00:03:56.490> matches<00:03:56.790> up

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
grid because as soon as it matches up

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.350 
grid because as soon as it matches up
and<00:03:57.420> it<00:03:58.050> will<00:03:58.230> run<00:03:58.440> this<00:03:58.620> check<00:03:58.890> again<00:03:59.240> so<00:04:00.240> now

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
and it will run this check again so now

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.360 
and it will run this check again so now
let's<00:04:00.570> go<00:04:00.720> ahead<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.140> duplicate<00:04:01.680> this<00:04:01.950> for

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
let's go ahead and duplicate this for

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.260 
let's go ahead and duplicate this for
the<00:04:02.790> other<00:04:02.940> keys<00:04:03.330> with<00:04:04.110> this<00:04:04.200> duplicate<00:04:04.710> event

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
the other keys with this duplicate event

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.360 
the other keys with this duplicate event
keyboard<00:04:06.270> up<00:04:08.480> duplicate<00:04:09.480> event<00:04:10.370> keyboard

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
keyboard up duplicate event keyboard

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.530 
keyboard up duplicate event keyboard
left<00:04:12.260> duplicate<00:04:13.260> event<00:04:13.700> keyboard<00:04:14.700> right<00:04:15.270> and

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
left duplicate event keyboard right and

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.270 
left duplicate event keyboard right and
now<00:04:15.750> we<00:04:15.810> have<00:04:15.990> to<00:04:16.080> go<00:04:16.170> in<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.590> change<00:04:16.980> a<00:04:17.250> few

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
now we have to go in and change a few

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.760 
now we have to go in and change a few
things<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:18.780> starting<00:04:19.260> with<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.470> keyboard

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
things so starting with the keyboard

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.770 
things so starting with the keyboard
right<00:04:20.070> we'll<00:04:20.580> come<00:04:20.760> to<00:04:20.970> our<00:04:21.090> change<00:04:21.390> sprite

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
right we'll come to our change sprite

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.400 
right we'll come to our change sprite
and<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:23.400> sub<00:04:23.669> image<00:04:23.820> we<00:04:24.150> want<00:04:24.360> will<00:04:24.870> be<00:04:24.990> three

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
and the sub image we want will be three

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.820 
and the sub image we want will be three
because<00:04:25.979> that's<00:04:26.160> the

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
because that's the

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.149 
because that's the
point<00:04:27.039> in<00:04:27.099> the<00:04:27.189> sequence<00:04:27.580> we<00:04:28.800> also<00:04:29.800> need<00:04:30.069> to

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:30.159 
point in the sequence we also need to

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:34.040 
point in the sequence we also need to
change<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.610> direction<00:04:30.810> from<00:04:31.810> down<00:04:32.259> to<00:04:32.680> right

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
change the direction from down to right

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.129 
change the direction from down to right
come<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.199> our<00:04:35.349> up<00:04:35.969> change<00:04:36.969> the<00:04:37.210> sprite<00:04:37.539> into

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
come to our up change the sprite into

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.689 
come to our up change the sprite into
sub<00:04:38.379> image<00:04:38.710> one<00:04:39.009> and<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:41.050> direction<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:42.520> up

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
sub image one and the direction to up

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.559 
sub image one and the direction to up
and<00:04:43.199> then<00:04:44.199> finally<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.919> left<00:04:45.129> one

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
and then finally the left one

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:52.080 
and then finally the left one
change<00:04:46.569> this<00:04:46.810> to<00:04:47.819> sub<00:04:48.819> image<00:04:49.210> two<00:04:49.599> and<00:04:51.090> change

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
change this to sub image two and change

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.499 
change this to sub image two and change
the<00:04:52.300> direction<00:04:52.509> to<00:04:53.409> the<00:04:53.439> left<00:04:54.330> now<00:04:55.330> there's

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
the direction to the left now there's

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:56.969 
the direction to the left now there's
something<00:04:55.659> else<00:04:55.870> we<00:04:56.080> have<00:04:56.199> to<00:04:56.319> account<00:04:56.620> for

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
something else we have to account for

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:00.540 
something else we have to account for
when<00:04:57.969> we<00:04:58.090> do<00:04:58.240> a<00:04:58.270> move<00:04:58.659> fixed<00:04:59.289> it's<00:04:59.860> giving<00:05:00.280> the

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
when we do a move fixed it's giving the

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.820 
when we do a move fixed it's giving the
object<00:05:00.969> a<00:05:01.090> constant<00:05:01.629> speed<00:05:01.780> which<00:05:02.379> means<00:05:02.590> it's

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
object a constant speed which means it's

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.990 
object a constant speed which means it's
just<00:05:02.889> going<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.310> keep<00:05:03.460> going<00:05:03.669> in<00:05:03.909> that

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
just going to keep going in that

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.969 
just going to keep going in that
direction<00:05:04.060> until<00:05:04.719> we<00:05:05.050> change<00:05:05.259> it<00:05:05.500> or<00:05:05.680> stop<00:05:05.949> it

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
direction until we change it or stop it

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:08.430 
direction until we change it or stop it
so<00:05:06.879> what<00:05:07.090> we<00:05:07.210> could<00:05:07.389> do<00:05:07.629> is<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:07.870> could<00:05:08.050> come<00:05:08.289> to

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
so what we could do is we could come to

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.670 
so what we could do is we could come to
add<00:05:08.620> event<00:05:09.009> key<00:05:09.849> release<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:10.599> go<00:05:11.349> through<00:05:11.650> all

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
add event key release and go through all

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.869 
add event key release and go through all
of<00:05:11.889> these<00:05:12.190> keys

00:05:12.869 --> 00:05:12.879 
of these keys

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.640 
of these keys
so<00:05:13.150> that<00:05:13.360> when<00:05:13.509> we<00:05:13.539> release<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.050> key<00:05:14.349> we<00:05:14.530> could

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
so that when we release the key we could

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.159 
so that when we release the key we could
then<00:05:14.770> set<00:05:15.069> the<00:05:15.219> movement<00:05:15.669> to<00:05:16.000> stop<00:05:16.599> speed<00:05:17.050> of

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
then set the movement to stop speed of

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:19.080 
then set the movement to stop speed of
zero<00:05:17.409> but<00:05:17.919> that<00:05:17.949> adds<00:05:18.250> a<00:05:18.490> lot<00:05:18.639> of<00:05:18.699> unnecessary

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
zero but that adds a lot of unnecessary

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.850 
zero but that adds a lot of unnecessary
events<00:05:19.930> there's<00:05:20.110> an<00:05:20.199> easier<00:05:20.500> way<00:05:20.680> of<00:05:20.710> doing

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
events there's an easier way of doing

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.219 
events there's an easier way of doing
this<00:05:21.219> and<00:05:21.430> that<00:05:21.539> is<00:05:22.539> going<00:05:22.629> to<00:05:22.840> be<00:05:22.960> in<00:05:23.110> the

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
this and that is going to be in the

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.959 
this and that is going to be in the
keyboard<00:05:23.770> event<00:05:24.069> all<00:05:24.250> the<00:05:24.310> way<00:05:24.580> down<00:05:24.759> at<00:05:24.909> the

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:24.969 
keyboard event all the way down at the

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:28.350 
keyboard event all the way down at the
bottom<00:05:25.180> no<00:05:25.870> key<00:05:26.229> so<00:05:27.099> the<00:05:27.250> actions<00:05:27.669> in<00:05:27.819> here<00:05:28.180> are

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
bottom no key so the actions in here are

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.390 
bottom no key so the actions in here are
going<00:05:28.569> to<00:05:28.659> trigger<00:05:28.990> whenever<00:05:29.379> no<00:05:29.860> key<00:05:30.189> is

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
going to trigger whenever no key is

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.580 
going to trigger whenever no key is
being<00:05:30.610> pressed<00:05:30.840> so<00:05:31.840> we'll<00:05:32.020> add<00:05:32.169> our<00:05:32.199> move

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
being pressed so we'll add our move

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.619 
being pressed so we'll add our move
fixed<00:05:33.129> in<00:05:33.279> here<00:05:33.639> but<00:05:33.819> first<00:05:34.029> we<00:05:34.270> need<00:05:34.389> to<00:05:34.509> make

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 
fixed in here but first we need to make

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:35.969 
fixed in here but first we need to make
sure<00:05:34.690> that<00:05:34.990> we're<00:05:35.139> lined<00:05:35.349> up<00:05:35.529> with<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.770> grid

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
sure that we're lined up with the grid

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:37.469 
sure that we're lined up with the grid
so<00:05:36.219> that<00:05:36.340> we<00:05:36.430> don't<00:05:36.520> just<00:05:36.819> stop<00:05:37.120> in<00:05:37.330> between

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
so that we don't just stop in between

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.200 
so that we don't just stop in between
grid<00:05:37.990> lines<00:05:38.229> so<00:05:39.159> we'll<00:05:39.310> come<00:05:39.460> over<00:05:39.580> here<00:05:39.879> to

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
grid lines so we'll come over here to

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.180 
grid lines so we'll come over here to
our<00:05:40.360> check<00:05:40.840> grid<00:05:41.279> change<00:05:42.279> this<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.639> 32<00:05:43.089> by<00:05:43.300> 32

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
our check grid change this to 32 by 32

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.089 
our check grid change this to 32 by 32
come<00:05:45.190> to<00:05:45.339> move<00:05:45.550> move<00:05:46.120> fixed<00:05:46.629> select<00:05:47.589> the<00:05:47.740> stop

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
come to move move fixed select the stop

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.760 
come to move move fixed select the stop
speed<00:05:48.639> of<00:05:48.759> zero<00:05:49.050> so<00:05:50.050> now<00:05:50.169> the<00:05:50.229> player<00:05:50.500> should

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
speed of zero so now the player should

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.129 
speed of zero so now the player should
move<00:05:51.039> and<00:05:51.250> stop<00:05:51.729> while<00:05:52.389> aligned<00:05:52.900> with<00:05:53.050> the

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:53.139 
move and stop while aligned with the

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:55.260 
move and stop while aligned with the
grid<00:05:53.349> let's<00:05:54.009> go<00:05:54.129> ahead<00:05:54.250> and<00:05:54.550> put<00:05:54.759> in<00:05:54.849> the<00:05:54.940> final

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
grid let's go ahead and put in the final

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.760 
grid let's go ahead and put in the final
bit<00:05:55.419> which<00:05:55.659> is<00:05:55.839> the<00:05:55.990> collision<00:05:56.379> with<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.529> wall

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
bit which is the collision with the wall

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:59.879 
bit which is the collision with the wall
so<00:05:57.159> at<00:05:57.370> event<00:05:57.669> collision<00:05:58.629> object<00:05:59.469> wall<00:05:59.680> and

00:05:59.879 --> 00:05:59.889 
so at event collision object wall and

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.589 
so at event collision object wall and
here<00:06:00.669> we're<00:06:00.819> just<00:06:00.849> going<00:06:01.150> to<00:06:01.210> come<00:06:01.360> over<00:06:01.449> to

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
here we're just going to come over to

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.589 
here we're just going to come over to
move<00:06:01.930> fixed<00:06:02.460> tell<00:06:03.460> it<00:06:03.580> to<00:06:03.669> stop<00:06:03.909> speed<00:06:04.240> of<00:06:04.360> zero

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
move fixed tell it to stop speed of zero

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:06.570 
move fixed tell it to stop speed of zero
we<00:06:05.409> don't<00:06:05.440> need<00:06:05.680> to<00:06:05.800> check<00:06:06.039> for<00:06:06.219> alignment

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
we don't need to check for alignment

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:08.820 
we don't need to check for alignment
because<00:06:06.940> the<00:06:07.300> object<00:06:07.719> wall<00:06:07.990> is<00:06:08.229> the<00:06:08.349> same<00:06:08.560> size

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
because the object wall is the same size

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.439 
because the object wall is the same size
as<00:06:09.039> the<00:06:09.159> player<00:06:09.400> and<00:06:09.849> will<00:06:09.969> already<00:06:10.300> be

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:10.449 
as the player and will already be

00:06:10.449 --> 00:06:12.899 
as the player and will already be
aligned<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.379> grid<00:06:11.620> so<00:06:12.279> go<00:06:12.430> ahead<00:06:12.520> and<00:06:12.610> close

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
aligned the grid so go ahead and close

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:17.659 
aligned the grid so go ahead and close
this<00:06:13.150> and<00:06:13.389> then<00:06:13.659> open<00:06:13.990> up<00:06:14.080> our<00:06:14.289> room<00:06:14.650> level<00:06:15.219> one

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.980 

we<00:06:18.669> won't<00:06:18.879> bother<00:06:19.029> with<00:06:19.240> a<00:06:19.300> background<00:06:19.810> for

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
we won't bother with a background for

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.019 
we won't bother with a background for
right<00:06:20.169> now<00:06:20.469> come<00:06:21.009> over<00:06:21.099> to<00:06:21.310> our<00:06:21.400> object<00:06:21.580> I'm

00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:22.029 
right now come over to our object I'm

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:24.959 
right now come over to our object I'm
just<00:06:22.210> going<00:06:22.360> to<00:06:22.449> place<00:06:22.629> a<00:06:22.900> single<00:06:23.289> wall<00:06:23.500> and<00:06:23.969> an

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:24.969 
just going to place a single wall and an

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:26.969 
just going to place a single wall and an
object<00:06:25.360> player<00:06:25.599> and<00:06:25.870> we'll<00:06:26.500> be<00:06:26.589> able<00:06:26.650> to<00:06:26.800> use

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
object player and we'll be able to use

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.920 
object player and we'll be able to use
the<00:06:27.099> wall<00:06:27.279> as<00:06:27.490> a<00:06:27.550> reference<00:06:28.089> to<00:06:28.389> show<00:06:28.569> that<00:06:28.779> we

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
the wall as a reference to show that we

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.040 
the wall as a reference to show that we
are<00:06:29.050> moving<00:06:29.349> 32<00:06:30.039> pixels<00:06:30.310> every<00:06:30.729> time<00:06:31.060> so<00:06:31.599> close

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050 
are moving 32 pixels every time so close

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.589 
are moving 32 pixels every time so close
the<00:06:32.199> room<00:06:32.409> and<00:06:32.589> test

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.519 

okay<00:06:36.289> so<00:06:36.409> I'll<00:06:36.559> move<00:06:36.710> left<00:06:37.119> down<00:06:38.119> right<00:06:38.419> up<00:06:38.869> and

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529 
okay so I'll move left down right up and

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:43.689 
okay so I'll move left down right up and
you<00:06:40.089> can<00:06:41.089> see<00:06:41.360> that<00:06:42.349> I<00:06:42.619> am<00:06:42.770> keeping<00:06:43.099> myself

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:43.699 
you can see that I am keeping myself

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:47.820 
you can see that I am keeping myself
aligned<00:06:44.449> to<00:06:44.599> the<00:06:44.689> grid<00:06:44.899> and<00:06:45.279> when<00:06:46.279> I<00:06:46.309> let<00:06:46.580> go<00:06:46.610> it

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
aligned to the grid and when I let go it

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.529 
aligned to the grid and when I let go it
keeps<00:06:48.830> moving<00:06:49.099> until<00:06:49.639> it's<00:06:49.819> snapped<00:06:50.179> to<00:06:50.509> a

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:50.539 
keeps moving until it's snapped to a

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:52.749 
keeps moving until it's snapped to a
grid<00:06:50.809> line<00:06:51.020> now<00:06:51.979> let's<00:06:52.159> try<00:06:52.309> and<00:06:52.429> move<00:06:52.550> into

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 
grid line now let's try and move into

00:06:52.759 --> 00:06:59.870 
grid line now let's try and move into
the<00:06:52.879> block<00:06:53.619> and<00:06:55.479> we<00:06:56.479> stop

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.770 

move<00:06:59.970> on<00:07:00.150> and<00:07:00.390> start<00:07:00.930> creating<00:07:01.230> a<00:07:01.560> room
