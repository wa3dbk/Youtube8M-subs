00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
adhesive in there and it is not going

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.999 
adhesive in there and it is not going
anywhere<00:02:00.170> then<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.439> see<00:02:01.560> how<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.740> got<00:02:01.860> that

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
anywhere then you can see how I got that

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.270 
anywhere then you can see how I got that
dark<00:02:02.310> strip<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.759> bottom<00:02:02.909> there<00:02:03.210> here<00:02:04.280> that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
dark strip on the bottom there here that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.059 
dark strip on the bottom there here that
is<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:06.030> strip<00:02:06.420> magnet<00:02:06.840> with<00:02:07.380> that<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.890> used

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
is a strip magnet with that I just used

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.440 
is a strip magnet with that I just used
some<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.310> super<00:02:08.670> glue<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:08.970> pick

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
some of that super glue that you pick

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.660 
some of that super glue that you pick
literally<00:02:09.660> over<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.080> Dollar<00:02:10.619> Tree<00:02:10.709> shoot<00:02:11.610> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
literally over the Dollar Tree shoot a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.630 
literally over the Dollar Tree shoot a
line<00:02:11.819> across<00:02:12.030> there<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.590> well<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:14.400> have<00:02:14.519> to

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
line across there and well you have to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.420 
line across there and well you have to
peel<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:14.819> off<00:02:15.000> without<00:02:15.330> breaking<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:16.430> then

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
peel it off without breaking it then

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.520 
peel it off without breaking it then
after<00:02:17.550> that<00:02:17.819> did<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.660> same<00:02:18.840> thing<00:02:19.050> here<00:02:19.260> put

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
after that did the same thing here put

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.140 
after that did the same thing here put
another<00:02:19.950> one<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.340> those<00:02:20.430> magnetic<00:02:20.849> strips

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
another one of those magnetic strips

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.940 
another one of those magnetic strips
made<00:02:21.629> sure<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:21.900> was<00:02:22.110> negative<00:02:22.739> positive

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
made sure it was negative positive

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.580 
made sure it was negative positive
polarities<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.849> we<00:02:23.970> would<00:02:24.090> actually<00:02:24.560> stick

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
polarities that we would actually stick

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.870 
polarities that we would actually stick
oh<00:02:25.830> there<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.000> fix<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:28.340> my<00:02:29.340> experiment

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
oh there that is fix the my experiment

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.410 
oh there that is fix the my experiment
works<00:02:30.470> anyways<00:02:31.470> ah<00:02:31.790> yeah<00:02:32.790> like<00:02:32.970> anything<00:02:33.300> is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
works anyways ah yeah like anything is

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.170 
works anyways ah yeah like anything is

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
not completely perfect but you know as

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.589 
not completely perfect but you know as
is<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.510> way<00:02:36.630> with<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:36.930> DIY<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:39.030> know<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.239> DIY

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
is the way with the DIY you know the DIY

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.259 
is the way with the DIY you know the DIY
crowd<00:02:39.870> there<00:02:40.080> pretty<00:02:40.349> much<00:02:40.560> used<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.890> that<00:02:41.269> but

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
I don't know for not being completely

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.339 
I don't know for not being completely
perfect<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:44.760> pretty<00:02:45.360> damn<00:02:45.540> close<00:02:45.780> I've<00:02:46.080> used

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
perfect it's pretty damn close I've used

here but anyways yeah just barely glides
past<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.730> two<00:03:20.880> magnets<00:03:21.329> enough<00:03:21.720> for<00:03:22.079> those

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
past the two magnets enough for those

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.500 
past the two magnets enough for those
polarities<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:23.010> sup<00:03:23.609> on<00:03:23.790> each<00:03:23.910> other<00:03:24.090> and<00:03:24.329> I

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
polarities to sup on each other and I

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.410 
polarities to sup on each other and I
said<00:03:25.500> stuck<00:03:25.920> on<00:03:26.100> each<00:03:26.250> other<00:03:26.430> anyways<00:03:27.180> yeah
