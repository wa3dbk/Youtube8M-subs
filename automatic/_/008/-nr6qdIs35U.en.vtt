00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
actually looking at here is a small turn

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.180 
actually looking at here is a small turn
90<00:03:16.739> degrees<00:03:17.040> with<00:03:17.250> an<00:03:17.370> allen<00:03:17.609> key<00:03:17.639> and<00:03:19.190> your

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
90 degrees with an allen key and your

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.770 
90 degrees with an allen key and your
seat<00:03:20.400> post<00:03:20.609> comes<00:03:20.819> right<00:03:21.060> out<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.600> what

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
seat post comes right out so what

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.569 
seat post comes right out so what
happens<00:03:22.139> here<00:03:22.380> it<00:03:22.859> allows<00:03:23.130> us<00:03:23.340> because

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
happens here it allows us because

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.129 
happens here it allows us because
there's<00:03:23.730> no<00:03:23.880> crushing<00:03:24.180> force<00:03:24.569> on<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.930> frame

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
there's no crushing force on the frame

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.680 
there's no crushing force on the frame
to<00:03:25.769> use<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.069> much<00:03:26.310> thinner<00:03:26.549> seat<00:03:26.850> tube<00:03:27.090> much

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
to use a much thinner seat tube much

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.379 
to use a much thinner seat tube much
thinner<00:03:27.930> seat<00:03:28.260> post<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.859> you<00:03:29.790> can<00:03:29.940> also<00:03:30.090> tune

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
thinner seat post and you can also tune

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:34.930 
thinner seat post and you can also tune
it<00:03:30.540> with<00:03:30.690> just<00:03:30.930> one<00:03:31.319> turn<00:03:32.060> 90<00:03:33.060> degree<00:03:33.299> turn<00:03:33.540> and

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
it with just one turn 90 degree turn and

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.240 
it with just one turn 90 degree turn and
your<00:03:35.940> bike<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.209> ready<00:03:36.359> to<00:03:36.540> ride<00:03:37.010> excellent<00:03:38.010> and

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
your bike is ready to ride excellent and

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.830 
your bike is ready to ride excellent and
we<00:03:38.340> don't<00:03:38.430> have<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:38.639> woman's<00:03:38.880> frame<00:03:39.329> here<00:03:39.569> today

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
we don't have a woman's frame here today

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.240 
we don't have a woman's frame here today
but<00:03:39.900> can<00:03:40.139> you<00:03:40.230> tell<00:03:40.260> me<00:03:40.500> about<00:03:40.590> some<00:03:40.919> of<00:03:41.040> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
but can you tell me about some of the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.430 
but can you tell me about some of the
things<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.329> women<00:03:42.569> can<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:42.900> putting<00:03:43.290> or

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
things that the women can be putting or

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.860 
things that the women can be putting or
in<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.680> PMC<00:03:44.130> by<00:03:44.280> client<00:03:44.700> yeah<00:03:44.970> we've<00:03:45.239> we've

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
in the PMC by client yeah we've we've

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.360 
in the PMC by client yeah we've we've
made<00:03:46.049> a<00:03:46.079> bike<00:03:46.290> with<00:03:46.440> a<00:03:46.470> similar<00:03:46.739> concept<00:03:47.280> to

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
made a bike with a similar concept to

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.970 
made a bike with a similar concept to
this<00:03:47.519> which<00:03:47.700> is<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:48.060> lightweight<00:03:48.859> rigid<00:03:49.859> in

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
this which is a lightweight rigid in

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.530

we've<00:03:52.079> adjusted<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.560> geometry<00:03:53.099> a<00:03:53.160> little<00:03:53.340> bit

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
we've adjusted the geometry a little bit

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.879 
we've adjusted the geometry a little bit
to<00:03:53.579> fit<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.910> build<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.900> your<00:03:55.290> average<00:03:55.560> woman

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
to fit the build of your average woman

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.819 
to fit the build of your average woman

of<00:04:08.430> April<00:04:08.730> early<00:04:08.849> May<00:04:09.060> I'm<00:04:10.019> so<00:04:10.560> anxious<00:04:10.799> for

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
of April early May I'm so anxious for

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.680 
of April early May I'm so anxious for
that<00:04:11.340> to<00:04:11.489> happen<00:04:11.669> I<00:04:11.910> can't<00:04:12.090> wait<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.359> ride<00:04:12.480> one

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
that to happen I can't wait to ride one

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.589 
that to happen I can't wait to ride one
I<00:04:12.959> know<00:04:13.650> that<00:04:13.769> one<00:04:14.220> thing<00:04:14.400> about<00:04:14.579> BMC<00:04:15.180> bikes<00:04:15.389> is

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
I know that one thing about BMC bikes is

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.319 
I know that one thing about BMC bikes is
the<00:04:15.810> geometry<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.680> way<00:04:16.799> they<00:04:16.979> measure<00:04:17.340> size

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
the geometry the way they measure size

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.940 
the geometry the way they measure size
for<00:04:18.959> the<00:04:18.989> bikes<00:04:19.229> is<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.470> little

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
for the bikes is a little

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.400 
for the bikes is a little
friend<00:04:20.190> than<00:04:20.700> what<00:04:21.300> most<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.930> us<00:04:22.050> might<00:04:22.290> be

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
friend than what most of us might be

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.600 
friend than what most of us might be
familiar<00:04:22.620> with<00:04:22.830> can<00:04:23.130> you<00:04:23.190> tell<00:04:23.340> us<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:23.490> little

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
familiar with can you tell us a little

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.550 
familiar with can you tell us a little
bit<00:04:23.760> about<00:04:23.970> that<00:04:24.150> well<00:04:24.510> yes<00:04:24.810> it<00:04:25.200> tends<00:04:25.470> to

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
bit about that well yes it tends to

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.900 
bit about that well yes it tends to
throw<00:04:25.770> people<00:04:25.920> off<00:04:26.160> a<00:04:26.220> little<00:04:26.580> bit<00:04:26.760> for

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
throw people off a little bit for

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.120 
throw people off a little bit for
instance<00:04:27.240> in<00:04:27.360> my<00:04:27.630> particular<00:04:27.810> case<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:28.620> ride

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
instance in my particular case I ride

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.620 
instance in my particular case I ride
let's<00:04:29.400> say<00:04:29.520> a<00:04:29.550> 58<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.180> many<00:04:30.480> other

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
let's say a 58 and many other

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.970 
let's say a 58 and many other
manufacturers<00:04:31.260> but<00:04:31.350> when<00:04:31.470> it<00:04:31.560> came<00:04:31.650> over<00:04:31.890> to

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
manufacturers but when it came over to

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.860 
manufacturers but when it came over to
BMC<00:04:32.400> and<00:04:32.640> I<00:04:32.670> was<00:04:32.790> told<00:04:32.970> I<00:04:33.090> would<00:04:33.150> ride<00:04:33.300> a<00:04:33.330> 55<00:04:33.840> I

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
BMC and I was told I would ride a 55 I

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.630 
BMC and I was told I would ride a 55 I
thought<00:04:34.260> oh<00:04:34.440> wait<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.920> minute<00:04:34.950> here<00:04:35.280> so<00:04:35.460> our

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
thought oh wait a minute here so our

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.160 
thought oh wait a minute here so our
bikes<00:04:35.820> tend<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.180> run<00:04:36.330> a<00:04:36.360> little<00:04:36.570> large<00:04:36.810> it's<00:04:37.110> a

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:37.170 
bikes tend to run a little large it's a

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.420 
bikes tend to run a little large it's a
racing<00:04:37.350> heritage<00:04:37.680> who<00:04:38.040> tend<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.250> have<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.370> very

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
racing heritage who tend to have a very

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.520 
racing heritage who tend to have a very
long<00:04:38.790> top<00:04:39.120> tube<00:04:39.330> a<00:04:39.450> very<00:04:39.630> aggressive<00:04:39.840> geometry

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:40.530 
long top tube a very aggressive geometry

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.950 
long top tube a very aggressive geometry
to<00:04:40.680> them<00:04:40.940> so<00:04:41.940> when<00:04:42.150> you're<00:04:42.270> getting<00:04:42.360> size<00:04:42.690> for

to them so when you're getting size for
a<00:04:42.990> BMC<00:04:43.230> we<00:04:43.620> definitely<00:04:43.950> don't<00:04:44.070> recommend<00:04:44.520> that

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
a BMC we definitely don't recommend that

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.780 
a BMC we definitely don't recommend that
you<00:04:44.670> go<00:04:44.880> by<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.510> size<00:04:46.020> that<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.380> used<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.130> get

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
you go by the size that you used to get

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.250
