00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.520 
of pécs after one week and so he gets
more<00:02:23.340> rare<00:02:23.670> on<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.090> market<00:02:24.690> as<00:02:24.840> people<00:02:25.290> just

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
more rare on the market as people just

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.350 
more rare on the market as people just

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
keep him in their sports or keeping in

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.140 
keep him in their sports or keeping in
the<00:02:27.390> club<00:02:27.780> or<00:02:27.959> whatever<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.879> prices

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the club or whatever and so the prices

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.720 
the club or whatever and so the prices
can<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:30.690> think<00:02:31.080> only<00:02:31.349> go<00:02:31.620> up<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:32.069> at<00:02:32.280> least<00:02:32.489> some

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
can I think only go up on at least some

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.430 
can I think only go up on at least some
of<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.940> players<00:02:33.150> like<00:02:33.420> ppl<00:02:33.750> players<00:02:34.140> and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
of the players like ppl players and

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.259 
of the players like ppl players and
there<00:02:34.950> definitely<00:02:35.069> is<00:02:35.489> some<00:02:35.519> profit<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.150> be

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
there definitely is some profit to be

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.240 
there definitely is some profit to be
made<00:02:36.299> I<00:02:36.629> personally<00:02:37.290> don't<00:02:37.769> really<00:02:38.069> like

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
made I personally don't really like

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.900 
made I personally don't really like
doing<00:02:38.670> bad<00:02:39.000> because<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:40.470> takes<00:02:40.650> time<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.010> make

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
doing bad because it takes time to make

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.460 
doing bad because it takes time to make
this<00:02:42.060> profit<00:02:42.450> it<00:02:42.540> takes<00:02:42.750> two<00:02:43.049> or<00:02:43.079> three<00:02:43.440> weeks

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
this profit it takes two or three weeks

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.649 
this profit it takes two or three weeks
or<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:43.980> until<00:02:44.280> you<00:02:44.519> can<00:02:44.700> sell<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> players<00:02:45.360> for

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.289 
bit more coins couple of thousand coins
more<00:03:04.680> or<00:03:04.829> less<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.489> always<00:03:05.760> better<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.150> have

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
more or less it's always better to have

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.300 
more or less it's always better to have
more<00:03:06.629> of<00:03:06.780> them<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:07.470> had<00:03:07.590> some<00:03:07.799> time<00:03:07.829> so<00:03:08.280> I

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
more of them and I had some time so I

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.280 
more of them and I had some time so I
did<00:03:08.579> this<00:03:08.790> method<00:03:09.150> as<00:03:09.269> well<00:03:09.480> but<00:03:09.900> of<00:03:10.049> course

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
did this method as well but of course

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.229 
did this method as well but of course
gets<00:03:10.680> tiresome<00:03:11.370> after<00:03:11.700> some<00:03:11.849> time<00:03:12.030> because

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
gets tiresome after some time because

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.180 
gets tiresome after some time because
you<00:03:12.420> have<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.870> look<00:03:12.989> at<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.410> players<00:03:13.620> prices

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
for 30,000 point I think in the end just

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.020 
for 30,000 point I think in the end just
because<00:03:22.919> it's<00:03:23.250> in<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.340> fourth<00:03:23.669> week<00:03:23.880> you

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
because it's in the fourth week you

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
didn't go up in price and I think I know

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.339 
didn't go up in price and I think I know
why<00:03:39.060> and<00:03:39.359> I<00:03:39.450> just<00:03:39.630> want<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.930> give<00:03:40.079> you<00:03:40.109> an<00:03:40.260> idea

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
why and I just want to give you an idea

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.940 
why and I just want to give you an idea
of<00:03:40.709> why<00:03:41.669> he<00:03:41.730> didn't<00:03:42.209> go<00:03:42.239> up<00:03:42.329> in<00:03:42.510> price<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:43.079> then

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
of why he didn't go up in price and then

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.909 
of why he didn't go up in price and then
you<00:03:44.069> can<00:03:44.310> probably<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.510> judge<00:03:46.319> on<00:03:46.530> your<00:03:46.739> own

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:46.919 
you can probably a judge on your own

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:49.460 
you can probably a judge on your own
which<00:03:47.099> place<00:03:47.400> will<00:03:47.669> go<00:03:47.849> up<00:03:47.880> or<00:03:48.299> not<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:49.019> Adriano

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
which place will go up or not so Adriano

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.430 
which place will go up or not so Adriano
is<00:03:49.709> only<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.130> think<00:03:50.480> 76<00:03:51.480> /<00:03:51.690> or<00:03:51.959> rated<00:03:52.290> which

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
is only I think 76 / or rated which

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.520 
is only I think 76 / or rated which
isn't<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:52.919> greatest<00:03:53.069> and<00:03:54.290> first<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.410> all

how

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
how

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.020 
how
she<00:04:25.150> goes<00:04:25.420> for<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:26.230> adriano<00:04:26.639> doesn't<00:04:27.639> get<00:04:27.790> pic

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
she goes for so adriano doesn't get pic

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.180 
she goes for so adriano doesn't get pic
too<00:04:28.240> often<00:04:28.570> as<00:04:28.750> a<00:04:28.780> left<00:04:29.080> egg<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.920> then<00:04:30.040> in

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
too often as a left egg and then in

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.040 
too often as a left egg and then in
general<00:04:30.550> in<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.730> Liga<00:04:31.000> BBVA<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.630> course<00:04:31.930> you

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
general in the Liga BBVA of course you

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.590 
general in the Liga BBVA of course you
have<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.710> likes<00:04:32.950> of<00:04:33.250> qua<00:04:33.880> di<00:04:34.060> ba<00:04:34.330> or<00:04:34.510> the

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
have the likes of qua di ba or the

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.210 
have the likes of qua di ba or the
income<00:04:34.930> for<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.260> other<00:04:35.410> if<00:04:35.620> you<00:04:35.830> like<00:04:36.010> for

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
income for the other if you like for

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.550 
income for the other if you like for
example<00:04:36.280> build<00:04:36.820> a<00:04:37.000> pass<00:04:37.270> alone<00:04:37.660> ask<00:04:37.840> what<00:04:38.139> you

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
example build a pass alone ask what you

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.960 
example build a pass alone ask what you
will<00:04:38.650> definitely<00:04:38.950> go<00:04:39.220> for<00:04:39.250> him<00:04:39.639> instead<00:04:39.910> of

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
will definitely go for him instead of

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.120 
will definitely go for him instead of
Adriano<00:04:40.510> so<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:40.810> think<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.350> kind<00:04:41.740> of<00:04:41.830> explains

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
Adriano so I think that kind of explains

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:46.650 
Adriano so I think that kind of explains
why<00:04:42.490> his<00:04:42.790> price<00:04:43.090> didn't<00:04:43.450> go<00:04:43.600> up<00:04:45.060> in<00:04:46.060> contrast

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
why his price didn't go up in contrast

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.330 
why his price didn't go up in contrast
to<00:04:46.780> other<00:04:46.990> players<00:04:47.350> who<00:04:47.530> fight<00:04:47.770> a<00:04:47.800> difficult
