00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.369
 already done a very long time ago so at 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.450
 maybe two three years on my channel 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.369
 but I'm trying to close video for 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.359
 to give a little bit of two 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.729
 new simply 

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:20.890
 so it's a hijab like in monaco 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.420
 as early as the 6th nachiri I do not know how 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.219
 to say but it's his signature level 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.560
 religious anyway she does this kind 

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:27.939
 of hijab style all the time in all 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.710
 these videos if you look at the pictures 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.740
 in miniature it's really that kind 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.420
 of jazz as she does and then that's it 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.130
 I hope this video will please you and 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.539
 if you want to see how I did this 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.170
 light do not hesitate to look at the 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.079
 following the video 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.299
 first of all I pin all in bad to 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.880
 in fact you have to have both sides of 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.889
 the same rigor it is is beautiful I'm going 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.359
 turn the first side tight enough into 

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:51.359
 done so here I 'm going to shoot 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.440
 it's not the kind of veil that 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.490
 I will really use for for already 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.010
 rather because it's 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.020
 here it is hard but preferred everything 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.280
 that chiffon rendering will be 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:09.350
 prettier the drape too so that's 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.000
 just that I actually did not have a scarf 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.030
 or care sign of this color there they 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.800
 know with my sweater so here i'm going 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.530
 just have a little test 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.580
 everywhere and like that then I'm going 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.890
 paint and all with a little 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.080
 save the other side you know who we 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.410
 who's staying you're just going attached 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.910
 loosli so it's with really the ccv 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.910
 but it's not tight at all 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:35.360
 really it's wide and relaxed we're going 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:39.410
 say and we will tie 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:42.530
 we will try to create a way that's 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.520
 pretty because we are great i'm going 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.310
 rendered so you can put time 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.780
 still to find the game the sheet 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.370
 and you want to get him of required age 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.220
 the pretty you can as much serves it and 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.830
 that loosen it and must also find 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.420
 the way that is most appropriate anymore 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.790
 pretty once you'll find the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.250
 perfect and appropriate way for you 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.020
 you pin it to that level so here is 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.950
 it can be as tight as not wax 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:13.130
 as lacerated as humus holds rijab 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:16.010
 change style and that adapts to the way 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.540
 you want to wear the veil 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.010
 so I hope this video will have you 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.080
 more than the quality of life you are 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.050
 also you will like it so I try 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.880

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.380
 of video because as you know 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.610
 for me, I really like to watch 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.500

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.580

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.350
