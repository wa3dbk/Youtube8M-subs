00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
way back to fifa 10 cards and this squad

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.369 
way back to fifa 10 cards and this squad
is<00:00:14.400> absolutely<00:00:15.269> insane<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.839> rules<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.260> this

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
is absolutely insane the rules of this

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.439 
is absolutely insane the rules of this
are<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:17.010> can<00:00:17.160> move<00:00:17.279> players<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.670> maximum<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.240> two

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
are we can move players a maximum of two

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.480 
are we can move players a maximum of two
positions<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> striker<00:00:19.680> can<00:00:19.949> become<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> cam

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
positions so a striker can become a cam

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.880 
positions so a striker can become a cam
but<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:20.939> striker<00:00:21.390> can't<00:00:22.050> become<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.560> centre

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
but a striker can't become a centre

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.130 
but a striker can't become a centre
defensive<00:00:23.340> mid<00:00:23.490> for<00:00:23.699> example<00:00:24.180> ok<00:00:24.810> so<00:00:24.869> let's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
defensive mid for example ok so let's

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.540
