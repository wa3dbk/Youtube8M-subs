00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.979
 very well and it's a tendency to block 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.889
 colors we are going to use colored blocks 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:10.690
 intense and in this case use a fuchsia 

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:12.429
 combined with black you do the 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.879
 combination that you want 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.890
 remember keeping the balance always 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:19.000
 depending on your body not then what 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.190
 first thing we're going to do is that the 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.080
 fuchsia color that is more the accent what 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.570
 let's use on top of 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.910
 our holter let's cut it into a 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.040
 single piece because it looks thinner though 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.160
 you spend a little more fabric you see 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:36.670
 finer and the strip is cut full 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:39.609
 with the bust part of our blouse 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.530
 let's cut it this way by doing 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.870
 our space that is where you see the bust 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.120
 let's cut a curve a little bit more 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.780
 closed for what is the part of the 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.640
 sisa and a more open curve for 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.589
 part of the bust because we are going to cross 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.960
 a little bit to give a little more 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:57.730
 coverage after we cut our 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.030
 two pieces because we're going to cut it 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.100
 double each one because of the fact that 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.260
 We transparent depending on your type 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.980
 of cloth and also because of the 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.330
 terminal 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.010
 because it looks nicer I'm going to 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.990
 teach a trick how are we going to 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:15.670
 finish to make it look cute we're going to 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.950
 pass two seams all around 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.900
 our top of the blouse and 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.660
 then we're going to turn it around 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.630
 to give an effect of a very finished 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.030
 nice that later we will go ironing 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.610
 and we will be well polished and well 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.590
 fine then what we cut next is 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.740
 our bodice and there if you have 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.780
 to see how long you want me 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.340
 I made it a little bit more sexy chubby 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.010
 more youthful you can do it more 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.110
 long even this I can use it for a 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.080
 much longer blouse that I can wear 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.790
 with tight pants I used black 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.130
 for the bottom we are going to cut 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.590
 one piece because I'm from the 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.960
 belief that the less seams more 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.360
 fine is seen then the finished and more if 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.490
 they are beginners one piece type 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.430
 rectangle depending on the width that 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.970
 want and we're going to give you one 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.620
 posture on one side 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.530
 now let's proceed to finish 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.570
 our party and we're going to do what 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.910
 next we are going to paste remember that 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.490
 we did one of the sides was a little bit 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.080
 more closed and the other more open then 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.330
 the most open is the one that will remain 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.270
 side of the bust because we are going to cross 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.190
 a little bit and then let's suppose if 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.840
 this one was turned around since still 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.650
 we do not turn it over and it's on 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.060
 here if we are going to place it this way 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.870
 and here we are going to do our sewing 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.690
 as you can see there takes your sewing in 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.010
 the back double stitching for 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:46.470
 reinforcement and here they have the finished I 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.410
 you do to your liking, I did not put 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.030
 an elastic in the part of down here 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.650
 because it gives a little more shape 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.510
 you can make a closing or in the 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.180
 back or just a button 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.300
 Well, this blouse can be put on 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.640
 with skorts pasted with shorts very 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.110
 sexy very fashionable 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.110
 I hope you like it
