you see that spray-on wait 45 seconds
spray<00:04:05.880> down<00:04:06.060> so<00:04:06.990> this<00:04:07.140> is<00:04:07.170> what<00:04:07.500> it<00:04:07.650> should

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
spray down so this is what it should

turn<00:04:08.070> out<00:04:08.220> do<00:04:08.580> not<00:04:08.780> wash<00:04:09.780> it<00:04:10.050> underneath<00:04:10.470> water

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
turn out do not wash it underneath water

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.630
