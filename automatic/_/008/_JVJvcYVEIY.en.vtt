00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
get there okay the most likely outcome

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.219 
get there okay the most likely outcome
of<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:18.180> you'll<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:18.570> never<00:01:18.869> make

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
of that is that you'll just never make

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
to two examples one is a summary I did

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.290 
to two examples one is a summary I did
over<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.780> film<00:03:17.020> Jurassic<00:03:17.410> Park<00:03:17.650> and<00:03:18.210> so<00:03:19.210> you
