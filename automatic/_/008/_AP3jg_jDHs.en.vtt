00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
streaming it onto the shield so you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.160 
streaming it onto the shield so you
might<00:00:26.400> have<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.670> adjust<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.330> brightness<00:00:27.570> more

community so one aspect is there's also

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.870 
community so one aspect is there's also
building<00:01:49.229> aspect<00:01:50.009> where<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.759> to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
this is one of them I build barricades

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.709 
this is one of them I build barricades
so<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> zombies<00:01:59.670> don't<00:01:59.850> come<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.180> this

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
so that the zombies don't come in this

so that the zombies don't come in this
concept<00:02:01.079> has<00:02:01.229> been<00:02:01.409> done<00:02:01.710> before<00:02:02.159> but<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.180> is

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
concept has been done before but this is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.230 
concept has been done before but this is
just<00:02:03.509> one<00:02:03.840> of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.110> things<00:02:04.320> you<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.590> do<00:02:05.090> so<00:02:06.090> now

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
just one of the things you can do so now
