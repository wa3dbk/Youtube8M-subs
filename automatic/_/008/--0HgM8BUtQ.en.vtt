00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:10.889
 many zeros a type of incalculable 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.200
 value how the vegetables of 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.360
 leaf well that one goes for a lettuce 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.340
 divide a divine dome a thorn that 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.859
 fortune teller contracted punctually the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.789
 of the new kitchen all the same day it 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.489
 begins to sadden the matter way of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.919
 keep them I swear that is the best 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.039
 that there is much better than any other 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.800
 time 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.620
 is not this what we have to do is 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.149
 wash the vegetables the lavas in water with 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.040
 a little bit of air if you want 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.230
 I explain in this other video and all the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.199
 key to this method is that when 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.469
 you take them out you have to dry them well 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.469
 you have 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.480
 debt centrifugation that yes it is not 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.239
 sharpens sharpens you can to go 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.399
 they appear dry surpassing a piece of paper 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.729
 whatever you do not have to be super 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:04.570
 recontra hyper dry once also 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:07.149
 a tupper will be married and you put a 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.460
 absorbent paper then you will take 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.520
 keep the leaves accommodating them well 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.640
 well and this as well as this one will not take 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.250
 the refrigerator one hour open more than one 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.880
 tuit got tired on my page like 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.420
 occupies all the past so far you take it out 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.240
 you put another absorbent paper up and 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:31.450
 cover it well with the pie stage is 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.890
 that's how I swear you lasts a lot 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.630
 parsley for example that I previously what 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.220

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.920
 cute cook everything you want hard 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.530
 so many arugula that usually last 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.619
 very little lasts much longer so is a 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.550
 fan balls is to wash everything together but 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.370
