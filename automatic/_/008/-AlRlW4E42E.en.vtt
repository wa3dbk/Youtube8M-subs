again

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.980 

that's<00:02:15.320> without<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:17.300> is<00:02:17.450> with

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
that's without and this is with

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.510 
that's without and this is with
so<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.740> see<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> trees<00:02:20.250> in<00:02:20.280> the

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.690 

and<00:02:29.920> finally<00:02:30.340> when<00:02:30.489> you're<00:02:30.640> streaming<00:02:30.939> videos

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
and finally when you're streaming videos

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.289 
and finally when you're streaming videos
video<00:02:33.700> blog<00:02:33.999> sites<00:02:34.299> or<00:02:34.769> video<00:02:35.769> sites<00:02:36.299> what

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
video blog sites or video sites what

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.849 
video blog sites or video sites what
normally<00:02:37.629> happens<00:02:37.659> as<00:02:38.109> a<00:02:38.139> quality<00:02:38.620> is<00:02:38.680> never

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
normally happens as a quality is never

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:42.780 
normally happens as a quality is never
very<00:02:39.099> good<00:02:39.959> so<00:02:40.959> what<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.379> bravia<00:02:42.219> engine<00:02:42.340> does

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
very good so what the bravia engine does

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.379 
very good so what the bravia engine does
is<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.209> reduces<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.959> noise<00:02:44.109> in<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.739> picture

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:45.389 
is it reduces the noise in the picture

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:50.000 
is it reduces the noise in the picture
so<00:02:46.389> here<00:02:46.659> we<00:02:46.689> can<00:02:46.900> see<00:02:47.049> without<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.469> engine

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:03:01.720 

and<00:02:50.400> they<00:02:50.549> have<00:02:50.790> with<00:02:50.970> engine

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.839 

so<00:03:02.239> that's<00:03:02.450> the<00:03:02.659> problem<00:03:03.170> baba<00:03:03.560> legend<00:03:03.920> at<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849
