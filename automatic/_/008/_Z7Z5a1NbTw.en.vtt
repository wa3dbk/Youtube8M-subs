as that golden opportunity to you know
basically<00:00:42.440> beat<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.620> guy<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.040> was<00:00:44.129> just<00:00:44.430> in

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
basically beat the guy that was just in

basically beat the guy that was just in
a<00:00:44.640> fight<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.030> Mayweather<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.920> and<00:00:47.000> so<00:00:48.000> you

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
a fight with Mayweather and and so you

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.270 
a fight with Mayweather and and so you
know<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.870> he<00:00:49.140> knew<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.770> amount<00:00:50.100> of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
know and and he knew the amount of

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.430 
know and and he knew the amount of
recognition<00:00:51.030> he<00:00:51.180> would<00:00:51.360> receive<00:00:51.719> by<00:00:51.960> beating

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
recognition he would receive by beating

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.229 
recognition he would receive by beating
this<00:00:52.559> guy<00:00:52.800> I<00:00:52.829> mean<00:00:53.129> he<00:00:53.600> stood<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:55.320> gain<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:56.250> lot

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
this guy I mean he stood to gain a lot

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.290 
this guy I mean he stood to gain a lot
from<00:00:57.600> winning<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.579> could<00:00:59.760> tell<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.239> his

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
from winning and you could tell in his

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.579 
from winning and you could tell in his
desire<00:01:02.090> he<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.750> wanted<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.260> win<00:01:04.559> that

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
desire he really wanted to win that

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.380 
desire he really wanted to win that
fight<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.309> he's<00:01:05.460> tough<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.670> think<00:01:09.090> Victor

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
fight and he's tough and I think Victor

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.710 
fight and he's tough and I think Victor
is<00:01:09.420> faster<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.500> think<00:01:11.130> Victor<00:01:11.689> was<00:01:12.689> um<00:01:13.670> was<00:01:14.720> some

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
is faster I think Victor was um was some

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.560 
is faster I think Victor was um was some
cops<00:01:15.960> right<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.590> guys<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:16.979> gotta

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
cops right here but guys I gotta

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.550 
cops right here but guys I gotta
I<00:01:17.659> think<00:01:18.290> Victor<00:01:18.710> was<00:01:19.510> was<00:01:20.510> faster<00:01:21.080> I<00:01:21.260> think

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
I think Victor was was faster I think

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.149 
I think Victor was was faster I think
his<00:01:21.620> punches<00:01:22.159> were<00:01:22.340> more<00:01:22.580> precise<00:01:23.470> I<00:01:24.470> think

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
his punches were more precise I think

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.680 
his punches were more precise I think
he's<00:01:25.370> more<00:01:25.640> athletic<00:01:26.390> than<00:01:26.630> Xhosa<00:01:27.200> Sita<00:01:27.680> was

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
he's more athletic than Xhosa Sita was

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.969 
he's more athletic than Xhosa Sita was
Victor<00:01:29.690> was<00:01:29.840> pretty<00:01:30.110> much<00:01:30.260> winning<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.710> fight

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
Victor was pretty much winning the fight

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.820 
Victor was pretty much winning the fight
and<00:01:31.220> you<00:01:32.060> could<00:01:32.240> arguably<00:01:32.720> say<00:01:33.260> that<00:01:33.530> most

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
and you could arguably say that most

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.380 
and you could arguably say that most
osito<00:01:34.340> um<00:01:36.400> you<00:01:37.400> know<00:01:37.490> got<00:01:37.670> lucky<00:01:38.119> with<00:01:38.330> that

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
osito um you know got lucky with that

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.260 
osito um you know got lucky with that
jaw<00:01:38.900> crack<00:01:39.380> and<00:01:39.680> then<00:01:39.890> you<00:01:40.580> can<00:01:40.729> argue<00:01:40.910> whether

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
jaw crack and then you can argue whether

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.969 
jaw crack and then you can argue whether
Victor<00:01:41.750> should<00:01:41.960> have<00:01:42.080> given<00:01:42.290> up<00:01:42.530> or<00:01:42.680> not<00:01:42.800> but

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
Victor should have given up or not but

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:44.980 
Victor should have given up or not but
you<00:01:43.130> know<00:01:43.280> the<00:01:43.850> guy's<00:01:44.030> mouth<00:01:44.270> was<00:01:44.540> totally

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
you know the guy's mouth was totally

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.580 
you know the guy's mouth was totally
full<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.229> blood

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
full of blood

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.190 
full of blood
I<00:01:46.649> don't<00:01:47.250> know<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.549> I'm<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.539> that<00:01:48.750> doesn't

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
I don't know I I'm one that doesn't

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.169 
I don't know I I'm one that doesn't
necessarily<00:01:49.350> blame<00:01:49.920> him<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.880> know<00:01:51.000> what

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
necessarily blame him you know what

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.300 
necessarily blame him you know what
fight<00:01:51.750> another<00:01:52.020> day<00:01:52.170> man<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:52.979> doesn't

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
fight another day man and that doesn't

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.029 
fight another day man and that doesn't
happen<00:01:53.429> every<00:01:53.909> fight<00:01:54.179> and<00:01:54.619> it<00:01:55.619> doesn't<00:01:55.950> seem

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
happen every fight and it doesn't seem

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.859 
happen every fight and it doesn't seem
like<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.310> happens<00:01:56.609> too<00:01:56.819> often<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.240> any<00:01:57.509> fighter

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
like it happens too often to any fighter

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.910 
like it happens too often to any fighter
so<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.469> say<00:01:59.039> just<00:01:59.479> whatever<00:02:00.679> just<00:02:01.679> fight

so I say just whatever just fight
another<00:02:02.189> day<00:02:02.340> don't<00:02:03.030> it<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.240> so<00:02:03.479> bad<00:02:03.750> that

another day don't it up so bad that
you<00:02:04.020> you<00:02:04.380> know<00:02:04.469> could<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.890> career<00:02:05.219> costing<00:02:05.789> for

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
you you know could be career costing for

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.499 
you you know could be career costing for
you<00:02:06.590> but<00:02:07.590> anyhow<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.429> know<00:02:08.519> I<00:02:08.549> don't<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.060> think

you but anyhow you know I don't I think
Victor<00:02:10.080> well<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.860> don't<00:02:11.069> think<00:02:11.370> Victor<00:02:11.879> is

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
Victor well I don't think Victor is

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.180 
Victor well I don't think Victor is
playing<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.569> full<00:02:12.810> deck<00:02:12.870> as<00:02:13.349> they<00:02:13.650> say<00:02:13.890> I

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
playing with a full deck as they say I

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.960 
playing with a full deck as they say I
don't<00:02:14.970> think<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:17.299> think<00:02:18.299> his<00:02:18.750> mind<00:02:19.049> was

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
don't think that I think his mind was

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.160 
don't think that I think his mind was
reasonably<00:02:20.970> there<00:02:21.420> for<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:21.900> fight<00:02:22.230> and

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
reasonably there for this fight and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.479 
reasonably there for this fight and
although<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.200> did<00:02:25.530> see<00:02:25.739> signs<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.220> he's

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
although I did see signs that he's

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.600 
although I did see signs that he's
unstable<00:02:26.940> for<00:02:27.360> sure<00:02:27.630> I<00:02:27.660> mean<00:02:27.860> but<00:02:28.860> overall

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
unstable for sure I mean but overall

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.970 
unstable for sure I mean but overall
given<00:02:30.120> everything<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:31.230> Victor's<00:02:31.739> gone

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
given everything that Victor's gone

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.819 
given everything that Victor's gone
through<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.519> whom<00:02:32.910> he<00:02:32.940> hit<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.510> who<00:02:34.260> he<00:02:34.590> has

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
through and whom he hit you who he has

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.250 
through and whom he hit you who he has
shown<00:02:35.250> us<00:02:35.459> he<00:02:35.730> is<00:02:35.760> up<00:02:36.269> until<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.660> point<00:02:36.750> I

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
shown us he is up until this point I

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.650 
shown us he is up until this point I
think<00:02:37.680> Victor<00:02:38.190> did<00:02:38.400> all<00:02:38.549> right<00:02:38.660> relatively

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
think Victor did all right relatively
