semi-automatic<00:00:09.540> we<00:00:10.050> found<00:00:10.380> design<00:00:10.740> that<00:00:10.889> I

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
semi-automatic we found design that I

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.759 
semi-automatic we found design that I
mean<00:00:11.570> first<00:00:12.570> I'm<00:00:12.809> going<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:12.990> show<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.590> some

mean first I'm going to show you some
basic<00:00:13.950> concepts<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:15.109> don't<00:00:16.109> know<00:00:16.199> perhaps<00:00:16.500> they

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
basic concepts I don't know perhaps they

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.090 
basic concepts I don't know perhaps they
made<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.369> but<00:00:18.029> for<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.170> Sapna's<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.740> had<00:00:19.949> to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
made it but for you Sapna's you had to

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.750 
made it but for you Sapna's you had to
have<00:00:20.189> source<00:00:20.730> box<00:00:21.060> all<00:00:21.660> along<00:00:22.230> it<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.740> all<00:00:23.609> the

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
have source box all along it and all the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.540 
have source box all along it and all the
11<00:00:24.150> block<00:00:24.449> out<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.590> made<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.220> you

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
11 block out and made you have to you

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.169 
11 block out and made you have to you
have<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.730> do<00:00:26.910> big<00:00:27.150> fields<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:28.019> wheat<00:00:28.500> oh<00:00:29.179> now

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
have to do big fields of wheat oh now

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.030 
have to do big fields of wheat oh now
you<00:00:30.240> don't<00:00:30.599> have<00:00:30.779> them<00:00:30.990> source<00:00:31.289> ball<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.800> just

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
you don't have them source ball can just

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.220 
you don't have them source ball can just
be<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.550> little<00:00:32.820> block<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.450> I'll<00:00:33.690> cover<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.110> my

by<00:00:42.570> mine<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.079> water<00:00:43.379> flowing<00:00:43.739> through<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.129> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
by mine is water flowing through it and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.529 
by mine is water flowing through it and
it's<00:00:45.030> still<00:00:46.879> your<00:00:47.879> dated<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:50.539> I'll

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
it's still your dated right here I'll

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.600 
it's still your dated right here I'll
take<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.899> concept<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.760> extended<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:55.610> this

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
take this concept and extended it this

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.340 
take this concept and extended it this
no<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.870> not<00:00:58.020> Ram<00:00:58.520> okay<00:00:59.520> I'm<00:01:00.239> very<00:01:01.020> kind<00:01:01.260> of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
no this is not Ram okay I'm very kind of

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.310 
no this is not Ram okay I'm very kind of
red<00:01:01.500> stones<00:01:02.539> this<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.750> pretty<00:01:04.080> much<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
red stones this is pretty much the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.520 
red stones this is pretty much the
extent<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.949> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:17.950 

as<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.979> can<00:01:11.159> see<00:01:11.340> in<00:01:11.520> here

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:33.660 

I<00:01:18.049> have<00:01:18.350> to<00:01:18.530> make<00:01:18.650> sure<00:01:18.710> all<00:01:19.250> overgrown

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.140 

um

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.940 

alright<00:01:39.840> basically<00:01:40.020> we<00:01:40.950> have<00:01:40.980> to<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
alright basically we have to this is the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.800 
alright basically we have to this is the
basically<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> switch<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.360> put<00:01:45.780> a

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
basically the switch so it I put a

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.410 
basically the switch so it I put a
switch<00:01:46.050> at<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.230> bottom<00:01:46.410> minute<00:01:46.920> this

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
switch at the bottom minute this

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.730 
switch at the bottom minute this
redstone<00:01:48.420> torch<00:01:48.780> elevator<00:01:49.200> all<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.410> way<00:01:49.530> up

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
redstone torch elevator all the way up

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.390 
redstone torch elevator all the way up
so<00:01:50.010> which<00:01:50.340> affects<00:01:50.670> all<00:01:50.880> levels<00:01:52.190> Pistons<00:01:53.190> here

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:53.400 
so which affects all levels Pistons here

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.750 
so which affects all levels Pistons here
holding<00:01:53.820> this<00:01:53.970> water<00:01:54.240> bag<00:01:54.680> and<00:01:55.680> then<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.610> it's

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
holding this water bag and then but it's

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.230 
holding this water bag and then but it's
also<00:01:56.910> connected<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.280> top<00:01:59.520> one<00:01:59.550> is<00:01:59.880> also

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
also connected to this top one is also

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.130 
also connected to this top one is also
connected<00:02:00.510> to<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:01.020> based<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.520> so<00:02:02.840> when<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.870> hit

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
connected to this based on so when I hit

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.500 
connected to this based on so when I hit
the<00:02:04.200> switch<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:05.340> I'll<00:02:05.700> cut<00:02:05.940> this<00:02:06.090> water<00:02:06.330> off

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
the switch and I'll cut this water off

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.770 
the switch and I'll cut this water off
first<00:02:06.870> and<00:02:07.170> then<00:02:07.920> after<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> little<00:02:08.280> delay<00:02:08.790> this

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
first and then after a little delay this

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.470 
first and then after a little delay this
one<00:02:10.110> will<00:02:10.229> come<00:02:10.380> out<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.430> then<00:02:11.880> when<00:02:12.240> I<00:02:12.270> turn

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
one will come out and then when I turn

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.080 
one will come out and then when I turn
back<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.690> just<00:02:12.840> flip<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.650> switch<00:02:13.830> again<00:02:14.090> this

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
back I just flip the switch again this

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.280 
back I just flip the switch again this
one<00:02:15.420> will<00:02:15.600> cut<00:02:15.810> off<00:02:15.840> or<00:02:16.200> meet<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.340> alone

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.600 

okay<00:02:23.180> I'll<00:02:24.180> flip<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.630> switch<00:02:25.370> first<00:02:26.370> time

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
okay I'll flip the switch first time

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.940 
okay I'll flip the switch first time
this<00:02:26.910> will<00:02:27.120> close<00:02:27.420> stopping<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:28.440> water<00:02:28.709> and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
this will close stopping this water and

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.440 
this will close stopping this water and
then<00:02:29.370> after<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.640> little<00:02:29.670> delay<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.209> will<00:02:30.300> let

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
then after a little delay it will let

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.140 
then after a little delay it will let
this<00:02:30.600> stuff<00:02:30.810> out<00:02:31.020> I<00:02:31.700> want<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.790> flip<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.030> again

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
this stuff out I want to flip it again

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.150 
this stuff out I want to flip it again
these<00:02:33.930> Pistons<00:02:34.380> will<00:02:34.530> close<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.070> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
these Pistons will close and the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.070 
these Pistons will close and the
launcher<00:02:35.459> delay<00:02:35.790> this<00:02:36.330> one<00:02:36.600> will<00:02:36.690> open<00:02:36.990> again

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
launcher delay this one will open again

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.960 
launcher delay this one will open again
releasing<00:02:37.530> this<00:02:37.740> one<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.520> reason<00:02:38.760> there's<00:02:38.910> a

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
releasing this one the reason there's a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.020 
releasing this one the reason there's a
delay<00:02:39.620> if<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.770> water<00:02:40.950> comes<00:02:41.250> through<00:02:41.370> here

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
delay if the water comes through here

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.240 
delay if the water comes through here
and<00:02:42.150> hits<00:02:42.360> this<00:02:42.570> then<00:02:42.930> it'll<00:02:43.440> drag<00:02:43.800> some<00:02:44.070> this

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
and hits this then it'll drag some this

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.090 
and hits this then it'll drag some this
water<00:02:44.459> back<00:02:44.760> out<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.300> I'll<00:02:45.780> stay<00:02:46.110> here<00:02:46.440> even

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
water back out and I'll stay here even

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.160 
water back out and I'll stay here even
if<00:02:47.310> these<00:02:47.489> Pistons<00:02:47.940> closed<00:02:48.180> because<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.870> don't

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
if these Pistons closed because I don't

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.600 
if these Pistons closed because I don't
know<00:02:49.260> why<00:02:49.410> water<00:02:49.620> mechanics<00:02:50.130> do<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.400> um<00:02:52.610> it's

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
know why water mechanics do that um it's

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.560 
know why water mechanics do that um it's
pretty<00:02:53.670> much<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:54.920> this<00:02:55.970> design<00:02:56.970> all<00:02:57.390> the

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
pretty much of this this design all the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.620 
pretty much of this this design all the
way<00:02:57.690> down<00:02:58.370> let's<00:02:59.370> see<00:02:59.550> i<00:02:59.580> have<00:02:59.900> glowstone<00:03:02.630> each

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
way down let's see i have glowstone each

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.479 
way down let's see i have glowstone each
area<00:03:04.260> so<00:03:04.769> they<00:03:04.890> grow<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:07.800> ladder<00:03:08.040> here<00:03:08.370> you

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
area so they grow the ladder here you

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:14.930 
area so they grow the ladder here you
come<00:03:08.670> up<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.970> each<00:03:09.150> level<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.860> took<00:03:11.370> about<00:03:13.940> 10

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
come up to each level it took about 10

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.790 
come up to each level it took about 10
minutes<00:03:15.709> to<00:03:16.709> replant<00:03:17.250> all<00:03:17.489> of<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:18.680> all<00:03:19.680> right

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
minutes to replant all of this all right

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.560 
minutes to replant all of this all right
let's<00:03:20.070> get<00:03:20.190> this<00:03:20.340> let's<00:03:20.760> get<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.060> going<00:03:21.239> i

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
let's get this let's get this going i

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.710 
let's get this let's get this going i
give<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.560> demonstration<00:03:23.570> and<00:03:24.570> i'll

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
give you a demonstration and i'll

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.360 
give you a demonstration and i'll
probably<00:03:24.930> give<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.260> guys<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.530> map<00:03:25.860> download

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
probably give you guys a map download

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.370 
probably give you guys a map download
too<00:03:26.549> because<00:03:26.850> when<00:03:27.330> we<00:03:28.130> copy<00:03:29.130> this<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:30.380> didn't

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
too because when we copy this I didn't

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.110 
too because when we copy this I didn't
build<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.680> little<00:03:31.890> bit<00:03:32.040> i<00:03:32.190> just<00:03:32.400> did<00:03:32.549> /<00:03:32.790> stack

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
build the little bit i just did / stack

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.670 
build the little bit i just did / stack
all<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.420> way<00:03:33.540> down<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:33.900> can<00:03:34.080> only<00:03:34.110> imagine<00:03:34.320> how

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
all the way down I can only imagine how

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.770 
all the way down I can only imagine how
long<00:03:34.890> it<00:03:34.950> would<00:03:35.160> take<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:37.230> in<00:03:37.950> sec<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:42.750> then

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
long it would take so in sec and then

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.199 
long it would take so in sec and then
make<00:03:43.260> my<00:03:43.500> game<00:03:43.769> boys<00:03:44.040> 0<00:03:45.950> throw<00:03:46.950> some<00:03:47.370> stuff<00:03:47.910> I

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
make my game boys 0 throw some stuff I

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.550 
make my game boys 0 throw some stuff I
am<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:50.299> really<00:03:51.299> hate<00:03:51.480> long<00:03:52.700> okay

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
am I really hate long okay

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.650 
am I really hate long okay
Oh

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.880 

is<00:04:02.260> an<00:04:02.500> action<00:04:02.800> fly<00:04:03.760> pretty<00:04:04.000> quick<00:04:04.530> or<00:04:05.530> I'll<00:04:05.710> go

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
is an action fly pretty quick or I'll go

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.120 
is an action fly pretty quick or I'll go
to<00:04:06.130> on<00:04:06.450> this<00:04:07.450> room<00:04:07.720> right<00:04:07.900> here<00:04:07.960> to<00:04:08.890> show<00:04:09.070> you

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
to on this room right here to show you

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:24.350 
to on this room right here to show you
guys<00:04:09.220> what<00:04:09.610> all<00:04:09.730> things<00:04:09.970> with<00:04:10.240> the<00:04:10.330> piston

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.469 

alright<00:04:25.080> we're<00:04:25.229> back<00:04:26.030> sorry<00:04:27.030> about<00:04:27.090> the<00:04:27.270> lag

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
alright we're back sorry about the lag

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.939 
alright we're back sorry about the lag
um<00:04:28.069> honor<00:04:29.069> seven<00:04:30.259> you<00:04:31.259> will<00:04:31.409> not<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.740> lag

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:31.949 
um honor seven you will not that lag

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:35.089 
um honor seven you will not that lag
problem<00:04:32.430> because<00:04:32.759> the<00:04:33.060> item<00:04:33.469> sprites<00:04:34.469> joined

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
problem because the item sprites joined

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.360 
problem because the item sprites joined
together<00:04:35.280> to<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.169> really<00:04:37.830> only<00:04:37.860> end<00:04:38.219> up

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
together to so you really only end up

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.559 
together to so you really only end up
with<00:04:38.550> one<00:04:38.879> sprite<00:04:39.300> per<00:04:39.659> stack<00:04:40.020> and<00:04:40.490> center

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:41.569 
with one sprite per stack and center

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.499 
with one sprite per stack and center
only<00:04:42.569> supposed<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:42.960> get<00:04:43.139> about<00:04:43.759> 34<00:04:44.759> stacks<00:04:45.120> so

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:45.509 
only supposed to get about 34 stacks so

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.990 
only supposed to get about 34 stacks so
it'd<00:04:45.629> only<00:04:45.750> be<00:04:45.870> 34<00:04:46.439> I'm<00:04:46.620> fine<00:04:46.860> so<00:04:47.129> any<00:04:47.490> computer

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
it'd only be 34 I'm fine so any computer

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.879 
it'd only be 34 I'm fine so any computer
can<00:04:48.180> handle<00:04:48.210> that<00:04:48.629> so<00:04:49.379> um<00:04:50.449> at<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.509> end<00:04:51.740> this<00:04:52.740> is

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
can handle that so um at the end this is

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:56.420 
can handle that so um at the end this is
how<00:04:53.009> much<00:04:53.189> I<00:04:53.280> have<00:04:55.069> calculate<00:04:56.069> it<00:04:56.219> really

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
how much I have calculate it really

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.140 
how much I have calculate it really
quick<00:04:57.319> there's<00:04:58.319> 27<00:04:58.919> levels<00:04:59.219> and<00:04:59.639> you<00:04:59.699> get<00:05:00.000> a

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
quick there's 27 levels and you get a

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.659 
quick there's 27 levels and you get a
deeper<00:05:00.479> level<00:05:01.050> cuz<00:05:01.830> it's<00:05:02.009> nine<00:05:02.189> times<00:05:02.460> nine

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
deeper level cuz it's nine times nine

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.850 
deeper level cuz it's nine times nine
minus<00:05:03.000> one<00:05:03.860> type<00:05:04.860> 80<00:05:05.039> x<00:05:05.490> 27<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.930> get<00:05:07.229> a<00:05:07.259> total<00:05:07.770> of

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
minus one type 80 x 27 to get a total of

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:14.779 
minus one type 80 x 27 to get a total of
twenty<00:05:09.199> 2160<00:05:10.199> we<00:05:10.789> 2116<00:05:11.789> wheat<00:05:13.400> see<00:05:14.400> just<00:05:14.639> sort

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:14.789 
twenty 2160 we 2116 wheat see just sort

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.320 
twenty 2160 we 2116 wheat see just sort
of<00:05:14.819> random<00:05:15.240> because<00:05:15.389> how<00:05:15.750> many<00:05:15.810> I<00:05:16.110> got<00:05:17.240> do<00:05:18.240> you

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
of random because how many I got do you

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.719 
of random because how many I got do you
run<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.319> little<00:05:19.710> more<00:05:19.889> than<00:05:20.099> we<00:05:20.930> will<00:05:21.930> yes<00:05:22.729> hope

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
run a little more than we will yes hope

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.999 
run a little more than we will yes hope
you<00:05:23.849> guys<00:05:24.029> like<00:05:25.340> this<00:05:26.340> is<00:05:26.939> a<00:05:27.139> farm<00:05:28.139> idea<00:05:28.620> I

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
you guys like this is a farm idea I

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.499 
you guys like this is a farm idea I
think<00:05:29.400> it's<00:05:29.520> very<00:05:29.580> efficient<00:05:30.089> because<00:05:30.270> it

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:30.509 
think it's very efficient because it

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:34.749 
think it's very efficient because it
only<00:05:30.629> took<00:05:30.839> 10<00:05:31.050> minutes<00:05:31.080> three<00:05:31.500> plan<00:05:31.909> um<00:05:33.020> and

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 
only took 10 minutes three plan um and

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:37.189 
only took 10 minutes three plan um and
I'm<00:05:35.759> probably<00:05:36.150> going<00:05:36.629> to<00:05:36.719> build<00:05:36.900> this<00:05:36.990> on

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:37.199 
I'm probably going to build this on

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.970 
I'm probably going to build this on
server<00:05:37.469> somewhere

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:39.980 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.820 

see<00:05:40.730> ya
