00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.090

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.309
 the form factor device is called 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.289
 transformer and we all know what a leader 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.640
 among such devices are up to the company asus 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.080
 today we will look at the most 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.010
 best transform companies 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.380
 they are called 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.900
 transformer book chi in three modifications 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.779
 model for 12 and a half heroes for 10 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.960
 inches and 8 sec tenth inches let's 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.480
 watch this transformer book t300 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.760
 flagship model of asus with one 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.050
 sides this is the thinnest windows tablet 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.739
 the world on the other hand is the most 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.020
 heaped 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.420
 transformer too in our world 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.129
 specifications are different 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.170
 do not happen 8 gigabytes of RAM 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.700
 or four gigabytes of RAM 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.059
 internal space is with 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.539
 only 64 gigabytes either at 128 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.699
 gigabyte 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.250
 This model is completed with top 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.930
 intel core m processor is very 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.629
 cool solution for this form factor 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.940
 device out it works fast the most 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.070
 the main thing is very very long this 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.090
 devices super super display with 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.979
 2560 by 1440 resolution per inch 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.510
 work of course it's all on windows and 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.119
 I think that with the bark of time here you can 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.460
 will roll in windows 10 it remains 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.270
 will be even cooler as regards the price 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.729
 transformer book t300 costs a lot 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.610
 699 dollars but what did you want for such 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.680
 thin transformer is not a sin to give such 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.299
 money keyboard here is attached very 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.770
 very tight it doesnâ€™t tear off at all 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.810
 while it connects not dock 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.060
 the station is working on bluetooth sculptures not 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.159
 little important these are two transformer models 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.990
 book t100 and t90 in principle 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.730
 they are little technical characteristics 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.400
 only diagonals differ 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.950
 sing and here or wav and 8 and 9 inches 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.140
 internal memory 32 gigabytes and 64 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.880
 gigabyte and 2 gigabytes each model 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.680
 RAM and here of course 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.810
 intel core m processors 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.950
 These models are processor intel 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.640
 atom z 37 75c on them is also a different model 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.610
 for 10 inches costs 499 euros and 8 and 9 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.470
 inches costs 299 euros in principle very 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.660
 affordable solution is compact and affordable 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.370
 the solution is very easy and can be thin 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.770
 take in a bag to work on 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.300
 a trip to the disco where you want to 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.860
 asus transformer book chi got 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.690
 a large number of awards and in principle 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.670
 were very interesting devices a 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.410
 here with the release of windows 10 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.570
 their relevance is even greater 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.780
 this is what increases these ces 2015 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.370
 the reward is not just friends put 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.960
