so<00:02:16.700> your<00:02:16.880> auto<00:02:17.030> attack<00:02:17.360> is<00:02:17.510> probably<00:02:17.750> going<00:02:17.900> to

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
so your auto attack is probably going to

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.780 
so your auto attack is probably going to
end<00:02:18.019> up<00:02:18.230> doing<00:02:18.560> more<00:02:19.340> damage<00:02:19.489> in<00:02:19.760> the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
end up doing more damage in the

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.640 
end up doing more damage in the
scattershot<00:02:20.209> will<00:02:20.510> anyways<00:02:20.870> so<00:02:21.290> why<00:02:21.500> even

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
scattershot will anyways so why even

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.400 
scattershot will anyways so why even
bother<00:02:21.890> getting<00:02:22.160> it<00:02:23.260> especially<00:02:24.260> when<00:02:24.319> you
