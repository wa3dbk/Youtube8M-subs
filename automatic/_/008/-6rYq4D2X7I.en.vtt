the<00:00:00.210> games<00:00:00.659> one<00:00:01.110> describes<00:00:01.890> as<00:00:02.159> gateway<00:00:02.550> games

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
the games one describes as gateway games

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.930 
the games one describes as gateway games
are<00:00:03.230> probably<00:00:04.230> my<00:00:04.589> favorite<00:00:04.620> area<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.670> games

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
are probably my favorite area of games

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.750 
are probably my favorite area of games
but<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:06.870> that's<00:00:07.259> what<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.040> have<00:00:08.400> time<00:00:08.730> for

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
but that that's what I have time for

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.060 
but that that's what I have time for
these<00:00:09.120> days<00:00:09.420> and<00:00:09.809> and<00:00:10.500> I've<00:00:10.620> always<00:00:10.800> liked

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
these days and and I've always liked

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.720 
these days and and I've always liked
those<00:00:12.559> sort<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.860> some<00:00:13.920> sense<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.429> would<00:00:14.580> say

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
those sort of in some sense I would say

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.849 
those sort of in some sense I would say
one<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> greatest<00:00:15.360> gateway<00:00:16.289> games<00:00:16.560> is

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
one of the greatest gateway games is

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.730 
one of the greatest gateway games is
poker<00:00:17.130> right<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:18.600> can<00:00:18.779> play<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.170> for<00:00:19.710> a

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
poker right you can play it as for a

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.920 
poker right you can play it as for a
short<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.189> time<00:00:20.310> as<00:00:20.460> you<00:00:20.490> like<00:00:20.760> or<00:00:21.000> as<00:00:21.029> long<00:00:21.869> a

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
like or as casual easy way so when

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.740 
like or as casual easy way so when
people<00:00:28.109> say<00:00:28.820> gateway<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.119> filler<00:00:30.390> games

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
people say gateway and filler games

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.970 
people say gateway and filler games
often<00:00:31.470> times<00:00:31.740> those<00:00:32.489> terms<00:00:33.380> don't<00:00:34.380> carry<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
often times those terms don't carry the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.620 
often times those terms don't carry the
depth<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.489> love<00:00:35.700> I<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.090> for<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.360> category

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
depth of love I have for that category

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.180 
depth of love I have for that category
and<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.170> think<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.440> underestimates<00:00:38.010> their

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
and I think it underestimates their

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.330 
and I think it underestimates their
potential<00:00:38.719> when<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.750> was<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.710> graduate

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
potential when I was a in graduate

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.569 
potential when I was a in graduate
school<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.579> mathematics<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.420> had<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.719> game

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
school in mathematics I had this game

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.600 
school in mathematics I had this game
called<00:00:44.579> Robo<00:00:45.329> rally<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.950> in<00:00:46.950> fact<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.250> designed

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
called Robo rally and in fact I designed

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.619 
called Robo rally and in fact I designed
it<00:00:47.730> many<00:00:48.000> years<00:00:48.059> before<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.610> we<00:00:50.629> had

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
it many years before that and we had

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.540 
it many years before that and we had
tried<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.350> find<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.590> publisher<00:00:52.949> for<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.340> game

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
tried to find a publisher for this game

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.389 
tried to find a publisher for this game
for<00:00:53.579> seven<00:00:54.449> years<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.440> we'd<00:00:55.860> had<00:00:56.070> people

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
for seven years and we'd had people

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.040 
for seven years and we'd had people
actually<00:00:56.670> pay<00:00:57.000> us<00:00:57.120> money<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.629> say<00:00:57.750> they<00:00:57.899> would

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
actually pay us money and say they would

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930 
actually pay us money and say they would
publish<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.710> then<00:00:59.010> sit<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.609> for<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> year

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
publish it and then sit on it for a year

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.029 
publish it and then sit on it for a year
or<00:01:00.359> two<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.780> then<00:01:00.899> give<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.109> back<00:01:01.289> but

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
or two and then give it back but

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.479 
or two and then give it back but
eventually<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.969> found<00:01:03.329> Wizards<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.870> coast

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
eventually we found Wizards of the coast

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.240 
eventually we found Wizards of the coast
who<00:01:07.220> were<00:01:08.220> young<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.729> naive<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.360> had<00:01:10.350> lots<00:01:11.100> of

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
who were young and naive and had lots of

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.370 
who were young and naive and had lots of
ambitions<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.689> were<00:01:12.750> very

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
ambitions and so they were very

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.800 
ambitions and so they were very
interested<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:13.890> doing<00:01:14.100> roborally

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
interested in doing roborally

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.749 
interested in doing roborally
but<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.960> was<00:01:16.080> too<00:01:16.170> expensive<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.369> they

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
but it was too expensive and so they

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.060 
but it was too expensive and so they
asked<00:01:18.000> me<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.119> come<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.509> with<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> game<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.710> was

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
asked me to come up with a game that was

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.450 
asked me to come up with a game that was
cheaper<00:01:20.460> than<00:01:20.520> roborally<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:22.280> after<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.310> met

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
cheaper than roborally and after I met

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.120 
cheaper than roborally and after I met
with<00:01:23.490> them<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:24.409> came<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.740> idea<00:01:25.920> for

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
with them I came up with this idea for

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.510 
with them I came up with this idea for
trading<00:01:27.000> card<00:01:27.270> game<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:28.189> asked<00:01:29.189> them<00:01:29.310> about

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
trading card game and asked them about

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
trading card game and asked them about
that<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.060> Peter<00:01:30.630> Adkison<00:01:31.140> who<00:01:31.229> was<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
that and Peter Adkison who was the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.499 
that and Peter Adkison who was the
president<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.070> wizards<00:01:32.430> at<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.610> time<00:01:32.790> was

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
president of wizards at the time was

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.890 
president of wizards at the time was
very<00:01:34.110> excited<00:01:34.560> about<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.890> idea<00:01:35.009> it<00:01:35.729> became<00:01:36.119> so

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
very excited about the idea it became so

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.260 
very excited about the idea it became so
successful<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.790> that<00:01:38.790> within<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.240> couple

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
successful that that within a couple

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.749 
successful that that within a couple
years<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.900> it<00:01:40.049> coming<00:01:40.619> out<00:01:40.740> within<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.579> year

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
years of it coming out within one year

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.060 
years of it coming out within one year
of<00:01:41.790> coming<00:01:42.180> out<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.299> left<00:01:42.950> teaching<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:46.070> since

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
of coming out I left teaching and since

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.260 
of coming out I left teaching and since
then<00:01:47.220> I've<00:01:47.340> been<00:01:47.430> working<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:47.759> games<00:01:47.880> I

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
then I've been working on games I

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.780 
then I've been working on games I
certainly<00:01:48.990> didn't<00:01:49.320> anticipate<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
certainly didn't anticipate it in the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.940 
certainly didn't anticipate it in the
sense<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.090> I've<00:01:51.630> seen<00:01:51.930> many<00:01:52.470> many<00:01:52.560> games

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
sense that I've seen many many games

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.069 
sense that I've seen many many games
before<00:01:53.369> which<00:01:54.000> were<00:01:54.210> very<00:01:54.390> good<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:54.960> were

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
before which were very good but were

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.980 
before which were very good but were
very<00:01:55.649> small<00:01:56.009> so<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.759> see<00:01:57.000> magic<00:01:57.479> blow<00:01:57.689> up<00:01:57.840> like

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
very small so to see magic blow up like

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.200 
very small so to see magic blow up like
that<00:01:58.229> was<00:01:58.500> was<00:01:59.689> gratifying<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.049> unexpected

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
that was was gratifying and unexpected

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.240 
that was was gratifying and unexpected
and<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.570> still<00:02:04.110> surprises<00:02:04.530> me<00:02:04.890> what<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> think
