00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 hello dear gardeners visitors 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.969
 of our website garden world today we are 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:18.509
 Visiting Svetlana Ivanovna Kalashnikova 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.570
 in her wonderful garden we will have 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:24.660
 several videos we will tell and 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.520
 about flowers and design about roses 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.300
 check and see if anyone 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:32.759
 interesting we begin our story with her 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.340
 greenhouses she is quite small here 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.040
 because the focus is on 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.280
 still an ornamental plant but here 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.100
 as they say in the hands of the master everything is fine 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:48.050
 growing and now look at 16 today 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:52.140
 June is already hanging such a crop 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.890
 large enough tomatoes there in here 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.010
 the country is already turning red blush tomatoes 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.620
 and cucumbers are already collected here 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:06.240
 any and there is a secret svetlana 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.570
 bath but here mostly seems to me 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.940
 here 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.120
 success is what i do 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.570
 warm beds after all late autumn 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.700
 in the fall when all the harvest is done I do 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.350
 roig the second tranche these are such small 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.080
 lay remove all rubbish wisdom 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.960
 equal vegetable garbage then 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.720
 bury it all 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.600
 zemkomka and in the spring it all starts 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.080
 overheating are planted tomatoes have to he there 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.670
 heat to the spines and food is still 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.130
 additional here I think all the same 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.600
 this is the main success in 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.920
 the fact that tomatoes are still tomatoes 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.840
 ripen earlier than other gardeners 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.870
 here look still planted here 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.480
 marigolds it is completely no coincidence for 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.290
 what do you plant it is considered that 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.780
 marigold 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.850
 deter pests especially 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.510
 whitefly which is very hard 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.580
 fight 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:08.060
 our zaanta is so cute to kill 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.070
 for insect he advertises everything 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.050
 breeding so she is very fast 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.450
 multiplies and drugs accounted for 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.370
 apply many times but on such 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.000
 early maturing cultures especially like 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.890
 cucumbers his tomatoes one after another 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.370
 it doesnâ€™t really want 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.350
 do well that's probably still very 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.290
 good airing here goes too 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.460
 probably less disease before 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.520
 airing there and you're because 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.050
 love open legs, head therefore 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.730
 this type of person I feel sorry for her 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.600
 parting with the film greenhouse and 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.720
 because in hot and so i open 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.930
 open the sheep 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.630
 tomatoes are tied right here now 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.030
 many complained that it was hot 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.280
 weather and tomatoes are not with your visa here 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.890
 all beautiful first tassels here 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.890
 particularly the very hot steam was when 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.410
 here all the same will turn clear well here still 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.890
 tell me about the varieties you have 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.050
 take away your seeds already plant well in 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.800
 mostly yes and their seeds 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.739
 Well, like the avid gardeners want 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.959
 of course try something new here 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.030
 This year I am the first time though the software seems to be 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:23.660
 would not be very much but planted pink honey 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:27.290
 pretty pretty pink variety in general 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.750
 here's another method that's what I want 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.320
 pay attention to one trunk 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:37.070
 all tomatoes are formed yes not necessarily 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:41.630
 in 1 you can here first one way 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:43.730
 then drink well, here's one two trunks up in 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.400
 one barrel is set to 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.690
 early get some ultimate home 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.780
 then it is somewhat literally plants in 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.940
 mainly in the two tables 2 and falls and 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.700
 I also want to pay attention 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.680
 everywhere look stepchildren all deleted 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.140
 that's just a little somewhere here 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.570
 growing up and svetlana bathroom here here 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.090
 so here quickly removes I want 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:10.190
 apologize to our gardeners 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.670

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.489
