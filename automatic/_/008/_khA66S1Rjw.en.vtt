to do shields again but this time not on

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.570 
to do shields again but this time not on
the<00:00:09.240> Crusader<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.900> want<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.920> do<00:00:11.010> it<00:00:11.130> on<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.280> barb

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
the Crusader I want to do it on a barb

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.970 
the Crusader I want to do it on a barb
just<00:00:11.880> to<00:00:12.090> see<00:00:12.330> you<00:00:13.170> know<00:00:13.200> if<00:00:13.620> there's<00:00:13.889> a

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
just to see you know if there's a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.570 
just to see you know if there's a
difference<00:00:14.460> in<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.089> targeted<00:00:15.750> loop<00:00:16.580> although

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
difference in the targeted loop although

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.370 
difference in the targeted loop although
for<00:00:17.850> some<00:00:18.000> reason<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.630> guys<00:00:18.750> can<00:00:18.960> see<00:00:19.020> i'm

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
for some reason as you guys can see i'm

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.950 
for some reason as you guys can see i'm
still<00:00:19.410> getting<00:00:19.710> quite<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> few<00:00:20.960> crusader

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
still getting quite a few crusader

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.290 
still getting quite a few crusader
shields<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.650> maybe<00:00:22.920> there<00:00:23.369> actually<00:00:23.939> is<00:00:24.119> no

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
shields so maybe there actually is no

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.089 
shields so maybe there actually is no
difference<00:00:24.710> we<00:00:25.710> should<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> little

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
difference we should be a little

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.460 
difference we should be a little
surprising<00:00:26.460> because<00:00:27.170> you<00:00:28.170> know<00:00:28.260> i<00:00:28.289> would

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
surprising because you know i would

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.999 
surprising because you know i would
think<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:29.929> loot<00:00:30.929> table<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.590> crusader

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
think that the loot table for a crusader

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.400 
think that the loot table for a crusader
would<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> little<00:00:32.550> bit<00:00:32.669> higher<00:00:33.290> when<00:00:34.290> you're

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
would be a little bit higher when you're

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.400 
would be a little bit higher when you're
gambling<00:00:34.530> these<00:00:35.750> verses<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.170> barb

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
gambling these verses just on a barb

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.869 
gambling these verses just on a barb
where<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> would<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:37.980> get<00:00:38.070> regular<00:00:38.280> shields

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
where you would just get regular shields

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.690 
where you would just get regular shields
but<00:00:39.149> maybe<00:00:39.690> that's<00:00:39.989> not<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.379> case<00:00:40.700> we're

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
but maybe that's not the case we're

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.700 
but maybe that's not the case we're
still<00:00:41.879> trying<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.329> figure<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.410> lot<00:00:43.590> of

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
still trying to figure out a lot of

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.400 
still trying to figure out a lot of
things<00:00:43.890> about<00:00:47.329> you<00:00:48.329> know<00:00:48.420> how<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:49.200> actually

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
things about you know how this actually

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.189 
things about you know how this actually
works<00:00:49.620> there<00:00:50.460> are<00:00:50.550> some<00:00:50.760> theories<00:00:51.270> around<00:00:52.940> and

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
works there are some theories around and

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.000 
works there are some theories around and
shields<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.289> one<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.469> those<00:00:55.559> things<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.890> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
shields are one of those things that I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.720 
shields are one of those things that I
actually<00:00:56.190> been<00:00:56.610> very<00:00:56.910> very<00:00:57.120> unlucky<00:00:57.600> on<00:00:57.870> I

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
actually been very very unlucky on I

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.539 
actually been very very unlucky on I
have<00:00:59.730> now<00:01:00.030> gone<00:01:00.420> through<00:01:00.890> 1,500<00:01:01.890> shards<00:01:02.340> and

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.250 

one<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.640> them<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:06.090> know<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.450> showed<00:01:07.170> you

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
one of them you know and I showed you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.570 
one of them you know and I showed you
guys<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> Crusader<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.460> other

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
guys with the Crusader the other

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.940 
guys with the Crusader the other
thousand<00:01:09.180> i<00:01:09.390> did<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.049> barb<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.619> actually<00:01:10.860> got

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
thousand i did on barb and actually got

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.820 
thousand i did on barb and actually got
nothing<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.229> looking<00:01:13.409> very<00:01:13.590> good

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
nothing and it's not looking very good

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.609 
nothing and it's not looking very good
right<00:01:13.979> now<00:01:14.159> either<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:14.909> maybe<00:01:15.210> it's<00:01:15.659> just<00:01:15.810> like

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
right now either so maybe it's just like

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.530 
right now either so maybe it's just like
I<00:01:16.830> don't<00:01:16.950> know<00:01:17.040> reading<00:01:17.280> shields<00:01:18.240> are<00:01:18.330> just

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
I don't know reading shields are just

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.010 
I don't know reading shields are just
really<00:01:18.810> bad<00:01:18.990> i<00:01:20.090> just<00:01:21.090> don't<00:01:21.240> really<00:01:21.390> get<00:01:21.780> any

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
just really good on a crusader and not a

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.350

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
barb but I'm looking for storm shield

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
videos where I've actually recorded 500

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.460 
videos where I've actually recorded 500
shards<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.470> didn't<00:01:50.399> get<00:01:50.490> anything<00:01:51.320> and<00:01:52.320> then

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
