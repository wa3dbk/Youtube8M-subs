demonstration<00:00:40.179> I<00:00:41.140> need<00:00:41.710> to<00:00:41.859> do<00:00:42.010> something<00:00:42.550> a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
demonstration I need to do something a

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.939 
demonstration I need to do something a
little<00:00:42.699> different<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:44.170> principle<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:44.829> still

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
little different the principle is still

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.610 
little different the principle is still
the<00:00:45.100> same<00:00:45.429> but<00:00:46.089> I'm<00:00:46.269> actually<00:00:46.569> going<00:00:47.050> to<00:00:47.170> color

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
the same but I'm actually going to color

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.739 
the same but I'm actually going to color
my<00:00:47.920> dough<00:00:48.510> with<00:00:49.510> spinach<00:00:50.140> use<00:00:51.010> about<00:00:51.969> 50<00:00:52.479> grams

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:52.749 
my dough with spinach use about 50 grams

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:55.919 
my dough with spinach use about 50 grams
2<00:00:53.289> ounces<00:00:53.800> of<00:00:54.339> cooked<00:00:54.909> and<00:00:55.359> very<00:00:55.600> finely

2 ounces of cooked and very finely
chopped<00:00:56.440> spinach<00:00:56.729> you<00:00:57.729> could<00:00:57.940> use<00:00:58.120> a<00:00:58.149> little

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
chopped spinach you could use a little

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.329 
chopped spinach you could use a little
more<00:00:58.780> it<00:00:59.260> would<00:00:59.409> just<00:00:59.620> mean<00:00:59.829> that<00:00:59.859> the<00:01:00.100> color

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:00.339 
more it would just mean that the color

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:02.369 
more it would just mean that the color
of<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:00.699> dough<00:01:00.999> would<00:01:01.239> be<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:01.449> little<00:01:01.749> deeper<00:01:02.199> or

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
of the dough would be a little deeper or

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.880 
of the dough would be a little deeper or
a<00:01:02.679> little<00:01:03.280> less<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:04.510> can<00:01:04.659> also<00:01:04.839> use<00:01:05.350> other

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
a little less you can also use other

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.370 
a little less you can also use other
pureed<00:01:06.670> vegetables<00:01:06.700> for<00:01:07.690> different<00:01:08.020> colors

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
pureed vegetables for different colors

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.430 
pureed vegetables for different colors
such<00:01:08.710> as<00:01:09.010> carrots<00:01:09.880> for<00:01:10.210> a<00:01:10.270> very<00:01:10.450> deep<00:01:10.840> orange

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
such as carrots for a very deep orange

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.790 
such as carrots for a very deep orange
or<00:01:12.630> something<00:01:13.630> like<00:01:13.750> beetroot<00:01:14.320> which<00:01:14.560> would

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
or something like beetroot which would

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.340 
or something like beetroot which would
give<00:01:14.980> a<00:01:15.010> lovely<00:01:15.520> purple<00:01:15.790> color<00:01:16.350> however

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
give a lovely purple color however

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.770 
give a lovely purple color however
whenever<00:01:17.620> you're<00:01:18.010> using<00:01:18.750> pureed<00:01:19.750> vegetables

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
whenever you're using pureed vegetables

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.580 
whenever you're using pureed vegetables
in<00:01:20.470> this<00:01:20.620> way<00:01:20.890> you<00:01:21.880> actually<00:01:22.120> have<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.960> reduce

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
in this way you actually have to reduce

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.460 
in this way you actually have to reduce
the<00:01:23.860> amount<00:01:24.100> of<00:01:24.280> eggs<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:25.390> instead<00:01:25.720> of<00:01:25.780> 2<00:01:26.260> eggs

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
the amount of eggs so instead of 2 eggs

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.240 
the amount of eggs so instead of 2 eggs
you<00:01:27.310> just<00:01:27.610> use<00:01:27.790> one<00:01:28.060> egg<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.710> I'll<00:01:29.800> just<00:01:30.010> take

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
you just use one egg so I'll just take

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.540 
you just use one egg so I'll just take
the<00:01:30.460> equivalent<00:01:30.880> of<00:01:31.000> one<00:01:31.270> egg<00:01:31.860> out<00:01:32.860> of<00:01:32.890> this<00:01:33.280> 2

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
the equivalent of one egg out of this 2

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.010 
the equivalent of one egg out of this 2
egg<00:01:33.730> mixture<00:01:34.090> and<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:36.040> need<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.910> mix<00:01:37.390> it<00:01:37.720> with

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
egg mixture and you need to mix it with

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.460 
egg mixture and you need to mix it with
the<00:01:38.980> pureed<00:01:39.640> vegetables<00:01:39.670> in<00:01:40.540> this<00:01:40.720> case<00:01:41.050> the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
the pureed vegetables in this case the

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.600 
the pureed vegetables in this case the
spinach<00:01:42.090> before<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.330> add<00:01:43.540> it<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:44.050> the<00:01:44.920> flour

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.440 

give<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.730> a<00:01:48.880> good<00:01:49.120> mix<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:51.700> make<00:01:51.880> sure<00:01:52.090> it's<00:01:52.270> all

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
give it a good mix to make sure it's all

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.800 
give it a good mix to make sure it's all
well<00:01:52.960> incorporated<00:01:53.760> I'm<00:01:54.760> using<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.240> knife<00:01:55.450> that

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
well incorporated I'm using a knife that

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.930 
well incorporated I'm using a knife that
you<00:01:56.080> perhaps<00:01:56.350> it'd<00:01:56.530> be<00:01:56.680> better<00:01:56.860> if<00:01:57.010> I<00:01:57.220> used<00:01:57.520> a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
you perhaps it'd be better if I used a

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
you perhaps it'd be better if I used a
whisk<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.770> reason<00:02:03.190> for<00:02:03.310> doing<00:02:03.370> this<00:02:03.960> is

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
whisk and the reason for doing this is

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.620 
whisk and the reason for doing this is
so<00:02:05.260> that<00:02:05.290> when<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.250> add<00:02:06.430> it<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.790> flour<00:02:07.060> it

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
so that when you add it to the flour it

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.919 
so that when you add it to the flour it
will<00:02:07.840> be<00:02:08.050> all<00:02:08.349> quite<00:02:09.099> well<00:02:09.340> blended<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.300> so

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
will be all quite well blended and so

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.699 
will be all quite well blended and so
we'll<00:02:11.230> mix<00:02:12.040> into<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.580> flour<00:02:12.900> evenly<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.650> you

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
we'll mix into the flour evenly so you

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.500 
we'll mix into the flour evenly so you
get<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> smooth<00:02:15.900> color

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:28.510 

so<00:02:20.510> once<00:02:20.720> that's<00:02:20.960> done<00:02:21.230> take<00:02:24.880> your<00:02:25.880> flower<00:02:27.520> now

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
so once that's done take your flower now

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.940 
so once that's done take your flower now
you<00:02:28.580> should<00:02:29.000> add<00:02:29.210> quite<00:02:29.780> a<00:02:29.810> good<00:02:30.290> amount<00:02:30.470> of

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
you should add quite a good amount of

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.830 
you should add quite a good amount of
salt<00:02:31.510> because<00:02:33.550> pasta<00:02:34.550> with<00:02:34.730> no<00:02:35.000> salt<00:02:35.330> added

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
salt because pasta with no salt added

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.360 
salt because pasta with no salt added
can<00:02:36.200> tend<00:02:36.800> to<00:02:37.040> taste<00:02:37.850> very<00:02:38.120> flat<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.860> mix<00:02:40.160> the

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
can tend to taste very flat so mix the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.400 
can tend to taste very flat so mix the
salt<00:02:40.580> in<00:02:40.850> with<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.180> flour<00:02:41.450> quite<00:02:41.840> well<00:02:42.080> with<00:02:42.380> a

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
salt in with the flour quite well with a

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:54.270 
salt in with the flour quite well with a
knife<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:43.700> then<00:02:43.910> make<00:02:44.120> a<00:02:44.150> well<00:02:44.420> in<00:02:44.780> the<00:02:44.810> center

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.260 

add<00:02:55.280> your<00:02:56.180> spinach<00:02:57.050> mixture<00:02:57.790> which<00:02:58.790> is<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.060> mix

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
add your spinach mixture which is to mix

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.310 
add your spinach mixture which is to mix
with<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.660> eggs<00:03:03.490> don't<00:03:04.490> add<00:03:04.760> any<00:03:05.090> extra<00:03:05.420> water

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
with the eggs don't add any extra water

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:09.400 
with the eggs don't add any extra water
or<00:03:06.770> anything<00:03:07.010> else<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.820> then<00:03:08.540> just<00:03:08.870> start<00:03:09.230> to

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
or anything else and then just start to

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.090 
or anything else and then just start to
gradually<00:03:11.020> stir<00:03:12.020> that<00:03:12.230> around<00:03:12.410> with<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:12.830> knife

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
gradually stir that around with a knife

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.910 
gradually stir that around with a knife
and<00:03:13.700> it'll<00:03:14.510> start<00:03:14.780> collecting<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:15.650> flour

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
and it'll start collecting the flour

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:34.410 
and it'll start collecting the flour
around<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.700> edges

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:41.500 

then<00:03:35.420> you<00:03:35.600> can<00:03:35.780> start<00:03:37.780> mixing<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:40.510> more

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
then you can start mixing it more

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:50.170 
then you can start mixing it more
thoroughly<00:03:46.150> wait<00:03:47.150> until<00:03:47.570> you've<00:03:47.750> got<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:49.180> lot

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
thoroughly wait until you've got a lot

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:59.820 
thoroughly wait until you've got a lot
of<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.420> flour<00:03:50.720> mixed<00:03:51.320> in<00:03:57.760> you're<00:03:58.760> aiming<00:03:59.300> for

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
of the flour mixed in you're aiming for

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.480 
of the flour mixed in you're aiming for
a<00:04:00.830> firm<00:04:01.700> dough<00:04:02.150> that's<00:04:03.080> not<00:04:03.320> too<00:04:03.590> dry<00:04:03.920> but<00:04:04.370> it

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
a firm dough that's not too dry but it

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.270 
a firm dough that's not too dry but it
must<00:04:04.790> be<00:04:05.150> quite<00:04:05.540> firm<00:04:06.080> as<00:04:06.770> you're<00:04:06.920> going<00:04:07.100> to

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
must be quite firm as you're going to

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.300 
must be quite firm as you're going to
have<00:04:07.459> to<00:04:07.700> roll<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:07.940> out<00:04:08.560> very<00:04:09.560> thinly<00:04:10.480> and

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
have to roll it out very thinly and

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.680 
have to roll it out very thinly and
you're<00:04:13.310> just<00:04:13.520> going<00:04:13.730> to<00:04:13.820> have<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.240> feel<00:04:14.480> your

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
you're just going to have to feel your

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.400 
you're just going to have to feel your
way<00:04:14.750> because<00:04:15.110> it<00:04:15.380> rather<00:04:15.650> depends<00:04:16.190> on<00:04:17.410> the

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
way because it rather depends on the

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.430 
way because it rather depends on the
flour<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:18.950> use<00:04:19.430> and<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:19.970> size<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.510> egg<00:04:20.690> I've

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
flour you use and the size of egg I've

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.550 
flour you use and the size of egg I've
used<00:04:21.830> medium<00:04:22.550> egg<00:04:22.700> but<00:04:23.690> if<00:04:23.810> you<00:04:23.960> feel<00:04:24.260> that

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
used medium egg but if you feel that

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.810 
used medium egg but if you feel that
it's<00:04:24.710> too<00:04:25.190> wet

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
it's too wet

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.050 
it's too wet
then<00:04:26.180> just<00:04:26.419> add<00:04:26.600> a<00:04:26.630> little<00:04:26.840> more<00:04:27.050> flour<00:04:31.060> and

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
then just add a little more flour and

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.250 
then just add a little more flour and
once<00:04:32.360> that's<00:04:32.960> mainly<00:04:33.520> mixed<00:04:34.520> in<00:04:34.700> just<00:04:35.260> knead

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
once that's mainly mixed in just knead

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.680 
once that's mainly mixed in just knead
it<00:04:36.530> in<00:04:36.919> the<00:04:37.400> bowl<00:04:38.950> for<00:04:39.950> a<00:04:39.980> little<00:04:40.280> while<00:04:40.690> make

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
it in the bowl for a little while make

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.000 
it in the bowl for a little while make
sure<00:04:41.720> you<00:04:42.200> have<00:04:42.440> some<00:04:42.650> extra<00:04:43.070> flour<00:04:43.310> ready

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
sure you have some extra flour ready

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:53.920 
sure you have some extra flour ready
just<00:04:46.010> in<00:04:46.190> case<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.940> mixture<00:04:47.330> is<00:04:47.450> too<00:04:47.750> wet<00:04:52.930> and

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
just in case the mixture is too wet and

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.100 
just in case the mixture is too wet and
just<00:04:53.990> continue<00:04:54.650> kneading<00:04:54.860> it<00:04:55.130> in<00:04:55.310> the<00:04:55.430> bowl

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
just continue kneading it in the bowl

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:04.870 
just continue kneading it in the bowl
for<00:04:57.110> a<00:04:57.140> minute<00:04:57.440> or<00:04:57.620> so<00:05:01.300> then<00:05:02.710> transfer<00:05:03.710> to<00:05:04.100> a

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
for a minute or so then transfer to a

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:14.170 
for a minute or so then transfer to a
lightly<00:05:05.210> floured<00:05:06.520> surface<00:05:07.660> and<00:05:12.340> continue<00:05:13.340> to

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
lightly floured surface and continue to

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:21.610 
lightly floured surface and continue to
knead<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:15.250> for<00:05:16.250> a<00:05:16.400> good<00:05:16.729> four<00:05:17.270> minutes<00:05:18.880> and<00:05:20.620> it

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
knead it for a good four minutes and it

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.530 
knead it for a good four minutes and it
really<00:05:21.890> does<00:05:22.250> need<00:05:23.200> this<00:05:24.200> four-minute

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
really does need this four-minute

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:32.650 
really does need this four-minute
kneading<00:05:26.540> time

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:42.500 

keep<00:05:33.660> surface<00:05:34.940> well<00:05:35.940> floured<00:05:41.090> so<00:05:42.090> I've<00:05:42.270> been

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:42.510 
keep surface well floured so I've been

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.550 
keep surface well floured so I've been
needing<00:05:42.780> for<00:05:43.260> a<00:05:43.530> good<00:05:43.950> four<00:05:44.340> minutes<00:05:45.410> and<00:05:46.410> I've

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
needing for a good four minutes and I've

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.240 
needing for a good four minutes and I've
added<00:05:47.150> extra<00:05:48.150> flour<00:05:48.890> because<00:05:49.890> the<00:05:50.070> dough

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
added extra flour because the dough

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.000 
added extra flour because the dough
seemed<00:05:50.640> a<00:05:50.850> little<00:05:50.940> wet<00:05:51.360> so<00:05:52.260> you<00:05:52.320> may<00:05:52.560> well<00:05:52.800> have

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
seemed a little wet so you may well have

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.380 
seemed a little wet so you may well have
to<00:05:53.160> do<00:05:53.310> that<00:05:55.160> but<00:05:56.160> as<00:05:56.280> I<00:05:56.430> said<00:05:56.490> before<00:05:56.730> it's

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
to do that but as I said before it's

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.230 
to do that but as I said before it's
really<00:05:57.480> important<00:05:58.410> not<00:05:58.800> to<00:05:58.860> have<00:05:59.100> too<00:05:59.640> softer

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
really important not to have too softer

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.630 
really important not to have too softer
dough<00:06:00.620> because<00:06:01.620> when<00:06:01.800> you<00:06:01.890> come<00:06:02.130> to<00:06:02.310> fill<00:06:02.550> in

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640 
dough because when you come to fill in

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.990 
dough because when you come to fill in
it<00:06:02.760> and<00:06:03.510> then<00:06:03.660> handle<00:06:04.320> it<00:06:04.470> it'll<00:06:05.310> all<00:06:05.400> break

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
it and then handle it it'll all break

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.420 
it and then handle it it'll all break
apart<00:06:06.450> and<00:06:06.840> the<00:06:07.020> filling<00:06:07.380> will<00:06:07.500> fall<00:06:07.800> out<00:06:07.830> and

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
apart and the filling will fall out and

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.760 
apart and the filling will fall out and
you<00:06:09.390> won't<00:06:09.690> be<00:06:09.810> able<00:06:09.930> to<00:06:10.050> get<00:06:10.200> it<00:06:10.320> off<00:06:10.440> the<00:06:10.620> work

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
you won't be able to get it off the work

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.650 
you won't be able to get it off the work
surface<00:06:12.140> so<00:06:13.140> that's<00:06:13.620> my<00:06:14.120> four<00:06:15.120> or<00:06:15.360> five

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
surface so that's my four or five

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.090 
surface so that's my four or five
minutes<00:06:16.110> kneading<00:06:16.850> and<00:06:17.850> as<00:06:18.000> you<00:06:18.120> can<00:06:18.270> see<00:06:19.100> I've

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
minutes kneading and as you can see I've

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.500 
minutes kneading and as you can see I've
got<00:06:20.280> a<00:06:20.310> nice<00:06:20.580> springy<00:06:21.180> dough<00:06:21.980> now<00:06:23.360> there<00:06:24.360> are

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
got a nice springy dough now there are

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.920 
got a nice springy dough now there are
actually<00:06:24.690> flecks<00:06:25.410> of<00:06:25.940> spinach<00:06:26.940> visible<00:06:27.630> here

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
actually flecks of spinach visible here

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.090 
actually flecks of spinach visible here
if<00:06:28.350> you<00:06:28.830> wanted<00:06:29.220> a<00:06:29.340> completely<00:06:29.820> smooth<00:06:31.100> green

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
if you wanted a completely smooth green

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:37.180 
if you wanted a completely smooth green
finish<00:06:32.790> then<00:06:33.630> simply<00:06:34.470> puree<00:06:35.300> the<00:06:36.300> spinach

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
finish then simply puree the spinach

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.800 
finish then simply puree the spinach
before<00:06:38.190> you<00:06:38.400> start<00:06:38.730> so<00:06:39.090> that<00:06:39.120> it<00:06:39.330> really<00:06:39.570> is

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
before you start so that it really is

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.950 
before you start so that it really is
quite<00:06:40.050> liquid<00:06:40.880> so<00:06:41.880> once<00:06:42.510> you've<00:06:42.720> done<00:06:42.900> all

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 
quite liquid so once you've done all

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.760 
quite liquid so once you've done all
that<00:06:43.520> you<00:06:44.520> need<00:06:44.760> to<00:06:45.330> let<00:06:45.510> this<00:06:45.780> dough<00:06:46.080> rest<00:06:46.470> for

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
that you need to let this dough rest for

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.760 
that you need to let this dough rest for
at<00:06:47.760> least<00:06:47.940> ten<00:06:48.330> minutes<00:06:48.540> and<00:06:48.960> it<00:06:49.110> really<00:06:49.440> does

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
at least ten minutes and it really does

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.190 
at least ten minutes and it really does
make<00:06:49.800> a<00:06:50.370> difference<00:06:50.430> to<00:06:51.120> the<00:06:51.300> handling<00:06:51.870> of<00:06:52.020> the

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:52.200 
make a difference to the handling of the

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.030 
make a difference to the handling of the
dough<00:06:52.410> to<00:06:52.710> let<00:06:53.460> it<00:06:53.640> rest<00:06:54.260> 30<00:06:55.260> minutes<00:06:55.710> would<00:06:55.860> be

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.040 
dough to let it rest 30 minutes would be

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.330 
dough to let it rest 30 minutes would be
great<00:06:56.340> but<00:06:57.240> ten<00:06:57.540> minutes<00:06:57.710> fifteen<00:06:58.710> minutes<00:06:58.740> is

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
great but ten minutes fifteen minutes is

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.450 
great but ten minutes fifteen minutes is
fine<00:06:59.970> just<00:07:00.750> to<00:07:00.900> let<00:07:01.080> the<00:07:01.350> gluten<00:07:01.830> settle<00:07:02.280> down

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
fine just to let the gluten settle down

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.480 
fine just to let the gluten settle down
a<00:07:02.520> bit<00:07:02.730> so<00:07:03.480> that<00:07:03.630> when<00:07:03.780> you<00:07:03.930> roll<00:07:04.170> it<00:07:04.200> out<00:07:04.590> it'll

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:05.490 
a bit so that when you roll it out it'll

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.670 
a bit so that when you roll it out it'll
keep<00:07:05.820> its<00:07:06.060> shape<00:07:06.620> so<00:07:07.940> pop<00:07:08.940> that<00:07:09.150> into<00:07:09.680> your

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 
keep its shape so pop that into your

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.590 
keep its shape so pop that into your
bowl<00:07:12.350> cover<00:07:13.350> with<00:07:13.440> cling<00:07:13.740> film<00:07:13.890> and<00:07:14.570> in<00:07:15.570> the

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 
bowl cover with cling film and in the

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.740 
bowl cover with cling film and in the
ten<00:07:15.990> or<00:07:16.170> fifteen<00:07:16.590> minutes<00:07:16.620> that<00:07:17.190> it<00:07:17.280> will<00:07:17.460> take

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750 
ten or fifteen minutes that it will take

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.650 
ten or fifteen minutes that it will take
to<00:07:18.750> allow<00:07:18.960> that<00:07:19.020> to<00:07:19.470> rest<00:07:19.650> you<00:07:20.610> can<00:07:20.640> make<00:07:21.030> your

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 
to allow that to rest you can make your

00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:24.920 
to allow that to rest you can make your
filling<00:07:22.080> and<00:07:22.290> your<00:07:22.650> sauce
