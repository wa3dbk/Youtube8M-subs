00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.649 
and it was in the evening and looked up
at<00:03:01.939> the<00:03:01.969> moon<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.790> these<00:03:04.969> two<00:03:05.560> really<00:03:06.560> bright

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
at the moon so these two really bright

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:10.539 
at the moon so these two really bright
stars<00:03:08.659> on<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:08.989> sky<00:03:09.079> I<00:03:09.230> didn't<00:03:10.219> know<00:03:10.310> what<00:03:10.459> it

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
stars on the sky I didn't know what it

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.300 
stars on the sky I didn't know what it
was<00:03:11.409> and<00:03:12.409> I<00:03:13.189> thought<00:03:13.219> you<00:03:13.609> know<00:03:13.989> have<00:03:14.989> to<00:03:15.310> take

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
was and I thought you know have to take

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.399 
was and I thought you know have to take
a<00:03:16.340> check<00:03:16.909> on<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.359> i<00:03:17.449> mean<00:03:17.599> i<00:03:17.719> thought<00:03:18.049> one<00:03:18.379> of

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:18.409 
a check on it i mean i thought one of

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.009 
a check on it i mean i thought one of
them<00:03:18.530> would<00:03:18.590> be<00:03:18.739> Venus<00:03:19.129> but<00:03:19.569> I<00:03:20.569> don't<00:03:20.930> think

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
them would be Venus but I don't think

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.039 
them would be Venus but I don't think
I've<00:03:21.199> ever<00:03:21.349> seen<00:03:21.680> two<00:03:23.079> bright<00:03:24.079> stars<00:03:26.049> like

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
I've ever seen two bright stars like

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.270 
I've ever seen two bright stars like
this<00:03:29.409> they<00:03:30.409> were<00:03:30.470> in<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.769> different<00:03:31.129> position

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
this they were in a different position

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.009 
this they were in a different position
when<00:03:31.729> I<00:03:31.790> was<00:03:31.909> looking<00:03:32.209> at<00:03:32.299> them<00:03:32.569> but<00:03:32.720> I<00:03:32.780> I

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
when I was looking at them but I I

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.740 
when I was looking at them but I I
wanted<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.799> make<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.849> check<00:03:35.239> on<00:03:35.449> it<00:03:35.659> and<00:03:36.430> kind<00:03:37.430> of

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
wanted to make a check on it and kind of

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.099 
wanted to make a check on it and kind of
forgot<00:03:38.750> about<00:03:38.780> it<00:03:39.109> and<00:03:39.409> then<00:03:39.530> today<00:03:40.569> i<00:03:41.569> noticed

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
forgot about it and then today i noticed

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:47.699 
forgot about it and then today i noticed
um<00:03:42.769> that<00:03:43.759> Venus<00:03:44.299> and<00:03:44.479> Jupiter<00:03:44.569> are<00:03:45.489> converging

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
um that Venus and Jupiter are converging

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:54.759 
um that Venus and Jupiter are converging
it's<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:49.239> 13th<00:03:50.239> now<00:03:51.519> tonight<00:03:53.560> they<00:03:54.560> say

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
it's the 13th now tonight they say

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.300 
it's the 13th now tonight they say
they're<00:03:54.979> going<00:03:55.069> to<00:03:55.129> be<00:03:56.199> perhaps<00:03:57.199> this<00:03:57.919> close

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
they're going to be perhaps this close

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.360 
they're going to be perhaps this close
together<00:03:58.579> I<00:03:59.090> haven't<00:03:59.870> dumb<00:04:00.229> I<00:04:00.530> haven't<00:04:01.129> seen

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
together I haven't dumb I haven't seen

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:07.179 
together I haven't dumb I haven't seen
them<00:04:02.560> probably<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.709> four<00:04:04.340> days<00:04:04.790> or<00:04:05.389> so<00:04:06.189> but

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:07.189 
them probably in four days or so but

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:11.020 
them probably in four days or so but
tonight<00:04:07.579> March<00:04:08.329> thirteenth<00:04:09.790> there's<00:04:10.790> I

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
tonight March thirteenth there's I

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.459 
tonight March thirteenth there's I
believe<00:04:11.449> they're<00:04:11.659> supposed<00:04:11.959> to<00:04:12.049> look<00:04:12.139> as

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:12.469 
believe they're supposed to look as

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:14.229 
believe they're supposed to look as
close<00:04:12.889> together<00:04:13.129> is<00:04:13.430> what<00:04:13.609> you<00:04:13.699> see<00:04:13.909> they<00:04:14.090> say

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
close together is what you see they say

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:15.399 
close together is what you see they say
they're<00:04:14.449> going<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:14.599> be<00:04:14.719> about<00:04:14.840> 10<00:04:14.989> degrees

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:15.409 
they're going to be about 10 degrees

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:19.689 
they're going to be about 10 degrees
apart<00:04:16.130> what<00:04:17.090> I've<00:04:17.239> been<00:04:17.449> seeing<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:18.280> is<00:04:19.280> more

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:19.699 
apart what I've been seeing is is more

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.670 
apart what I've been seeing is is more
like<00:04:19.909> this<00:04:20.299> but<00:04:20.989> it<00:04:21.109> is<00:04:21.139> unique<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:23.349> to<00:04:24.349> me<00:04:24.500> it

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
like this but it is unique and to me it

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.029 
like this but it is unique and to me it
certainly<00:04:25.159> is<00:04:25.460> another<00:04:26.030> sign<00:04:27.039> because

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
certainly is another sign because

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.390 
certainly is another sign because
Jupiter<00:04:28.610> is<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:28.789> king<00:04:29.300> planet

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.779 
and of course we know Yeshua is the King
king<00:04:38.099> of<00:04:38.280> kings<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:39.919> venus<00:04:40.919> is<00:04:41.190> the<00:04:41.220> morning

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789

is what they saw was Jupiter and Venus
they<00:05:04.979> were<00:05:05.039> completely<00:05:05.879> converged<00:05:06.840> so<00:05:07.139> that

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:07.349 
they were completely converged so that

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.550
