the<00:00:03.070> macbook<00:00:03.429> pro<00:00:03.639> family<00:00:04.150> really<00:00:04.750> is<00:00:04.990> a<00:00:05.410> quite

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.250 
the macbook pro family really is a quite

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.060 
the macbook pro family really is a quite
remarkable<00:00:06.910> engineering<00:00:07.080> achievement<00:00:08.080> it's

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
remarkable engineering achievement it's

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.070 
remarkable engineering achievement it's
truly<00:00:09.790> the<00:00:09.820> result<00:00:10.360> of<00:00:10.630> years<00:00:11.230> of<00:00:12.960> hard<00:00:13.960> work

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
truly the result of years of hard work

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.880 
truly the result of years of hard work
of<00:00:15.030> innovation<00:00:16.030> I<00:00:16.240> think<00:00:16.660> driven<00:00:17.560> by<00:00:17.710> this

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
of innovation I think driven by this

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.000 
of innovation I think driven by this
obsessive<00:00:18.760> attention<00:00:19.120> to<00:00:19.930> to<00:00:20.350> every<00:00:20.800> detail

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010 
obsessive attention to to every detail

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.930 
obsessive attention to to every detail
and<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:23.020> is<00:00:23.140> particularly<00:00:23.710> evident<00:00:23.890> in<00:00:24.580> the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.940 
and this is particularly evident in the

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.770 
and this is particularly evident in the
enclosure<00:00:26.700> when<00:00:27.700> traditionally<00:00:28.270> notebooks

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:28.780 
enclosure when traditionally notebooks

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.850 
enclosure when traditionally notebooks
are<00:00:28.990> made<00:00:29.200> from<00:00:29.940> multiple<00:00:30.940> parts<00:00:31.740> but<00:00:32.740> the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
are made from multiple parts but the

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.310 
are made from multiple parts but the
problem<00:00:33.220> is<00:00:33.310> when<00:00:33.640> you<00:00:33.970> have<00:00:34.240> multiple<00:00:34.690> parts

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:35.320 
problem is when you have multiple parts

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.520 
problem is when you have multiple parts
you<00:00:35.500> you<00:00:35.710> add<00:00:35.860> size<00:00:36.310> and<00:00:36.700> weight<00:00:36.940> and<00:00:37.530> you

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
you you add size and weight and you

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.590 
you you add size and weight and you
increase<00:00:38.980> the<00:00:39.280> opportunity<00:00:39.850> for<00:00:40.060> failure<00:00:40.210> and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
increase the opportunity for failure and

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.980 
increase the opportunity for failure and
that<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.650> huge<00:00:42.340> breakthrough<00:00:42.640> that<00:00:43.480> we<00:00:43.690> heard

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
that the huge breakthrough that we heard

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.890 
that the huge breakthrough that we heard
was<00:00:44.560> to<00:00:44.740> replace<00:00:45.010> all<00:00:45.280> of<00:00:45.700> those<00:00:45.850> parts<00:00:46.329> with

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:46.900 
was to replace all of those parts with

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.860 
was to replace all of those parts with
just<00:00:47.170> one<00:00:47.500> part<00:00:47.800> and<00:00:48.130> at<00:00:49.000> one<00:00:49.180> part<00:00:49.450> we<00:00:49.600> called

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
just one part and at one part we called

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.940 
just one part and at one part we called
the<00:00:49.960> unibody<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:52.270> figured<00:00:52.720> out<00:00:52.840> a<00:00:52.900> way<00:00:53.230> of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
the unibody we figured out a way of

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
we've never even dreamed of before and

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.740 
we've never even dreamed of before and
the<00:01:07.780> only<00:01:08.080> way<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:09.070> make<00:01:09.310> that<00:01:09.670> one<00:01:09.909> part<00:01:10.240> was

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
the only way to make that one part was

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.480 
the only way to make that one part was
to<00:01:10.990> machine<00:01:11.380> it<00:01:11.530> from<00:01:11.740> a<00:01:11.830> single<00:01:12.250> piece<00:01:12.430> of

to machine it from a single piece of
aluminium<00:01:17.220> aluminium<00:01:18.220> was<00:01:18.490> the<00:01:18.610> ideal<00:01:18.909> choice

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
aluminium aluminium was the ideal choice

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.060 
aluminium aluminium was the ideal choice

solid block of aluminum then we go

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.679 
solid block of aluminum then we go
through<00:01:39.009> an<00:01:39.130> extrusion<00:01:39.520> process<00:01:39.820> which<00:01:40.570> is

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
through an extrusion process which is

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:42.600 
through an extrusion process which is
kind<00:01:40.899> of<00:01:40.960> like<00:01:41.079> how<00:01:41.229> you<00:01:41.289> make<00:01:41.560> like<00:01:41.920> pasta<00:01:42.399> and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
kind of like how you make like pasta and
