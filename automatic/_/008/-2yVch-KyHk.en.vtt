00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.980
 let's prepare chickpeas with 

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.740
 prawns the ingredients that 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.400
 we need are 400 grams of chickpeas 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.009
 cooked 250 prawns half a liter 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.470

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.470
 grated parsley oil and salt 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.920
 and we started making a caldito with the 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.640
 heads and bodies of prawns 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.360
 already peeled we add a little salt a 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.360
 trickle of oil 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.030
 and we fry them so they release well 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.030
 all the juice 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.630
 Then we will add half a liter of 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.630
 Water 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.370
 and since it starts to boil what 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.910
 we will have about 15 or 20 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.489
 minutes on the other hand in a saucepan 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.989
 honda let's take the garlic cloves 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.989
 with an oil background 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.610
 as soon as the oil starts to take 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:10.130
 hot 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.829
 we will add the chopped onion 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.409
 and we're going to fry it very well over a fire 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:17.370
 slow we put a little salt so that 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.710
 it can be better 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.880
 and when it's stir-fried we add the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:26.880
 teaspoon of paprika stir well and 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.520
 we turn away from the fire 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.710
 On the other hand we take a colander and 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.590
 we put the broth of the heads of the 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.250
 prawns we tighten so that it falls 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.250
 Well all 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.800
 and we go back to our pan to which 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:47.390
 we will add the drained chickpeas 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.390
 and we add the broth 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.689
 from now on we will always shake in 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.729
 the pan for the chickpeas to be 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.759
 cooked can already be undone if we put 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.649
 spoon them on medium heat 10 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.920
 minutitos so that they take the flavor of 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.950
 sofrito we add the prawns and the 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.899
 we have nothing but another minute for 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.789
 last we add a little bread 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.789
 grated sprinkled to thicken 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.110
 we chop the fresh parsley 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.470
 we remove from the fire we add the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.170
 parsley 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.720
 and if we let it rest until the time of 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.100
 eating will have taken texture and will be more 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.860
 good 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.750
 ready we have our chickpeas with 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.330
 prawns that although it may collide 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.220
