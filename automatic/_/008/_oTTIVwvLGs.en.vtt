okay welcome back this is part four of
building<00:00:05.130> a<00:00:05.779> mini<00:00:06.779> CNC<00:00:07.589> machine<00:00:08.040> out<00:00:08.400> of

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
building a mini CNC machine out of

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.049 
building a mini CNC machine out of
floppy<00:00:09.120> drives<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:10.099> actually<00:00:11.099> cd-rom<00:00:11.700> drives

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
floppy drives and actually cd-rom drives

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.099 
floppy drives and actually cd-rom drives
-<00:00:12.450> forgot<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.049> mention<00:00:13.490> so<00:00:14.900> what<00:00:15.900> we're<00:00:16.020> going

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
- forgot to mention so what we're going

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.870 
- forgot to mention so what we're going
to<00:00:16.170> do<00:00:16.320> here<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.710> this<00:00:16.859> video<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.340> test<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
to do here in this video is test the

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.500 
to do here in this video is test the
interface<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:19.470> we<00:00:19.680> have<00:00:19.830> made<00:00:20.359> from<00:00:21.359> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
interface that we have made from the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.410 
interface that we have made from the
printer<00:00:22.080> port<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.220> floppy<00:00:23.490> drive<00:00:23.730> now

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
printer port to the floppy drive now

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.910 
printer port to the floppy drive now
we're<00:00:24.539> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.779> try<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.019> hook<00:00:25.560> them<00:00:25.710> together

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
we're going to try to hook them together

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.689 
we're going to try to hook them together
and<00:00:27.410> manipulate<00:00:28.410> them<00:00:28.590> with<00:00:28.619> our<00:00:29.099> parallel

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
and manipulate them with our parallel

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.630 
and manipulate them with our parallel
port<00:00:30.029> monitor<00:00:30.269> program<00:00:31.040> parm<00:00:32.040> on<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.550> we

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
port monitor program parm on that we

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.389 
port monitor program parm on that we
discussed<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.390> last<00:00:33.420> video<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.309> we

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
discussed in the last video so what we

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:40.420 
discussed in the last video so what we
got<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.640> do<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.920> if<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.070> see<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.570> our

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
got to do is if you see here we have our

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.500 
got to do is if you see here we have our
it<00:00:41.430> has<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.820> numbered<00:00:42.620> pin<00:00:43.620> number<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.610> here

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
it has it numbered pin number one here

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.090 
it has it numbered pin number one here
is<00:00:45.800> the<00:00:46.800> bottom<00:00:47.160> row<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.780> actually<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.620> odd

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
is the bottom row is actually the odd

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.639 
is the bottom row is actually the odd
numbers<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.510> top<00:00:51.809> row<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> even

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
numbers and the top row is the even

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.090 
numbers and the top row is the even
movers<00:00:53.180> so<00:00:54.180> basically<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.920> we

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
movers so basically all of the if we

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.770 
movers so basically all of the if we
look<00:00:56.250> at<00:00:56.370> our<00:00:56.399> pin<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:57.620> for<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> floppy<00:00:58.949> drive

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
look at our pin out for a floppy drive

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.569 
look at our pin out for a floppy drive
let's<00:01:00.780> see<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.079> only<00:01:01.350> even<00:01:01.800> numbers<00:01:02.190> that

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
let's see it's only even numbers that

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.329 
let's see it's only even numbers that
have<00:01:03.570> anything<00:01:03.989> on<00:01:04.140> them<00:01:04.379> so<00:01:04.589> it's<00:01:05.010> all<00:01:05.189> the

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
have anything on them so it's all the

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.960 
have anything on them so it's all the
odd<00:01:05.489> numbers<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.240> are<00:01:06.570> ground<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.220> if<00:01:08.760> we

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
odd numbers that are ground so if we

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.500 
odd numbers that are ground so if we
find<00:01:09.240> our<00:01:10.220> black<00:01:11.220> wire<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.610> we<00:01:12.000> made<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.479> our

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
find our black wire that we made on our

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.850 
find our black wire that we made on our
ground<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.650> actually<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:15.470> 25<00:01:16.470> if<00:01:16.770> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
ground that is actually in 25 if you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.630 
ground that is actually in 25 if you
remember<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.380> we<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> little<00:01:20.250> jumper

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
remember and we have a little jumper

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.530 
remember and we have a little jumper
here<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.689> what<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.210> look<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
here so what we do is if we look on the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.350 
here so what we do is if we look on the
back<00:01:24.630> here<00:01:25.140> we<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.439> see<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:26.939> one<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
back here we can see the the one on the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.350 
back here we can see the the one on the
bottom<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.229> all<00:01:28.590> ground<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.210> just

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
bottom here is all ground so if I just

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.140 
bottom here is all ground so if I just
hook<00:01:30.509> up<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.170> of<00:01:31.290> those<00:01:31.790> that<00:01:32.790> should<00:01:33.000> be

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
hook up to one of those that should be

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.999 
hook up to one of those that should be
grounded<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.750> then<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> other<00:01:34.470> two<00:01:34.710> pin

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
grounded and then the other two pin

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.870 
grounded and then the other two pin
these<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.960> black<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> green<00:01:37.880> we

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
these to the black and the green we

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.350 
these to the black and the green we
hooked<00:01:39.090> up<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.630> our<00:01:40.280> parallel<00:01:41.280> port<00:01:41.579> we're

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
hooked up to our parallel port we're

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.950 
hooked up to our parallel port we're
going<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.570> hook<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.020> eighteen<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.890> twenty

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
going to hook up to eighteen and twenty

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.630 
going to hook up to eighteen and twenty
which<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.320> believer<00:01:47.100> here<00:01:47.490> yeah<00:01:48.299> mmm<00:01:49.140> here<00:01:49.640> so

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
which I believer here yeah mmm here so

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.450 
which I believer here yeah mmm here so
now<00:01:50.820> we've<00:01:51.299> got<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.540> all<00:01:51.689> hooked<00:01:51.899> up<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.950> we've

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
now we've got it all hooked up and we've

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.459 
now we've got it all hooked up and we've
got<00:01:53.490> parallel<00:01:54.030> port<00:01:54.360> or<00:01:54.720> paramon<00:01:55.610> running<00:01:56.610> and

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
got parallel port or paramon running and

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.440 
got parallel port or paramon running and
that's<00:01:58.469> your<00:01:58.740> whole<00:01:58.979> set<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.460> there<00:01:59.700> now<00:02:00.270> what

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
that's your whole set up there now what

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.120 
that's your whole set up there now what
we're<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.930> is<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.500> click<00:02:01.740> on<00:02:01.950> and

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
we're going to do is just click on and

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.959 
we're going to do is just click on and
off<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.880> hopefully<00:02:03.420> it's<00:02:03.540> all<00:02:03.630> set<00:02:03.930> up<00:02:04.969> and

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
off and hopefully it's all set up and

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.050 
off and hopefully it's all set up and
you<00:02:06.030> see<00:02:06.479> that

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
you see that

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.950 
you see that
you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.240> see<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.570> let<00:02:09.810> me<00:02:09.869> zoom<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.350> here<00:02:11.960> our

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
you can see it let me zoom in here our

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.980 
you can see it let me zoom in here our
stepper<00:02:13.260> motor<00:02:13.910> jumps<00:02:14.910> back<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.450> forth<00:02:15.720> here

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
stepper motor jumps back and forth here

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.210 
stepper motor jumps back and forth here
when<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.170> click<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:17.420> pin<00:02:18.420> number<00:02:19.140> actually<00:02:19.860> its

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
when I click on pin number actually its

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.100 
when I click on pin number actually its
pin<00:02:20.550> 3d<00:02:21.360> one<00:02:21.600> output<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:23.450> then<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.480> have<00:02:24.990> to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
pin 3d one output and then I have to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.410 
pin 3d one output and then I have to
reverse<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.710> actually<00:02:26.190> I<00:02:26.220> click<00:02:26.880> pin<00:02:27.690> -<00:02:29.420> there

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
reverse it actually I click pin - there

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.650 
reverse it actually I click pin - there
it<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.600> pin<00:02:31.230> -<00:02:31.560> who's<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.570> direction<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:35.660> pin

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
it is pin - who's the direction and pin

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.000 
it is pin - who's the direction and pin
3<00:02:37.050> is<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.680> step<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:40.160> when<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.190> click<00:02:41.460> on<00:02:42.500> pin<00:02:43.500> 3

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
3 is the step so when I click on pin 3

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.040 
3 is the step so when I click on pin 3
again<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.610> again<00:02:44.820> that's<00:02:45.600> where<00:02:45.810> I'm<00:02:45.930> getting

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
again and again that's where I'm getting

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.130 
again and again that's where I'm getting
the<00:02:46.260> movement<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.940> we<00:02:48.360> set<00:02:48.630> all<00:02:48.750> this<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:48.959> just

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
the movement so we set all this up just

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.460 
the movement so we set all this up just
to<00:02:49.470> show<00:02:49.680> how<00:02:49.980> to<00:02:50.610> manipulate<00:02:51.260> stepper<00:02:52.260> motor

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
to show how to manipulate stepper motor

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.910 
to show how to manipulate stepper motor
and<00:02:53.030> now<00:02:54.030> what<00:02:54.209> we're<00:02:54.360> going<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.600> do<00:02:54.920> since

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
and now what we're going to do since

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.280 
and now what we're going to do since
this<00:02:56.160> travel<00:02:56.760> is<00:02:56.910> only<00:02:57.120> you<00:02:57.810> know<00:02:57.870> half<00:02:58.110> an

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
this travel is only you know half an

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.490 
this travel is only you know half an
inch<00:02:58.440> or<00:02:58.650> 3/4<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.340> an<00:02:59.459> inch<00:02:59.520> it's<00:02:59.760> not<00:02:59.940> very<00:03:00.150> big

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
inch or 3/4 of an inch it's not very big

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.850 
inch or 3/4 of an inch it's not very big
the<00:03:01.500> next<00:03:01.620> video<00:03:01.950> we're<00:03:02.130> going<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.280> do<00:03:02.490> is<00:03:03.860> hook

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
the next video we're going to do is hook

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.040 
the next video we're going to do is hook
up<00:03:05.100> this<00:03:05.280> stepper<00:03:05.790> motor<00:03:06.000> basically<00:03:06.900> we're

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
up this stepper motor basically we're

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.460 
up this stepper motor basically we're
using<00:03:07.260> this<00:03:07.680> whole<00:03:08.220> board<00:03:08.580> here<00:03:08.910> this<00:03:09.840> chip<00:03:10.230> to

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
using this whole board here this chip to

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.830 
using this whole board here this chip to
control<00:03:11.070> the<00:03:11.220> because<00:03:11.790> it's<00:03:11.970> got<00:03:12.150> an<00:03:12.269> h-bridge

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
control the because it's got an h-bridge

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.310 
control the because it's got an h-bridge
in<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.150> it<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.330> control<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.720> stepper<00:03:16.050> motor

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
in it and it can control a stepper motor

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.280 
in it and it can control a stepper motor
so<00:03:17.250> we're<00:03:17.400> going<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.610> use<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.290> connection

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
so we're going to use this connection

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.970 
so we're going to use this connection
here<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.590> connect<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.100> into<00:03:20.250> a<00:03:21.410> cd-rom<00:03:22.410> drive

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
here and connect it into a cd-rom drive

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.770 
here and connect it into a cd-rom drive
as<00:03:23.220> our<00:03:23.340> next<00:03:23.640> one<00:03:23.760> so<00:03:24.090> we're<00:03:24.480> going<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.630> hack

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
as our next one so we're going to hack

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.259 
as our next one so we're going to hack
open<00:03:24.959> an<00:03:25.260> old<00:03:25.530> cd-rom<00:03:26.040> drive<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.090> has<00:03:27.239> a

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
open an old cd-rom drive and it has a

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.180 
open an old cd-rom drive and it has a
bigger<00:03:27.540> travel<00:03:28.110> as<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.440> is<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:28.860> whole<00:03:29.010> thing

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
bigger travel as the is the whole thing

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.090 
bigger travel as the is the whole thing
of<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:30.300> laser<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.500> we're<00:03:31.650> going<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.800> do<00:03:31.950> that

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
of the laser so we're going to do that

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.230 
of the laser so we're going to do that
next<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:33.019> stay<00:03:34.019> tuned
