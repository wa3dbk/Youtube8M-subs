alright<00:00:01.199> this<00:00:01.469> walkthrough<00:00:01.709> video<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.280> going

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
alright this walkthrough video is going

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.519 
alright this walkthrough video is going
to<00:00:02.490> cover<00:00:02.550> progression<00:00:03.360> from<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.870> small<00:00:04.200> star

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
to cover progression from the small star

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.570 
to cover progression from the small star
stage<00:00:05.000> up<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.420> the<00:00:06.750> black<00:00:07.529> postage<00:00:08.150> soldier

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.160 

no<00:00:12.180> way<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.330> get<00:00:12.570> there<00:00:12.780> it's<00:00:12.930> pretty

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
no way to get there it's pretty

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.530 
no way to get there it's pretty
straightforward<00:00:13.530> what<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.070> wanna<00:00:14.250> do<00:00:14.460> is

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
straightforward what you wanna do is

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.420 
straightforward what you wanna do is
soak<00:00:15.540> up<00:00:15.690> as<00:00:15.870> much<00:00:15.900> matter<00:00:16.379> into<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:16.890> star<00:00:18.260> and

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430 
soak up as much matter into you star and

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:23.179 
soak up as much matter into you star and
preferably<00:00:20.430> as<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.700> single<00:00:21.360> star<00:00:21.630> system<00:00:22.189> that

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
preferably as a single star system that

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.260 
preferably as a single star system that
way<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.790> can<00:00:23.939> get<00:00:24.119> there<00:00:24.330> faster<00:00:24.540> otherwise

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
way you can get there faster otherwise

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.150 
way you can get there faster otherwise
as<00:00:27.270> mentioned<00:00:27.540> in<00:00:27.869> my<00:00:27.900> solar<00:00:28.590> system<00:00:28.980> back

as mentioned in my solar system back
view<00:00:29.430> when<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.390> soak<00:00:30.630> up<00:00:30.810> or<00:00:31.740> concern<00:00:32.250> planets

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:32.760 
view when you soak up or concern planets

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.009

for<00:00:33.480> mass<00:00:33.720> as<00:00:34.710> multiple<00:00:35.280> stars<00:00:35.519> it<00:00:36.420> gets<00:00:36.720> split

00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:37.019 
for mass as multiple stars it gets split

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.070

and<00:01:39.430> while<00:01:40.430> we're<00:01:40.640> still<00:01:40.970> a<00:01:41.000> small<00:01:41.120> star

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
and while we're still a small star

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.820 
and while we're still a small star
becoming<00:01:41.960> healthy<00:01:42.320> planets<00:01:42.740> at<00:01:42.890> once<00:01:43.100> so<00:01:44.830> what

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
becoming healthy planets at once so what

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.010 
becoming healthy planets at once so what
I<00:01:45.890> try<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.100> do<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.610> keep<00:01:47.450> two<00:01:47.930> stars<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:49.340> planets

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
I try to do is keep two stars to planets

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.120 
I try to do is keep two stars to planets
evolving<00:01:51.020> and<00:01:51.830> gaining<00:01:52.400> experience<00:01:52.880> while

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
evolving and gaining experience while

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:18.420 
evolving and gaining experience while
every<00:01:55.130> third<00:01:55.400> finally<00:01:56.090> get<00:01:56.440> confused<00:01:57.440> formats

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.280 

and<00:02:19.430> it's<00:02:19.640> uh<00:02:19.850> muscly<00:02:20.180> best<00:02:20.540> just<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.870> avoid

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
and it's uh muscly best just to avoid

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.500 
and it's uh muscly best just to avoid
other<00:02:21.950> star<00:02:22.340> systems<00:02:22.370> for<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.150> most<00:02:23.330> part

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
other star systems for the most part

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.840 
other star systems for the most part
although<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.950> few<00:02:25.180> times<00:02:26.180> if<00:02:26.480> you<00:02:26.600> try<00:02:26.810> to

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
although a few times if you try to

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.670 
although a few times if you try to
destroy<00:02:28.850> the<00:02:29.060> stars<00:02:29.360> themselves<00:02:29.600> at<00:02:30.260> damians

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
destroy the stars themselves at damians

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.870 
destroy the stars themselves at damians
resources<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:32.500> one<00:02:33.500> way<00:02:33.650> are<00:02:33.800> found<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.489> can

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
resources and one way are found that can

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.770 

as<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.400> see<00:02:59.580> it's<00:02:59.700> still<00:02:59.940> coming<00:03:00.450> into

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
as you can see it's still coming into

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.660 
as you can see it's still coming into
asteroid<00:03:01.290> fields<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:01.920> doing<00:03:02.130> some<00:03:02.340> damage<00:03:02.490> to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
asteroid fields and doing some damage to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.690 
asteroid fields and doing some damage to
the<00:03:02.880> side<00:03:03.440> which<00:03:04.440> is<00:03:04.500> also<00:03:04.770> good<00:03:05.130> tactic<00:03:05.580> that

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
the side which is also good tactic that

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.330 
the side which is also good tactic that
you<00:03:05.850> can<00:03:06.060> use<00:03:06.240> them<00:03:06.740> when<00:03:07.740> you're<00:03:07.860> just<00:03:08.100> kind

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
you can use them when you're just kind

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.490 

you<00:03:42.030> see<00:03:42.240> the<00:03:42.510> power<00:03:42.690> that<00:03:42.870> starts<00:03:43.320> such<00:03:43.470> a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
you see the power that starts such a

you see the power that starts such a

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
speed that now is just constantly

it's<00:03:59.270> definitely<00:03:59.450> entertaining<00:04:00.080> to<00:04:00.260> do<00:04:03.310> this

it's<00:05:05.340> always<00:05:06.050> best<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.200> try<00:05:07.380> to<00:05:07.440> find<00:05:07.680> planets

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
it's always best to try to find planets

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.730 
it's always best to try to find planets
with<00:05:08.700> life<00:05:08.730> on<00:05:09.120> them<00:05:09.390> as<00:05:10.200> much<00:05:10.530> as<00:05:10.710> possible

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
with life on them as much as possible

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.770 
with life on them as much as possible
because<00:05:11.370> he<00:05:11.550> also<00:05:11.700> had<00:05:11.970> one<00:05:12.180> mass<00:05:12.420> when<00:05:12.690> you

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
because he also had one mass when you

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.520 
because he also had one mass when you
can<00:05:12.990> see<00:05:13.670> the<00:05:14.670> black<00:05:14.850> holes<00:05:15.090> get<00:05:15.300> faster<00:05:18.530> and

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
can see the black holes get faster and

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.230 
can see the black holes get faster and
it<00:05:19.680> can<00:05:19.860> pick<00:05:20.100> up<00:05:20.250> some<00:05:20.430> asteroids<00:05:20.850> on<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.120> way

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
it can pick up some asteroids on the way

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.580 
it can pick up some asteroids on the way
you<00:05:21.300> can<00:05:21.570> always<00:05:21.840> pull<00:05:22.080> them<00:05:22.200> into<00:05:22.350> your

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
you can always pull them into your

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.350 
you can always pull them into your
planet<00:05:22.919> in<00:05:23.070> order<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.370> garden<00:05:23.730> for<00:05:23.940> later<00:05:24.120> when

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
planet in order to garden for later when

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:30.890 
planet in order to garden for later when
you<00:05:24.480> eventually<00:05:24.630> go<00:05:25.020> consume<00:05:25.470> everything

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.270 

another<00:05:31.900> good<00:05:32.080> idea<00:05:32.199> is<00:05:32.410> also<00:05:32.740> to<00:05:32.800> try<00:05:33.009> to<00:05:33.069> keep

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
another good idea is also to try to keep

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.339 
another good idea is also to try to keep
why<00:05:33.849> it's<00:05:33.970> good<00:05:34.120> to<00:05:34.150> get<00:05:34.360> as<00:05:34.509> many<00:05:34.690> points<00:05:35.050> as

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:35.349 
why it's good to get as many points as

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.559 
why it's good to get as many points as
possible<00:05:35.580> in<00:05:36.580> orbit<00:05:37.000> is<00:05:37.210> because<00:05:37.419> you<00:05:37.509> have

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:37.569 
possible in orbit is because you have

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.950 
possible in orbit is because you have
that<00:05:37.660> expanded<00:05:38.319> field<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.740> view<00:05:38.860> now<00:05:39.750> as<00:05:40.750> we

that expanded field of view now as we

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.260 
that expanded field of view now as we
have<00:05:41.080> five<00:05:41.380> planets<00:05:41.889> and<00:05:42.130> keeping<00:05:42.550> a<00:05:42.699> six<00:05:43.000> slot

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
the large started filming a little bit

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.430 
the large started filming a little bit

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
more to go and as a single large started

more to go and as a single large started
control<00:06:11.770> way<00:06:11.919> of<00:06:12.039> planets<00:06:12.460> and<00:06:12.639> you<00:06:13.120> would

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
control way of planets and you would

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.360 
control way of planets and you would
need<00:06:13.389> to<00:06:13.449> have<00:06:13.720> a<00:06:13.750> second<00:06:14.229> star<00:06:14.560> to<00:06:14.590> hold<00:06:15.220> the

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
full ten but since that would end up

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:19.680 
full ten but since that would end up
taking<00:06:18.520> longer<00:06:18.759> because<00:06:18.940> you<00:06:19.210> have<00:06:19.360> to<00:06:19.509> feed

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
taking longer because you have to feed

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.360 
taking longer because you have to feed
two<00:06:19.900> stars<00:06:20.259> that's<00:06:20.560> just<00:06:20.800> something<00:06:20.949> in<00:06:21.280> the
