targets<00:01:00.320> in<00:01:00.440> the<00:01:00.530> ground<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.370> let's<00:01:01.700> do<00:01:01.970> a

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
targets in the ground so let's do a

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.210 
targets in the ground so let's do a
little<00:01:02.150> test<00:01:02.420> to<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.810> helmet<00:01:03.320> cam<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:03.770> see

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
little test to the helmet cam and see

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.179 
little test to the helmet cam and see
how<00:01:04.339> it<00:01:04.489> looks<00:01:05.830> what<00:01:06.830> we're<00:01:06.920> going<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.070> do

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
how it looks what we're going to do

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.149 
how it looks what we're going to do
first<00:01:07.460> is<00:01:07.729> use<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.509> helmet<00:01:09.290> cam<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:09.740> walk<00:01:09.950> you

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
first is use the helmet cam to walk you

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.999 
first is use the helmet cam to walk you
through<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:11.299> basic<00:01:11.810> setup<00:01:12.110> for<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.470> fish<00:01:12.680> RF

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.370 
through the basic setup for the fish RF
75<00:01:13.759> now<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.360> is<00:01:14.509> a<00:01:14.540> very<00:01:14.720> powerful<00:01:14.990> machine

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
75 now this is a very powerful machine

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.889 
75 now this is a very powerful machine
and<00:01:15.890> it<00:01:16.220> has<00:01:16.369> a<00:01:16.400> lot<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:16.850> options<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.630> settings

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:17.899 
and it has a lot of options and settings

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:19.630 
and it has a lot of options and settings
but<00:01:18.469> what<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:18.649> want<00:01:18.799> to<00:01:18.859> do<00:01:18.950> is<00:01:19.100> try<00:01:19.249> to<00:01:19.280> give<00:01:19.520> you

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
an idea of a basic out-of-the-box

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.919 
an idea of a basic out-of-the-box
setting<00:01:22.460> that<00:01:22.549> you<00:01:22.729> can<00:01:22.759> use<00:01:23.210> right<00:01:23.600> into<00:01:23.840> the

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:23.929 
setting that you can use right into the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.380 
setting that you can use right into the

the first thing that we want to do is we
want<00:01:28.490> to<00:01:28.549> turn<00:01:29.149> the<00:01:29.299> machine<00:01:29.569> home<00:01:32.109> and<00:01:33.109> we'll

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
want to turn the machine home and we'll

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.899 
want to turn the machine home and we'll
see<00:01:33.469> that<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.799> machine<00:01:34.340> will<00:01:34.490> cycle<00:01:34.700> through

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
see that the machine will cycle through

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:37.929 
see that the machine will cycle through
its<00:01:35.259> various<00:01:36.259> settings<00:01:36.770> now<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.579> next<00:01:37.850> thing

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
its various settings now the next thing

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.219 
its various settings now the next thing
we're<00:01:38.119> going<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.270> do<00:01:38.420> is<00:01:38.689> we're<00:01:38.899> going<00:01:38.929> to<00:01:39.049> run

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
we're going to do is we're going to run

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.590 
we're going to do is we're going to run
through<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:39.499> menu<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:40.359> first<00:01:41.359> and<00:01:41.539> foremost

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
through the menu and first and foremost

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.480 
through the menu and first and foremost
we'll<00:01:42.049> set<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.380> sensitivity<00:01:42.710> and<00:01:43.249> around

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
we'll set the sensitivity and around

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.739 
we'll set the sensitivity and around
here<00:01:44.139> something<00:01:45.139> between<00:01:45.350> 65<00:01:46.069> well<00:01:46.579> 60<00:01:47.179> and<00:01:47.299> 70

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
here something between 65 well 60 and 70

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.399 
here something between 65 well 60 and 70
is<00:01:47.810> probably<00:01:48.200> best<00:01:48.499> so<00:01:49.069> we'll<00:01:49.219> leave<00:01:49.340> it<00:01:49.399> on<00:01:49.579> 65

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
is probably best so we'll leave it on 65

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.419 
is probably best so we'll leave it on 65
then<00:01:51.409> we'll<00:01:51.530> go<00:01:51.619> to<00:01:51.679> the<00:01:51.829> discrimination

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
then we'll go to the discrimination

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.649 
then we'll go to the discrimination
level<00:01:53.409> 15<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.590> a<00:01:54.679> good<00:01:55.389> discrimination<00:01:56.389> level

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
level 15 is a good discrimination level

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.989 
level 15 is a good discrimination level

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
want to do with the machine is we want

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.479 
want to do with the machine is we want
to<00:02:36.019> ground<00:02:36.140> balance<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:37.750> machine<00:02:38.750> is

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
to ground balance and this machine is

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.569 
to ground balance and this machine is
very<00:02:40.489> effective<00:02:41.060> and<00:02:41.390> easy<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.170> do<00:02:42.400> because<00:02:43.400> of

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
very effective and easy to do because of

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.309 
very effective and easy to do because of
its<00:02:43.700> fast<00:02:43.940> grab<00:02:46.420> mode<00:02:47.420> or<00:02:47.690> process<00:02:48.079> that<00:02:48.110> it

its fast grab mode or process that it

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.630 
its fast grab mode or process that it
has<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.799> simply<00:02:49.040> what<00:02:49.099> we're<00:02:49.250> going<00:02:49.370> to<00:02:49.400> do<00:02:49.489> is

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
has and simply what we're going to do is

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.300 
has and simply what we're going to do is
we're<00:02:49.760> going<00:02:49.849> to<00:02:49.940> push<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:51.129> toggle<00:02:52.129> switch

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
we're going to push the toggle switch

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.369 
we're going to push the toggle switch
forward<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:52.970> we're<00:02:53.180> going<00:02:53.299> to<00:02:53.329> pump<00:02:53.569> it<00:02:53.750> over

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
forward and we're going to pump it over

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.720 
forward and we're going to pump it over
the<00:02:54.500> ground<00:02:54.739> as<00:02:54.950> though<00:02:55.099> we<00:02:55.250> were<00:02:55.280> doing<00:02:55.640> a

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
the ground as though we were doing a

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.880 
the ground as though we were doing a
regular<00:02:55.909> ground<00:02:56.269> balance<00:02:56.750> so<00:02:56.930> we'll<00:02:57.140> go<00:02:57.769> ahead

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
regular ground balance so we'll go ahead

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:05.199 
regular ground balance so we'll go ahead
we'll<00:02:58.129> set<00:02:58.340> that<00:02:58.390> set<00:02:59.390> it<00:02:59.510> forward<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.910> we<00:03:05.030> see

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
we'll set that set it forward and we see

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.380 
we'll set that set it forward and we see
it<00:03:05.299> comes<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.690> and<00:03:05.900> right<00:03:06.319> around<00:03:06.440> 63<00:03:07.340> 62<00:03:08.000> for<00:03:08.359> a

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
it comes in and right around 63 62 for a

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.789 
it comes in and right around 63 62 for a
round<00:03:08.690> balance<00:03:09.049> and<00:03:09.140> that's<00:03:09.260> pretty<00:03:09.440> normal

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
round balance and that's pretty normal

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.729 
round balance and that's pretty normal
for<00:03:09.829> this<00:03:10.069> this<00:03:10.879> site<00:03:11.180> so<00:03:11.840> let's<00:03:12.109> go<00:03:12.409> ahead<00:03:12.500> and

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
for this this site so let's go ahead and

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.559 
for this this site so let's go ahead and
swing<00:03:13.459> the<00:03:13.609> coal<00:03:13.790> through<00:03:14.030> the<00:03:14.120> yard<00:03:14.359> a<00:03:14.450> little

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
swing the coal through the yard a little

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:31.559 
swing the coal through the yard a little
bit<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.019> see<00:03:15.230> what<00:03:16.129> we<00:03:16.220> can<00:03:16.370> come<00:03:16.459> up<00:03:16.519> with

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.220 

we<00:03:32.319> got<00:03:32.470> a<00:03:32.500> good<00:03:32.739> target<00:03:33.129> here<00:03:34.110> it's<00:03:35.110> not

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
we got a good target here it's not

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.809 
we got a good target here it's not
reading<00:03:35.620> very<00:03:35.650> high<00:03:36.069> above<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.670> iron<00:03:37.269> mark

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
reading very high above the iron mark

00:03:38.819 --> 00:04:21.220 
reading very high above the iron mark
we'll<00:03:39.819> go<00:03:39.909> ahead<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.150> dig<00:03:40.239> it<00:03:40.360> anyway

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:23.650 

no<00:04:22.160> wonder<00:04:22.490> because<00:04:22.700> it<00:04:23.090> was<00:04:23.240> a<00:04:23.270> little<00:04:23.540> piece

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
no wonder because it was a little piece

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.690 
no wonder because it was a little piece
of<00:04:23.720> aluminum<00:04:24.290> pole<00:04:24.800> sitting<00:04:25.130> right<00:04:25.310> on<00:04:25.340> top<00:04:25.430> of

of aluminum pole sitting right on top of
the<00:04:25.760> ground<00:04:31.090> technology's<00:04:32.090> making<00:04:32.480> it<00:04:32.600> easier

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
the ground technology's making it easier

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.380 
the ground technology's making it easier
and<00:04:33.020> easier<00:04:33.260> for<00:04:33.640> anybody<00:04:34.640> to<00:04:34.850> get<00:04:35.000> into<00:04:35.240> video

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
and easier for anybody to get into video

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.990 
and easier for anybody to get into video
production<00:04:35.800> it's<00:04:36.800> certainly<00:04:37.130> changing<00:04:37.730> the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
production it's certainly changing the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.610 
production it's certainly changing the
way<00:04:38.480> we<00:04:38.810> can<00:04:39.850> view<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:41.840> hobbies<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.470> we
