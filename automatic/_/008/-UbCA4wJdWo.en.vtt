the<00:00:02.159> following<00:00:02.490> presentation<00:00:02.929> you<00:00:03.929> will<00:00:04.020> see

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
the following presentation you will see

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.610 
the following presentation you will see
two<00:00:04.410> cases<00:00:04.830> of<00:00:05.899> extraction<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.020> cheek<00:00:07.290> teeth

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
two cases of extraction of cheek teeth

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:14.700 
two cases of extraction of cheek teeth
in<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.130> horse

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:14.710 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.650 

here<00:00:15.710> we<00:00:15.830> see<00:00:16.010> an<00:00:16.070> oral<00:00:16.490> shot<00:00:16.730> demonstrating

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
here we see an oral shot demonstrating

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.550 
here we see an oral shot demonstrating
the<00:00:17.990> fractured<00:00:18.440> cheek<00:00:18.740> tooth<00:00:20.050> the<00:00:21.050> horse<00:00:21.290> is

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
the fractured cheek tooth the horse is

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:29.900 
the fractured cheek tooth the horse is
now<00:00:21.740> prepared<00:00:22.220> for<00:00:22.369> radiographs<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:23.390> be<00:00:23.480> taken

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.459 

this<00:00:30.910> shot<00:00:31.179> clearly<00:00:31.660> demonstrates<00:00:32.230> the

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
this shot clearly demonstrates the

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.650 
this shot clearly demonstrates the
fracture<00:00:32.860> when<00:00:33.460> we<00:00:33.579> see<00:00:33.790> the<00:00:33.940> tooth<00:00:34.149> in<00:00:34.450> to

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.660 
fracture when we see the tooth in to

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.139 
fracture when we see the tooth in to
break<00:00:35.079> to<00:00:35.739> manage<00:00:36.040> pain<00:00:36.309> nerve<00:00:36.699> blocks<00:00:36.970> are

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
break to manage pain nerve blocks are

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.549 
break to manage pain nerve blocks are
performed<00:00:37.600> and<00:00:37.809> the<00:00:38.020> horse<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.230> given

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
performed and the horse is given

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:47.560 
performed and the horse is given
appropriate<00:00:38.770> anesthesia

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:01:09.760 

you

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.399 

here<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:10.670> see<00:01:10.850> an<00:01:10.939> asymmetry<00:01:11.420> of<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:12.020> temporal

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
here we see an asymmetry of the temporal

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.080 
here we see an asymmetry of the temporal
muscles<00:01:12.740> because<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:13.369> horse<00:01:13.579> is<00:01:13.640> not<00:01:13.850> showing

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
muscles because the horse is not showing

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.179 
muscles because the horse is not showing
on<00:01:14.270> one<00:01:14.450> side

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.039 

this<00:01:21.189> image<00:01:21.610> demonstrates<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.390> location<00:01:22.899> of

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
this image demonstrates the location of

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:31.990 
this image demonstrates the location of
the<00:01:23.140> fracture<00:01:23.380> as<00:01:23.680> indicated<00:01:24.369> by<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.520> pin

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.730 

you

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.100 

here<00:01:35.549> we<00:01:35.700> see<00:01:35.880> an<00:01:35.970> old<00:01:36.180> shot<00:01:36.570> clearly

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
here we see an old shot clearly

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.020 
here we see an old shot clearly
demonstrating<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.830> fracture<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.430> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
demonstrating the fracture and the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.640 
demonstrating the fracture and the
severe<00:01:39.270> trauma<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.869> cheek

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.340 

the<00:01:45.490> patient<00:01:45.970> is<00:01:46.090> prepared<00:01:46.480> for<00:01:46.630> surgery<00:01:46.870> and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
the patient is prepared for surgery and

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:55.270 
the patient is prepared for surgery and
a<00:01:47.410> slow<00:01:47.620> task<00:01:47.860> of<00:01:48.100> removing<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.610> tooth<00:01:48.790> begins

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.010 

here<00:01:55.940> we<00:01:56.090> see<00:01:56.240> a<00:01:56.270> portion<00:01:56.690> of<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:56.870> tooth

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
here we see a portion of the tooth

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.700 
here we see a portion of the tooth
immediately<00:01:57.650> following<00:01:58.010> extraction

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:19.830 

you

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.540 

in<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:21.080> x-ray<00:02:21.409> we<00:02:21.739> can<00:02:21.890> clearly<00:02:22.099> see<00:02:22.370> that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
in this x-ray we can clearly see that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.720 
in this x-ray we can clearly see that
all<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.730> the<00:02:22.970> tooth<00:02:23.150> has<00:02:23.360> been<00:02:23.540> removed<00:02:24.730> here

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
all of the tooth has been removed here

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.670 
all of the tooth has been removed here
is<00:02:25.879> the<00:02:26.000> same<00:02:26.239> horse<00:02:26.450> undergoing<00:02:26.930> examination

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
is the same horse undergoing examination

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.400 
is the same horse undergoing examination
nine<00:02:27.950> months<00:02:28.370> later
