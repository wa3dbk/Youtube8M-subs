00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
injections while they're conscious and

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.800 
injections while they're conscious and
awake<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:10.790> if<00:01:11.150> you<00:01:11.270> think<00:01:11.479> about<00:01:11.540> what

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
awake and if you think about what

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.510 
awake and if you think about what
visitors<00:01:12.170> do<00:01:12.380> unless<00:01:12.590> you<00:01:12.740> go<00:01:12.860> into<00:01:13.100> an<00:01:13.189> ER

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
visitors do unless you go into an ER

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.030 
visitors do unless you go into an ER
most<00:01:14.000> of<00:01:14.119> the<00:01:14.180> time<00:01:14.390> you<00:01:14.570> know<00:01:14.659> you<00:01:14.689> have<00:01:14.900> the

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
most of the time you know you have the

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.170 
most of the time you know you have the
anesthesiologist<00:01:16.040> you<00:01:16.220> wake<00:01:16.370> up<00:01:16.520> it's<00:01:16.850> over

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
anesthesiologist you wake up it's over

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.300 
anesthesiologist you wake up it's over
so<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:17.630> think<00:01:17.810> we<00:01:18.230> have<00:01:18.260> the<00:01:18.650> bigger<00:01:18.830> challenge

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
so I think we have the bigger challenge

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.950 
so I think we have the bigger challenge
but<00:01:19.490> physicians<00:01:19.970> are<00:01:20.120> following<00:01:20.360> record

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
but physicians are following record

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.360 
but physicians are following record
numbers<00:01:21.260> it's<00:01:21.530> really<00:01:21.770> changing<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.220> way<00:01:22.340> a

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
numbers it's really changing the way a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.860 
numbers it's really changing the way a
dentist's<00:01:22.850> office<00:01:22.940> look<00:01:23.270> we<00:01:23.390> have<00:01:23.450> some<00:01:23.630> shots
