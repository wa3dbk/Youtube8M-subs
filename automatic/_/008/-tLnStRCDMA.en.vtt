of weeks ago but today and I'll shooting
this<00:03:34.550> video<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:34.880> decide<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.269> go<00:03:35.420> to<00:03:35.480> give

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
this video I decide to go to give

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.030 
this video I decide to go to give
another<00:03:35.780> shot<00:03:36.050> right<00:03:36.440> before<00:03:36.709> I<00:03:36.739> shot<00:03:36.920> this

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
another shot right before I shot this

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.670 
another shot right before I shot this
video<00:03:37.190> and<00:03:37.600> both<00:03:38.600> homework<00:03:39.080> to<00:03:39.170> find<00:03:39.350> I<00:03:39.590> was

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
video and both homework to find I was

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.080 
video and both homework to find I was
able<00:03:39.769> to<00:03:39.980> hear<00:03:40.130> sound<00:03:40.430> out<00:03:40.550> of<00:03:40.670> both<00:03:40.790> of<00:03:40.820> them

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
able to hear sound out of both of them

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.150 
able to hear sound out of both of them
so<00:03:41.150> they<00:03:41.900> made<00:03:42.080> it<00:03:42.230> man<00:03:42.350> just<00:03:42.380> a<00:03:42.739> temporary

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
so they made it man just a temporary

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.270 
so they made it man just a temporary
thing<00:03:43.430> something<00:03:43.910> like<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.239> but<00:03:45.040> that's<00:03:46.040> one

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
thing something like that but that's one

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.720 
thing something like that but that's one
of<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.430> problems<00:03:46.550> I've<00:03:46.910> had<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.650> also<00:03:48.730> about

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
of the problems I've had and also about

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.990 
of the problems I've had and also about
a<00:03:49.880> couple<00:03:50.209> hours<00:03:50.300> into<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:50.780> the<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:52.489> same<00:03:52.760> here

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
a couple hours into it the the same here

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.820 
a couple hours into it the the same here
but<00:03:53.209> actually<00:03:53.630> when<00:03:53.750> I<00:03:53.810> had<00:03:54.019> it<00:03:54.170> in<00:03:54.200> my<00:03:54.350> iphone

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
but actually when I had it in my iphone

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.600 
but actually when I had it in my iphone
um<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:56.300> sound<00:03:56.600> really<00:03:56.930> became<00:03:57.200> muffled<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:57.890> I

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
um the sound really became muffled and I

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.090 
um the sound really became muffled and I
thought<00:03:58.850> it<00:03:59.060> was<00:03:59.180> originally<00:04:00.100> these

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
thought it was originally these

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.130 
thought it was originally these
headphones<00:04:01.400> come<00:04:01.700> like<00:04:01.910> a<00:04:01.970> little<00:04:02.239> mesh<00:04:02.510> steel

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
headphones come like a little mesh steel

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.410 
headphones come like a little mesh steel
mesh<00:04:03.410> cap<00:04:03.709> that<00:04:03.920> goes<00:04:03.980> inside<00:04:04.310> there<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:04.970> do<00:04:05.209> not

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:05.420 
mesh cap that goes inside there I do not

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:06.759 
mesh cap that goes inside there I do not
have<00:04:05.630> that<00:04:05.750> arm<00:04:05.989> right<00:04:06.200> now<00:04:06.380> but<00:04:06.650> it's<00:04:06.739> a

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
have that arm right now but it's a

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.949 
have that arm right now but it's a
little<00:04:06.920> mesh<00:04:07.220> caps<00:04:07.550> that<00:04:08.180> goes<00:04:08.390> right<00:04:08.720> on

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
little mesh caps that goes right on

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.650 
little mesh caps that goes right on
there<00:04:09.290> screws<00:04:09.590> right<00:04:09.800> there<00:04:10.040> and<00:04:10.269> it<00:04:11.269> prevents

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
there screws right there and it prevents

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.270 
there screws right there and it prevents
any<00:04:11.810> dirt<00:04:12.019> and<00:04:12.050> debris<00:04:12.230> to<00:04:12.590> get<00:04:12.739> inside<00:04:13.070> the

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
any dirt and debris to get inside the

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.699 
any dirt and debris to get inside the
headphones<00:04:13.700> and<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.660> I<00:04:14.690> really<00:04:15.200> thought<00:04:15.350> why

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
headphones and so I really thought why

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.500 
headphones and so I really thought why
the<00:04:15.769> sound<00:04:16.100> was<00:04:16.220> muffled<00:04:16.250> that<00:04:16.880> maybe<00:04:17.299> got

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
the sound was muffled that maybe got

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.300 
the sound was muffled that maybe got
some<00:04:17.630> ear<00:04:17.840> wax<00:04:18.109> or<00:04:18.260> something<00:04:18.560> in<00:04:18.650> there<00:04:18.799> so<00:04:19.280> I

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
some ear wax or something in there so I

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.729 
some ear wax or something in there so I
screwed<00:04:19.729> that<00:04:19.760> off<00:04:20.060> held<00:04:20.600> it<00:04:20.810> up<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.109> didn't

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
screwed that off held it up and didn't

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.469 
screwed that off held it up and didn't
see<00:04:21.890> any<00:04:22.040> major<00:04:22.310> things<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:22.940> it<00:04:23.030> it<00:04:23.150> was<00:04:23.240> pretty

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
see any major things to it it was pretty

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.590 
see any major things to it it was pretty
clear<00:04:23.810> put<00:04:24.410> it<00:04:24.530> back<00:04:24.650> on<00:04:24.680> same<00:04:25.580> result<00:04:25.910> so

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
clear put it back on same result so

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.540 
clear put it back on same result so
ultimately<00:04:27.110> I've<00:04:27.710> been<00:04:27.860> messing<00:04:28.010> with<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.400> I

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
ultimately I've been messing with that I

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.330 
ultimately I've been messing with that I
just<00:04:28.580> decided<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.210> take<00:04:29.360> that<00:04:29.600> cap<00:04:29.810> off<00:04:30.050> and

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
just decided to take that cap off and

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.620 
just decided to take that cap off and
listen<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.520> without<00:04:31.669> the<00:04:31.940> cap<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:32.479> it

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
listen to it without the cap and it

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.070 
listen to it without the cap and it
works<00:04:32.870> fine<00:04:32.960> and<00:04:33.410> so<00:04:34.100> I<00:04:34.130> did<00:04:34.430> that<00:04:34.460> for<00:04:34.610> both

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
works fine and so I did that for both

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.480 
works fine and so I did that for both
the<00:04:35.169> headphones<00:04:35.680> i<00:04:35.889> don't<00:04:36.099> have<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.310> mesh

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
the headphones i don't have the mesh

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.730 
the headphones i don't have the mesh
caps<00:04:36.819> in<00:04:37.000> there<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.389> just<00:04:38.169> have<00:04:38.289> them<00:04:38.349> open

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
caps in there and just have them open

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.189 
caps in there and just have them open
I'm<00:04:39.729> ready<00:04:40.030> for<00:04:40.090> debris<00:04:40.509> to<00:04:40.629> get<00:04:40.750> inside<00:04:41.020> of

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
I'm ready for debris to get inside of

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.300 
I'm ready for debris to get inside of
them<00:04:41.319> but<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:41.680> don't<00:04:41.740> think<00:04:41.919> that's<00:04:42.069> going<00:04:42.220> to

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
them but I don't think that's going to

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.580 
them but I don't think that's going to
happen<00:04:42.479> but<00:04:43.479> I<00:04:43.509> just<00:04:43.750> took<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.960> mesh<00:04:44.110> caps<00:04:44.379> off

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
happen but I just took the mesh caps off

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.920 
happen but I just took the mesh caps off
and<00:04:44.770> it<00:04:44.830> works<00:04:45.009> fine<00:04:45.509> whether<00:04:46.509> that<00:04:46.719> was<00:04:46.810> the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
and it works fine whether that was the

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.990 
and it works fine whether that was the
earwax<00:04:47.289> problem<00:04:47.979> I'm<00:04:48.189> not<00:04:48.400> ashamed<00:04:48.520> said

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
earwax problem I'm not ashamed said

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.089 
earwax problem I'm not ashamed said
whether<00:04:49.479> it<00:04:49.599> was<00:04:49.719> a<00:04:49.750> hex<00:04:50.229> problem<00:04:50.620> or<00:04:50.710> not<00:04:50.860> i

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:51.099 
whether it was a hex problem or not i

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:53.550 
whether it was a hex problem or not i
think<00:04:51.699> it<00:04:52.090> probably<00:04:52.120> was<00:04:52.689> but<00:04:52.990> i'm<00:04:53.139> not<00:04:53.229> sure

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
think it probably was but i'm not sure

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.110 
think it probably was but i'm not sure
but<00:04:53.860> i'm<00:04:54.280> looking<00:04:54.580> to<00:04:54.699> that<00:04:54.789> little<00:04:54.939> bit

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
but i'm looking to that little bit

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.709 
but i'm looking to that little bit
further<00:04:55.300> but<00:04:55.719> i<00:04:55.990> just<00:04:56.379> took<00:04:56.469> him<00:04:56.650> off<00:04:56.800> so<00:04:57.719> other

haven't<00:05:09.099> personally<00:05:09.909> bought<00:05:10.360> a<00:05:10.419> set<00:05:10.690> of

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
haven't personally bought a set of

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.839 
haven't personally bought a set of
headphones<00:05:11.139> and<00:05:11.349> years<00:05:11.680> for<00:05:12.340> three<00:05:12.699> or<00:05:12.819> four

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849 
headphones and years for three or four

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:16.080 
headphones and years for three or four
years<00:05:13.650> so<00:05:14.650> this<00:05:15.099> is<00:05:15.219> my<00:05:15.310> first<00:05:15.550> purchase<00:05:15.759> of

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
years so this is my first purchase of

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.749 
years so this is my first purchase of
him<00:05:16.240> and<00:05:16.419> it<00:05:16.780> didn't<00:05:17.020> blow<00:05:17.050> me<00:05:17.349> away<00:05:17.699> they<00:05:18.699> were

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 
him and it didn't blow me away they were

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:22.409 
him and it didn't blow me away they were
all<00:05:19.629> across<00:05:20.259> the<00:05:20.469> board<00:05:20.500> decent<00:05:21.340> didn't<00:05:22.300> blow

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
all across the board decent didn't blow

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.390 
all across the board decent didn't blow
me<00:05:22.599> away<00:05:22.629> I<00:05:23.110> think<00:05:23.379> they<00:05:23.469> were<00:05:23.530> very<00:05:23.740> solid

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
me away I think they were very solid

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.339 
me away I think they were very solid
design<00:05:24.520> now<00:05:25.389> with<00:05:25.629> the<00:05:25.719> worth<00:05:25.900> of<00:05:26.050> seven

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:26.349 
design now with the worth of seven

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.999 
design now with the worth of seven
seventy<00:05:26.770> nine<00:05:26.830> dollars<00:05:27.219> I<00:05:27.629> don't<00:05:28.629> think<00:05:28.690> so

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
seventy nine dollars I don't think so

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.189 
seventy nine dollars I don't think so
and<00:05:30.009> actually<00:05:30.190> I<00:05:30.669> would<00:05:30.759> actually<00:05:31.150> if<00:05:32.080> you

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:32.199 
and actually I would actually if you

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.629 
and actually I would actually if you
want<00:05:32.349> my<00:05:32.409> recommendation<00:05:33.250> I<00:05:33.400> would<00:05:33.430> probably

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:33.639 
want my recommendation I would probably

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:35.369 
want my recommendation I would probably
look<00:05:33.969> around<00:05:34.360> first<00:05:34.599> before<00:05:34.779> buying<00:05:34.960> these

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:35.379 
look around first before buying these

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:37.950 
look around first before buying these
headphones<00:05:35.939> I<00:05:36.939> think<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:37.360> can<00:05:37.479> find<00:05:37.689> some

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
headphones I think you can find some

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.499 
headphones I think you can find some
better<00:05:38.110> at<00:05:38.680> least<00:05:38.830> same<00:05:39.669> quality<00:05:40.300> headphones

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
better at least same quality headphones

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:42.570 
better at least same quality headphones
or<00:05:40.900> even<00:05:41.139> better<00:05:41.379> for<00:05:41.680> a<00:05:41.740> lower<00:05:41.919> price<00:05:42.039> point

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
or even better for a lower price point

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.279 
or even better for a lower price point
probably<00:05:43.270> around<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.509> fifty<00:05:43.840> dollar<00:05:44.020> price

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
probably around the fifty dollar price

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:45.360 
probably around the fifty dollar price
point<00:05:44.620> I've<00:05:44.710> been<00:05:44.860> looking<00:05:45.069> at<00:05:45.159> a<00:05:45.190> couple

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
point I've been looking at a couple

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.490 
point I've been looking at a couple
others<00:05:45.789> so<00:05:46.539> it<00:05:46.599> looks<00:05:46.750> like<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:47.020> fifty<00:05:47.289> dollar

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
others so it looks like the fifty dollar

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.200 
others so it looks like the fifty dollar
price<00:05:47.800> point<00:05:48.129> for<00:05:48.190> some<00:05:48.460> here<00:05:48.639> in<00:05:48.969> your

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
price point for some here in your

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.409 
price point for some here in your
headphones<00:05:49.419> it's<00:05:50.259> probably<00:05:50.469> the<00:05:50.680> sweet<00:05:50.979> spot

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
headphones it's probably the sweet spot

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.329 
headphones it's probably the sweet spot
so<00:05:52.419> deftly<00:05:52.810> before<00:05:53.620> you<00:05:53.680> go<00:05:53.830> out<00:05:53.860> and<00:05:54.129> spend

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:54.339 
so deftly before you go out and spend

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:56.700 
so deftly before you go out and spend
$79<00:05:55.150> on<00:05:55.270> these<00:05:55.360> headphones<00:05:55.569> look<00:05:56.379> around

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
$79 on these headphones look around

00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.869 
$79 on these headphones look around
first<00:05:56.889> you<00:05:57.069> might<00:05:57.219> find<00:05:57.400> something<00:05:57.699> better

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:57.879 
first you might find something better

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:00.600 
first you might find something better
and<00:05:58.500> so<00:05:59.500> I'm<00:05:59.589> definitely<00:05:59.740> gonna<00:06:00.099> do<00:06:00.250> that<00:06:00.400> to

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
and so I'm definitely gonna do that to

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.820 
and so I'm definitely gonna do that to
the<00:06:00.759> to<00:06:01.300> see<00:06:01.539> and<00:06:01.810> think<00:06:02.469> and<00:06:02.560> be<00:06:02.680> able<00:06:02.740> to

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830 
the to see and think and be able to

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.369 
the to see and think and be able to
compare<00:06:03.129> them<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.339> this<00:06:03.779> so<00:06:04.779> overall

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:05.379 
compare them to this so overall

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:08.399 
compare them to this so overall
impression<00:06:06.000> decent<00:06:07.000> good<00:06:07.419> didn't<00:06:08.139> blow<00:06:08.259> me

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:08.409
