meltdown<00:01:07.210> at<00:01:07.510> the<00:01:07.540> reactor<00:01:08.140> we<00:01:08.619> kind<00:01:08.830> of<00:01:08.890> came

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
meltdown at the reactor we kind of came

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.370 
meltdown at the reactor we kind of came
up<00:01:09.190> with<00:01:09.340> a<00:01:09.400> theme<00:01:09.610> with<00:01:09.820> the<00:01:10.080> about<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.170> same

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
up with a theme with the about the same

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.090 
up with a theme with the about the same
time<00:01:11.409> but<00:01:11.770> they<00:01:11.890> had<00:01:12.070> that<00:01:12.840> tsunami<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.229> the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
time but they had that tsunami and the

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.550 
time but they had that tsunami and the
the<00:01:15.549> reactor<00:01:16.060> problems<00:01:17.049> that<00:01:17.170> they<00:01:17.260> had<00:01:17.409> in

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
the reactor problems that they had in

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.500 
the reactor problems that they had in
Japan<00:01:17.920> sort<00:01:18.400> of<00:01:18.460> like<00:01:18.549> that<00:01:18.970> sounds<00:01:19.240> like<00:01:19.360> real

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
Japan sort of like that sounds like real

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.000 
Japan sort of like that sounds like real
life<00:01:19.750> and<00:01:19.930> I<00:01:20.049> think<00:01:20.290> they<00:01:20.380> actually<00:01:20.680> had<00:01:20.799> a<00:01:20.830> lot

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
life and I think they actually had a lot

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.719 
life and I think they actually had a lot
of<00:01:21.060> robotics<00:01:22.740> cleaning<00:01:23.740> up<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.979> reactor<00:01:24.280> at

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
of robotics cleaning up the reactor at

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.539 
of robotics cleaning up the reactor at
the<00:01:25.000> Japanese<00:01:25.930> nuclear<00:01:26.530> reactor<00:01:27.100> site<00:01:27.400> is

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
the Japanese nuclear reactor site is

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.100 
the Japanese nuclear reactor site is
that<00:01:27.580> I've<00:01:27.790> left<00:01:28.180> your<00:01:28.360> life<00:01:28.630> that's<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:28.960> good

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
that I've left your life that's a good

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.080 
that I've left your life that's a good
application<00:01:29.229> for<00:01:29.860> robotic<00:01:30.310> so<00:01:30.520> what<00:01:30.700> we<00:01:30.939> might

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
application for robotic so what we might

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.890 
application for robotic so what we might
think

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
think

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.100 
think
if<00:01:31.960> you're<00:01:32.820> trying<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.940> mimic<00:01:34.120> real<00:01:34.450> life<00:01:34.630> as

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
if you're trying to mimic real life as

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:44.790 
if you're trying to mimic real life as
much<00:01:35.320> as<00:01:35.380> possible<00:01:42.180> section<00:01:43.180> one<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.470> two<00:01:44.470> or

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
autonomous navigation section one most

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.640 
autonomous navigation section one most
teams<00:01:48.550> use<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:49.000> ultrasound<00:01:49.720> sensors<00:01:50.290> to

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
teams use the ultrasound sensors to

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.550 
teams use the ultrasound sensors to
bounce<00:01:51.310> sound<00:01:51.850> waves<00:01:52.150> off<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.540> walls<00:01:52.780> and

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
bounce sound waves off the walls and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.260 
bounce sound waves off the walls and
navigate<00:01:54.130> on<00:01:54.340> to<00:01:54.670> section<00:01:55.330> 2<00:01:55.480> which<00:01:55.750> is<00:01:55.780> using

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
navigate on to section 2 which is using

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.910 
navigate on to section 2 which is using
light<00:01:58.270> waves<00:01:58.540> to<00:01:58.810> detect<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.260> line<00:01:59.470> and<00:01:59.770> pick

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
light waves to detect the line and pick

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
light waves to detect the line and pick
up<00:02:00.040> on<00:02:00.220> that<00:02:00.660> and<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:03.310> that's<00:02:03.460> really<00:02:03.640> true

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
up on that and and that's really true

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.520 
up on that and and that's really true
robotics<00:02:04.479> and<00:02:04.690> that's<00:02:04.840> probably<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.380> most

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
robotics and that's probably the most

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.960 
robotics and that's probably the most
difficult<00:02:05.680> most<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.430> the<00:02:06.490> programming

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
difficult most of the programming

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.250 
difficult most of the programming
intensive<00:02:07.540> part<00:02:07.750> but<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.970> know<00:02:10.090> I<00:02:10.420> always<00:02:10.959> say

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
intensive part but you know I always say

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.110 
intensive part but you know I always say
you<00:02:11.680> know<00:02:11.800> if<00:02:11.980> it's<00:02:12.100> not<00:02:12.280> autonomous<00:02:12.610> it's<00:02:12.970> not

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
you know if it's not autonomous it's not

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.680 
you know if it's not autonomous it's not
a<00:02:13.150> robotic<00:02:13.660> it's<00:02:13.840> really<00:02:13.990> cool<00:02:14.230> machines<00:02:15.690> but

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
a robotic it's really cool machines but

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.990 
a robotic it's really cool machines but
if<00:02:16.840> it's<00:02:16.990> not<00:02:17.050> autonomous<00:02:17.530> if<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.880> robot

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
if it's not autonomous if the robot

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.730 
if it's not autonomous if the robot
doesn't<00:02:19.360> have<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.690> ability<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.050> perform<00:02:20.470> some

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
intervention and it's not truly robotics

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.020 
intervention and it's not truly robotics
it's<00:02:24.820> just<00:02:25.120> big<00:02:25.990> RC<00:02:26.560> or<00:02:26.860> big<00:02:27.340> machines<00:02:27.760> that

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
it's just big RC or big machines that

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.560 
it's just big RC or big machines that
are<00:02:28.090> cool<00:02:28.330> and<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:30.520> the<00:02:30.640> autonomous<00:02:31.120> challenge

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
are cool and in the autonomous challenge

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.770 
are cool and in the autonomous challenge
obviously<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:32.800> most<00:02:32.980> difficult

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.509 

and<00:02:38.780> then<00:02:38.959> they<00:02:39.049> switch<00:02:39.319> into<00:02:39.739> manual<00:02:40.430> mode

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
and then they switch into manual mode

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.640 
and then they switch into manual mode
there's<00:02:41.060> a<00:02:41.150> design<00:02:41.480> challenge<00:02:41.810> there<00:02:42.409> where

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
there's a design challenge there where

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.190 
there's a design challenge there where
they've<00:02:42.769> got<00:02:42.920> to<00:02:43.069> construct<00:02:43.579> a<00:02:43.810> claw<00:02:44.810> or<00:02:44.840> an

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
they've got to construct a claw or an

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.459 
they've got to construct a claw or an
end<00:02:45.349> of<00:02:45.469> arm<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.859> leg<00:02:46.129> and<00:02:46.689> pick<00:02:47.689> up<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.019> the

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:48.469 
end of arm to leg and pick up the the

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.410 
end of arm to leg and pick up the the
fuel<00:02:48.709> rods<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.370> kind<00:02:49.579> of<00:02:49.640> contain<00:02:50.030> them<00:02:50.269> as

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
fuel rods and kind of contain them as

00:02:50.420 --> 00:03:10.190 
fuel rods and kind of contain them as
kind<00:02:50.659> of<00:02:50.719> the<00:02:50.900> thing

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.290 

and<00:03:11.200> then<00:03:11.620> next<00:03:12.459> phase<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:12.940> pick<00:03:13.150> up<00:03:13.240> the

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
and then next phase is pick up the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.090 
and then next phase is pick up the
disaster<00:03:13.959> victim<00:03:14.350> they<00:03:14.470> got<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.709> little<00:03:14.830> dude

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
disaster victim they got the little dude

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.400 
disaster victim they got the little dude
there<00:03:15.430> if<00:03:15.670> they<00:03:16.030> if<00:03:16.480> they<00:03:16.600> don't<00:03:16.780> contain<00:03:17.110> that

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
there if they if they don't contain that

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.440 
there if they if they don't contain that
reactor<00:03:17.950> fuel<00:03:18.160> rods<00:03:18.520> within<00:03:18.910> a<00:03:18.940> certain<00:03:19.150> time

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
reactor fuel rods within a certain time

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.850 
reactor fuel rods within a certain time
here<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.870> then<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.080> little<00:03:20.170> dude<00:03:20.380> turns<00:03:20.650> into

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
here and then the little dude turns into

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.970 
here and then the little dude turns into
the<00:03:21.010> hole<00:03:21.660> from<00:03:22.660> over<00:03:23.110> exposure<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:23.650> radiation

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
the hole from over exposure to radiation

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.640 
the hole from over exposure to radiation
and<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.390> that<00:03:25.540> that's<00:03:26.050> a<00:03:26.140> little<00:03:26.380> bit<00:03:26.500> of<00:03:26.590> a

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
and so that that's a little bit of a

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.500 
and so that that's a little bit of a
mechanical<00:03:27.190> disadvantage<00:03:27.580> it's<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.300> little

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
mechanical disadvantage it's a little

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:38.780 
mechanical disadvantage it's a little
bigger<00:03:28.720> a<00:03:28.840> little<00:03:29.040> heavier

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.780 

and<00:03:39.790> then<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:41.170> last<00:03:41.200> phases<00:03:41.680> they<00:03:42.070> got<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.370> get

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
and then the last phases they got to get

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.690 
and then the last phases they got to get
out<00:03:42.940> of<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.210> disaster<00:03:43.660> wreckage

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
out of the disaster wreckage

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.900 
out of the disaster wreckage
with<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:47.290> disaster<00:03:47.800> rescue<00:03:48.069> victim

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.220 

I<00:03:54.360> hope<00:03:55.360> they're<00:03:55.570> learning<00:03:55.720> some<00:03:56.020> hard

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
I hope they're learning some hard

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.260 
I hope they're learning some hard
lessons<00:03:56.410> about<00:03:56.950> teamwork<00:03:57.580> you<00:03:58.150> know

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
lessons about teamwork you know

obviously the mechanical systems have to
