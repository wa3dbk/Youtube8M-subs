00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
things

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530 
things
yeah<00:00:38.250> how<00:00:38.640> does<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.879> gain<00:00:38.969> compared<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
yeah how does it gain compared to the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.830 
yeah how does it gain compared to the
original<00:00:42.440> where's<00:00:43.440> nowhere<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.840> 21st

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
original where's nowhere in the 21st

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.440 
original where's nowhere in the 21st
century<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.230> it's<00:00:46.590> more<00:00:46.860> involved<00:00:47.160> now<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
century so it's more involved now so it

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.510 
century so it's more involved now so it
will<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.780> quicker<00:00:49.110> faster<00:00:49.559> more<00:00:50.010> adaptable

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
will be quicker faster more adaptable

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.610 
will be quicker faster more adaptable
moves<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.120> everything<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> think<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.530> I

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
moves with everything so I think that I

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.100 
moves with everything so I think that I
like<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.129> much<00:00:53.250> more<00:00:53.610> today<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.420> Mike<00:00:54.750> Tyson

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
like so much more today like Mike Tyson

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.970 
like so much more today like Mike Tyson

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to be pretty interesting and it comes

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.609 
to be pretty interesting and it comes
out<00:01:06.570> on<00:01:06.630> iPhone<00:01:07.080> when<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.320> come<00:01:07.439> out

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619
