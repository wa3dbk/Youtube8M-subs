00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
war 3 right now I don't I mean the idea

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.309 
war 3 right now I don't I mean the idea
of<00:02:09.759> interfacing<00:02:10.390> with<00:02:10.420> the<00:02:10.539> game<00:02:10.810> in<00:02:10.989> new<00:02:11.140> and

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
of interfacing with the game in new and

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.460 
of interfacing with the game in new and
fresh<00:02:11.530> ways<00:02:11.800> is<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:13.239> cool<00:02:13.540> thing<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:14.290> whether

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
fresh ways is a cool thing and whether

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.740 
fresh ways is a cool thing and whether
it's<00:02:14.650> on<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:14.860> Wii<00:02:15.010> or<00:02:15.040> the<00:02:15.370> ps3<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.209> think<00:02:16.660> it's

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
it's on the Wii or the ps3 I think it's

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.210 
it's on the Wii or the ps3 I think it's
a<00:02:16.810> great<00:02:16.840> way<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.260> communicate<00:02:17.470> with<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.040> game

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
a great way to communicate with the game

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.460 
a great way to communicate with the game
and<00:02:18.250> sort<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.700> give<00:02:19.239> new<00:02:19.450> puzzles<00:02:19.900> and<00:02:20.110> action

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
and sort of give new puzzles and action

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.860 
and sort of give new puzzles and action
sequences<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.040> all<00:02:21.160> that<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:22.360> believe<00:02:22.720> in

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
sequences and all that so I believe in

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.330 
sequences and all that so I believe in
it<00:02:22.959> for<00:02:23.140> what<00:02:23.290> we're<00:02:23.440> doing<00:02:23.680> now<00:02:23.830> is<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.250> the

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
it for what we're doing now is it the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.250 
it for what we're doing now is it the
next<00:02:24.489> big<00:02:24.790> thing<00:02:25.030> I<00:02:25.269> don't<00:02:25.780> know<00:02:25.900> but<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.170> think

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
next big thing I don't know but I think

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.020 
next big thing I don't know but I think
designers<00:02:26.799> are<00:02:27.069> excited<00:02:27.489> about<00:02:27.549> it<00:02:27.790> on<00:02:27.880> both

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
designers are excited about it on both

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.940 
designers are excited about it on both
both<00:02:28.450> systems<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.140> we'll<00:02:29.620> see<00:02:29.739> where<00:02:29.860> it<00:02:29.890> goes

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
both systems and we'll see where it goes

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.130 
both systems and we'll see where it goes
and<00:02:30.549> just<00:02:30.940> finally<00:02:31.120> do<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.510> believe<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.049> the
