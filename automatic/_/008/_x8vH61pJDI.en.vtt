00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
and this happens every year I guess

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.280 
and this happens every year I guess
happens<00:04:53.820> every<00:04:54.090> year<00:04:54.120> October<00:04:55.110> through

happens every year October through
December<00:04:56.270> it's<00:04:57.270> like<00:04:58.140> basically<00:04:58.830> a

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
December it's like basically a

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.760 
December it's like basically a

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
hypothermia the animals come in they're

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.550 
hypothermia the animals come in they're

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
malnourished dehydrated a lot of the

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.800

animals have pneumonia some have
secondary<00:05:07.470> trauma<00:05:07.800> we<00:05:08.580> had<00:05:08.670> released<00:05:09.030> one

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
secondary trauma we had released one

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.180 
secondary trauma we had released one
turtle<00:05:09.660> today<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:10.050> have<00:05:10.170> prop<00:05:10.440> strike<00:05:10.800> on<00:05:11.010> it

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
turtle today that have prop strike on it

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.270 
turtle today that have prop strike on it
that<00:05:11.790> healed<00:05:12.030> up<00:05:12.180> during<00:05:12.690> the<00:05:12.780> rehab<00:05:13.280> they're

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
that healed up during the rehab they're

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.250 
that healed up during the rehab they're
really<00:05:14.730> very<00:05:15.000> thin<00:05:15.390> most<00:05:15.660> of<00:05:15.780> these<00:05:15.870> turtles

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.260 
really very thin most of these turtles

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.810 
really very thin most of these turtles
have<00:05:16.380> gained<00:05:16.620> anywhere<00:05:17.040> from<00:05:17.190> four<00:05:17.520> to<00:05:17.580> eight

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
have gained anywhere from four to eight

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.480 
have gained anywhere from four to eight
pounds<00:05:18.570> and<00:05:18.780> they're<00:05:19.350> fairly<00:05:19.680> small<00:05:20.010> animals

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
pounds and they're fairly small animals

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.670 
pounds and they're fairly small animals
so<00:05:20.730> that's<00:05:20.970> a<00:05:21.120> that's<00:05:21.450> a<00:05:21.630> good<00:05:22.260> weight<00:05:22.440> game

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
so that's a that's a good weight game

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.320 
so that's a that's a good weight game
for<00:05:22.980> them<00:05:23.190> you<00:05:23.640> know<00:05:23.730> I<00:05:23.760> guess<00:05:23.910> so<00:05:24.030> that's<00:05:24.180> what

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
for them you know I guess so that's what

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:25.610 
for them you know I guess so that's what
adds<00:05:24.510> a<00:05:24.570> little<00:05:24.660> bit<00:05:24.780> of<00:05:24.870> at<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.140> prospect

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
adds a little bit of at the prospect

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.960 
adds a little bit of at the prospect
we're<00:05:25.860> talking<00:05:26.130> a<00:05:26.190> little<00:05:26.370> bit<00:05:26.490> Tony<00:05:26.790> and

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
we're talking a little bit Tony and

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.730 
we're talking a little bit Tony and
obviously<00:05:27.390> these<00:05:27.540> are<00:05:27.600> turtles<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:28.320> will

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
obviously these are turtles that will

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.800 
obviously these are turtles that will
migrate<00:05:28.950> and<00:05:29.460> migrate<00:05:29.820> back<00:05:30.030> to<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.420> Gulf<00:05:30.660> of

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
migrate and migrate back to the Gulf of

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.750 
migrate and migrate back to the Gulf of

we<00:05:40.380> were<00:05:40.530> concerned<00:05:40.860> about<00:05:41.010> that<00:05:41.340> but

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
we were concerned about that but

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.730 
we were concerned about that but

this age class on the East Coast show
that<00:05:48.000> usually<00:05:48.330> these<00:05:48.480> animals<00:05:48.960> at<00:05:49.170> at<00:05:49.500> this

that usually these animals at at this

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.500 
that usually these animals at at this
age<00:05:49.950> will<00:05:50.250> head<00:05:50.400> down<00:05:50.550> to<00:05:50.700> the<00:05:50.730> Carolinas<00:05:51.360> and

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
age will head down to the Carolinas and

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.600 
age will head down to the Carolinas and
Georgia<00:05:51.570> and<00:05:52.140> they'll<00:05:52.740> still<00:05:53.100> say<00:05:53.280> there<00:05:53.460> for

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
Georgia and they'll still say there for

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.410 
Georgia and they'll still say there for
a<00:05:53.640> while<00:05:54.000> it's<00:05:54.930> not<00:05:55.080> really<00:05:55.260> we<00:05:56.150> usually<00:05:57.150> will

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
a while it's not really we usually will

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.410 
a while it's not really we usually will
lose<00:05:57.570> track<00:05:57.990> after<00:05:58.770> about<00:05:59.370> a<00:05:59.430> year<00:05:59.520> sometimes

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
lose track after about a year sometimes

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.170 
lose track after about a year sometimes
less<00:06:00.930> but<00:06:01.340> we're<00:06:02.340> fairly<00:06:02.580> confident<00:06:03.090> that

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
less but we're fairly confident that

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.370 
less but we're fairly confident that
these<00:06:03.390> animals<00:06:03.600> will<00:06:03.870> stay<00:06:04.020> on<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.200> East

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
these animals will stay on the East

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.230 
these animals will stay on the East
Coast<00:06:04.530> and<00:06:05.040> until<00:06:05.610> they're<00:06:05.730> sexually<00:06:05.940> mature

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
Coast and until they're sexually mature

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.520 
Coast and until they're sexually mature
which<00:06:06.570> will<00:06:06.690> be<00:06:06.780> in<00:06:06.870> about<00:06:06.930> another<00:06:07.140> ten<00:06:07.500> years

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
which will be in about another ten years

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.320 
which will be in about another ten years
won't<00:06:08.100> probably<00:06:08.310> head<00:06:08.580> back<00:06:08.610> into<00:06:09.000> the<00:06:09.180> Gulf

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
won't probably head back into the Gulf

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.330 
won't probably head back into the Gulf
of<00:06:09.450> Mexico

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:10.340 
of Mexico

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.490 
of Mexico
so<00:06:10.460> we're<00:06:11.030> fairly<00:06:11.270> confident<00:06:11.780> that<00:06:11.900> these

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
so we're fairly confident that these

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.920 
so we're fairly confident that these
animals<00:06:12.940> hopefully<00:06:13.940> won't<00:06:14.150> feel<00:06:14.480> any<00:06:14.630> effects

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
animals hopefully won't feel any effects

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.420 
animals hopefully won't feel any effects
from<00:06:15.020> the<00:06:15.230> oil<00:06:15.260> because<00:06:15.889> when<00:06:16.040> they<00:06:16.160> go<00:06:16.280> on<00:06:16.310> to

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
from the oil because when they go on to

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.010 
from the oil because when they go on to
Gulf<00:06:16.610> that's<00:06:16.820> where<00:06:16.970> they<00:06:17.090> breed<00:06:17.389> and<00:06:17.720> they

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
Gulf that's where they breed and they

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.050 
Gulf that's where they breed and they
breed<00:06:18.230> on<00:06:18.380> the<00:06:18.530> beaches<00:06:19.280> down<00:06:19.580> in<00:06:19.790> the<00:06:19.880> Gulf

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
breed on the beaches down in the Gulf

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.450 
breed on the beaches down in the Gulf
Coast<00:06:20.360> yep<00:06:20.810> the<00:06:21.080> Kemp's<00:06:21.680> Ridley's<00:06:21.979> have<00:06:22.220> two
