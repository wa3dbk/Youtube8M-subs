here's the thing that makes life so

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.380 
here's the thing that makes life so
interesting<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:16.970> theory<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.000> evolution

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
interesting the theory of evolution

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
interesting the theory of evolution
claims<00:00:19.170> only<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> strong<00:00:20.070> shall<00:00:20.520> survive

maybe<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.710> maybe<00:00:23.269> so<00:00:25.310> but<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.490> theory<00:00:26.939> of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
maybe so maybe so but the theory of

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the strong doesn't mean they can't get

but what the odds don't know is this
isn't<00:00:51.140> a<00:00:51.200> math<00:00:51.410> test<00:00:52.390> this<00:00:53.390> is<00:00:53.660> a<00:00:53.720> completely

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
isn't a math test this is a completely

isn't a math test this is a completely
different<00:00:54.890> kind<00:00:55.190> of<00:00:55.430> test<00:00:56.110> one<00:00:57.110> where<00:00:57.380> passion

different kind of test one where passion

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.520 
different kind of test one where passion
has<00:00:59.270> a<00:00:59.300> funny<00:00:59.690> way<00:00:59.810> of<00:00:59.960> trumping<00:01:00.590> logic

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
has a funny way of trumping logic

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.799 
has a funny way of trumping logic
so<00:01:03.129> before<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.579> step<00:01:03.879> up<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.150> the<00:01:04.299> starting

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
so before you step up to the starting

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.430 
so before you step up to the starting
line<00:01:05.760> before<00:01:06.760> the<00:01:07.090> whistle<00:01:07.270> blows<00:01:07.720> and<00:01:08.049> the

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
line before the whistle blows and the

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.310 
line before the whistle blows and the
clock<00:01:08.680> starts<00:01:08.710> ticking<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:10.600> remember<00:01:11.140> out

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
clock starts ticking just remember out

clock starts ticking just remember out
here<00:01:11.920> the<00:01:12.759> results<00:01:13.210> don't<00:01:13.360> always<00:01:13.780> add<00:01:13.960> up

all<00:01:25.759> bets<00:01:26.329> are<00:01:26.600> off<00:01:27.520> don't<00:01:28.520> be<00:01:28.640> surprised<00:01:29.119> if

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
all bets are off don't be surprised if
