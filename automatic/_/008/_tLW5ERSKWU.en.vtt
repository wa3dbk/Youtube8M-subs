00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
and the portability I think it's really

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.880 
and the portability I think it's really
great<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.040> fact<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.430> you<00:02:22.940> don't<00:02:23.150> need<00:02:23.890> to

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
great the fact that you don't need to

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.470 
great the fact that you don't need to
have<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.040> power<00:02:25.310> supply<00:02:25.520> it<00:02:25.760> gets<00:02:26.150> all<00:02:26.300> of<00:02:26.330> its

have a power supply it gets all of its
power<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.260> it<00:02:27.530> uses<00:02:27.770> very<00:02:27.980> little<00:02:28.040> power<00:02:28.459> from

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000

or the computer that you're using over
here<00:02:37.250> is<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.610> connector<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.030> connect<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.600> to

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
here is the connector to connect it to

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.610 
here is the connector to connect it to

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
your iPad or your iPhone this is the USB

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.930 
your iPad or your iPhone this is the USB
connector<00:02:42.920> so<00:02:43.340> it's<00:02:43.459> just<00:02:43.550> like<00:02:43.700> plugging

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
connector so it's just like plugging

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.930 
connector so it's just like plugging
into<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.269> back<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.599> a<00:02:44.690> printer<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:46.130> then

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
into the back of a printer and then

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.960 
into the back of a printer and then
these<00:02:47.360> are<00:02:47.420> the<00:02:47.600> peas<00:02:48.019> are<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.260> jacks<00:02:48.590> for

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
these are the peas are the jacks for

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.729 
these are the peas are the jacks for
expression<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.180> sustain<00:02:50.720> so<00:02:51.170> how<00:02:51.290> do<00:02:51.350> you<00:02:51.530> use

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
expression and sustain so how do you use

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.890 
expression and sustain so how do you use
