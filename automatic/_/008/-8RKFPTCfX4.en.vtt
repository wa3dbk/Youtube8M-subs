00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 this genuine fur once this 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.820
 the guy he was alive with his eyes today 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.410
 serves man 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:17.369
 man, he serves as bedding for the feet 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:19.050

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.359
 wind and you watch my channel smart and 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.220
 Arianism guide where we consider the most 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.810
 painful 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.710
 vegetarian questions and find them 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.150
 answers 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.039
 I recently wrote a good man 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.040
 by the name of the strip gr 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.730
 I really don't know what your hobbies are 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.800
 when parents made up a world for themselves 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.090
 that's what he wrote and what he asked 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:44.850
 there are things like leather fur sheepskin coat 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.789
 silk well i mean punks are listed then 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.489
 what he wore and other things he does and 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.530
 make animals can make their 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.239
 mite in this topic because many 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.860
 refuse these materials because 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.410
 ethical considerations would like to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:05.250
 hear your opinion and spike jar with cyber 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:07.200
 and here is my opinion but it is obvious that we 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.900
 love animals so much we try with 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.320
 never leave them in our 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.810
 relations there are three levels 1 level we 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.180
 we eat them so much we love animals 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.380
 all the time just put them inside 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.409
 second level 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.680
 from animals we make clothes like that 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.700
 we carry them on the third level 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.939
 With the help of animals we have fun circus 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.329
 racecourses 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.369
 zoo dolphinariums it seems that hard 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:40.290
 and firmly entrenched in our animals 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.280
 the relationship is true we will only take one 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.280
 role and role only 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.020
 as for vegetarianism then this 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.880
 definitely a plus in feed and vegetarians 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.310
 these are people of the next 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.590
 intelligent generation order 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.030
 generations that will replace here 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.030
 this consumer society 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.850
 because vegetarianism is 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.509
 personal evolution is your level 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.990
 this evolution is very easy to define 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.570
 changing because you feel about 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:20.860
 it is easiest for animals to stop paying 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:23.350
 money for the humiliation of animals not to go to 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.500
 circus at the zoo in these dolphinariums 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.690
 hippodromes to places where they are parasitic 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.820
 animal abilities by exposing it 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.130
 some sports entertainment and away 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.080
 just stopped paying for over 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.020
 they were bullied like this 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.870
 turn up on the first basic level 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.610
 personal evolution to the second stage 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.380
 to evolution you rise and 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.380
 fixed on her then when 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:51.340
 stop carrying animals inside you 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.830
 so stop eating them is actually 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.870
 it is very profitable 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.660
 look younger feel better 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.640
 but the third level for advanced is 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.610
 when you stop carrying animals on 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.400
 Statement surprisingly but wearing them 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.390
 I often find myself harder than 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.850
 carry them in yourself why because that 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.070
 a man who makes expensive leather 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.610
 clothes shoes 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.980
 belts this is micha like this coats 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.500
 he is always in the eyes of others 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.019
 more status than the one who walks 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:36.390
 water pants you want to know what are my 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:36.390
 expensive leather shoes like that 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:44.750
 shame I don't have everything my time 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:47.480
 never try forcibly 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.520
 convince the person to take off his leather shoes and 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.810
 instead start wearing 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.930
 sandals around its time and every 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.340
 individually along its path whatever 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.660
 winding it was not 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:06.280
 he will come to the first second or third 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.280
 stage of personal evolution 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:17.150
 friend my bank cyber os listen in my 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.780
 it's not very hard there and so expensive 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.510
 change your name you think I hope 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:26.150
