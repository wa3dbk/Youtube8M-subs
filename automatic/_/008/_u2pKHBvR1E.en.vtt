San<00:03:20.640> Diego<00:03:20.760> Comic<00:03:21.269> Con<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:21.629> think<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.019> would

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
San Diego Comic Con I think that would

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.089 
San Diego Comic Con I think that would
be<00:03:22.200> super<00:03:22.980> awesome<00:03:23.159> if<00:03:23.790> they<00:03:24.360> had<00:03:24.599> all<00:03:24.900> mane<00:03:25.680> 6

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
be super awesome if they had all mane 6

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.570
