00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
this does go on to make a sacrifice mm

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.439 
this does go on to make a sacrifice mm
which<00:00:54.600> we<00:00:54.840> further<00:00:55.079> down<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:56.010> do<00:00:56.160> have

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449

00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:28.789 
to sacrifice cow in front well so this

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:31.899 
to sacrifice cow in front well so this
neck<00:01:29.060> does<00:01:29.390> have<00:01:29.829> kind<00:01:30.829> of<00:01:30.950> Integrative<00:01:31.640> grind

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
neck does have kind of Integrative grind

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.139 
neck does have kind of Integrative grind
rail<00:01:32.119> system<00:01:32.539> in<00:01:32.659> the<00:01:32.750> bottom<00:01:33.049> where<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.860> is

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
rail system in the bottom where it is

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.789 
rail system in the bottom where it is
rich<00:01:35.149> on<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.569> bottom<00:01:35.869> so<00:01:36.049> it<00:01:36.229> creates<00:01:36.560> less

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 
rich on the bottom so it creates less

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:38.740 
rich on the bottom so it creates less
friction<00:01:37.159> when<00:01:37.819> you're<00:01:38.000> trying<00:01:38.179> to<00:01:38.329> grind<00:01:38.539> a
