00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:07.340
 or smooth and the uib and we're going to make a 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:12.219
 skirt and skirt because the dane asked for the 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.219
 tutorial and many people ask for tutorials 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.869
 well this I think it would be help and 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.070
 they are working 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.390
 ha ha ha 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:26.840
 we have here a cloth like that if it's a 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.530
 technique is bent in half 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.880
 before the small 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.880
 to allow in that sense 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.880
 Well, here you're going to mark the 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.330
 fabric the part up here will go the 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.250
 waist and here below see what is the 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.410
 long skirt makes a small shovel 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.360
 but no more the ass back 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:54.910
 in the same cloth then with josÃ© greda 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.820
 eyes what you have at hand go 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.850
 marking with the tape measure what 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.390
 measure your waist for this case divide 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.390
 between 3 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.979
 then here a dose for girls 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:13.340
 but they go eck and they're marking like this 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.049
 congregates putting the tape I can not 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.049
 serve because he recorded and plan dollar 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.550
 and not so it has to look like it's 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.750
 in the form of a circle 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.680
 this is for swimming skirts and quickie d 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.800
 that there is a circle 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.880
 and then where the measurement of the 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.620
 waist makes a long of faster so that 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.730
 scope 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.730
 of 20 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.710
 to say something 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.780
 then where is the brand of the 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.780
 waist let's leave them in 20 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.520
 and at the end of the tape 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.619
 we are going to park the 20 and so I am 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.619
 dialing 20 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.240
 twenty 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.240
 or more 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.180
 to 20 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.590
 and something like that would be a medium skirt 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:36.459
 circle is seen to see well 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.520
 and here we have the waist and here 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.680
 we have the length of the skirt 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.340
 uy 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.850
 it is already dry to make the circle 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.400
 full 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.100
 good to make the circle skirt 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.160
 I was completely asked if how 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.140
 they do to cut the fabric and they do not 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.610
 sew then what we do 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.850
 us here is to fold the TV in 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.590
 four I think it shows and the stroke we 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.840
 will start doing the part of achilles and 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.840
 half where the two parts meet 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.850
 bent like the palms of 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.730
 full circle city for my house 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.730
 from full circle is going to be the one 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.050
 it gives me waist divided by 6 then 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.210
 The same will not be the case 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:29.130
 oh my god and you can dial with the 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.130
 matter but I take it 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.270
 well then massages and tape with 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.270
 pears 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.750
 we are going to mark for what was going to mark 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.080
 again but to dial 10 so that it 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.080
 note 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.410
 here we will mark what is waist 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.830
 between 6 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:00.480
 and where we mark waist between 6 we go to 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:02.940
 download them to see how much it arrives here 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.060
 long skirt through 20 so that 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.370
 come out line 10 and we will go putting 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.349
 tape 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.239
 let's put it where we're going to do the 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:18.709
 skirt length and drawn with clay 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.709
 x what they have 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.650
 we mark 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.150
 we mark 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.810
 to see again 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.870
 and afterwards we passed or yes 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.110
 well then here you can see a little 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.760
 plus 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.760
 what is there of white 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.480
 As I tell you, here is waist between 6 and 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:56.220
 here we will mark what is the length of 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:59.280
 skirt folding the fabric in four and 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.310
 tracing where the two doubles are made 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.260
 everyone takes the fabric like this 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:07.550
 then I'm going to double one and here in 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:10.190
 four for that when cutting 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.220
 leave a single piece that you no longer need 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:17.390
 sewing how much to put a waistband 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:20.000
 of size puts the elastic something like that 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.520
 it would be to trace a good lack many 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:28.750

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.750
