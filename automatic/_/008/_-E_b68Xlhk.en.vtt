00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.320 
cut the rope - you can experiment with
applications<00:02:08.160> some<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.399> them<00:02:08.640> might<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.000> work

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
applications some of them might not work

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.479 
applications some of them might not work
that<00:02:09.599> well<00:02:09.810> because<00:02:10.190> since<00:02:11.190> you're<00:02:11.340> doing

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
that well because since you're doing

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.370 
that well because since you're doing
this<00:02:11.760> not<00:02:12.120> all<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.330> applications<00:02:12.780> are<00:02:12.900> made

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
this not all the applications are made

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.950 
this not all the applications are made
to<00:02:13.590> multitask<00:02:14.400> um<00:02:14.580> these<00:02:15.180> work<00:02:15.450> well<00:02:15.480> together

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
to multitask um these work well together

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.120 
to multitask um these work well together
but<00:02:16.380> you<00:02:16.530> guys<00:02:16.620> are<00:02:16.770> still<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:17.070> to

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
experiment and see which one's work for

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.600 
experiment and see which one's work for
