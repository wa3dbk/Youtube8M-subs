I guess the never dragons after the
minecraft<00:03:37.450> dragon<00:03:38.480> if<00:03:38.840> you<00:03:39.080> ever<00:03:39.170> playing

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
minecraft dragon if you ever playing

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.130 
minecraft dragon if you ever playing
Minecraft<00:03:39.950> and<00:03:40.190> it<00:03:41.030> turns<00:03:41.330> invisible<00:03:41.510> which

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
Minecraft and it turns invisible which

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.690 
Minecraft and it turns invisible which
makes<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:42.590> much<00:03:42.710> harder<00:03:42.770> for<00:03:43.190> me<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.550> even

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
makes it much harder for me to even

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.880 
makes it much harder for me to even
shoot<00:03:44.030> him<00:03:44.240> and<00:03:44.540> he<00:03:44.810> sell<00:03:45.080> all<00:03:45.230> over<00:03:45.380> the<00:03:45.650> place

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
shoot him and he sell all over the place

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.860 
shoot him and he sell all over the place
I<00:03:46.040> can't<00:03:46.280> kill<00:03:46.610> him<00:03:46.790> I'm<00:03:47.210> really<00:03:47.450> struggling

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
to kill him

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.580 
to kill him
because<00:03:50.060> it<00:03:50.210> took<00:03:50.300> me<00:03:50.450> so<00:03:50.600> long<00:03:50.630> I<00:03:50.930> had<00:03:51.080> to<00:03:51.110> cut

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
because it took me so long I had to cut

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.360 
because it took me so long I had to cut
it<00:03:51.620> up<00:03:51.860> in<00:03:52.100> parts<00:03:52.520> and<00:03:52.670> then<00:03:52.820> nearly<00:03:53.060> died<00:03:53.480> and

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
it up in parts and then nearly died and

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.620 
it up in parts and then nearly died and
yeah<00:03:55.370> this<00:03:55.640> mod<00:03:56.000> makes<00:03:56.240> it<00:03:56.390> more<00:03:56.510> enjoyable
