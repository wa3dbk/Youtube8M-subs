00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.160 
even realistically have a contract I
mean<00:01:32.850> he<00:01:32.909> may<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.180> legends<00:01:33.570> contract<00:01:34.020> with

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
mean he may have a legends contract with

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.929 
mean he may have a legends contract with
them<00:01:34.320> but<00:01:34.439> it's<00:01:34.530> not<00:01:34.590> like<00:01:34.890> I<00:01:35.130> mean<00:01:35.759> whatever

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
them but it's not like I mean whatever

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.520 
them but it's not like I mean whatever
heat<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.509> Shawn<00:01:36.750> Michaels<00:01:36.780> has<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.290> him<00:01:37.439> I

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
heat that Shawn Michaels has on him I

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.100 
heat that Shawn Michaels has on him I
think<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:37.890> gonna<00:01:38.130> pass<00:01:38.369> him<00:01:38.579> by<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.150> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
think it's just gonna pass him by so you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630 
think it's just gonna pass him by so you
know<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.590> felt<00:01:40.799> Shawn<00:01:41.040> Michaels<00:01:41.310> probably

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
know and I felt Shawn Michaels probably

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.920 
know and I felt Shawn Michaels probably
whatever<00:01:41.790> he<00:01:42.060> said<00:01:42.299> was<00:01:42.329> better<00:01:42.659> than<00:01:42.810> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
whatever he said was better than the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.179 
whatever he said was better than the
speech<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.380> was<00:01:43.470> pre<00:01:43.740> written<00:01:43.890> for<00:01:44.100> him

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
speech that was pre written for him

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.190 
speech that was pre written for him
anyways<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.759> I<00:01:45.119> thought<00:01:45.329> Medusa's<00:01:45.930> speech

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
anyways and I thought Medusa's speech

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.870 
anyways and I thought Medusa's speech
was<00:01:46.409> great<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.710> thought<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.250> awesome<00:01:47.729> I

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
was great I thought it was awesome I

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.580 
was great I thought it was awesome I
wouldn't<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.570> changed<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.140> thing<00:01:49.170> about

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
wouldn't have changed one thing about

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.830 
wouldn't have changed one thing about
Medusa<00:01:50.100> or<00:01:50.280> Shawn<00:01:50.579> Michaels<00:01:50.909> speech<00:01:51.180> at<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
Medusa or Shawn Michaels speech at the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.030 
Medusa or Shawn Michaels speech at the
Hall<00:01:51.990> of<00:01:52.020> Fame<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.439> had<00:01:52.710> they<00:01:52.829> not<00:01:52.979> done

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
Hall of Fame because had they not done

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.219 
Hall of Fame because had they not done
what<00:01:53.430> they<00:01:53.549> did<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.479> Hall<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.869> Fame<00:01:54.990> probably

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
what they did but Hall of Fame probably

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.899 
what they did but Hall of Fame probably
would<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.380> been<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> lot<00:01:55.740> worse<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.700> your

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
would have been a lot worse so your

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.670
