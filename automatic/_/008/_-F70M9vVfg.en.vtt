what we have to do is a couple of things

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.670 
what we have to do is a couple of things
those<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.900> which<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.320> have<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.650> shoot<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.670> lamp

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
which will then do something really

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:46.789 
which will then do something really
clever

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.649 

this<00:01:47.799> might<00:01:48.070> work<00:01:48.250> is<00:01:48.460> around<00:01:48.729> so<00:01:49.420> there<00:01:49.570> we<00:01:49.630> go

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
this might work is around so there we go

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.620 
this might work is around so there we go
now<00:01:49.960> we<00:01:50.020> have<00:01:50.200> a<00:01:50.229> ramp<00:01:50.560> up<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:52.180> we<00:01:52.360> basically

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
now we have a ramp up so we basically

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.440 
now we have a ramp up so we basically
have<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.140> reach<00:01:53.350> that<00:01:53.530> top<00:01:53.890> thing<00:01:53.920> up<00:01:54.399> there

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
tomb shall I that was a waste of time a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.250 
tomb shall I that was a waste of time a
couple<00:02:30.160> of<00:02:30.280> seconds<00:02:30.610> there<00:02:30.730> so<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.810> what

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
couple of seconds there so this is what

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.680 
couple of seconds there so this is what
we<00:02:32.410> have<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.650> do<00:02:32.799> now<00:02:32.849> we<00:02:33.849> have<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.120> raise<00:02:34.390> this

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
we have to do now we have to raise this

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.490 
we have to do now we have to raise this
plane<00:02:35.019> up<00:02:35.410> to<00:02:36.280> there<00:02:36.519> so<00:02:36.880> there's<00:02:37.870> got<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.319> be<00:02:38.349> a

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
plane up to there so there's got to be a

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.069 
plane up to there so there's got to be a
way<00:02:38.560> to<00:02:38.739> raise<00:02:39.069> it<00:02:39.280> up<00:02:39.370> higher<00:02:39.640> there<00:02:40.269> is<00:02:40.540> Lara

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
way to raise it up higher there is Lara

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.920 
way to raise it up higher there is Lara
and<00:02:41.319> I'm<00:02:41.440> doing<00:02:41.590> it<00:02:41.799> let's<00:02:41.980> shot<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:43.720> we<00:02:43.810> do

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880 
that can be sure we can I just wasted a

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.410 
that can be sure we can I just wasted a
bunch<00:02:49.000> of<00:02:49.150> ammunition<00:02:49.540> doing<00:02:50.019> it<00:02:50.190> then<00:02:51.190> hey

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
bunch of ammunition doing it then hey

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.390 
bunch of ammunition doing it then hey
it's<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.540> game<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.109> let's<00:02:53.650> do<00:02:53.829> what<00:02:53.980> we<00:02:54.100> want<00:02:54.250> to

it's a game so let's do what we want to
I<00:02:54.600> will<00:02:55.600> let<00:02:55.840> that<00:02:55.870> swing<00:02:56.560> into<00:02:56.859> their<00:02:57.340> which

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
I will let that swing into their which

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.650 
I will let that swing into their which
will<00:02:58.239> then<00:02:58.420> burn<00:02:58.959> down<00:02:59.850> another<00:03:00.850> portion<00:03:01.209> of

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
will then burn down another portion of

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.699 
will then burn down another portion of
the<00:03:01.870> tree<00:03:02.260> which<00:03:02.590> will<00:03:03.519> then<00:03:03.639> in<00:03:03.910> turn<00:03:04.709> make

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
the tree which will then in turn make

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.000 
the tree which will then in turn make
the<00:03:06.010> plane<00:03:06.310> go<00:03:06.639> higher<00:03:07.420> you<00:03:07.959> ready

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010

the beginning and we'll go up on here

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:14.550 
the beginning and we'll go up on here
this<00:04:08.349> time<00:04:09.629> and<00:04:10.629> then<00:04:10.780> we<00:04:10.989> can<00:04:13.319> well<00:04:14.319> if<00:04:14.470> you

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
this time and then we can well if you

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.529 
this time and then we can well if you
have<00:04:14.709> flame<00:04:14.980> arrows<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:15.430> could<00:04:15.549> just<00:04:16.650> do<00:04:17.650> that

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
have flame arrows you could just do that

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.170 
have flame arrows you could just do that
something<00:04:19.539> stronger<00:04:19.930> oh<00:04:20.289> you<00:04:20.979> can't<00:04:21.250> bollocks

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
something stronger oh you can't bollocks

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.760 
something stronger oh you can't bollocks
I<00:04:22.360> thought<00:04:22.510> you<00:04:22.630> could<00:04:22.810> so<00:04:23.080> let's<00:04:23.440> just<00:04:23.620> use<00:04:23.740> a

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
I thought you could so let's just use a

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:26.370 
I thought you could so let's just use a
lamp<00:04:24.099> which<00:04:24.520> is<00:04:24.669> right<00:04:24.849> here<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.270> we'll<00:04:26.169> burn

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
lamp which is right here and we'll burn

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.339 
lamp which is right here and we'll burn
it<00:04:26.440> down<00:04:26.620> like<00:04:26.919> that<00:04:27.099> I<00:04:27.930> don't<00:04:28.930> know<00:04:29.020> how<00:04:29.169> it's

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
it down like that I don't know how it's

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:31.439 
it down like that I don't know how it's
only<00:04:29.590> stronger<00:04:29.860> flamers<00:04:30.820> flame<00:04:31.090> in<00:04:31.300> my

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
only stronger flamers flame in my

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:32.460 
only stronger flamers flame in my
opinion

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
opinion

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.690 
opinion
now<00:04:33.040> it's<00:04:33.670> going<00:04:33.880> to<00:04:34.000> separate<00:04:34.660> the<00:04:34.840> two<00:04:35.700> flip

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
now it's going to separate the two flip

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.790 
now it's going to separate the two flip
on<00:04:36.820> outside<00:04:37.240> and<00:04:37.600> always<00:04:38.110> scare<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.530> hell<00:04:38.680> out

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
on outside and always scare the hell out

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.820 
on outside and always scare the hell out
now<00:04:39.630> Lara<00:04:40.630> we<00:04:41.020> can<00:04:41.200> actually<00:04:41.350> have<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:41.680> look

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
now Lara we can actually have a look

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.130 
now Lara we can actually have a look
