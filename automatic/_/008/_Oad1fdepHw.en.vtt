00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 friends want comeback we are 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.500
 today in the third part of our series 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.760
 fit and healthy to say now and today 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.830
 Always go for the staple foods 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.599
 one we have in our fridge 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.700
 as we have for the last two 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.590
 he used recipes I hear 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.779
 maybe we have your health 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.850
 pizza made and the sweet potato 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.689
 spaghetti let's start with the tact 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.090
 pizza on 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.510
 Normally it is so pizza dough 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.119
 Wheat flour and what is far more moving than 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.489
 video shown of course this is now 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.630
 our personal experience team with 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.120
 made wide but our pizza exists 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.340
 mainly from Buchweitz from China 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.350
 and flea seed husks but why are 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.770
 these are the foods now 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.079
 told 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.030
 Let's catch the book more 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.140
 Buckwheat does not contain blood now 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.940
 not all of them for all 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.180
 interesting but for the avenue is already 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.300
 times particularly important because there is always 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.070
 more putin intolerant people and that 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.649
 does not mean that they suffer so little 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.940
 so if she tolerates me 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.890
 Buckwheat has nothing to do with wheat 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.229
 as you might guess by the name 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.700
 is a pseudo cereal buckwheat 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.979
 is characterized by the fact that all 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.720
 essential amino acids at what are 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.460
 essential amino acids essential 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.080
 amino acids are the same as amino acids 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.880
 body can not produce itself 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.430
 These amino acids are important for the 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.600
 Muscle development because without these amino acids 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.310
 The proteins can not work properly 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.150
 that's why it's important 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.049
 that you look over the food 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.810
 supplied 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.520
 furthermore buckwheat contains a great many 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.509
 fiber we take care that we 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 very much at our diet 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.100
 eat high fiber because 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.590
 Dietary fiber promotes digestion and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.420
 So help with weight loss as well 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.310
 See blood sugar play as well 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.340
 is buckwheat rice on zinc magnesium 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.450
 and iron and contains routine control 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.390
 like google 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.520
 Putin has an antioxidant effect 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.170
 the blood vessels and on the ladies and 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.920
 will feel positively 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.470
 disorder and high blood pressure from so much 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:03.000
 Buckwheat we come to the four 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:07.229
 Songs contain a lot of calcium copper 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.300
 magnesium potassium and so on and so on 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.580
 continued so very, very many trace elements 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.010
 In addition, they are very high in fiber 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.400
 and include a round amount 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.620
 Essential fed to pass 20 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.269
 percent of high quality protein 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.340
 but contain very little 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.350
 carbohydrates as well they have one 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.910
 very high proportion of omega 3 fatty acids 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.690
 which in turn has a positive effect on the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.700
 ability of the blood and in the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.260
 In turn, this causes the blood pressure 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.870
 is lowered and of course on the 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.850
 blood fat levels down 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.010
 dead flea seed husks come from the 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.230
 flea seed that his herbaceous plant 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.390
 the flea seed husks comply with slime 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.130
 binding fiber when added 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.660
 from liquid to swelling 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.340
 the digestion will support it too 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.500
 used in medicine so in intestine 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.989
 problems and constipation and the and 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.910
 that other hurt with that 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.160
 be the circle or prescribed with 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.390
 use as part of a diet are 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.370
 Again and again as adhesives 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.200
 who is if you are something 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.510
 This is also the case with water 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.890
 Once upon a time, I 'm so cramped 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.260
 Although no substitutes for substances 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.760
 high-fiber diet but help 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.680
 maybe narrow it the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.760
 to tie hunger feeling important fact on 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:22.079
 end is perhaps the 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:24.269
 flea seed husks no calories and last 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:26.459
 but not least the sweet potato we do 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.040
 used for our sweet potato 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.959
 and like buckwheat, what can 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.780
 Wheat is the sweet potato is not 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.400
 Potatoes only what they have in common 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.359
 with the dice is that they are in the ground 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.850
 grows as before , that 's the mole 

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.700
 actually open 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:46.319
 in any case it grows 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.700
 sweet potato in the earth as well as 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.049
 the potato but that's it too 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.420
 actually everything he does with the 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.430
 Hood has the sweet in common 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.069
 but one of the most nutritious 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.170
 enough this gives that is total 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.040
 fascinating now even more nutrients 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:06.780
 in the sweet potato are carotenoids and 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.780
 antioxidants and both substances 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:24.729
 Both substances are anti-inflammatory and 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:26.020
 he act as antioxidants live the 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.729
 fuels you also have quite a lot of 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.830
 minerals and vitamins of 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:34.630
 sweet potato eg vitamin c vitamin b6 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.430
 For example, biotin biotin can be used 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:48.130
 Supplement yours if you want that 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:49.479
 you thicker hair get so that meant 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.750
 Of course, that potato too 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:54.460
 therefore with all the minerals 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.130
 vitamins and all create these 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.620
 contains a very very very very 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.789
 good food is this cemetery 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.500
 is also a good source for 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.039
 carbs and offered the 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.000
 insulin resistance before and divx as well 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:11.680
 all foods of research 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.950
 digestive we are here in 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.140
 europe daumens promote at the start 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:21.370
 that's important, too, and maybe he does 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:23.169
 a very useful guy and maybe 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.210
 a very useful and important fact 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.500
 for either pregnant woman or 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.910
 girlfriend want to get pregnant 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:33.039
 it remembers the sweet potatoes sweet potato 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:35.800
 contain a lot of natural vollath 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.960
 So natural folic acid and how 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.419
 Most people know that would be totally cool 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.720
 very important for the embryo camping 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:49.560
 education is important for pregnant women 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:52.990
 women and so it was happy for today 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:54.810
 our video yesterday was on wednesday 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.320
 has a lot of controversy 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:06:00.090
 There came at once comments from 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.740
 charlatans blablabla here david what 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.450
 you work for the water yourself 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.010
 industry below are these techniques who 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.840
 This theory can be yours on friends 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.370
 how we tick we even got ourselves 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.630
 insulted in the comments 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:10.950
 that's why the devices have been disabled 

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.510
 because we let it insult on ours 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:14.250
 Stern is still our animal lover 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:15.600

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.450
 factual level

 We exchange ourselves from Italy 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.020
 have your own opinion exactly as it should 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.830
