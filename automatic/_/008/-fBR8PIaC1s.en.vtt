I'm not really too concerned about the
Rotom<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.519> at<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.760> same<00:02:35.970> time<00:02:36.150> Conqueror<00:02:36.660> was

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
Rotom but at the same time Conqueror was

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.390

worried about this point so now he's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.229 
worried about this point so now he's
gonna<00:02:40.350> actually<00:02:40.680> switch<00:02:41.640> while<00:02:42.120> I'm

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
gonna actually switch while I'm
