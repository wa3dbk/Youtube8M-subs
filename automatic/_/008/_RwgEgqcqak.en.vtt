one<00:02:19.900> thing<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.290> like<00:02:20.560> about<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:21.190> 2014<00:02:22.060> Mustang

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
one thing I like about the 2014 Mustang

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.670 
one thing I like about the 2014 Mustang
is<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.720> Mikey<00:02:23.170> setting<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:24.730> can<00:02:25.020> set<00:02:26.020> one<00:02:26.530> of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
is the Mikey setting you can set one of

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.060 
is the Mikey setting you can set one of
the<00:02:26.770> keys<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.010> be<00:02:27.400> restricted<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.120> only<00:02:29.070> 80

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
the keys to be restricted to only 80

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.730 
the keys to be restricted to only 80
miles<00:02:30.400> per<00:02:30.550> hour<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.420> radio<00:02:31.780> only<00:02:32.020> goes<00:02:32.200> 45
