00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.600 
thick as is and I'll show you as you can
see<00:04:07.240> in<00:04:07.330> the<00:04:07.390> bowl<00:04:07.540> there<00:04:07.720> so<00:04:08.620> we're<00:04:09.430> going<00:04:09.520> to

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.610 
see in the bowl there so we're going to

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.340 
see in the bowl there so we're going to
fold<00:04:09.820> in<00:04:10.000> the<00:04:10.030> egg<00:04:10.240> white<00:04:10.510> like<00:04:10.780> you<00:04:10.930> have<00:04:11.080> seen

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
fold in the egg white like you have seen

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.730 
fold in the egg white like you have seen
so<00:04:12.070> we<00:04:12.220> simply<00:04:12.640> just<00:04:12.850> take<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.270> egg<00:04:13.450> way<00:04:13.740> that

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
so we simply just take the egg way that

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.280 
so we simply just take the egg way that
is<00:04:14.920> sipping<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.400> a<00:04:15.430> firm<00:04:15.730> peak<00:04:16.050> place<00:04:17.050> it<00:04:17.230> in

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
is sipping to a firm peak place it in

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.940 
is sipping to a firm peak place it in
the<00:04:17.350> bowl<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:18.580> so

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.450 

then<00:04:22.880> all<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.180> do<00:04:23.530> you<00:04:24.530> go<00:04:24.710> from<00:04:24.830> the<00:04:24.980> outside

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
then all you do you go from the outside

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.040 
then all you do you go from the outside
in<00:04:25.760> fold<00:04:26.720> it<00:04:26.930> fold<00:04:27.680> it<00:04:27.920> in<00:04:28.070> I<00:04:28.840> don't<00:04:29.840> know<00:04:29.900> how

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
in fold it fold it in I don't know how

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.350 
in fold it fold it in I don't know how
well<00:04:30.260> you<00:04:30.410> can<00:04:30.530> see<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.950> but<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.880> simply<00:04:32.060> go

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
well you can see that but you simply go

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.140 
well you can see that but you simply go
along<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.720> outside<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.380> just<00:04:33.500> hold<00:04:33.800> it<00:04:33.950> in

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
along the outside and just hold it in

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.550 
along the outside and just hold it in
okay<00:04:35.150> I<00:04:35.180> know<00:04:35.360> it's<00:04:35.630> a<00:04:35.690> little<00:04:35.810> bit<00:04:36.050> higher<00:04:36.290> up

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
okay I know it's a little bit higher up

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.960 
okay I know it's a little bit higher up
but<00:04:36.770> I<00:04:36.860> want<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.280> be<00:04:37.340> able<00:04:37.460> to<00:04:37.700> see<00:04:37.820> the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
cooking in the process so after folding

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.490 
cooking in the process so after folding
in<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.670> egg<00:04:40.850> white<00:04:41.120> what<00:04:41.960> we're<00:04:42.050> going<00:04:42.230> to<00:04:42.320> do

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
in the egg white what we're going to do

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.740 
in the egg white what we're going to do
is<00:04:42.770> some<00:04:43.490> people<00:04:43.790> cooking<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.210> skillet<00:04:44.540> and

I'm going to cook one on each so that

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.180 
I'm going to cook one on each so that
way<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:50.030> can<00:04:50.390> see<00:04:50.690> what<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:51.560> final<00:04:51.740> product

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
way you can see what the final product

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.950 
way you can see what the final product
doesn't<00:04:52.550> look<00:04:52.760> like<00:04:53.000> so<00:04:53.600> we're<00:04:53.750> going<00:04:53.870> to

doesn't look like so we're going to
cooking<00:04:54.320> spray<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.830> down<00:04:55.130> and<00:04:56.060> we're<00:04:56.330> going

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.440 
to take the very thick batter as you can
see<00:04:58.580> and<00:04:58.930> slowly<00:04:59.930> just<00:05:00.560> drop<00:05:00.950> it<00:05:01.160> in<00:05:01.340> here<00:05:01.670> all

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
right when we cook our pancakes what are

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.300 
right when we cook our pancakes what are
we<00:05:05.360> going<00:05:05.510> to<00:05:05.600> look<00:05:05.780> for<00:05:06.050> we're<00:05:06.860> going<00:05:07.040> to<00:05:07.100> look

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
for a little bit of bubbling on the top

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.800 
for a little bit of bubbling on the top
all<00:05:09.980> right<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:11.120> we're<00:05:11.270> just<00:05:11.360> going<00:05:11.570> to<00:05:11.630> let

you'll be able to see actual little

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.640 
you'll be able to see actual little
bubbles<00:05:16.790> popping<00:05:17.120> up<00:05:17.420> on<00:05:17.570> the<00:05:17.600> top<00:05:17.900> that's

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
bubbles popping up on the top that's

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.260 
bubbles popping up on the top that's
when<00:05:18.890> you<00:05:18.980> know<00:05:19.130> it's<00:05:19.370> just<00:05:19.670> about<00:05:19.880> ready<00:05:20.120> to

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
when you know it's just about ready to

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.710 
when you know it's just about ready to
flip<00:05:20.660> so<00:05:21.380> we<00:05:21.620> have<00:05:21.770> our<00:05:21.800> spatula<00:05:22.280> here<00:05:22.790> and<00:05:23.000> I

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
flip so we have our spatula here and I

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.330 
flip so we have our spatula here and I
have<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:24.020> camera<00:05:24.410> up<00:05:24.440> high<00:05:24.650> enough<00:05:24.830> and<00:05:25.190> i'll

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
have the camera up high enough and i'll

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.910 
have the camera up high enough and i'll
be<00:05:25.490> able<00:05:25.580> to<00:05:25.760> pop<00:05:25.970> this<00:05:26.180> over<00:05:26.510> for<00:05:26.750> you<00:05:26.920> these

be able to pop this over for you these
should<00:05:28.100> always<00:05:28.460> be<00:05:28.610> cooked<00:05:28.910> on<00:05:29.060> a<00:05:29.150> medium

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
should always be cooked on a medium

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.660 
should always be cooked on a medium
power<00:05:29.780> don't<00:05:30.590> go<00:05:30.740> too<00:05:30.800> high<00:05:31.040> don't<00:05:31.430> go<00:05:31.610> to

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:31.670 
power don't go too high don't go to

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.150 
power don't go too high don't go to
medium<00:05:32.060> i<00:05:32.210> always<00:05:33.110> go<00:05:33.260> to<00:05:33.320> medium<00:05:33.740> because

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
medium i always go to medium because

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.580 
medium i always go to medium because
slower<00:05:34.610> is<00:05:34.910> better<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:36.020> same<00:05:36.260> can<00:05:36.440> be<00:05:36.470> said

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
slower is better the same can be said

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.380 
slower is better the same can be said
with<00:05:36.890> a<00:05:36.980> lot<00:05:37.130> of<00:05:37.280> other<00:05:37.430> cooking<00:05:37.730> principles

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
with a lot of other cooking principles

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.590 
with a lot of other cooking principles
that<00:05:38.900> you<00:05:39.080> will<00:05:39.260> pick<00:05:39.470> up<00:05:39.620> over<00:05:39.860> time<00:05:40.070> so<00:05:40.910> while

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 
that you will pick up over time so while

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.960 
that you will pick up over time so while
i<00:05:41.630> sit<00:05:41.960> here<00:05:42.170> and<00:05:42.290> keep<00:05:42.470> talking<00:05:42.980> you<00:05:43.760> can

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
i sit here and keep talking you can

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.170 
i sit here and keep talking you can
start<00:05:44.210> to<00:05:44.270> see<00:05:44.390> here<00:05:44.930> in<00:05:45.590> our<00:05:45.740> camera<00:05:46.180> they're

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
start to see here in our camera they're

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.370 
start to see here in our camera they're
starting<00:05:47.510> to<00:05:47.540> be<00:05:47.660> a<00:05:47.690> little<00:05:47.750> bit<00:05:47.960> of<00:05:48.110> bubbling

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:48.380 
starting to be a little bit of bubbling

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.350 
starting to be a little bit of bubbling
