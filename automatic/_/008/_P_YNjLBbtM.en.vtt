what<00:01:03.660> does<00:01:03.870> make<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.530> does<00:01:04.680> make<00:01:04.860> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
what does make it what does make a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.120 
what does make it what does make a
little<00:01:05.100> tougher<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.299> blade<00:01:06.659> smash<00:01:07.130> where

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
little tougher is the blade smash where

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.820 
little tougher is the blade smash where
you<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.990> let<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> counter<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
you have to let go of the counter and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.179 
you have to let go of the counter and
then<00:01:11.070> press<00:01:11.310> on<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.880> just<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> right<00:01:12.689> time

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
then press on it just at the right time

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.940 
then press on it just at the right time
that<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.490> timing<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.119> believe<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:16.140> like<00:01:16.710> it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that the timing I believe is like it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.080 
that the timing I believe is like it
when<00:01:17.070> there<00:01:17.220> I'm<00:01:17.310> like<00:01:17.549> either<00:01:17.670> one<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:17.939> their

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
when there I'm like either one of their

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.990 
when there I'm like either one of their
mid<00:01:18.299> swings<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.350> basically<00:01:19.590> got<00:01:20.000> two

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
mid swings so you basically got two

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.999 
mid swings so you basically got two
chances<00:01:21.420> two<00:01:21.689> or<00:01:21.780> three<00:01:21.869> chances<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.290> to

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
chances two or three chances to to

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.600 
chances two or three chances to to
counter<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.400> oh<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:24.150> did<00:01:24.509> Oh<00:01:25.009> what<00:01:26.009> follows<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
counter it oh I did Oh what follows the

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.240 
counter it oh I did Oh what follows the
rest<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.880> this<00:01:26.970> video<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.049> me<00:01:28.890> doing<00:01:29.189> the

trying<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.560> timing<00:01:37.799> right<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.570> hope

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
trying to get the timing right I hope

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.380 
trying to get the timing right I hope
this<00:01:39.840> helps<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.259> little<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.590> its<00:01:41.159> I'm<00:01:41.790> glad<00:01:42.210> to

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
see this not as difficult as I thought

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.700 
see this not as difficult as I thought
it<00:01:44.159> was<00:01:44.310> where<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:45.420> remember<00:01:45.780> all<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.619> do

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
it was where just remember all you do

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.740 
it was where just remember all you do
not<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.920> do<00:01:47.009> is<00:01:47.159> blade<00:01:47.610> dodge<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.509> don't<00:01:48.659> have

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
not to do is blade dodge you don't have

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.240 
not to do is blade dodge you don't have
to<00:01:48.869> smash<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.259> you<00:01:49.500> just<00:01:49.680> have<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to smash it you just have to get out of

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.200 
to smash it you just have to get out of
the<00:01:50.310> way<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.700> then<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.820> can

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
the way and then you can

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.700 
the way and then you can
you<00:01:51.630> know<00:01:51.690> punch<00:01:51.900> me<00:01:51.990> in<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.080> face<00:01:52.260> it<00:01:52.500> does

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you know punch me in the face it does

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.850 
you know punch me in the face it does
not<00:01:52.890> break<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.250> counter<00:01:53.549> your<00:01:54.090> combo<00:01:54.510> meter

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
not break the counter your combo meter

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.780

personally<00:01:55.860> though<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.010> find<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.549> much<00:01:56.729> easier

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
personally though I find it much easier

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.109 
personally though I find it much easier

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
just to jump over them but I felt that

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.800 
just to jump over them but I felt that
