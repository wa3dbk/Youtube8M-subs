00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 good morning and welcome as usual on libertarians. 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.780
 the news today and many center that I read ovi store 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.309
 analyzed and that concerning alitalia 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.150
 because with once we made ourselves face to face with the nth 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:19.909
 cap of this type 

00:00:19.909 --> 00:00:22.579
 Alitalia has decided to go on strike 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.759
 it will be very difficult to fly because half of the flights will be 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.810
 first with the earth 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.760
 and this for the simple fact that there are 356 cancellations 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.710
 the reason for this quotation is the usual assistants who sleep otherwise 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.690
 let's say 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.680
 the rent of the cisl to lawyer the various unions 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.420
 here again we do not find ourselves in front of you in the Alitalia case 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.820
 Italy is that 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.820
 10 years has now become 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.240
 tonight and his own pump of public money 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.940
 in the last ten years from worth remembering for example in this case not 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.130
 the center-left government was the center-right government 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.940
 I said worth mentioning that for 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.290
 avoid the fact that it arrives on bankruptcy 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.229
 I'm not interested in being a company for the flag airline 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.510
 aerial flag 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.760
 who has many of us text the flag company 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.650
 incredible loans were made 400 million euros in the 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.590
 2004 much more money previously 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.370
 eh in the last 10 years a continuous jet speaks italy cpi 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.870
 a long time someone 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.980
 I had declared that now I earn on the market its right to 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.440
 exist or it is better to sell 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.370
 since it would be the case with other companies to do with me 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.830
 and instead things are not so because between 1999 2005 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.500
 not just this one 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.450
 loafer companies 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.920
 the parasites 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.469
 shared losses of two, 6 billion euros 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:13.279
 but the government has paid two, 8 into the bankruptcy coffers of this company 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:14.849
 billion euros 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.850
 since 2002 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.850
 to date, that is to say climber 4 and a half years 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.659
 and in 2006 ce 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.289
 Once again 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.920
 despite the debt was 972 million euros 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.220
 we continued to think about financing alitalia 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.329
 all this happens 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:37.729
 code 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.609
 in the normality of things because all companies have problems 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.519
 because there is a crisis, people do not fly, they do not travel exactly the opposite agent 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:47.610
 flies much more 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.720
 travels a lot more and now all other airlines ask themselves 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.690
 basket that private among other things then 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.640
 italy in the public case is a case in itself a case of 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:02.059
 Effective sunbeds and inefficiency efficiency 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.669
 beyond the Nordic norm, intelligence beyond the norm 

00:03:05.669 --> 00:03:07.730
 we are all other airlines and you 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.540
 mar have churned out utility frantic pace 

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:16.079
 Yesterday's examples have discovered 116 million in profits 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:23.300
 rayaner 329 million useful greenhouse am a man the one you invented of 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.340
 low cost flights that allow us to travel at very low prices 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.640
 british airways and 556 million euros 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:33.769
 profits 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:34.689
 instead no 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:37.189
 alitalia continues to be 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.339
 the usual company 

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:45.159
 full of debts Roman loafers centric state unlikely 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.509
 what needs to be done 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:51.889
 it is a real case from manual with alitalia a case in which once for 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:56.670
 all it must be said that it would be good and put xp ne to waste 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.840
 by chance alitalia zinc speaking of a quantity mirrors 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.199
 d employees 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.769
 for please mobile operators and ice cream soiled that impressive respect 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:08.529
 to others then 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:12.549
 the real example is a state sideshow 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.930
 sincerely 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.769
 we have no other solution that lives privatized is damned company 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.139
 we have no other solution than to say 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.080
 just stop stealing our money to keep us alive 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.020
 unda real 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.110
 company farlocco 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.400
 alitalia cannot continue like this 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.380
 It is useful to privatize it
