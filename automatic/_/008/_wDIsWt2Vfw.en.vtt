00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.540
 only everyone pieter hour or in other words come on a cargo bike with none of days 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.199
 normal commentary today is 23 of my august marathon and today 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.759
 I have a fly video for you the rest of you see my dad sitting in it 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:14.509
 the middle 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.760
 Who the back of me I will try to explain this video 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.150
 about the things that animal is going to sing about how they join a plane 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.710
 And mainly about a little bit about the cities that you can see what you like 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.439
 can 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.970
 You can see it right away I can see Amsterdam I can see you too but that would be it 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:33.120
 not sure you could Amsterdam 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.590
 at least see it with the naked eye 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.040
 now we wait a while until a plane came by that was here and there 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.690
 there after plane 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.340
 we could take off the runway is the lynx of us and so we go too 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.670
 but in the same direction goal we start 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.970
 if that we saw that other plane and and land 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.820
 it is a lawn that I know is something that will surprise many people 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.430
 Because a lot of people think we all want the plane to be very expensive 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:59.280
 asphalt 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.260
 no i just a sport plane the thing that you can actually do with it 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.850
 lifting two so light that he weighs after one 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.190
 yes, it also does not need asphalt to land on it, you can also 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.680
 doing great with grass 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.650
 and I give it full gas 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.680
 I believe this plane is going to fly at and to 60 or 70 per hour 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.740
 bears 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.270
 that have been achieved here for those who have never flown it is 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.600
 really an on 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.750
 and very fat 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.500
 it is bouncing and bouncing a bit until you go fast enough 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.810
 and then it's suddenly 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.230
 very quiet flying and name 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.740
 That's actually because extremely quiet flies because he is flat at that time 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.240
 is above the ground 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.170
 which means that there is nig wind when you compare it to taking it up there and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.329
 that the that ensures that year too 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.840
 bump into a hole and that you can actually fly away in a very quiet window 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.050
 in a moment if there is a turn to the right for those who don't know 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.100
 what a while in goal is that we did this video but 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.430
 a to and thaksin is actually what is a bit of a lesson for me 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.470
 nowadays 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.170
 This article is namely going to land better and as soon as you land on request 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.900
 Available from the director as we were 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.479
 to go with the goats 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.729
 at least we had it my father and I this video and about seven 8 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.409
 done once and 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.559
 then we would have taken an hour and a half a bit too long for all of that 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.539
 while klÃ¶den and also on 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.929
 also a bit of a shame for the club and without walking and the time and 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:21.799
 trouble 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.919
 an hour and a half flight there is not really a pole to look at 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.529
 I am going to show you a round effect and we will go straight away 

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:29.499
 the name 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:33.629
 make a turn to the right then you can see lie in utrecht and here to the left of it 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.149
 our is a little castle drakenstein 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:40.439
 that is where space where prince friso is buried for those who sit there 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.169
 wondered where he was 

00:02:42.169 --> 00:02:46.569
 not exactly because the castle was buried but something on daddy walking distance 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.199
 ladies maybe and the kind of 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.189
 maybe years in the garden or so I don't know they always have those crazy people 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.240
 castles are all they have of those beautiful gardens just like that 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.170
 in any case you see left in picture utrecht sees the new helmet in it 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.709
 corner and that is it 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.799
 that is actually the only thing you can see during 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:07.099
 Queensday warm water an eco but also with this plane and there were 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.229
 was flying above it and then it was just a crazy orange gang 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:15.749
 unbelievable where really not normally many orange flags that saw there 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:17.199
 trainer looked on too 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:19.239
 popping of the customers themselves really 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.930
 after you saw people you really saw them all trained together and then 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.589
 You also saw some streets where it was hardly anyone 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:29.179
 and then you saw squares in real life and extremely busy with counting 

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:33.239
 orange flags and all there well what crazy TV screens like back 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.999
 view everything on genes 

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.400
 now that we are really in front of us, I already believe I am not sure how that class is 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:43.779
 but people coming from this neighborhood did this is more of it 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:47.869
 hilversum airport they are sozawe or they approach in the neighborhood of course 

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:51.949
 is it true that a logical pilot is the right-hand puddle? 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.679
 for those who live in the area the promotion which place it is because I have 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:56.379
 a 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.129
 I honestly have no idea how that works 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:00.919
 before there is water but yes 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.039
 we will have to wait to find commons and look at a few people 

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:08.389
 I have acknowledged it and so I call on people because of the 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.369
 to post that in a comment 

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:13.949
 we are going to make the right turn because we are now flying downwind 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.039
 actually means that we have with the link in the back 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.430
 and that means that agricultural policy is on our right and that we therefore have one 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.460
 turn to the right 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.310
 we want to hang on and want to make the landing with enthusiasts actually 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.659
 way of speaking along to more on 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:31.870
 complete within the circle 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.270
 Just as from the right turn then your hands may be able to heal 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.840
 maybe you can see london it is 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.530
 it has certainly not been a clear day today it is not very bad 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.800
 clear if you can do it as your body 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.120
 but for those who might be better but it should be because of the estimate 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.010
 they might see a little tower, at least I hope you 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.520
 see him and then after a while I also hope that you will also do that in a small bowl 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.770
 can leave 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.199
 in front of us I believe quite collect or it is loosdrecht that is nowadays 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.940
 all playing against each other has grown that is not very bad at all 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.229
 clear and 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:04.889
 make a difference 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:05.760
 and I hope 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.199
 can already see the runway with you 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.199
 left of my head now a little wasp about the 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:15.669
 above the heath above all panels is now the runway 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.699
 it's a little bit that flows daily from the trees that cross ours 

00:05:19.699 --> 00:05:21.499
 to indicate that that group 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:25.099
 the runway is an extension of where we now fly and I hope so 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:29.969
 You can also see that my hand is responding now so you can't be cynical now 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:30.939
 but my hand 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.960
 who sits is on the way to the nets and button brake lever it is actually it is 

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:35.900
 anp 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.370
 it's kind of a lever because of course you have no and dance drum brakes 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:43.999
 the way you always leave the car at f or maybe even a bicycle 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:47.219
 you just have speech breaks and those things are actually normal 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:50.400
 valves that go up and then you brake them 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.949
 here is the runway and the last part is always the most ricky 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:55.490
 what you always need him 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.419
 exactly under the growing vacancy rate and with it the get but this was an on 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.289
 a very nice landing I hope you enjoyed this video as the 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.469
 two ships please give a thumbs up and also give me the 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:07.180
 name 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.090
 and after a comment if you liked and after you see this more often because I am there 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.199
 I'm still curious about and after a year 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:17.379
 this was the german in deauville kite now off to get it another piece or 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.539
 seven behind and I hope you don't mind 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:25.740
 that I already have the other 7 11 6 not just fucking capture that a bit 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.430
 and i would say 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:31.729
 see you tomorrow at the next episode of my aforementioned marathon 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:32.520
 laughs the guests
