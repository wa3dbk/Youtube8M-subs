 phelps be very careful with toys that are for example made of wood 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.770
 normally they have varnished with a paint then this can become 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.830
 toxic for your baby they better not have this type of toys clean 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.620
 nz 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.140
 another important 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.010
 they are like this ball that are like rubber that is falling apart 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.450
 they can swallow and they are toxic 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.440
 4 another toy that you also have to be very careful is those that have 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.800
 paints 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.280
 toxic or maybe you do not know the presidency of toys like this one in 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.780
 this case that you can buy in places that do not have the mark oquendo well 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.450
 sealed and closed 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.549
 another thing that I recommend you that is 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.229
 that checks that the toys did not have cracks or are broken because I had to 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.820
 can be cut can hurt 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.100
 Beware of objects like these 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.399
 Yes, still 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.750
 everything was not in this stage to use them better to eliminate them is the best 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.990
 about stuffed animals 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.159
 like this liquefied this gesta here has some small balls of my the 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.750
 that can be toxic you can swallow them or they can breathe them and 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.280
 then the stuffed animals have a filling that is made of these is that better 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.029
 avoid them 

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:18.119
 another of the important things of what is 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.709
 read always you have left material are made 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.519
 toys 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.410
 this will give you an idea like this is a reliable gunino toy 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.739
 from her 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.600
 from the first day that painting and khedira 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.979
 non-toxic that is very important 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.159
 another thing 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.640
 check every three children two months the toys 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.970
 because they have k have an expiration time because by use then 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.709
 It may be that some toys are already mistreated or broken and to avoid 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.529
 Accidents is better 

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:51.710
 what do you take out 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.220
 on the other hand from the feet to the trash because in two or three years not even 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.479
 it's a secret that they can be dangerous 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:03:02.719

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:06.089
 good wrappers boxes

 and the cordobesistas these where they should talk to the many toys 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.069
 for example, like dolls 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.100
 throw them away because they also 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.910
 you can hurt yourself with these these objects that are 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.829
 the wrappings of the toys so it is that the fruit of the fire 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.980
 share with them freely and above all 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.599

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.219
