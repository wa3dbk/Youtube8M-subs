00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.470
 for weapons talks 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.420
 all these costs three of the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.990
 excellent bands none when buying me 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.040
 I have everything 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:33.359
 so there's no need to buy anything 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.769
 dragon's breath launch rockets 302 331 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.299
 and we see the cadence the radius of the 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.709
 speed of this ability to load 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.000

 pitcher power thrill three 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.799
 projectiles the ammunition fired by 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.879
 this weapon produces a solar flare at 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:49.470
 detonate cost of seven strange coins 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:51.870
 it's not for my taste is not one of the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.030
 best game missile stand for 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.459
 be exotic because I still prefer the 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.810
 gallon so I'm not going to buy it though 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.950
 I already have it and in fact I had sold it 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:04.390
 then we have gauntlet engrams 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.200
 As you can see, the light bikes do not reach me 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.150
 I spent a lot last week and nothing else 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.720
 they left me I think I sat down without being 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.700
 moon then a week take out like 20 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.890
 but well no, I'm not going to use them 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.890
 although I have it because I have a mount 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.140
 letes we have the exceptional fragment 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.420
 of improvements our the mask's 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.450
 third man hama's spine 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.380
 karam the helmet of the most intimate light the 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:35.799
 blazon of the phallus and the skull of the dismal 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.900
 karam breaks them soles the excellent 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.090
 advice the icebreaker band if you have not 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.310
 improved and has an icebreaker with damage 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.640
 300 better the great thing that the 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.000
 difference that small increase of 331 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.680
 then they do not have global improvement 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.600
 portable infinity a universal command 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.700
 hawthorn and south or if the same as him 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:00.360
 than the icebreaker where they do have their 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.150
 euros better in the in that small increase 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.340
 it's quite significant so no 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.750
 they have band people finally to télam 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.760
 between trucks calling rangefinder 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.340
 Melting telemetry functions launched 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.530
 rockets two improvements for hummingbirds 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.530
 heavy weapons charges 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.359
 is in inches remember heavy weapons 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.570
 because for the root they are super useful 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.610
 but bonus our band day there what 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.590
 they have is what brought us 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.139
 you can see that it is the 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.310
 same that I bring with the 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.430
 difference that also has more 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.289
 intellect and also you buy it south 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.689
 but well nothing new really we 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.370
 brought by the repeated things south nothing 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:42.400
 worth it so my 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.710
 recommendation if they do not have any of 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.650
 these items you can buy it but if 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.629
 and it really does not forget 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.879
 they are going to give it again it did not bring anything that 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:54.260
 worthwhile so we have to wait 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:57.740
 a week to know that our band 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.690
 so the fact that they fix is ​​strange 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.880
 how fast and this done without people 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.550
 new problems this realizes just the 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.440
 video and as is custom band by 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.940

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.880
 what they bought him if they bought in 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.380
 grammars they gave me and then nothing 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.730
 bands by month of August the video if it is 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.440
