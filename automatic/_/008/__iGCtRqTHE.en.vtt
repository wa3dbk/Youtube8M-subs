to be able to read clearly and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.550 
to be able to read clearly and
perceptively<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:16.840> they're<00:02:17.140> writing<00:02:17.290> longer

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
perceptively so they're writing longer

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.470

the complexities and that's because
