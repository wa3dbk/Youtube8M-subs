joints<00:02:33.400> this<00:02:34.400> figure<00:02:34.970> along<00:02:35.810> with<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:36.260> other

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
joints this figure along with the other

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.099 
joints this figure along with the other
figures<00:02:36.829> i<00:02:37.010> have<00:02:37.220> from<00:02:37.430> elite<00:02:37.730> series<00:02:38.000> 8<00:02:38.299> the

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
figures i have from elite series 8 the

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.979 
figures i have from elite series 8 the
elite<00:02:39.500> or<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:40.069> hip<00:02:40.310> joints<00:02:40.760> are<00:02:40.970> really<00:02:41.720> great

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
elite or the hip joints are really great

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.500 
elite or the hip joints are really great
on<00:02:42.200> it<00:02:42.380> they<00:02:43.190> move<00:02:43.400> in<00:02:43.519> all<00:02:43.640> directions<00:02:43.670> or<00:02:44.360> not

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
on it they move in all directions or not

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.120 
on it they move in all directions or not
stopped<00:02:44.930> up<00:02:45.200> or<00:02:45.440> glued<00:02:45.680> or<00:02:45.860> any

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
stopped up or glued or any

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.000 
stopped up or glued or any
thing<00:02:46.310> like<00:02:46.580> a<00:02:47.030> lot<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.450> Lee<00:02:47.600> figures<00:02:48.020> are<00:02:48.260> so<00:02:48.980> I

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
thing like a lot of Lee figures are so I

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.770 
thing like a lot of Lee figures are so I
think<00:02:49.130> mattel's<00:02:49.580> starting<00:02:50.090> to<00:02:50.240> improve<00:02:50.390> on

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
think mattel's starting to improve on

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
think mattel's starting to improve on
those<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.700> problem<00:02:53.150> with<00:02:53.360> all<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.500> all<00:02:54.770> the

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
those the problem with all the all the

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.190 
those the problem with all the all the
figures<00:02:55.070> that<00:02:55.400> are<00:02:55.430> gone<00:02:55.700> from<00:02:55.940> Lee<00:02:56.180> date<00:02:56.390> the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
figures that are gone from Lee date the

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.230 
figures that are gone from Lee date the
same<00:02:57.380> problem<00:02:57.890> this<00:02:58.070> time<00:02:58.130> seems<00:02:58.730> to<00:02:58.850> be<00:02:59.060> the

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
same problem this time seems to be the

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.350 
same problem this time seems to be the
ankles<00:02:59.660> are<00:03:00.370> really<00:03:01.370> loose<00:03:01.640> and<00:03:02.030> it<00:03:02.150> falls

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
ankles are really loose and it falls

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.680 
ankles are really loose and it falls
forward<00:03:02.750> or<00:03:03.050> falls<00:03:03.230> backward<00:03:03.830> really<00:03:04.190> easily

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
forward or falls backward really easily

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.650 
forward or falls backward really easily
um<00:03:05.690> that<00:03:06.110> was<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.320> I<00:03:06.790> was<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.880> bit<00:03:08.000> of<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.180> problem<00:03:08.210> I

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
um that was a I was a bit of a problem I

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.640 
um that was a I was a bit of a problem I
had<00:03:08.870> one<00:03:09.080> reviewing<00:03:09.590> elite<00:03:09.890> series<00:03:10.190> 8<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.900> it

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
had one reviewing elite series 8 that it

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.740 
had one reviewing elite series 8 that it
was<00:03:12.800> hard<00:03:13.040> especially<00:03:13.610> without<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.390> display

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
was hard especially without the display

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.900 
was hard especially without the display
stands<00:03:15.110> it<00:03:15.470> was<00:03:15.560> hard<00:03:15.830> to<00:03:15.920> turn<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.580> figures

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
stands it was hard to turn the figures

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.080 
stands it was hard to turn the figures
around<00:03:17.090> to<00:03:17.420> show<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.780> details<00:03:18.340> when<00:03:19.340> they

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
around to show the details when they

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.290 
around to show the details when they
kept<00:03:20.330> falling<00:03:20.690> forward<00:03:20.960> or<00:03:21.170> falling<00:03:21.440> backward

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
kept falling forward or falling backward

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.360 
kept falling forward or falling backward
but<00:03:23.320> if<00:03:24.320> you're<00:03:24.530> not<00:03:24.680> going<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:24.920> be<00:03:25.040> moving

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
but if you're not going to be moving

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.040 
but if you're not going to be moving
them<00:03:25.490> around<00:03:25.550> if<00:03:26.000> you're<00:03:26.150> just<00:03:26.360> standing<00:03:26.720> them

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
them around if you're just standing them

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.610 
them around if you're just standing them
if<00:03:28.040> you<00:03:28.190> can<00:03:28.340> actually<00:03:28.550> get<00:03:28.940> them<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.360> pose

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
if you can actually get them to pose

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.200 
if you can actually get them to pose
they<00:03:30.620> stay<00:03:31.010> where<00:03:31.220> they<00:03:31.370> are<00:03:31.400> but<00:03:31.850> if<00:03:32.000> you're

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
they stay where they are but if you're

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.060 
they stay where they are but if you're
trying<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.570> move<00:03:32.780> them<00:03:32.930> around<00:03:33.050> like<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.650> am<00:03:33.800> for

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
trying to move them around like I am for

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.650 
trying to move them around like I am for
a<00:03:34.130> review<00:03:35.290> then<00:03:36.880> you<00:03:37.880> have<00:03:38.030> problems<00:03:38.540> they

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
a review then you have problems they

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.100 
a review then you have problems they
start<00:03:38.930> falling<00:03:39.350> forward<00:03:40.330> and<00:03:41.330> another

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
start falling forward and another

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.680 
start falling forward and another
problem<00:03:42.560> that<00:03:42.590> seemed<00:03:42.980> to<00:03:43.100> only<00:03:43.390> be<00:03:44.390> an<00:03:44.540> issue

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
problem that seemed to only be an issue

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.950 
problem that seemed to only be an issue
on<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.590> Willie<00:03:45.800> regal<00:03:46.220> figure<00:03:46.580> his<00:03:47.240> waist<00:03:47.660> was

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
on the Willie regal figure his waist was

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.630 
on the Willie regal figure his waist was
pretty<00:03:48.260> loose<00:03:48.560> when<00:03:48.860> I<00:03:48.890> got<00:03:49.160> him<00:03:49.310> out<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.460> the

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
pretty loose when I got him out of the

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.090 
pretty loose when I got him out of the
jacket<00:03:50.150> so<00:03:50.930> what<00:03:51.200> I<00:03:51.230> did<00:03:51.350> is<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.680> just<00:03:51.890> took<00:03:52.040> a

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
jacket so what I did is I just took a

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.040 
jacket so what I did is I just took a
little<00:03:52.310> bit<00:03:52.520> of<00:03:52.580> superglue<00:03:53.360> with<00:03:53.930> the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
little bit of superglue with the

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.950 
little bit of superglue with the
toothpick<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.830> put<00:03:55.010> it<00:03:55.100> on<00:03:55.220> there<00:03:55.490> and

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
toothpick and I put it on there and

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.510 
toothpick and I put it on there and
twisted<00:03:56.960> its<00:03:57.110> waste<00:03:57.350> around<00:03:57.710> a<00:03:57.950> bunch<00:03:58.160> times

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
twisted its waste around a bunch times

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.420 
twisted its waste around a bunch times
until<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.570> glue<00:03:59.780> set<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.470> that<00:04:01.220> way<00:04:01.370> you

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
until the glue set and that way you

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.730 
until the glue set and that way you
could<00:04:01.610> still<00:04:01.910> move<00:04:02.120> his<00:04:02.360> waist<00:04:02.630> but<00:04:03.440> it's

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
could still move his waist but it's

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.880 
could still move his waist but it's
tighter<00:04:04.240> it<00:04:05.240> doesn't<00:04:05.720> glue<00:04:05.930> together<00:04:06.350> as<00:04:06.740> long

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
tighter it doesn't glue together as long

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.530 
tighter it doesn't glue together as long
as<00:04:07.070> you<00:04:07.160> move<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.490> waist<00:04:07.670> around<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:08.270> doesn't

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
as you move the waist around it doesn't

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.930 
as you move the waist around it doesn't
like<00:04:08.660> glue<00:04:09.020> the<00:04:09.620> torso<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.400> the<00:04:10.550> trunks<00:04:12.940> so

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
like glue the torso to the trunks so

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.670 
like glue the torso to the trunks so
with<00:04:14.270> a<00:04:14.300> little<00:04:14.390> bit<00:04:14.660> of<00:04:14.720> superglue<00:04:15.170> I<00:04:15.230> solves

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
with a little bit of superglue I solves

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.860 
with a little bit of superglue I solves
that<00:04:15.860> problem<00:04:15.920> I<00:04:16.670> couldn't<00:04:17.390> really<00:04:17.540> solve

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
that problem I couldn't really solve

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.910 
that problem I couldn't really solve
that<00:04:18.020> problem<00:04:18.290> with<00:04:18.500> the<00:04:18.650> ankles<00:04:19.810> but<00:04:20.830> like<00:04:21.830> i

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
that problem with the ankles but like i

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.110 
that problem with the ankles but like i
said<00:04:21.950> if<00:04:22.220> you're<00:04:22.340> just<00:04:22.460> going<00:04:22.670> to<00:04:22.790> set<00:04:23.090> it

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
said if you're just going to set it

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.880 
said if you're just going to set it
somewhere<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:23.660> display<00:04:24.050> it<00:04:24.230> you<00:04:24.410> can<00:04:24.590> get<00:04:24.770> it

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
somewhere to display it you can get it

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.280 
somewhere to display it you can get it
to<00:04:25.010> stand<00:04:25.310> on<00:04:25.520> its<00:04:25.700> own<00:04:25.880> it's<00:04:26.660> just<00:04:26.870> moving<00:04:27.110> it

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
to stand on its own it's just moving it

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.470 
to stand on its own it's just moving it
around<00:04:27.380> you<00:04:27.650> have<00:04:27.740> problems<00:04:28.250> i<00:04:28.490> do<00:04:29.090> recommend

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 
around you have problems i do recommend
