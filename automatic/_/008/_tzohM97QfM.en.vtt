00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
around the seventh round so I didn't

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.799 
around the seventh round so I didn't
even<00:00:36.340> get<00:00:36.550> to<00:00:36.609> see<00:00:36.850> the<00:00:36.969> whole<00:00:37.120> fight<00:00:37.449> I<00:00:37.480> ended

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
even get to see the whole fight I ended

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.040 
even get to see the whole fight I ended
up<00:00:37.840> watching<00:00:38.050> the<00:00:38.350> fight<00:00:38.590> on<00:00:38.890> my<00:00:39.460> phone<00:00:40.050> which

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
up watching the fight on my phone which

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.319 
up watching the fight on my phone which
is<00:00:41.079> the<00:00:41.260> reason<00:00:41.530> why<00:00:41.710> I<00:00:41.859> switched<00:00:42.519> from<00:00:42.670> Apple

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
is the reason why I switched from Apple

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.889 
is the reason why I switched from Apple
to<00:00:43.539> Android<00:00:44.500> because<00:00:45.250> on<00:00:45.609> an<00:00:45.730> Android<00:00:46.179> you<00:00:46.870> can

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
to Android because on an Android you can

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.950 
to Android because on an Android you can
stream<00:00:47.350> live<00:00:48.010> events<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:48.969> you<00:00:49.510> can't<00:00:49.750> do<00:00:49.929> it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
stream live events and you can't do it

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.279 
stream live events and you can't do it
on<00:00:50.260> an<00:00:50.500> iPhone<00:00:50.920> or<00:00:51.190> iPad<00:00:51.929> so<00:00:52.929> my<00:00:53.109> first

00:00:53.279 --> 00:00:53.289 
on an iPhone or iPad so my first

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:55.860 
on an iPhone or iPad so my first
question<00:00:53.469> is<00:00:53.980> why<00:00:54.699> wasn't<00:00:55.210> this<00:00:55.329> fight<00:00:55.539> aired

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
question is why wasn't this fight aired

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.290 
question is why wasn't this fight aired
on<00:00:56.140> HBO<00:00:56.379> I<00:00:57.039> mean<00:00:57.339> I<00:00:57.399> don't<00:00:57.460> get<00:00:57.760> it<00:00:57.969> Terence

American so I really don't understand

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.820 
American so I really don't understand
why<00:01:15.220> this<00:01:15.610> fight<00:01:15.820> wasn't<00:01:16.060> on<00:01:16.270> HBO<00:01:16.830> but

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
why this fight wasn't on HBO but

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.620 
why this fight wasn't on HBO but

nevertheless that didn't stop t see

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.020 
nevertheless that didn't stop t see
obviously<00:01:20.290> from<00:01:21.190> winning<00:01:21.670> his<00:01:21.700> first

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
obviously from winning his first

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.200 
obviously from winning his first
championship<00:01:22.440> belt<00:01:23.440> and<00:01:24.030> continuing<00:01:25.030> to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210

climb towards pound-for-pound status

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.190 
climb towards pound-for-pound status
maybe<00:01:28.300> one<00:01:28.630> day

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
maybe one day

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.080 
maybe one day
now<00:01:29.740> I<00:01:29.770> actually<00:01:30.160> thought<00:01:30.550> that<00:01:30.610> Terence

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
now I actually thought that Terence

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.030 
now I actually thought that Terence
Crawford<00:01:31.210> was<00:01:31.630> gonna<00:01:31.810> win<00:01:31.960> this<00:01:32.140> fight<00:01:32.380> easier

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
Crawford was gonna win this fight easier

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.940 
Crawford was gonna win this fight easier
than<00:01:33.820> he<00:01:33.940> actually<00:01:34.450> won<00:01:34.690> the<00:01:34.900> fight<00:01:35.110> don't<00:01:35.740> get

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
than he actually won the fight don't get

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.800 
than he actually won the fight don't get
me<00:01:36.040> wrong<00:01:36.070> that's<00:01:36.460> not<00:01:36.580> a<00:01:36.700> knock<00:01:37.000> on<00:01:37.300> Crawford

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
me wrong that's not a knock on Crawford

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.260 
me wrong that's not a knock on Crawford
because<00:01:38.650> he<00:01:38.950> still<00:01:39.190> won<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.610> fight<00:01:39.790> I<00:01:39.820> think

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
because he still won the fight I think

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.060 
because he still won the fight I think
117-111<00:01:41.230> and<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:42.670> was<00:01:42.910> in<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.390> UK<00:01:43.900> okay<00:01:44.860> on

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
117-111 and that was in the UK okay on

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.300 
117-111 and that was in the UK okay on
most<00:01:46.000> scorecards<00:01:46.870> now<00:01:47.560> I<00:01:47.590> will<00:01:47.950> give<00:01:48.130> credit

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
most scorecards now I will give credit

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.400 
most scorecards now I will give credit
to<00:01:48.520> Ricky<00:01:48.850> Byrnes<00:01:49.090> because<00:01:49.720> Ricky<00:01:50.020> Barnes<00:01:50.200> in

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
to Ricky Byrnes because Ricky Barnes in

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.900 
to Ricky Byrnes because Ricky Barnes in
my<00:01:50.560> opinion<00:01:50.980> he<00:01:51.100> did<00:01:51.310> make<00:01:51.550> the<00:01:51.700> fight

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:51.910 
my opinion he did make the fight

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.090 
my opinion he did make the fight
competitive<00:01:52.540> it<00:01:52.900> did<00:01:53.320> look<00:01:53.590> like<00:01:53.620> it<00:01:53.920> was<00:01:54.070> a

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
competitive it did look like it was a

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.490 
competitive it did look like it was a
championship<00:01:55.000> bout<00:01:55.300> it<00:01:55.630> didn't<00:01:56.140> look<00:01:56.260> like<00:01:56.320> it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
championship bout it didn't look like it

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.590 
championship bout it didn't look like it
was<00:01:56.710> just<00:01:56.920> Terence<00:01:57.340> Crawford<00:01:57.460> on<00:01:57.940> HBO

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
was just Terence Crawford on HBO

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.080 
was just Terence Crawford on HBO
fighting<00:01:59.110> against<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.560> bomb<00:01:59.770> okay<00:02:00.730> it<00:02:00.970> was<00:02:01.060> a

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
fighting against the bomb okay it was a

Crawford<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:25.150> way<00:03:25.270> I<00:03:25.300> mean<00:03:25.570> he<00:03:25.780> was<00:03:25.959> talking

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
Crawford the way I mean he was talking

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.870 
Crawford the way I mean he was talking
as<00:03:26.620> if<00:03:26.950> he<00:03:27.100> was<00:03:27.220> getting<00:03:27.459> in<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.580> ring<00:03:27.850> with

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
as if he was getting in the ring with

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.670 
as if he was getting in the ring with
Mike<00:03:28.240> Tyson<00:03:28.510> that's<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.080> way<00:03:29.170> he<00:03:29.290> was<00:03:29.440> talking

Mike Tyson that's the way he was talking
in<00:03:29.950> previous<00:03:30.400> interviews<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.870> didn't

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
in previous interviews so it didn't

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.870 
in previous interviews so it didn't
surprise<00:03:32.260> me<00:03:32.740> at<00:03:32.860> all<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.070> when<00:03:33.490> he<00:03:33.580> got<00:03:33.730> in

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
surprise me at all that when he got in

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.300 
surprise me at all that when he got in
the<00:03:33.970> ring<00:03:34.180> he<00:03:35.020> didn't<00:03:35.380> seem<00:03:35.590> like<00:03:35.920> he<00:03:36.130> was

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
the ring he didn't seem like he was

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.670 
the ring he didn't seem like he was
completely<00:03:37.120> comfortable<00:03:37.420> I<00:03:37.930> mean<00:03:38.350> he's<00:03:38.530> in

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
completely comfortable I mean he's in

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.170 
completely comfortable I mean he's in
the<00:03:38.770> ring<00:03:38.950> with<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.310> best<00:03:39.520> opponent<00:03:40.090> that

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:15.910 
lomachenko he was trying to make history

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.060 
lomachenko he was trying to make history
with<00:04:16.720> what<00:04:16.870> he<00:04:16.989> was<00:04:17.020> doing<00:04:17.410> trying<00:04:17.830> to<00:04:17.919> win<00:04:18.040> a

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
with what he was doing trying to win a

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.760

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
so lomachenko he really has no reason to

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.570 
so lomachenko he really has no reason to
walk<00:04:25.330> with<00:04:25.539> his<00:04:25.630> head<00:04:25.810> down<00:04:26.050> he<00:04:26.919> definitely

has a bright future and
definitely<00:04:30.310> I<00:04:30.340> can<00:04:30.460> see<00:04:31.259> him<00:04:32.259> winning<00:04:32.499> the

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680

it's not too hard to to win a title

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.689 
it's not too hard to to win a title
especially<00:04:38.080> when<00:04:38.529> you<00:04:38.620> have<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:39.039> experience
