00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.500 

I<00:01:07.550> mean<00:01:08.550> you'd<00:01:08.670> be<00:01:08.700> completely<00:01:09.890> if<00:01:10.890> you're

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:11.510 
I mean you'd be completely if you're

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
I mean you'd be completely if you're
like<00:01:12.510> five<00:01:12.750> -<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.620> could<00:01:13.770> easily<00:01:14.010> go

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
like five - you could easily go

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:24.020 
like five - you could easily go
flat-footed<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:15.090> something<00:01:15.510> like<00:01:15.690> this<00:01:23.030> you

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
flat-footed with something like this you

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.610 
flat-footed with something like this you
have<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.330> bike<00:01:24.540> standing<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.230> always<00:01:25.440> want

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
have the bike standing you always want

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.130 
have the bike standing you always want
to<00:01:25.650> make<00:01:25.710> sure<00:01:25.800> that<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.930> handlebars<00:01:27.930> are

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
to make sure that the handlebars are

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.810 
to make sure that the handlebars are
turned<00:01:28.410> toward<00:01:28.830> the<00:01:28.950> direction<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.580> kicks

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
turned toward the direction of the kicks

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:44.330 
turned toward the direction of the kicks
the<00:01:30.000> end

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.910 

this<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.329> next<00:01:45.630> one<00:01:45.810> up<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.409> v-star<00:01:46.920> 650

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
this is the next one up the v-star 650

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.109 
this is the next one up the v-star 650
obviously<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.039> can<00:01:50.219> kind<00:01:50.700> of<00:01:50.789> see<00:01:50.969> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
obviously you can kind of see the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:58.160 
obviously you can kind of see the
contrast<00:01:51.780> between<00:01:53.659> the<00:01:56.359> the<00:01:57.359> displacements

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
contrast between the the displacements

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.109 
contrast between the the displacements
of<00:01:58.289> the<00:01:58.439> motor<00:02:01.310> significant<00:02:02.310> difference<00:02:02.759> but

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
of the motor significant difference but

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.600 
of the motor significant difference but
then<00:02:03.299> again<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.780> think<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.679> is<00:02:04.890> even<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:05.340> lower

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
then again I think this is even a lower

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.139 
then again I think this is even a lower
seat<00:02:06.390> height<00:02:06.420> than<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.079> than<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.829> 250<00:02:08.580> it

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
seat height than the than the 250 it

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:17.090 
seat height than the than the 250 it
looks<00:02:09.330> like

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.160 

you
