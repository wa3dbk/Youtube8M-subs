different<00:00:16.080> ones<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.500> different<00:00:16.680> sizes<00:00:17.039> and

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
different ones in different sizes and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.130 
different ones in different sizes and
different<00:00:17.430> capacities<00:00:18.300> I<00:00:18.449> picked<00:00:18.690> this<00:00:18.930> one

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
different capacities I picked this one

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.080 
different capacities I picked this one
because<00:00:19.199> it's<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.949> most<00:00:20.220> powerful<00:00:20.880> one<00:00:21.060> that

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
because it's the most powerful one that

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.509 
because it's the most powerful one that
they<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.930> two<00:00:22.230> cell<00:00:22.560> configuration<00:00:22.830> in

Traxxas<00:00:57.420> pack<00:00:57.660> test<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.260> brand<00:00:58.620> new<00:00:58.770> but<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
Traxxas pack test is brand new but the

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.729 
Traxxas pack test is brand new but the
gens<00:00:59.910> ace<00:01:00.120> pack<00:01:00.390> test<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:00.930> done<00:01:01.109> some<00:01:01.469> time

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
gens ace pack test was done some time

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.130 
gens ace pack test was done some time
ago<00:01:01.770> according<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.879> my<00:01:03.030> records<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.989> day

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
ago according to my records on the day

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.810 
ago according to my records on the day
that<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> did<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.710> previous<00:01:05.220> test<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that I did that previous test the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.940 
that I did that previous test the
ambient<00:01:06.360> air<00:01:06.570> temperature<00:01:06.630> was<00:01:07.470> seven<00:01:07.920> point

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
ambient air temperature was seven point

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.070 
ambient air temperature was seven point
seven<00:01:08.340> degrees<00:01:08.820> Fahrenheit<00:01:09.510> higher

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
seven degrees Fahrenheit higher

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.920 
seven degrees Fahrenheit higher
therefore<00:01:10.650> it's<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> fair<00:01:11.610> test<00:01:11.640> however<00:01:12.540> I

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
therefore it's not a fair test however I

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.249 
therefore it's not a fair test however I
no<00:01:13.200> longer<00:01:13.409> have<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.250> brand<00:01:14.610> new<00:01:14.760> other<00:01:15.240> pack<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
no longer have a brand new other pack to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.800 
no longer have a brand new other pack to
compare<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> Traxxas<00:01:17.220> one<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.299> had<00:01:18.659> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
compare the Traxxas one to so I had to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.469 
compare the Traxxas one to so I had to
just<00:01:19.020> compare<00:01:19.439> my<00:01:19.920> brand<00:01:20.400> new<00:01:20.520> tracks<00:01:21.119> us<00:01:21.270> back

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
just compare my brand new tracks us back

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.960 
just compare my brand new tracks us back
to<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> couple<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.229> five-month-old<00:01:22.970> well-used

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
packs the old gens a still did better

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.160 
packs the old gens a still did better

Traxxas one lasted quite a bit longer

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.620 
Traxxas one lasted quite a bit longer
which<00:01:34.560> only<00:01:35.040> makes<00:01:35.280> sense<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.390> a

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.640 
good pack it feels well built and most
importantly<00:03:39.849> the<00:03:40.450> numbers<00:03:40.870> on<00:03:41.019> it<00:03:41.200> seemed<00:03:41.530> to

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
importantly the numbers on it seemed to

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.400 
importantly the numbers on it seemed to
be<00:03:41.680> very<00:03:41.829> honest<00:03:42.819> if<00:03:43.030> anything<00:03:43.780> like<00:03:44.019> I<00:03:44.139> said

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
be very honest if anything like I said

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.189 
be very honest if anything like I said
they<00:03:44.620> are<00:03:44.940> understated<00:03:45.940> you<00:03:46.269> get<00:03:46.449> at<00:03:46.660> least<00:03:46.900> as

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
they are understated you get at least as

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:49.409 
they are understated you get at least as
much<00:03:47.410> capacity<00:03:47.650> in<00:03:48.220> an<00:03:48.489> actual<00:03:49.000> real-world

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:49.419

charge<00:03:50.290> as<00:03:50.620> is<00:03:51.370> marked<00:03:52.030> on<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.599> battery<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.169> I

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
charge as is marked on the battery and I

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.430 
charge as is marked on the battery and I
think<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.769> 25<00:03:54.220> C<00:03:54.489> rating<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.030> either<00:03:55.720> correct

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
think the 25 C rating is either correct

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.619 
think the 25 C rating is either correct
or<00:03:56.620> maybe<00:03:57.549> even<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:57.879> little<00:03:57.910> bit<00:03:58.180> lower<00:03:58.389> than

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
or maybe even a little bit lower than

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:59.939 
or maybe even a little bit lower than
what<00:03:58.690> you're<00:03:58.959> actually<00:03:58.989> getting<00:03:59.650> out<00:03:59.769> of<00:03:59.889> the
