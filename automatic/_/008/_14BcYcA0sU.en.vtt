00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
same exact same mounting flange so I've

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.730 
same exact same mounting flange so I've
got<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:56.820> slightly<00:00:57.090> bigger<00:00:57.360> carburetor<00:00:57.900> gave<00:00:58.590> me

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:58.740 
got a slightly bigger carburetor gave me

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.210 
got a slightly bigger carburetor gave me
a<00:00:58.800> bit<00:00:58.920> more<00:00:59.070> top-end<00:00:59.310> bit<00:00:59.730> more<00:00:59.880> brother<00:01:00.150> and

a bit more top-end bit more brother and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.620 
a bit more top-end bit more brother and
yeah<00:01:02.220> probably<00:01:02.460> uses<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> bit<00:01:03.120> more<00:01:03.270> fuel<00:01:03.450> at

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:03.630 
yeah probably uses a bit more fuel at

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.860 
yeah probably uses a bit more fuel at
the<00:01:03.720> same<00:01:03.930> time<00:01:04.199> but<00:01:04.409> who<00:01:04.949> cares<00:01:05.309> it's<00:01:05.670> fun

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
the same time but who cares it's fun

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
about that tires went flat and the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.770 
about that tires went flat and the
carburetor<00:01:23.010> I<00:01:23.070> won't<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:24.000> left<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.360> fuel<00:01:24.600> on

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
carburetor I won't we left the fuel on

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.490 
carburetor I won't we left the fuel on
and<00:01:25.430> has<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.610> all<00:01:26.790> evaporated<00:01:27.110> over<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.200> year

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
and has it all evaporated over the year

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.380 
and has it all evaporated over the year
deposited<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.490> hell<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.970> lot<00:01:30.120> of<00:01:30.150> crap<00:01:30.360> in

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
deposited a hell of a lot of crap in

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.850 
deposited a hell of a lot of crap in
there<00:01:30.690> inside<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.080> carburetor<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.620> you<00:01:31.710> can

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
there inside the carburetor as you can

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.430 
there inside the carburetor as you can
imagine<00:01:32.540> so<00:01:33.540> I<00:01:33.600> find<00:01:33.870> that<00:01:33.960> all<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.290> the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
imagine so I find that all that the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.960 
imagine so I find that all that the
other<00:01:34.590> day<00:01:34.799> now<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.340> just<00:01:35.370> finished<00:01:35.760> true

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
other day now if just finished true

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.010 
other day now if just finished true
tuning<00:01:36.510> it<00:01:36.600> now

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
tuning it now

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
tuning it now
have<00:01:37.440> to<00:01:37.560> fiddle<00:01:37.740> with<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.100> bit<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.430> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
have to fiddle with it a bit to get it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.770 
have to fiddle with it a bit to get it
just<00:01:38.670> right<00:01:38.820> because<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.240> carburetor<00:01:39.690> is<00:01:39.720> a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
just right because the carburetor is a

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.660 
just right because the carburetor is a
bit<00:01:39.930> big<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:42.080> yeah<00:01:43.080> maybe<00:01:43.440> maybe<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.460> can

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
bit big and yeah maybe maybe I can

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.100 
bit big and yeah maybe maybe I can
figure<00:01:44.940> out<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.180> way<00:01:45.330> here<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.630> start<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.080> with

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
figure out a way here to start it with

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.440 
figure out a way here to start it with
the<00:01:46.260> one<00:01:46.710> hand<00:01:47.010> actually<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> got<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> trifle

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
the one hand actually I got a trifle

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.450 
the one hand actually I got a trifle
over<00:01:48.659> here<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.350> that's<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.830> good<00:01:49.950> idea

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.960 

grab<00:01:53.460> that

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:04.750
