I said kit was that it was color-coded

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.770 
I said kit was that it was color-coded
so<00:05:46.440> it<00:05:46.560> made<00:05:46.770> it<00:05:46.800> really<00:05:47.190> easy<00:05:47.310> to<00:05:48.270> be<00:05:48.390> able<00:05:48.510> to

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
so it made it really easy to be able to

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:55.580 
so it made it really easy to be able to
do<00:05:48.990> so<00:05:49.560> it<00:05:49.710> wasn't<00:05:50.040> too<00:05:51.320> too<00:05:52.320> too<00:05:53.750> too<00:05:54.750> hard<00:05:55.050> to

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
do so it wasn't too too too too hard to

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.920 
do so it wasn't too too too too hard to

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:57.930 
explain too hard to use this was

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.420 
explain too hard to use this was
something<00:05:58.170> that<00:05:58.290> definitely<00:05:58.620> you<00:05:59.010> could<00:05:59.220> you
