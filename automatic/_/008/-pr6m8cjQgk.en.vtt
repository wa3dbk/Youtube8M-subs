00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.170
 my brother we are the fourth generation 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:36.010
 always like a family relationship with 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.010
 one generation to another 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.280
 comes from my aunt my mother's sister 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.840
 who received it from her husband that 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.610
 received from his father who received it 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.610
 from her aunt she received from her husband 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.780
 my days of leisure were days 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.129
 of games in the laboratory 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.780
 those that were mine then 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.519
 my work tools were first 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.679
 toys what was mine 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.659
 master was before being mine 

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:04.409
 master my playmate me 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.990
 I have grown since I could 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.670
 to be to hold them on the legs and 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.920
 practice the scale that led into 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.820
 lab I grew up playing the 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.970
 lab i don't know if i ever ran out of 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.970
 to play 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.170
 I decided at age 25 when my aunt for 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.200
 age and for health conditions not 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.720
 he could no longer sustain the bulk of 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.200
 I work in a store having no gods 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.240
 children extend the grandchildren we had to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.900
 choose or finish the studies 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.570
 university students and therefore the excess 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.830
 defined it or choose the pastry 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.840
 and not complete university studies 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.760
 he is so happy 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.220
 all the fruit we work does not 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.340
 they come from the market they come from 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.440
 campania from farmers by producers 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.540
 because we need to be able to 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.390
 establish us the exact time of the 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.670
 collection to get the right point of 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.000
 maturation in order to express 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.640
 the aromatic profile the landscape 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.120
 best taste that that fruit can 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.190
 offer and we therefore turn to 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.350
 primary farmers who are there 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.330
 give the possibility to choose the 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.209
 suitable time for the harvest of each 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.180
 fruit therefore we do not have semi-finished products 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:27.500
 industrial but we are the industry that 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:30.150
 produces the semi-finished product for ourselves 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.600
 this laboratory is a place where you 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.190
 experience where required curiosity where 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.549
 required interest where requested 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.010
 passion you asked for attention this 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.440
 what we do and where we are asking why 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.950
 we know we have to take care of the things we do 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.950
 we have in our hands 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:52.450
 sweet that I like best I don't know 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.920
 maybe I still have to do it I 'll try 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.920
 what I like to prepare more 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:02.569
 I always like my neighbor there too 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.870
 think progress made no one me 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.409
 already like to think about what will happen 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.409
 in the next one
