00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.110 

bible<00:00:52.560> thumper<00:00:52.830> that's<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.700> first<00:00:53.910> thing<00:00:54.000> I

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
bible thumper that's the first thing I

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
bible thumper that's the first thing I
think<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.980> pseudo<00:00:55.980> Christian<00:00:56.460> people<00:00:56.670> trying

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
think of pseudo Christian people trying

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.220 
think of pseudo Christian people trying
to<00:00:57.120> tell<00:00:57.330> you<00:00:57.480> what<00:00:57.660> they<00:00:57.780> believe<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
to tell you what they believe in and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.510 
to tell you what they believe in and
what<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.500> should<00:00:58.739> believe

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
what you should believe

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.110 
what you should believe
when<00:01:01.450> I<00:01:01.480> think<00:01:01.690> of<00:01:01.720> Christians<00:01:02.110> I<00:01:02.320> think<00:01:02.860> of

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
when I think of Christians I think of

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.770 
when I think of Christians I think of
dogmatic<00:01:04.120> closed<00:01:04.660> minded<00:01:05.140> individuals<00:01:06.780> well

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
dogmatic closed minded individuals well

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.990 
dogmatic closed minded individuals well
I<00:01:08.140> think<00:01:08.440> of<00:01:08.800> this<00:01:09.040> thing<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.400> Gandhi<00:01:09.730> said<00:01:09.970> I

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
I think of this thing that Gandhi said I

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.400 
I think of this thing that Gandhi said I
would<00:01:10.330> have<00:01:10.420> become<00:01:10.690> a<00:01:10.720> first<00:01:10.990> Christian

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
would have become a first Christian

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.070 
would have become a first Christian
except<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:11.800> never<00:01:11.830> met<00:01:12.250> one<00:01:12.400> I<00:01:12.640> mean<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.540> haven't

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
except I never met one I mean I haven't

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
except I never met one I mean I haven't
met<00:01:14.320> very<00:01:14.560> many<00:01:14.710> true<00:01:15.220> Christians<00:01:15.760> in<00:01:15.970> my<00:01:16.150> life

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
met very many true Christians in my life

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.560 
met very many true Christians in my life
the<00:01:18.100> most<00:01:18.280> part<00:01:18.580> I<00:01:18.700> think<00:01:18.729> of<00:01:19.030> people<00:01:19.360> who

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
the most part I think of people who

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.270 
the most part I think of people who
should<00:01:19.870> just<00:01:20.110> be<00:01:20.229> taken<00:01:20.560> out<00:01:20.680> back<00:01:20.860> and<00:01:21.070> shot

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
should just be taken out back and shot

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.740 
should just be taken out back and shot
because<00:01:21.640> they<00:01:22.450> don't<00:01:23.190> apply<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:25.210> love<00:01:25.540> is

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
because they don't apply the the love is

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:36.590 
because they don't apply the the love is
everything<00:01:26.050> message<00:01:26.680> of<00:01:26.920> Jesus

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.480
