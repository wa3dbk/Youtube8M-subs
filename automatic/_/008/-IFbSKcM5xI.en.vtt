00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
to finish them off but the boys really

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.370 
to finish them off but the boys really
worked<00:01:59.579> hard<00:01:59.899> obviously<00:02:00.899> we<00:02:01.020> didn't<00:02:01.290> know

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
worked hard obviously we didn't know

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.780 
worked hard obviously we didn't know
what<00:02:01.560> we're<00:02:01.710> up<00:02:01.740> against<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> first<00:02:02.579> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
what we're up against the first the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.700 
what we're up against the first the
first<00:02:02.939> half<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.390> we<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.960> did<00:02:04.170> played<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> little

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
first half so we we did played a little

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.990 
first half so we we did played a little
a<00:02:05.040> little<00:02:05.340> kg<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:06.240> we<00:02:06.689> dropped<00:02:06.960> back<00:02:07.170> in

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
a little kg we we dropped back in

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.419 
a little kg we we dropped back in
but<00:02:08.330> once<00:02:08.899> we<00:02:09.080> saw<00:02:09.619> were<00:02:09.830> up<00:02:09.950> against<00:02:10.250> we

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
but once we saw were up against we

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.370 
but once we saw were up against we
decided<00:02:10.850> that<00:02:10.880> I<00:02:11.240> press<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.780> little<00:02:11.960> bit<00:02:12.200> more

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
decided that I press a little bit more

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.380 
decided that I press a little bit more
and<00:02:12.440> go<00:02:12.620> forward<00:02:13.010> and<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.790> paid<00:02:14.000> off<00:02:14.030> and<00:02:14.330> I

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
and go forward and it paid off and I

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.580 
and go forward and it paid off and I
understand<00:02:14.810> South<00:02:14.960> but<00:02:15.170> we<00:02:15.230> should<00:02:15.380> have<00:02:15.470> won

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
understand South but we should have won

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.380 
understand South but we should have won
the<00:02:15.710> game<00:02:15.740> but<00:02:16.070> it<00:02:16.160> was<00:02:16.250> a<00:02:16.280> good<00:02:16.940> experience

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
the game but it was a good experience

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.110 
the game but it was a good experience

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.690 
think we'll do a lot better I saw second
half<00:03:23.810> we<00:03:24.260> had<00:03:24.380> the<00:03:24.500> ball<00:03:24.650> possession<00:03:25.400> of<00:03:25.610> the

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
half we had the ball possession of the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.210 
half we had the ball possession of the
ball<00:03:25.730> we<00:03:26.360> moved<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.140> did<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.530> lot<00:03:27.709> better<00:03:27.739> he<00:03:28.070> got

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
ball we moved it did a lot better he got

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.850 
ball we moved it did a lot better he got
got<00:03:28.700> some<00:03:28.820> with<00:03:28.940> more<00:03:29.150> chances<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.810> I<00:03:30.019> think<00:03:30.680> if

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
got some with more chances so I think if

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.000 
got some with more chances so I think if
we<00:03:30.950> do<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.070> better<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.519> our<00:03:31.640> next<00:03:31.820> game
