I guess it's up this is meathead mchale

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.210 
I guess it's up this is meathead mchale

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
about furious charge and rakers set and

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.740 
about furious charge and rakers set and
i'm<00:00:11.309> going<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> do<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> quick<00:00:11.820> little<00:00:12.120> demo<00:00:12.240> and

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
i'm going to do a quick little demo and

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:13.940 
i'm going to do a quick little demo and
then<00:00:12.929> i'm<00:00:13.049> actually<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.410> do<00:00:13.530> another<00:00:13.740> video

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
then i'm actually to do another video

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.359 
then i'm actually to do another video
where<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.639> show<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.330> guys<00:00:15.450> this<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:16.529> action

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
where I show you guys this in action

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.429 
where I show you guys this in action
inside<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.180> greater<00:00:18.390> rift<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:18.990> first<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.410> all

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
inside of a greater rift so first of all

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.720 
inside of a greater rift so first of all
let's<00:00:19.500> just<00:00:19.710> go<00:00:19.830> over<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.100> changes<00:00:20.430> briefly

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
let's just go over the changes briefly

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.790 
let's just go over the changes briefly
there<00:00:21.660> are<00:00:21.750> some<00:00:21.900> major<00:00:22.080> major<00:00:22.380> changes<00:00:22.740> to

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
there are some major major changes to

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200 
there are some major major changes to
priya's<00:00:23.130> charge<00:00:23.340> first<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.670> all<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.910> moves

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
priya's charge first of all it moves

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.839 
priya's charge first of all it moves
very<00:00:24.660> very<00:00:24.900> well<00:00:25.050> now<00:00:25.400> it<00:00:26.400> moves<00:00:26.670> around

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
very very well now it moves around

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.300 
very very well now it moves around
obstacles<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.660> will<00:00:27.750> move<00:00:27.930> around<00:00:28.140> waller<00:00:28.439> it

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
obstacles it will move around waller it

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.700 
obstacles it will move around waller it
will<00:00:29.429> not<00:00:29.519> go<00:00:29.699> through<00:00:29.730> waller<00:00:30.210> but<00:00:30.660> I<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.500> aim

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
will not go through waller but I can aim

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.560 
will not go through waller but I can aim
like<00:00:31.949> over<00:00:32.279> here<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:33.030> going<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.210> go<00:00:33.329> all

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
like over here and it's going to go all

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.330 
like over here and it's going to go all
the<00:00:33.600> way<00:00:33.690> around<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.200> I'm<00:00:34.290> just<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.620> morir<00:00:34.920> but

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
the way around so I'm just a morir but

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.670 
the way around so I'm just a morir but
it<00:00:36.300> will<00:00:36.450> actually<00:00:36.630> cover<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.230> max<00:00:37.410> distance

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
it will actually cover the max distance

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.910 
it will actually cover the max distance
but<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.070> will<00:00:38.420> go<00:00:39.420> around<00:00:39.960> obstacles<00:00:40.260> very

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
but it will go around obstacles very

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.970 
but it will go around obstacles very
very<00:00:41.129> nice<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.960> maximum<00:00:43.260> charge<00:00:43.379> distance

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
very nice the maximum charge distance

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.459 
very nice the maximum charge distance
has<00:00:44.070> been<00:00:44.219> increased<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.670> 60<00:00:45.149> yards<00:00:45.420> from<00:00:46.020> 35

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
has been increased to 60 yards from 35

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.529 
has been increased to 60 yards from 35
which<00:00:46.739> is<00:00:46.890> huge<00:00:47.190> that's<00:00:47.820> most<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.270> screen

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
which is huge that's most of the screen

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.389 
which is huge that's most of the screen
so<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.260> see<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:49.800> covered<00:00:50.100> most<00:00:50.309> of

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
so you can see that I covered most of

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.069 
so you can see that I covered most of
that<00:00:50.690> 50<00:00:51.690> yards<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.699> probably<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.809> so

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
that 50 yards is probably out to here so

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.229 
that 50 yards is probably out to here so
60<00:00:55.469> yards<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.920> basically<00:00:56.520> from<00:00:56.730> where<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.000> are

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
60 yards is basically from where you are

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.529 
60 yards is basically from where you are
down<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.949> roughly<00:00:59.309> here<00:00:59.520> so<00:00:59.820> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.510> see

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
down to like roughly here so you can see

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.060 
down to like roughly here so you can see
that<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:00.989> actually<00:01:01.109> cover<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.829> know<00:01:01.920> my

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that I can actually cover you know my

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.119 
that I can actually cover you know my
entire<00:01:02.250> screen<00:01:02.640> can't<00:01:03.449> really<00:01:03.750> go<00:01:03.989> past<00:01:04.920> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
entire screen can't really go past the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.600 
entire screen can't really go past the
screen<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:06.090> that's<00:01:07.020> okay<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.439> mean<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:08.010> still

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
screen but that's okay I mean it's still

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.730 
screen but that's okay I mean it's still
very<00:01:08.850> very<00:01:08.970> good<00:01:09.210> distance<00:01:09.570> basically<00:01:10.080> get<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
very very good distance basically get to

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
very very good distance basically get to
anything<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> screen<00:01:11.630> anyway<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.900> travel

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
anything on the screen anyway the travel

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.920 
anything on the screen anyway the travel
speed<00:01:13.710> has<00:01:13.799> been<00:01:13.950> increased<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.930> ending

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
speed has been increased the ending

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.580 
speed has been increased the ending
animation<00:01:16.560> has<00:01:16.770> also<00:01:17.100> been<00:01:17.549> decreased<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
animation has also been decreased and

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.960 
animation has also been decreased and
apparently<00:01:19.590> it<00:01:19.680> also<00:01:19.799> scales<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.580> your<00:01:20.700> tax

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
apparently it also scales with your tax

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
apparently it also scales with your tax
beat<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.450> higher<00:01:21.570> attack<00:01:21.900> speed<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
beat so the higher attack speed the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.560 
beat so the higher attack speed the
quicker<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.040> end<00:01:23.189> animation<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.420> it's

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
quicker the end animation and it's

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.240 
quicker the end animation and it's
actually<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.110> fast<00:01:25.380> now<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> was<00:01:25.860> doing<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.070> on

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
actually so fast now I was doing this on

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.700 
actually so fast now I was doing this on
stream<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> other<00:01:26.790> night<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.409> lot<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.530> times

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
stream the other night a lot of times

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.190 
stream the other night a lot of times
you<00:01:28.950> will<00:01:29.040> actually<00:01:29.220> cast<00:01:29.960> you<00:01:30.960> know<00:01:31.049> with

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
you will actually cast you know with

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.480 
you will actually cast you know with
rakers<00:01:31.500> you'll<00:01:31.650> cast<00:01:31.799> your<00:01:31.950> fears<00:01:32.100> charged

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
rakers you'll cast your fears charged

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850 
rakers you'll cast your fears charged
twice<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:34.020> won't<00:01:34.170> even<00:01:34.259> realize<00:01:34.680> that

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
twice and you won't even realize that

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.410 
twice and you won't even realize that
you<00:01:34.950> casted<00:01:35.340> twice<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.729> such<00:01:35.909> succession

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
you casted twice in such succession

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.910 
you casted twice in such succession
because<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.869> moves<00:01:37.369> so<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.729> fast<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.920> another

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
because it moves so so fast now another

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.170 
because it moves so so fast now another
thing<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.310> no<00:01:41.430> longer<00:01:41.670> alternates<00:01:42.119> between

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
thing and no longer alternates between

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
thing and no longer alternates between
main<00:01:42.750> hand<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.490> off<00:01:44.490> hand<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.689> means

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
main hand and off hand so that means

this<00:03:42.269> is<00:03:42.419> no<00:03:42.870> longer<00:03:43.079> one<00:03:43.319> of<00:03:43.349> those<00:03:43.530> your

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
this is no longer one of those your

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.770 
this is no longer one of those your
dependency<00:03:44.579> things<00:03:44.819> it's<00:03:45.150> more<00:03:45.449> the<00:03:45.540> skill

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
dependency things it's more the skill

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.960 
dependency things it's more the skill
dependency<00:03:46.230> now<00:03:46.349> once<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.310> have<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.669> in-game

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
dependency now once you have the in-game

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.619 
dependency now once you have the in-game
set<00:03:48.299> you<00:03:48.930> know<00:03:49.049> how<00:03:49.199> well<00:03:49.470> you<00:03:49.650> aim<00:03:49.859> your

00:03:50.619 --> 00:03:50.629 
set you know how well you aim your

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:52.789 
set you know how well you aim your
furious<00:03:51.629> charge<00:03:51.690> will<00:03:52.169> depend<00:03:52.440> on<00:03:52.560> whether<00:03:52.739> or

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
furious charge will depend on whether or

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.080 
furious charge will depend on whether or
not<00:03:52.949> you<00:03:53.160> know<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.340> activate<00:03:53.699> the<00:03:53.790> cooldown

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
not you know you activate the cooldown

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.280 
not you know you activate the cooldown
because<00:03:54.419> you<00:03:54.510> have<00:03:54.599> to<00:03:54.690> hit<00:03:54.780> a<00:03:54.840> certain<00:03:55.079> amount

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
because you have to hit a certain amount

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.990 
because you have to hit a certain amount
of<00:03:55.379> mobs<00:03:55.590> to<00:03:55.829> not<00:03:55.980> sure<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.220> cool<00:03:56.489> down<00:03:56.519> like<00:03:56.879> on

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
of mobs to not sure to cool down like on

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.270 
of mobs to not sure to cool down like on
that<00:03:57.120> one<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:57.329> hit<00:03:57.629> one<00:03:57.919> such<00:03:58.919> rid<00:03:59.099> of<00:03:59.190> the

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
that one I hit one such rid of the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.589 
that one I hit one such rid of the
cooldowns<00:03:59.639> so<00:03:59.910> let<00:04:00.060> me<00:04:00.120> see<00:04:00.269> if<00:04:00.389> I<00:04:00.449> can

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
cooldowns so let me see if I can

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.670 
cooldowns so let me see if I can
actually<00:04:00.750> drag<00:04:01.199> a<00:04:01.940> very<00:04:02.940> nice<00:04:03.150> chunk<00:04:03.510> here<00:04:03.750> for

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
actually drag a very nice chunk here for

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.720 
actually drag a very nice chunk here for
you<00:04:04.769> guys<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:05.099> we're<00:04:05.250> just<00:04:05.370> we're<00:04:05.489> going<00:04:05.669> to

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
you guys and we're just we're going to

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.089 
you guys and we're just we're going to
charge<00:04:05.910> all<00:04:06.060> over<00:04:06.239> the<00:04:06.329> screen<00:04:06.949> here<00:04:07.949> in<00:04:08.069> a

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
charge all over the screen here in a

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.550 
charge all over the screen here in a
second

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
second

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.140 
second
I<00:04:12.190> didn't<00:04:13.190> do<00:04:13.280> too<00:04:13.430> good<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.640> a<00:04:13.700> job<00:04:13.730> there<00:04:14.030> but

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
I didn't do too good of a job there but

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.580 
I didn't do too good of a job there but
you<00:04:14.209> can<00:04:14.360> see<00:04:14.569> how<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.750> can<00:04:14.900> just<00:04:15.080> change<00:04:15.260> arge

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
you can see how you can just change arge

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.780 
you can see how you can just change arge
all<00:04:16.430> over<00:04:16.669> the<00:04:16.760> place<00:04:18.190> this<00:04:19.190> is<00:04:19.310> ridiculous

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:23.590 

and<00:04:22.790> you<00:04:22.880> could<00:04:23.000> just<00:04:23.150> do<00:04:23.210> this<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.389> you're

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
and you could just do this and you're

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.510 
and you could just do this and you're
basically<00:04:23.870> immune<00:04:24.230> while<00:04:24.980> you're<00:04:25.100> charging

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
basically immune while you're charging

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.930 
basically immune while you're charging
so<00:04:26.500> now<00:04:27.500> when<00:04:27.650> you<00:04:27.710> combine<00:04:28.040> that<00:04:28.070> with<00:04:30.940> some

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
so now when you combine that with some

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.570 
so now when you combine that with some
other<00:04:32.060> attack<00:04:32.389> like<00:04:32.690> hammer<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.830> ancients<00:04:34.340> or

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
other attack like hammer the ancients or

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.350 
other attack like hammer the ancients or
your<00:04:35.000> end<00:04:35.240> or<00:04:36.050> some<00:04:36.260> combination<00:04:36.530> of<00:04:37.090> rend<00:04:38.090> and

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
your end or some combination of rend and

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.240 
your end or some combination of rend and
hammer<00:04:38.570> the<00:04:38.780> ancients<00:04:39.230> you<00:04:39.620> can<00:04:39.800> get<00:04:40.070> across

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
hammer the ancients you can get across

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.219 
hammer the ancients you can get across
the<00:04:40.520> screen<00:04:40.669> very<00:04:40.910> very<00:04:41.150> quickly<00:04:41.389> this<00:04:42.080> is

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
the screen very very quickly this is

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:45.850 
the screen very very quickly this is
absolutely<00:04:42.530> awesome<00:04:43.030> for<00:04:44.530> greater<00:04:45.530> rifts

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
absolutely awesome for greater rifts

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.320 
absolutely awesome for greater rifts
because<00:04:46.250> it<00:04:46.430> lets<00:04:46.520> you<00:04:46.639> cover<00:04:46.850> distances

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
because it lets you cover distances

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.640 
because it lets you cover distances
quickly<00:04:47.720> and<00:04:47.840> as<00:04:47.930> you'll<00:04:48.080> see<00:04:48.290> in<00:04:48.410> greater

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
quickly and as you'll see in greater

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.650 
quickly and as you'll see in greater
rifts<00:04:48.979> a<00:04:49.130> lot<00:04:49.790> of<00:04:49.880> times<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.240> do<00:04:50.360> have<00:04:50.479> to<00:04:50.630> have

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
rifts a lot of times you do have to have

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.710 
rifts a lot of times you do have to have
mobility<00:04:50.960> that's<00:04:51.380> something<00:04:51.740> that<00:04:51.880> is<00:04:52.880> a<00:04:53.389> big

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
mobility that's something that is a big

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:56.469 
mobility that's something that is a big
thing<00:04:53.930> and<00:04:54.770> being<00:04:55.070> able<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.400> actually<00:04:55.550> cover

thing and being able to actually cover

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.270 
thing and being able to actually cover
those<00:04:56.720> distances<00:04:57.050> very<00:04:57.440> quickly<00:04:57.710> is<00:04:58.040> going<00:04:58.220> to

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
those distances very quickly is going to

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.950 
those distances very quickly is going to

cavity with ptrs I don't know you know

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:13.240 
cavity with ptrs I don't know you know
how<00:05:11.990> it's<00:05:12.169> going<00:05:12.290> to<00:05:12.380> if<00:05:12.830> this<00:05:12.950> is<00:05:13.070> going<00:05:13.160> to

how it's going to if this is going to

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.700 
how it's going to if this is going to

this<00:05:20.030> is<00:05:20.180> actually<00:05:20.330> very<00:05:20.539> very<00:05:20.900> fun<00:05:21.289> build

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
this is actually very very fun build

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.710 
this is actually very very fun build
it's<00:05:22.310> incredibly<00:05:22.850> powerful<00:05:23.030> I<00:05:23.450> don't<00:05:23.660> think

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
it's incredibly powerful I don't think

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.750 
it's incredibly powerful I don't think
it's<00:05:24.020> really<00:05:24.260> overpowered<00:05:24.919> because<00:05:25.310> again

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
it's really overpowered because again

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.430 
it's really overpowered because again
like<00:05:26.030> single<00:05:26.390> target<00:05:26.690> on<00:05:26.780> ripped<00:05:26.990> Guardians

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
like single target on ripped Guardians

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.290 
like single target on ripped Guardians
you<00:05:27.650> know<00:05:27.740> it<00:05:27.860> doesn't<00:05:28.130> really<00:05:28.220> work<00:05:28.520> because

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
you know it doesn't really work because

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.820 
you know it doesn't really work because
you<00:05:29.539> can't<00:05:29.720> keep<00:05:29.870> charging<00:05:30.140> and<00:05:30.440> we<00:05:30.500> have<00:05:30.620> one

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:30.830 
you can't keep charging and we have one
