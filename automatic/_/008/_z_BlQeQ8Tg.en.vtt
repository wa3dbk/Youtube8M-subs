00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.940
 Affairs in the world server-sided affairs and 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.439
 It means that we have if we estimate 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.480
 we have two minutes of alchemy on 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.119
 ruthlessness can basically bang and 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.220

 gone called the wrong steppe 31 seconds 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.730
 at the beginning of the battle let's hope that 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:50.550
 tags will fall into the windows of such people 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.440
 102,000 but unfortunately mwk and therefore even 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.129
 with the label will not live long 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.410
 but would be in the keel and this is yes yes yes 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.559

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.750
 Abuse Pegasus of we will not I think 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.409

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.119

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.220
 necromancer without immortality yes it is 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.140
 wonderful necromancer I already like you 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.620
 broke to the droplets so she is getting closer 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:13.170
 and closer but electric shock is even closer 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.130
 Unfortunately did not have time to give him no trouble does not 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.489
 misfortune the priest stands such on the highground and 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.549
 supposedly 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.890
 op op heal oh I started to beat dyk 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.780

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.500
 good luck let's go from here stop standing 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.380
 i don't want a thread on a thread with us 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.530
 already have a label in fact a pan and 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:38.400
 magician too 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:41.370
 Castillo pan yes of course the purpose I 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.410
 I guess this is a hint that the wizard 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.160
 without any crutches hard 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.680
 52,000 is too heavy to play with now 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:53.010
 play for all classes it turns out that 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.530
 castillo need everywhere not only on 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.430
 sorcerers unfortunately yes and electric shock 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.190
 at 26 percent 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.860
 hit points is an unpleasant situation but 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.250
 tolerated 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.489
 kill or at least try to kill became 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.440
 to 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.750
 and you know it turns out quite quickly 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.260
 all the priest took away the torch we can it 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.450
 see 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.859
 although there seems to be the first now 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.739
 I appeared quickly and blinks but I 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.510
 I am in a bucket as it is not 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.530
 paradoxically who is there becoming the world from 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.620
 a thief and who is hyper that it looks like a tenant 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:31.200
 already all death mark is over 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.240
 this battle has passed two calves to me 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.610
 I didn't have to do anything. 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:39.330
 ran clearly entertained smart food though 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.250
 I would bang course meal to 600 gold coins 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.380
 pleases my bag 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.330
 by the way I will ask to notice the enemy 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.430
 the team has banged one of the tags 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.070
 I didn't even give it any 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.370
 Values Well, dear friends, I think 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.090
