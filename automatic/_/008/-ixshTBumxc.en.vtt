00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 hallelujah my viewers play with you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.740
 jesus is the best player in the last two 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.190
 thousands of years and in this video I wanted 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.070
 show you all how to lower or 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.969
 understate the car even lower than that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.080
 permissible 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.480
 tuning and how to open the hood well 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.490
 for example in order to do some 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.130
 cool pictures at gatherings 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.890
 so in order to perform the first 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.009
 grech you must necessarily have 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.710
 imagine a micro pp with a silencer this 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.290
 mandatory condition further just 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.300
 choose the car you want 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.190
 underestimate yourself and just start 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.190
 shoot right at the center of the wheel 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.170
 that's how I do it now and you will see 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.170
 that car gradually in this place 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.989
 from this side will fall 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.440
 down also make sure that you do not break through 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.600
 tire and be sure you should know 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.480
 what if you have bullets resistant 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.350
 tire you will not work not 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.510
 this glitch will work perfectly here 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.280
 see what I got the result before and 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.280
 after now you see the car before 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.020
 now after the way i'm not sure about 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:24.570
 that does not work with every car I 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.479
 I know exactly what works with ordinary 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:31.200
 cars do not know jeep works or 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.300
 No, but who needs to lower the jeep 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.210
 the next sword is how to open the hood 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.220
 cars so as not to destroy it well 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.159
 look for that you need to take 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.590
 sniper rifle is very simple 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.560
 you need to take aim and start 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.840
 shoot in the hood and where exactly instead 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.210
 which is as close as possible 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.890
 to the windshield for example for this 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.830
 cars this place turned 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.930
 straight middle of the hood you will see that as 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.229
 only you got to the right place hood 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.119
 open slightly and then shoot again 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.660
 and the final hood will open further 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.729
 get in the car and press the gas and you 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.950
 you will see that he starts to open up 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.580
 once again I would like to repeat and say 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.230
 what for example for different cars 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.450
 need to shoot at different places for example i 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.970
 style see in the center of the hood for 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.820
 most other cars it can 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.100
 turn up the corners of the hood that is the place 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.900
 near the windshield just the corners and so 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.420
 friends are very glad that you watched it 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.390
 the video would also very much like you 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.000
 put a thumbs up on this video you 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.620
 can tell for example your friends 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.970
 about the fact that you know this way 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.070
 show them this video and wish you all 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:51.049
 have a good day 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.049
 hallelujah from the mouth of all loves
