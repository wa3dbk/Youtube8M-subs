00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:03.669
 for 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.000
 Spain indicates regret said these areas 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.159
 they stayed later 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:21.079
 good harvest as the idea of ​​cycling in the master arises 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.319
 and this is just the most common 

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:28.509
 personal entrepreneurship but that at the beginning it was like at jovi level 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.939
 came against the issue is that of the environmental problem 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.470
 and leisure cutting sustainable technologies Mendes has interested that energy 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.890
 renewable plus materials 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.970
 that can be sustainable 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.010
 and good there 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.180
 in a moment the possibility arose I felt like in the first yes 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.950
 build i do 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.190
 of a bicycle and do not come 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.390
 later they told me not rather to the possibility of making it mambo 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.020
 it's like visitors to take shape 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.110
 the idea has been an enterprise that fits the behavior 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.700
 theories that came 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.500
 studying 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.250
 this was not the first carmen prototype but it is 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.650
 you are the fifth the sixth but I was throwing two models new designs 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.320
 compare and explore what the sports material after 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.140
 depending on what is the bicycle and the union the power 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.290
 extrapolate for other types of constructions 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.900
 and successes brings us experience in the world people who make ramón bicycles 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.630
 cecilia stop being the inventor 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.990
 the very idea had taken him from the internet that he had seen a photo 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.280
 with the design in the United States there is a reference 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.340
 Rate and kalfin 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.960
 who has been developing bike models for several years that are 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.220
 basic route 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.800
 about what I wanted to expect new design and contained by the process itself 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.900
 yes i had to go 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.750
 working on investigating that as you're supposed to do not trying with 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.160
 what is available 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.590
 valley and in rosario know to see some bicycles bouquet by the street freese there 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.180
 bicycles are within the circle of 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.020
 of paternal friends and family well controlled because they are in 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.919
 experimental stage 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.459
 Likewise, a sense of resistance has been selected and in 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.349
 him in the inti national technological institute trial 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.619
 scared and pedro agenda and the program quality and sustainable technology 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.859
 What we are trying to do is make these technologies 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:26.019
 sustainable 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.250
 be accessible to people with people adopt them 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.439
 and you can implement them for your 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:35.789
 technological solutions everyday I know what a bicycle like 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.859
 also other types of structures here we are seeing structures at a 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.989
 housing construction 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.999
 and good to go in that state just trying 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.579
 and it's worth the cost here the mountain to go pulling a bit of because the feeling 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.249
 laboratories and Hebrew I think it takes the things you have to try it using the 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.639
 and until now working well 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.459
 I have my mind set 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.790
 good many grace fran accompanied integral graziano 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.309
 this work itself 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:19.469
 p 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:25.369
 the whistleblower for these crimes for 1 year is not true
