drawings in flash and it's one technique
of<00:00:04.770> many<00:00:06.740> I'm<00:00:07.740> gonna<00:00:07.980> start<00:00:08.250> with<00:00:08.400> a<00:00:08.429> drawing

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
of many I'm gonna start with a drawing

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.780 
of many I'm gonna start with a drawing
here<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.690> was<00:00:09.809> basically<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.349> 3d<00:00:10.800> image<00:00:11.160> of<00:00:11.610> a

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
here it was basically a 3d image of a

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.100 
here it was basically a 3d image of a
treasure<00:00:12.030> chest<00:00:12.179> let's<00:00:12.630> say<00:00:12.750> I'm<00:00:12.809> doing<00:00:12.900> a

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
treasure chest let's say I'm doing a

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.660 
treasure chest let's say I'm doing a
flash<00:00:13.380> game<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.889> I<00:00:13.920> want<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.400> treasure

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
flash game and I want to have a treasure

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.180 
flash game and I want to have a treasure
chest<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.120> my<00:00:15.240> game<00:00:15.650> what<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.680> would<00:00:16.890> do<00:00:16.980> is<00:00:17.100> I

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
chest in my game what I would do is I

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.279 
chest in my game what I would do is I
would<00:00:17.220> put<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.210> its<00:00:18.359> own<00:00:18.480> layer<00:00:18.720> here<00:00:19.080> and

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
would put it on its own layer here and

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.380 
would put it on its own layer here and
then<00:00:19.859> it<00:00:19.949> would<00:00:20.039> lock<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.609> layer<00:00:20.670> so<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.330> I

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
then it would lock that layer so that I

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.179 
then it would lock that layer so that I
can't<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.320> know<00:00:22.410> mess<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.800> up

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
can't you know mess it up

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.730 
can't you know mess it up
then<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.939> would<00:00:24.060> add<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> new<00:00:24.510> layer<00:00:24.750> here<00:00:25.140> you

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
then I would add a new layer here you

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.250 
then I would add a new layer here you
know<00:00:25.830> by<00:00:26.460> clicking<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.970> plus<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:28.050> new

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
know by clicking the plus which is a new

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.070 
know by clicking the plus which is a new
layer<00:00:28.470> option<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.539> I'm<00:00:30.539> gonna<00:00:30.810> use<00:00:31.050> that

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
layer option and I'm gonna use that

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.280 
layer option and I'm gonna use that
layer<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:32.279> draw<00:00:32.579> on<00:00:32.880> this<00:00:33.120> layer<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:34.110> I'm<00:00:34.170> going

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
layer to draw on this layer so I'm going

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.229 
layer to draw on this layer so I'm going
to<00:00:34.350> start<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> line<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.940> know<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.059> can

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
to start with a line and you know I can

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.690 
to start with a line and you know I can
pick<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.420> color<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.200> can<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.770> maybe<00:00:38.460> on

to now draw more freehand see how it's

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.069 
to now draw more freehand see how it's
not<00:01:27.630> locking<00:01:27.900> into<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.409> points<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:30.079> click

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
wanted to kind of have a little bit of a

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.550 
wanted to kind of have a little bit of a
hand<00:02:02.400> made<00:02:02.640> kind<00:02:02.940> of<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.090> look<00:02:03.300> if<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:04.170> makes

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
hand made kind of a look if that makes

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.710 
hand made kind of a look if that makes
sense<00:02:06.530> go<00:02:07.530> here<00:02:08.070> and<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:09.119> think<00:02:09.360> I'm<00:02:09.479> just<00:02:09.570> gonna

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
sense go here and I think I'm just gonna

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.940 
sense go here and I think I'm just gonna
draw<00:02:09.990> as<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.380> it's<00:02:10.530> closed<00:02:12.590> which<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.740> gonna<00:02:13.860> be

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
draw as if it's closed which is gonna be

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.470 
draw as if it's closed which is gonna be
kind<00:02:14.100> of<00:02:14.280> interesting<00:02:14.790> since<00:02:14.970> I'm<00:02:15.150> trying<00:02:15.360> to

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
kind of interesting since I'm trying to

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.350 
kind of interesting since I'm trying to
trace<00:02:15.690> but<00:02:16.020> we'll<00:02:17.010> go<00:02:17.160> for<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.430> anyway

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.240 

all<00:02:21.360> right<00:02:21.660> I'm<00:02:22.080> gonna<00:02:22.260> draw<00:02:22.440> across<00:02:22.710> the<00:02:23.010> top

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
all right I'm gonna draw across the top

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.740 
all right I'm gonna draw across the top
and<00:02:24.980> whoops

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
and whoops

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.940 
and whoops
maybe<00:02:27.750> I'm<00:02:27.900> just<00:02:28.110> draw<00:02:28.320> this<00:02:28.470> line<00:02:28.710> all<00:02:28.860> the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
maybe I'm just draw this line all the

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.110 
maybe I'm just draw this line all the
way<00:02:29.040> across<00:02:29.280> as<00:02:29.640> well<00:02:31.550> we<00:02:32.550> can<00:02:32.700> always<00:02:32.940> edit

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
way across as well we can always edit

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.449 
way across as well we can always edit
this<00:02:33.360> later<00:02:34.880> okay<00:02:36.140> and<00:02:37.140> basically<00:02:38.130> if<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.340> was

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
this later okay and basically if I was

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.400 
this later okay and basically if I was
hot<00:02:38.610> if<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.850> had<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.120> bottom<00:02:39.390> layer<00:02:39.570> now<00:02:39.840> I've

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
hot if I had the bottom layer now I've

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.150 
hot if I had the bottom layer now I've
got<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.920> shape<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:42.140> I<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.440> use<00:02:43.590> my<00:02:43.620> pencil

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
got that shape and I can use my pencil

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.090 
got that shape and I can use my pencil
tool<00:02:46.280> to<00:02:47.280> kind<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.520> draw<00:02:47.730> up<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.090> around<00:02:49.100> now

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
tool to kind of draw up and around now

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.290 
tool to kind of draw up and around now
you<00:02:50.190> can<00:02:50.310> see<00:02:50.430> how<00:02:50.520> it's<00:02:50.670> all<00:02:50.730> kind<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.060> choppy

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
you can see how it's all kind of choppy

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.620 
you can see how it's all kind of choppy
there<00:02:51.650> blocky<00:02:52.650> if<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.520> check<00:02:53.790> this<00:02:53.820> box<00:02:54.360> and

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
there blocky if I check this box and

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.560 
there blocky if I check this box and
turn<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:54.989> smooth<00:02:55.440> and<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.130> draw<00:02:56.400> my<00:02:56.580> curve<00:02:59.570> it

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
turn it to smooth and I draw my curve it

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.530 
turn it to smooth and I draw my curve it
smoothes<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.260> out<00:03:01.410> for<00:03:01.680> me<00:03:01.830> not<00:03:02.700> perfectly<00:03:03.269> but

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
smoothes it out for me not perfectly but

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.650 
smoothes it out for me not perfectly but
whoops<00:03:04.410> that's<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.890> really<00:03:05.100> bad<00:03:05.250> one<00:03:05.600> but<00:03:06.600> you

all right now let me go ahead and do

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.380 
all right now let me go ahead and do
another<00:03:57.739> line<00:03:58.040> across<00:03:58.340> just<00:03:58.879> because<00:03:59.120> I<00:03:59.209> want

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
another line across just because I want

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.759 
another line across just because I want
one<00:03:59.540> line<00:03:59.719> it's<00:03:59.870> kind<00:04:00.109> of<00:04:00.170> straight<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:00.709> it

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
one line it's kind of straight so it

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.459 
one line it's kind of straight so it
gives<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.010> impression<00:04:01.909> that's<00:04:02.719> curved<00:04:03.170> and

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:03.469 
gives that impression that's curved and

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:13.089 
gives that impression that's curved and
then<00:04:04.370> some<00:04:05.180> lines<00:04:05.359> across<00:04:05.510> here<00:04:06.290> I<00:04:12.040> feel<00:04:13.040> a

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
then some lines across here I feel a

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.500 
then some lines across here I feel a
little<00:04:13.220> silly<00:04:13.489> tracing<00:04:14.030> something<00:04:14.390> while

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:14.510 
little silly tracing something while

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.810 
little silly tracing something while
people<00:04:14.780> watch<00:04:14.930> me<00:04:15.170> but<00:04:15.379> you<00:04:16.130> know<00:04:16.220> I<00:04:16.459> think
