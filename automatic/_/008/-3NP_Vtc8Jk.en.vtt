00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.870 

the<00:00:15.920> Duncan<00:00:16.340> loop<00:00:17.920> there's<00:00:18.920> times<00:00:19.279> when<00:00:19.730> I'm

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:19.880 
the Duncan loop there's times when I'm

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.990 
the Duncan loop there's times when I'm
fishing<00:00:20.119> that<00:00:20.810> I<00:00:21.259> don't<00:00:21.919> want<00:00:22.130> a<00:00:22.220> knot<00:00:22.460> that<00:00:22.789> is

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
fishing that I don't want a knot that is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.420 
fishing that I don't want a knot that is
going<00:00:23.419> to<00:00:23.480> be<00:00:23.660> close<00:00:24.349> up<00:00:24.590> to<00:00:24.829> the<00:00:24.950> eye<00:00:24.980> of<00:00:25.099> the

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:25.430 
going to be close up to the eye of the

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.720 
going to be close up to the eye of the
fly<00:00:25.579> like<00:00:26.419> this<00:00:26.630> clinch<00:00:26.990> knot<00:00:27.110> right<00:00:27.500> here<00:00:27.740> so

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
fly like this clinch knot right here so

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.509 
fly like this clinch knot right here so
one<00:00:29.449> of<00:00:29.480> the<00:00:29.599> reasons<00:00:29.960> is<00:00:30.140> because<00:00:30.400> when<00:00:31.400> I'm

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
one of the reasons is because when I'm

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.540 
one of the reasons is because when I'm
fishing<00:00:31.699> larger<00:00:32.210> flies<00:00:32.449> say<00:00:32.809> streamers<00:00:33.550> or

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
fishing larger flies say streamers or

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.720 
fishing larger flies say streamers or
leech<00:00:34.790> patterns<00:00:35.330> or<00:00:36.019> big<00:00:36.260> nymphs<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:36.920> lot<00:00:37.610> of

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
leech patterns or big nymphs a lot of

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.160 
leech patterns or big nymphs a lot of
times<00:00:38.320> while<00:00:39.320> I'm<00:00:39.470> casting<00:00:40.070> this<00:00:40.900> knot<00:00:41.900> right

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
times while I'm casting this knot right

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.079 
times while I'm casting this knot right
here<00:00:42.440> because<00:00:42.739> it's<00:00:42.920> so<00:00:43.129> tight<00:00:43.430> on<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.730> eye<00:00:43.760> of

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
here because it's so tight on the eye of

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.770 
here because it's so tight on the eye of
the<00:00:44.239> fly<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:45.890> knot<00:00:46.129> itself<00:00:46.700> will<00:00:47.030> stay<00:00:47.270> here

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
the fly the knot itself will stay here

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.319 
the fly the knot itself will stay here
but<00:00:48.410> as<00:00:48.559> we're<00:00:48.739> casting<00:00:49.370> right<00:00:49.850> where<00:00:50.090> the

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
but as we're casting right where the

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.100 
but as we're casting right where the
line<00:00:51.199> right<00:00:51.440> there<00:00:51.710> it<00:00:52.670> will<00:00:52.879> start<00:00:53.239> to<00:00:53.449> hinge

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
line right there it will start to hinge

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.590 
line right there it will start to hinge
back<00:00:54.440> and<00:00:54.680> forth<00:00:54.949> so<00:00:55.820> it's<00:00:56.149> kind<00:00:56.360> of<00:00:56.420> like<00:00:56.570> a

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
back and forth so it's kind of like a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.020 
back and forth so it's kind of like a
piece<00:00:56.899> of<00:00:56.930> wire<00:00:57.680> the<00:00:58.250> more<00:00:58.430> times<00:00:58.699> that<00:00:58.910> you

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
piece of wire the more times that you

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.700 
piece of wire the more times that you
bend<00:00:59.329> it<00:00:59.480> back<00:00:59.629> and<00:00:59.870> forth<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:00.289> weaker<00:01:00.680> it

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
bend it back and forth the weaker it

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.570 
bend it back and forth the weaker it
gets<00:01:01.149> so<00:01:02.149> also<00:01:03.109> to<00:01:03.170> another<00:01:03.920> reason<00:01:04.369> and

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
gets so also to another reason and

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.109 
gets so also to another reason and
probably<00:01:05.269> more<00:01:05.479> importantly<00:01:06.080> is<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:07.130> I<00:01:07.580> want

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
probably more importantly is that I want

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.190 
probably more importantly is that I want
my<00:01:08.149> fly<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:09.490> present<00:01:10.490> itself<00:01:10.789> differently<00:01:11.330> so

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
my fly to present itself differently so

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.010 
my fly to present itself differently so
the<00:01:12.860> only<00:01:12.950> movement<00:01:13.789> or<00:01:13.940> articulation<00:01:14.690> that

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
the only movement or articulation that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.200 
the only movement or articulation that
we<00:01:15.170> have<00:01:15.380> from<00:01:15.740> this<00:01:15.920> fly<00:01:16.250> is<00:01:16.580> by<00:01:17.150> the

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
we have from this fly is by the

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.420 
we have from this fly is by the
suppleness<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:18.140> our<00:01:18.350> leader<00:01:18.590> or<00:01:18.860> our<00:01:19.009> tippet

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
suppleness of our leader or our tippet

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.789 
suppleness of our leader or our tippet
in<00:01:20.180> other<00:01:20.330> words<00:01:20.570> it<00:01:20.810> doesn't<00:01:21.049> dangle<00:01:21.590> very

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
in other words it doesn't dangle very

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.880 
in other words it doesn't dangle very
much<00:01:22.070> so<00:01:22.580> on<00:01:22.939> NIM<00:01:23.630> fishing<00:01:24.110> has<00:01:24.409> is<00:01:24.560> coming

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
much so on NIM fishing has is coming

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.490 
much so on NIM fishing has is coming
through<00:01:25.100> I<00:01:25.490> want<00:01:26.150> it<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.420> look<00:01:26.600> as<00:01:26.810> natural<00:01:27.049> as

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
through I want it to look as natural as

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
through I want it to look as natural as
possible<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.299> Duncan<00:01:29.780> loop<00:01:30.020> is<00:01:30.259> or<00:01:30.860> an<00:01:31.040> open

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
possible so a Duncan loop is or an open

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.480 
possible so a Duncan loop is or an open
loop<00:01:31.729> knot<00:01:32.240> would<00:01:33.079> be<00:01:33.200> one<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.650> my<00:01:33.890> choices

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
loop knot would be one of my choices

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.810 
loop knot would be one of my choices
the<00:01:35.420> Duncan<00:01:35.780> loop<00:01:38.829> this<00:01:39.829> knot<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.280> probably

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
the Duncan loop this knot is probably

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.660 
the Duncan loop this knot is probably
going<00:01:40.939> to<00:01:41.030> take<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.270> little<00:01:41.600> practice<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.200> learn

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
them clip your tag end I liked again

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.390 
them clip your tag end I liked again
leave<00:04:05.579> sixteenth<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.359> an<00:04:06.479> inch<00:04:06.599> or<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.250> so<00:04:08.250> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
leave sixteenth of an inch or so so the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.369

come<00:04:10.620> undone<00:04:11.959> reason<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:13.229> this<00:04:13.440> is

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
come undone reason I like this is

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.069 
come undone reason I like this is
because<00:04:13.889> it<00:04:14.010> gives<00:04:14.159> that<00:04:14.760> that<00:04:15.000> nymph<00:04:15.599> or<00:04:15.840> that

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
because it gives that that nymph or that

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.879 
because it gives that that nymph or that
streamer<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.250> lot<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:18.030> nice<00:04:18.680> articulation<00:04:19.680> and

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
streamer a lot of nice articulation and

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.500 
streamer a lot of nice articulation and
movement<00:04:20.340> in<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.609> natural<00:04:21.060> flow<00:04:21.299> of<00:04:21.329> the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
movement in the natural flow of the

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.580 
movement in the natural flow of the
water<00:04:22.460> the<00:04:23.460> Dunkin<00:04:23.849> loop<00:04:24.349> another<00:04:25.349> nice

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
water the Dunkin loop another nice

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.290 
water the Dunkin loop another nice
advantage<00:04:26.159> of<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.430> Dunkin<00:04:26.820> loop<00:04:27.000> is

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
advantage of the Dunkin loop is

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.240 
advantage of the Dunkin loop is
especially<00:04:27.960> when<00:04:28.289> I'm<00:04:28.440> fishing<00:04:28.620> for<00:04:28.830> bigger

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
especially when I'm fishing for bigger

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.990 
especially when I'm fishing for bigger
fish<00:04:29.370> and<00:04:29.960> on<00:04:30.960> a<00:04:31.349> tight<00:04:31.830> line

fish and on a tight line

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.130 
fish and on a tight line
the<00:04:33.120> fish<00:04:33.750> often<00:04:34.410> will<00:04:34.560> hit<00:04:34.800> so<00:04:35.040> hard<00:04:35.280> that

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
the fish often will hit so hard that

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.990 
the fish often will hit so hard that
they'll<00:04:37.140> actually<00:04:37.440> break<00:04:37.890> my<00:04:38.130> fly<00:04:38.400> off<00:04:38.640> if<00:04:38.820> I'm

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
they'll actually break my fly off if I'm

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.900 
they'll actually break my fly off if I'm
using<00:04:39.410> say<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.440> clinch<00:04:40.980> knot<00:04:41.070> or<00:04:41.460> an<00:04:41.550> improved

using say a clinch knot or an improved
clinch<00:04:42.380> so<00:04:43.380> in<00:04:44.160> your<00:04:44.490> trial<00:04:44.820> or<00:04:45.180> in<00:04:45.630> your

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
clinch so in your trial or in your

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.680 
clinch so in your trial or in your
Duncan<00:04:46.830> loop<00:04:47.040> by<00:04:47.640> determining<00:04:48.210> how<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.390> size

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
Duncan loop by determining how to size

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.230 
Duncan loop by determining how to size
up<00:04:48.960> your<00:04:49.110> loop<00:04:49.350> you<00:04:50.250> can<00:04:50.430> set<00:04:50.640> your<00:04:50.760> loop<00:04:51.000> it

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
up your loop you can set your loop it

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.590 
up your loop you can set your loop it
slides<00:04:51.600> so<00:04:52.230> what<00:04:53.130> I'll<00:04:53.250> do<00:04:53.430> a<00:04:53.460> lot<00:04:53.760> is<00:04:54.150> I'll

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
slides so what I'll do a lot is I'll

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.830 
slides so what I'll do a lot is I'll
leave<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:55.170> loop<00:04:56.010> like<00:04:56.190> such<00:04:56.580> without<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.630> tag

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
leave a loop like such without the tag

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.140 
leave a loop like such without the tag
and<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.230> course<00:04:58.440> I'll<00:04:58.680> clip<00:04:58.950> it<00:04:59.130> off<00:04:59.310> but<00:05:00.060> I'll

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
and of course I'll clip it off but I'll

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.990 
and of course I'll clip it off but I'll
leave<00:05:00.270> an<00:05:00.510> open<00:05:00.870> loop<00:05:01.050> like<00:05:01.320> that<00:05:01.370> now<00:05:02.370> when<00:05:02.820> my

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
leave an open loop like that now when my

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.090 
leave an open loop like that now when my
fish<00:05:03.830> takes<00:05:04.830> my<00:05:05.040> fly<00:05:05.340> as<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:06.840> shock<00:05:07.320> absorber<00:05:07.980> or

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
a little bit of it will just slide down

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.170 
a little bit of it will just slide down
to<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.620> knot<00:05:14.360> so<00:05:16.460> another<00:05:17.460> another<00:05:17.880> nice
