00:00:10.568 --> 00:00:12.225
 BERTA: Where have you been going all day? 

00:00:12.827 --> 00:00:13.474
 IAGO: I have something. 

00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:19.286
 BERTA: Is there something? What about the stationery store? Do you think you can leave your job and leave it, and pretend to be nothing? 

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:20.481
 IAGO: Mom, let's talk later. I will go back to the house first... 

00:00:21.149 --> 00:00:23.403
 BERTA: No, I didn't explain things clearly, you can't think about going away. 

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:28.908
 IAGO: I want to be alone. In short, when CLARA comes back, I will apologize to her. 

00:00:29.355 --> 00:00:30.465
 BERTA: I am not talking about this. 

00:00:31.712 --> 00:00:32.462
 IAGO: What is it? 

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:40.129
 BERTA: CLARA says you are a comrade. I certainly don't believe her, because... if you are, I should have known it... 

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.886
 BERTA: Right? IAGO? 

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:49.385
 IAGO: CLARA is telling the truth. 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.558
 BERTA: Impossible... What time is it? 

00:01:02.912 --> 00:01:04.062
 IAGO: It has always been a thing. 

00:01:07.914 --> 00:01:16.673
 BERTA: No, it doesn't make sense at all. You used to have a girlfriend, and there are many girls who like you. 

00:01:17.374 --> 00:01:21.942
 IAGO: I was still ignorant and didn't know what I wanted. When I figured it out, it was the period when you were locked in prison. 

00:01:24.502 --> 00:01:25.656
 BERTA: Then when are you going to tell me? 

00:01:27.503 --> 00:01:28.756
 IAGO: I don't know if you can accept it. 

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:31.611
 IAGO: Mom, please. 

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:34.262
 BERTA: How can you bear it! 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:36.715
 IAGO: I knew you would have a big reaction, I don't admit it. 

00:01:37.072 --> 00:01:38.024
 BERTA: You don't understand at all! 

00:01:39.618 --> 00:01:45.832
 BERTA: I don't care if you are a comrade. I care more about why I am so stupid. 

00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:47.330
 IAGO: Mom. 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.483
 BERTA: Yesterday I told you the biggest secret of my life... 

00:01:52.828 --> 00:02:02.408
 BERTA: I have always been proud of you. I thought we could share everything, we could trust each other, and there was no secret between them... 

00:02:02.952 --> 00:02:03.958
 BERTA: I don't know you... 

00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:11.870
 BERTA: Tell me honestly, what else do you hide from me? 

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:13.518
 IAGO: Mom, what do you mean? 

00:02:14.222 --> 00:02:16.672
 BERTA: I have been out of prison so far, you have been lying. 

00:02:17.576 --> 00:02:23.840
 BERTA: You said that you are working in the factory. You said that you have changed your mind and corrected, but none of them is true. Now even this should lie to me? 

00:02:25.472 --> 00:02:26.327
 IAGO: Everything is now plain. 

00:02:27.928 --> 00:02:28.778
 BERTA: I don't believe you. 

00:02:32.246 --> 00:02:33.194
 IAGO: Mom, please. 

00:02:33.701 --> 00:02:39.756
 BERTA: Whenever I feel that I am getting to know you, there will always be things that make me realize that I don't know you at all. 

00:02:40.854 --> 00:02:44.263
 BERTA: I only know that you are my son, but I don't know what kind of person you are. 

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:45.423
 IAGO: Mom, please don't be like this. 

00:02:52.562 --> 00:02:56.720
 CLARA: Good morning. I am going to find out the list of classified newspapers. Can you handle these lines for me? 

00:02:57.073 --> 00:02:57.876
 IAGO: I can't do it. 

00:02:58.725 --> 00:03:02.080
 CLARA: In this case... you will do it later, but we have to deal with the books and magazines that are to be returned. 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:03.934
 IAGO: CLARA, I want to ask you a question. 

00:03:05.872 --> 00:03:12.529
 IAGO: Have you trusted me from beginning to end? Even if it is a moment or a day. 

00:03:13.131 --> 00:03:13.937
 CLARA: What are you talking about? 

00:03:14.692 --> 00:03:15.485
 IAGO: What do you think? 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.594
 CLARA: We have a bunch of things to deal with, now it’s not about discussing these... 

00:03:18.896 --> 00:03:22.695
 IAGO: It's the right time. Your answer is no, right? You have never trusted me. 

00:03:23.145 --> 00:03:25.099
 CLARA: I have helped you so much. How can you fall over and say these words? 

00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:32.513
 IAGO: You helped me? CLARA, please don't laugh at my teeth! You didn't help me, what you did was to pay back your debts. 

00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:33.715
 CLARA: What is not important. 

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:39.723
 IAGO: Very important to me. I tried to change my evil spirits and be honest, but you never believed in me. 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.427
 CLARA: I am not like you said. 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:44.333
 IAGO: No? Then why are you spreading the past of criminals everywhere? 

00:03:46.606 --> 00:03:52.962
 IAGO: You just can't put away your prejudice against me. You have to tell MAX. Why do you interfere with my life? 

00:03:53.512 --> 00:03:59.531
 CLARA: You are wrong, I am not interfering with your life. On the contrary, I am caring about my son. Sorry, it’s hard to say, I don’t think you can afford my son. 

00:04:00.778 --> 00:04:05.393
 IAGO: I really don't understand what you think. I thought that you would understand the meaning of the second opportunity better than others. 

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:09.347
 CLARA: IAGO... 

00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:11.797
 IAGO: Since you are too busy, why not kill yourself in the stationery store! 

00:04:13.847 --> 00:04:14.805
 BERTA: You just let him go? 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.950
 CLARA: Otherwise, what do you want me to do? 

00:04:16.352 --> 00:04:18.804
 BERTA: I don't know. However, you should trust him from the beginning. 

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.667
 CLARA: I said everything that I said, why don't you persuade him? 

00:04:22.217 --> 00:04:26.265
 BERTA: How to persuade? Persuaded him to continue working with a boss who said he was a thief? 

00:04:26.515 --> 00:04:33.336
 CLARA: BERTA, you know I have done my best. It is one thing to give him a job at home. It is another thing to give him a chance to hurt MAX. 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.396
 BERTA: Do you assert that he will definitely hurt MAX in the future? 

00:04:36.397 --> 00:04:41.897
 CLARA: If MAX wants to interact with IAGO, he needs to know the background of IAGO and make the right decision. 

00:04:42.207 --> 00:04:44.202
 BERTA: Right. It’s just that you promised to help us before, but what you are doing now is exactly the opposite. 

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:49.122
 CLARA: BERTA, it’s unfair to me to say this. You want me to trust your son, but you can't even do it. 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:50.376
 BERTA: This has nothing to do with the relationship between the two of them. 

00:04:50.671 --> 00:04:55.882
 CLARA: It is related. He concealed his identity as a comrade. If he can do this for many years, he knows how much he can hide. 

00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:59.140
 BERTA: Even so, that's what happened between me and IAGO, you don't have to interfere. 

00:04:59.535 --> 00:05:01.792
 CLARA: You should know that I have been involved since the day you moved into my house. 

00:05:02.143 --> 00:05:03.641
 BERTA: I didn't move in as I knew it! 

00:05:08.804 --> 00:05:09.300
 BERTA: IAGO. 

00:05:09.907 --> 00:05:10.509
 IAGO: What? 

00:05:10.952 --> 00:05:11.610
 BERTA: Where are you going all day? 

00:05:12.255 --> 00:05:13.060
 IAGO: Do you still care? 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.357
 BERTA: Don't be like this, I am worried about you. 

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:17.818
 IAGO: Don't worry about you. You will be quiet in the future. 

00:05:18.111 --> 00:05:18.463
 BERTA: What do you mean by this? 

00:05:18.912 --> 00:05:19.570
 IAGO: I decided to leave here. 

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:21.904
 BERTA: Where are you going? 

00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:23.422
 IAGO: Plan again. 

00:05:24.411 --> 00:05:26.366
 BERTA: Don't mess around. Your home is here. 

00:05:26.962 --> 00:05:31.769
 IAGO: Is your so-called home living with you? CLARA is disgusted with me, you don't want to see me, is it a home? 

00:05:32.284 --> 00:05:36.535
 BERTA: You don't think I really don't want to see you. That's not what I meant. 

00:05:36.987 --> 00:05:37.645
 IAGO: It’s too late. 

00:05:38.591 --> 00:05:43.308
 BERTA: IAGO, wait! Please! 

00:05:47.662 --> 00:05:51.369
 JOTA: I thought you were no longer looking for me. Tell me, what is the wind blowing you? 

00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:52.477
 IAGO: You are right. 

00:05:53.295 --> 00:05:56.599
 JOTA: Which time have I been wrong? However, I don't understand what you are talking about? 

00:05:57.101 --> 00:05:58.298
 IAGO: I left home. 

00:05:58.651 --> 00:05:59.305
 JOTA: Just kidding! 

00:06:00.555 --> 00:06:06.814
 IAGO: I am fed up. Since they don't trust me, what am I still doing there? So I just left it. 

00:06:07.217 --> 00:06:08.112
 JOTA: Brother, this time you are playing really. 

00:06:08.863 --> 00:06:09.715
 IAGO: I really can't bear it. 

00:06:10.414 --> 00:06:14.774
 JOTA: I have already said that you are not suitable for playing cards. So what are your plans for now? 

00:06:15.873 --> 00:06:17.575
 IAGO: I want to live with you for the time being. 

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:22.889
 JOTA: You are terrible! Why don’t you have a place to stay, just find a girlfriend! 

00:06:23.688 --> 00:06:24.545
 IAGO: Are you promised? 

00:06:25.141 --> 00:06:28.193
 JOTA: Yes. However, my bed is very small, two people will be very sleepy, you have to find a place to move as soon as possible. 

00:06:28.795 --> 00:06:36.264
 IAGO: Rest assured, I will move away as soon as I have money. However, I am short of money now. What kind of work have you introduced recently? 

00:06:36.612 --> 00:06:37.460
 JOTA: You are very urgent! 

00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:39.163
 IAGO: I have no money at work now. 

00:06:40.724 --> 00:06:41.816
 JOTA: I currently have a special mission. 

00:06:42.917 --> 00:06:44.222
 IAGO: Good! Tell me the details. 

00:06:44.776 --> 00:06:53.045
 JOTA: Listen, this group of people is not a good man and a woman, and can't be offended. If you want me to count on you, then you must not let me down, otherwise the consequences will be disastrous! You can agree to me if you think about it. 

00:06:54.143 --> 00:06:58.102
 IAGO: Nothing to consider. Since they all think that I am a criminal, then I will be a veritable criminal! 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:06:59.101
 JOTA: Well said!
