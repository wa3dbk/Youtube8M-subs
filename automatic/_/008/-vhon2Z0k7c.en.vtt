 we are qualified really important for groomers two years in 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:03.199

 charaf and so we will deliver them his practical skills that's it 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.990
 obvious but in addition there are theoretical trainings 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.099
 they are a little less important to be a good professional 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.160
 for them I can give you some examples for example you have a 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.190
 training for 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.960
 hence his approach to the veterinarian there we will have notions about them the 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.280
 skin problems and take orange 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.939
 the eyes and we will be able to tell his client 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:47.779
 and well it's a big problem to be veterinary or vista 

00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:50.580
 does not matter I'll explain to you what you can do is when 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.680
 even something of it is very important to have this 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.360
 to have this opportunity to respond to customers so 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:00.080
 professional we also have behavioral trainings 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.770
 for this it is the collectors who have just had a small approach 

00:07:04.599 --> 00:07:07.580
 on them all these notions of behavior that is good for 100 th 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.490
 to have believed 

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.830
 to implement it ddd behavior of all the actors they 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.460
 are 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.149
