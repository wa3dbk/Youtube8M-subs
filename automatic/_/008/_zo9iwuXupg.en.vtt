00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.870 
caffeine I roll one now what this is is
then<00:00:10.510> eye<00:00:10.830> cream<00:00:11.830> but<00:00:12.370> it's<00:00:12.550> more<00:00:12.670> like<00:00:12.850> a

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880 
then eye cream but it's more like a

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.630 
then eye cream but it's more like a
liquid<00:00:13.240> I<00:00:13.330> guess<00:00:13.540> in<00:00:13.870> a<00:00:14.140> tube<00:00:14.440> you<00:00:15.250> apply<00:00:15.580> it

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.640 
liquid I guess in a tube you apply it

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.400 
liquid I guess in a tube you apply it
underneath<00:00:16.180> the<00:00:16.480> eye<00:00:16.510> and<00:00:16.840> it<00:00:16.930> has<00:00:17.110> a<00:00:17.140> little

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
underneath the eye and it has a little

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.550 
underneath the eye and it has a little
rollerball<00:00:17.950> at<00:00:18.370> the<00:00:18.520> end<00:00:18.700> of<00:00:18.850> it<00:00:18.970> so<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:20.410> way<00:00:20.530> I

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
rollerball at the end of it so the way I

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.220 
rollerball at the end of it so the way I
apply<00:00:20.980> it<00:00:21.100> is<00:00:21.430> normally<00:00:22.150> one<00:00:22.539> or<00:00:22.690> two<00:00:22.840> strokes

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
apply it is normally one or two strokes

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.740 
apply it is normally one or two strokes
depending<00:00:23.800> on<00:00:23.920> how<00:00:24.070> much<00:00:24.220> I<00:00:24.430> need<00:00:24.670> that<00:00:25.600> will

I fine works the best to me the
consistency<00:00:45.249> it's<00:00:45.519> quite<00:00:46.420> nice<00:00:46.569> it's<00:00:46.989> very

it's<00:00:50.379> drying<00:00:50.739> but<00:00:51.100> it's<00:00:51.280> not<00:00:51.489> uncomfortable

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
it's drying but it's not uncomfortable

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.009

or unpleasant at all it claims that it

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.200 
or unpleasant at all it claims that it
helps<00:00:56.440> reduce<00:00:56.589> puffiness<00:00:56.979> and<00:00:57.460> under-eye

helps reduce puffiness and under-eye
dark<00:00:58.629> circles<00:00:59.109> I<00:00:59.350> haven't<00:01:00.309> seen<00:01:00.459> any<00:01:00.670> change

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
dark circles I haven't seen any change

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.569 
dark circles I haven't seen any change
at<00:01:01.209> all<00:01:01.329> to<00:01:01.989> my<00:01:02.170> dark<00:01:02.559> circles<00:01:02.979> they're<00:01:03.370> still

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
at all to my dark circles they're still

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.240 
at all to my dark circles they're still
there<00:01:03.789> they're<00:01:04.030> still<00:01:04.390> as<00:01:04.510> bad<00:01:04.690> as<00:01:04.839> they<00:01:04.960> were

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
there they're still as bad as they were

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.770 
there they're still as bad as they were
um<00:01:06.250> so<00:01:06.729> I<00:01:06.759> haven't<00:01:07.030> really<00:01:07.240> noticed<00:01:07.329> any

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
um so I haven't really noticed any

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.810 
um so I haven't really noticed any
change<00:01:08.049> there<00:01:08.409> so<00:01:09.009> I<00:01:09.039> don't<00:01:09.399> think<00:01:09.520> it<00:01:09.700> does

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
change there so I don't think it does

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.899 
change there so I don't think it does
that<00:01:10.149> as<00:01:11.079> far<00:01:11.259> as<00:01:11.289> puffiness<00:01:11.979> goes<00:01:12.070> in<00:01:12.549> the

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:12.909 
that as far as puffiness goes in the

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.130 
that as far as puffiness goes in the
mornings<00:01:13.270> I<00:01:13.420> can<00:01:13.570> definitely<00:01:13.689> tell<00:01:14.049> the

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
mornings I can definitely tell the

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.620 
mornings I can definitely tell the
difference<00:01:14.170> after<00:01:14.979> I've<00:01:15.070> used<00:01:15.369> this<00:01:15.640> not<00:01:16.359> only

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
difference after I've used this not only

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.230 
difference after I've used this not only
does<00:01:16.780> it<00:01:16.810> look<00:01:16.930> slightly<00:01:17.829> less<00:01:18.009> puffy<00:01:18.280> but<00:01:19.090> it

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
does it look slightly less puffy but it

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.200 
does it look slightly less puffy but it
actually<00:01:19.420> feels<00:01:19.869> refreshed<00:01:20.680> it<00:01:21.640> does<00:01:21.880> have<00:01:22.180> a

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
actually feels refreshed it does have a

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.569 
actually feels refreshed it does have a
very<00:01:22.479> very<00:01:22.630> cooling<00:01:23.439> sensation<00:01:23.740> when<00:01:24.460> you

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579 
very very cooling sensation when you

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.520 
very very cooling sensation when you
apply<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:24.939> to<00:01:25.090> the<00:01:25.210> skin<00:01:25.509> so<00:01:26.140> I<00:01:26.170> don't<00:01:26.409> know

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
apply it to the skin so I don't know

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.020 
apply it to the skin so I don't know
whether<00:01:26.710> or<00:01:26.799> not<00:01:26.890> that's<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.310> actual<00:01:27.670> formula

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
whether or not that's the actual formula

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.090 
whether or not that's the actual formula
or<00:01:28.840> if<00:01:29.079> it's<00:01:29.229> got<00:01:29.439> something<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.799> do<00:01:29.920> with<00:01:30.039> that

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
or if it's got something to do with that

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.539 
or if it's got something to do with that
little<00:01:30.340> cool<00:01:30.909> no<00:01:31.450> ball<00:01:32.009> applicator<00:01:33.009> at<00:01:33.340> the

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
little cool no ball applicator at the

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.940 
little cool no ball applicator at the
end<00:01:33.700> either<00:01:34.539> way<00:01:34.869> though<00:01:35.109> I<00:01:35.320> do<00:01:35.439> like<00:01:35.829> the

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
end either way though I do like the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.069 
end either way though I do like the
feeling<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.340> it<00:01:36.490> gives<00:01:36.700> on<00:01:36.909> my<00:01:37.539> eyes<00:01:37.689> in<00:01:38.049> the

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:38.079 
feeling that it gives on my eyes in the

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:40.440 
feeling that it gives on my eyes in the
morning<00:01:38.170> kind<00:01:39.100> of<00:01:39.219> just<00:01:39.340> peps<00:01:39.820> me<00:01:40.030> up<00:01:40.179> and

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
morning kind of just peps me up and

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.319 
morning kind of just peps me up and
wakes<00:01:40.659> me<00:01:40.899> up<00:01:40.929> a<00:01:41.140> little<00:01:41.259> bit<00:01:41.500> as<00:01:41.619> well<00:01:42.030> um<00:01:43.030> it

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
wakes me up a little bit as well um it

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.080 
wakes me up a little bit as well um it
does<00:01:43.600> help<00:01:44.439> with<00:01:44.799> certain<00:01:45.280> things<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.729> apply

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
does help with certain things to apply

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.810 
does help with certain things to apply
smoother<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.929> that<00:01:47.079> area<00:01:47.530> and<00:01:48.249> whether<00:01:48.549> or<00:01:48.729> not

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
smoother to that area and whether or not

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.300 
smoother to that area and whether or not
it<00:01:49.060> plumps<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:49.600> out<00:01:49.749> or<00:01:50.140> just<00:01:50.200> makes<00:01:51.130> it

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
it plumps it out or just makes it

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.880 
it plumps it out or just makes it
smoother<00:01:51.789> somehow<00:01:52.240> that<00:01:53.020> does<00:01:53.320> help<00:01:53.560> a<00:01:53.679> little

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
smoother somehow that does help a little

dark<00:02:12.599> circles<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.319> wouldn't<00:02:14.160> even<00:02:14.220> bother

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
dark circles I wouldn't even bother

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.030 
dark circles I wouldn't even bother
because<00:02:15.450> for<00:02:16.050> me<00:02:16.170> it's<00:02:16.560> done<00:02:16.800> absolutely

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
because for me it's done absolutely

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.729 
because for me it's done absolutely
nothing<00:02:17.400> for<00:02:17.880> my<00:02:18.000> dark<00:02:18.239> circles<00:02:18.750> but<00:02:19.410> I<00:02:19.440> still

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
nothing for my dark circles but I still

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.350 
nothing for my dark circles but I still
will<00:02:19.950> continue<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.520> use<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.060> I<00:02:21.120> probably

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
will continue to use this and I probably

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.780 
will continue to use this and I probably
will<00:02:21.720> repurchase<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.560> because<00:02:23.190> particularly

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
will repurchase it because particularly

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.250 
will repurchase it because particularly
in<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.000> summer<00:02:24.209> months<00:02:24.420> here<00:02:24.780> where<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.230> gets
