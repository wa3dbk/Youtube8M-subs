00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.830

 nice to meet you guys 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.820
 I am humberto gutiÃ©rrez consultant in 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.400
 strategic public image and reputation 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.230
 online and then today's advice is about 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.000
 of a subject that surely you have never 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.790
 put to think that it could include in your 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.040
 personal image and it's like unbuttoning 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.739
 The sack is not even like taking it off 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.410
 the little step before unbuttoning the 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.520
 I take out when you have some hands this 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.829
 video advice I'll show you how 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.420
 Unbuttoning the bag with one hand 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.460
 so you do not have this problem when 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.109
 you want to sit or for when you want 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.859
 grasping an object while the 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.910
 unbuttoning the bag is a little detail 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.890
 minimum but remember that the image 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.170
 personal the details are what 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.999
 accounts and I tell you the context is not 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.670
 I had happened to make this video but 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.289
 giving a course last week he told me 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.269
 a person who every time appointed 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.059
 something on the board or whatever 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.469
 what they did, they paid for this 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:04.360
 It will be very useful for you when you 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.100
 want to take a photograph embraced by 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.659
 someone already like you if you want to hug 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.120
 to someone or whatever it is that is 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.860
 pulling elsa councilor elsa who looks very 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.540
 therefore you want to hug someone 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.970
 in a photograph of that button tie the 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.620
 I take out and you can hug them you want to take 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.990
 seat remember the video in what you 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.490
 he said that when you sit down at some 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.890
 armchair or a chair you have to 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.320
 unbutton the sack of grass in the 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.750
 you will do it with one hand and 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.760
 you are going to take a seat therefore I have 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.130
 of recommendations to unbutton and 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.510
 button the sack of a proper era and 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.940
 modish 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.100
 well the recommendation is very simple 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.380
 to unbutton the sack with just one 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.630
 manga to start I'm going to suggest that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.850
 try it with the opposite hand to the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.530
 which is more skillful you write with the right 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.760
 what will he do with the left if you 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.310
 you write with the left you are going to do 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.800
 with the right hand with your hand less 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.290
 skillful are you going to do this process of 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.240
 sabotage and button the sack because 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.770
 because if you are greeting a person 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.540
 and at the same time you want to button it 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.490
 or you want to enter and you're 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.110
 supporting with your most skillful hand and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.179
 he just wants to sit down and 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.190
 unbutton the bag at the same time 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.370
 we will be able to achieve in our own way 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.870
 indicated way is something very simple you 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.670
 I'm going to say that you have to grab the 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.520
 part of the sack the part that is below 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.620
 of the flap with the full hand and to 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.770
 you want button 'you do not just have to 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.260
 pushing the button with your thumb is going to 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.930
 push down look how a 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.700
 little down and halo automatically 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.709
 the sack opens this is going to favor you 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.630
 a lot for when you want to get in 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.790
 fast way and you the only thing that you have 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.310
 what to do is that burning button and take 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.030
 you are going to button the sack 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.130
 exactly 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.290
 I'm going to repeat the process for 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.569
 unbutton you just grab the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.120
 bottom part of the flap with the hand 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.360
 complete and leave your thumb to push 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.060
 the button down and open it well 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.069
 Now that you have this recommendation 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.230
 the simplest is also going to be a button 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.430
 art what you know how it is to pay what 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.920
 quickly 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.200
 you're going to button it practically the same goes 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.900
 to be with the same hand for which you go 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.180
 to pull by hand on the side 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.739
 left of the sack and the side part 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.290
 right to put them together and have the 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:20.070
 control the only thing that remains is nothing else 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.260
 push with the ring the part of the 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.080
 button pushes it up and from that 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.370
 way will be buttoned that serves you for 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.360
 if we are bringing in the hand the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.910
 mobile 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.430
 you are bringing the keys you are bringing 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.930
 whatever it is in terms of one drink per 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.250
 example the recommendation that I'm going to 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.110
 give is that you always bring the drink with 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.640
 the left hand because suddenly 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.810
 you have to greet someone and if 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.390
 you greet someone there is nothing else 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.010
 unpleasant to bring wet hand 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.120
 then the drink will not go here but 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.640
 Well maybe you change hands 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.250
 the drink unbuttoned sauce with 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.750
 meats again and takes seat is a 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.790
 very simple recommendation but that you 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.069
 will help communicate an image of 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.040
 elite of sport leadership and of 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:01.200
 a lot of presence 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.879
