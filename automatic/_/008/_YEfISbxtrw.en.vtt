 girls of my age coming to 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.630
 meeting with bare shoulders 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.079
 if the weather allows it yes that is it 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 not winter and the second question is valid or 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.060
 cleavage 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.530
 you combine enough business blouse 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.210
 which of course is not enough jacket or 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.820
 something over because any business 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.070
 environment whether it be banks or it will not 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.320
 We know the institution some or it will 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.180
 just things in the office work involves 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.500
 the most basic rule is two layers a 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.659
 as for decalte 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.770
 I want to say that it is very important here 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.840
 learn the level of it until the end 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.070
 determine based on your natural 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.350
 harmony ie this action 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.630
 proportions which is 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.190
 nature is very easy to measure take 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.680
 these distances from the hairline to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.270
 chin and lower and chin down 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.130
 in this case , Elena is perfect 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.709
 cleavage 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.090
 watch as for shoes I turn your 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.830
 attention that of course she is also much 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.550
 how many and close any 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.709
 sandals 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.050

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:29.180
 heel will be open closed toe they 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.160
 open and close both yes 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.480
 surely 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.670
 most often enforcing strict 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.980
 dress code requires bank employees 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.900
 or large business organizations external 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.850
 the kind of workers have a big impact on 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.519
 company reputation and building 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.290
 customer relationship in business 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.450
 everyone should also have clear forms 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.250
 why do men wear suits because 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.640
 it gives a clear shape 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.800
 the lines 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.900
 likewise in girls hairstyles 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.230
 why not let on wide long 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.850
 hair because hair they are not here 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.100
 have a certain form demonstrate 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.410
 the beauty of ourselves therefore if here in our 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.600
 girls just take them a bunch or will remove 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.600
 hair back or make the premiere clearly 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.040
 executed haircut like how to call 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.140
 tatyana date will actually have 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.970
 significantly more business women difficult 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.829
 follow the rules of the dress code after all 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.840
 fashion trends often contradict 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.700
 business style to bring a touch 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.510
 piquancy worth turning to 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.730
 accessories 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.859
 I want to ask how much is in business 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.010
 style we admit and decorations how much 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:29.959
 acceptable and acceptable wearing sky something 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.820
 original gold silver or all the same 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.750
 jewelry can be used most 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.730
 formal style 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.400
 He talks about what you wear 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.890
 engagement ring and watch and everything and more 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.470
 nothing but we are there and no we 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.109
 did not write well, you can wear for example 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.000
 little gnomes and barely noticeable carnations 

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:47.750
 you can pearls but in no case 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.640
 diamonds 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.930
 if we have more in the holiday box 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.370
 event then we can afford 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.650
 string of pearls 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.400
 certainly better standing or suppose 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.680
 brooch 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.750
 That brooch can demonstrate of course 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.220
 status of festive events on 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.049
 but it must be visually very 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.359
 expensive most optimal clothes for 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.430
 office work is a classic suit 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:10.069
 need to remember he must include himself not 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.200
 more than three colors and two types of pattern 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.180
 need to get you relatively speaking 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.739
 ribbon for a long time as a male voice with 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.160
 which we will fold so we with 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.630
 you 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.630
 add it up like this 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.909
 men's dress code is usually more 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.249
 conservative than female but male 

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:40.349
 can also find room for fantasy and 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:42.029
 way to emphasize your individuality 

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.639
 it could be an original tie 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:45.120
 cufflinks bag watch or well seated 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.499
 suit 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.029
 What do you think helps if the image for 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:54.240
 to a man on the career ladder 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:58.759
 gone higher and higher of course look i would 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.759
 took the head and even so dressed 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.770
 American, as it were, this one here 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.060
 dress code idea american approaches 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.069
 they say that if you want 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.500
 reach looks like you already 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:12.629
 there is important here not to overdo it but 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.879
 the theme is good also alexander batova 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:16.469
 noted the importance of colors in the wardrobe 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:18.419
 so in the interior and 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.279
 corporate symbolism color has 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.150
 enormous influence on mood and 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:22.770
 perception 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.050
 so pay special attention 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.120
 the choice of individual colors 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.629
 As for color psychology , I want 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.699
 say that this topic is very important about it 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.319
 writes a lot but it's important to remember 

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:36.389
 that color is generally emotional perception 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.490
 flowers it is very individual 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:40.229
 someone loves red and can 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:42.240
 find in a room with a red sofa 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.650
 endlessly with red walls and in 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.189
 someone starts to get sick instantly 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:46.139
 head 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:47.490
 tattoo is thrilled this is orange here on 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:50.310
 the street we go out for the sum 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.529
 average residents love him business 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:54.779
 wardrobe is not a uniform not worth it 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:56.909
 to restrict the strict suits dark 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.860
 colors experiments with style always 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:01.020
 welcome the important thing not to break 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.689
 basic rules but despite the prevailing 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.610
 opinion that there are no men and women in business 

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:07.500
 we want to hope that in the future 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.550
 amendments to the business dress code for women 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.770
 yet a month
