00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.100
 Beauty talks, people are going to start another one. 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.740
 video here on the channel and in that video was 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.830
 girl 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.939
 but how to make a system a whip 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.580
 quite known as playing money 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.070
 by fishermen very easy to do 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.800
 with few materials for you to use 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:31.060
 in the small fishery 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.980
 there in your pond on the river or where you 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.309
 for fishing a very simple whip of 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.739
 do and fairly efficient ok guys 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:40.210
 so here's the structure and I put it here 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.199
 on the wall for you to see how it is 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.350
 stay 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:48.129
 Beauty I borrowed a green ribbon to stay in 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:52.739
 right position may come in detail 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:55.089
 so let's go to the video 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.470
 Good people, a triage that will need 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.030
 to do the sporting will have a piece 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.580
 line of approximately one meter and 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.350
 twenty to one and a half you can 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.229
 picking up a spool of an old ticket 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.570
 You do not use it so much, we'll need it. 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:11.350
 also with a medium-sized sun for 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.979
 small a generator and to finalize a 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.979
 lead 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.710
 Good, we'll do the assembly of the 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.179
 played had 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.619
 first you do not pick up a piece 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:22.060
 line of approximately one meter and 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.009
 twenty-five and a half as I had 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.689
 I said I got a yellow line. 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.250
 to get easier and you see 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.960
 view the video 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.780
 this line has a bit of memory in the 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.979
 truth until quite hours can see that 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.079
 she is well wrapped 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.450
 But it's okay, she'll give 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:40.600
 you understand how you make a 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.729
 so we'll start with 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.569
 the ends of the line first 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:49.630
 with rain and then with a hook says it 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.840
 generator is last as it is 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.579
 what is to start with the call is going to get a 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.950
 account of the line that people 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:02.200
 We're going to make that sauce for 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.409
 tie the lead here you can see 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.100
 than a very bright lead in the case of 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.310
 a polished one in it was well illustrated that 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.569
 prohibit then passed that the line makes a 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.850
 single quickie 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.560
 You already know how to do it if you do not 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.500
 I know I'll leave the video link 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.100
 in the description that teaches him to do teaching 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.100
 in detail 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.870
 there's going to be end here you come 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:38.959
 take a pair of scissors 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.290
 pliers and cuts the excess of 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:42.480
 beauty 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.519
 done that we'll have to go for a 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.049
 Hook the galley now 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:54.650
 then take another end there comes with 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.650
 the sun is the same in the eye in it 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:09.210
 grab the scissors and glue excess beauty 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.190
 you can see one end of the call the 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.870
 lead at the other end is the hook 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.130
 now he's going to have to split up 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:21.270
 here in the structure is in the line to form 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:25.170
 the whip we will check 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:28.230
 ok you will join the sink with 11 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.880
 sun and will pull here until she stays 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.120
 indicators can see that it has remained here 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.850
 So there's all this space here, but your 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.220
 Compliment of the whip ok is out of focus 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.310
 more beauty 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.140
 I'll do it now, it can not be like this. 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.870
 they will have to leave a little more 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.580
 above and do not wrap around the 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.489
 lead beauty 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:55.050
 so it's just more or less so the 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:56.580
 background has to be down there and one 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.140
 a little more so more or less 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.530
 here you put the lead and 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.700
 now will do that measurement of 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:10.860
 new 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.390
 This case is going to be here with beauty and 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.209
 When are you going to do this end here now? 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.840
 You'll knot to stay in the height. 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.989
 Sure the whip then just get it will give 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.260
 a blind knot here o help two will stay 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.260
 more reinforced 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:35.250
 pull there but you can see it 's a 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.200
 scott system that sells does not use 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.430
 material is only lead 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.500
 sometimes you do not even need to use 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:43.290
 is in an emergency situation. 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.110
 there is the biggest thing that only makes weight 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:50.370
 to throw and put the sun as well is 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.220
 an escort a simple materials system 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.200
 simple no need to use rotor 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.370
 missang these things that usually the 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:01.919
 whips but is sophisticated for fish 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.780
 to use all these accessories 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.270
 then what you have seen here is well 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.810
 simple as was the crowd was so 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.300
 o the lead and the hook and here the little one 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.070
 the big medium but it's a real size 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.440
 to use the fishery for the playoffs 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:21.460
 getting the line that like my arm 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.860
 right you can see that o Stretching 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:25.690
 the lead got a little more to itself 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.430
 that gave show was a little lower 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.660
 a little higher 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:34.450
 that way there's no way 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.980
 screwing at catch time hook 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.139
 Anything and everything. 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.760
 It will get a pretty penny 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.220
 great about a 30 40 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.700
 cm which can be seen that 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:51.160
 Legs already come out directly here on the other side 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:56.710
 Left schumi're here am sun is 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.870
 have in the simple and usual line here beauty 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.860
 Okay, now we have to do it alone. 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:07.090
 because the generator here passes the line through 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.760
 inside the generator pulls back there by 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.590
 inside 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:16.720
 Pull the operator down again. 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:18.370
 stuck here in the movie made little school 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.240
 is ready the galley scott is already 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.060
 ready 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.289
 You can see in the image I created with a 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:27.760
 very nice structure 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:29.890
 in the top generator the stride and the 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.720
 lead down it's quite simple you 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:34.360
 only use a piece of line one 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.910
 sink in a resort preference 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.580
 average small size is just for 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.650
 small fish spot fishing break 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.240
 twig for some emergency situation 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.630
 or even for you to use with 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.700
 A lightweight reel is a 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:51.900
 telescope worth something like one 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.320
 other light material ends up being well 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.470
 interesting 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:59.080
 this cut is system played as not 

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:01.600
 is known and by some fishermen ok 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.830
 so that was it, I hope you guys 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:05.500
 have enjoyed the tip 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.630
 In the video she forgot to click and I liked it 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.340
 to help outreach to help the 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.950
 also if you are not enrolled in the 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.560

 you fish some information also everything 

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:22.910
 related beauty is fishing and I will leave 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:26.090

 and if on Twitter for you to follow 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.040

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.450
 there real-time fishing in the 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.480
 instagram in the fish have some 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:37.760
 updates but a bit more 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.350
 it is interesting that sometimes can not really 

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.570
 post here on the channel because on the channel 

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:43.300

 stay on top of all the news 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.150
 I draw something of the kind that 

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.430
 Until then that was it. 

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:52.480
 we had the next video a big hug 

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.480
 and spoke
