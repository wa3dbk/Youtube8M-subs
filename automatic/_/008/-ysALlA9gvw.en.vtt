going<00:04:48.630> to<00:04:48.690> be<00:04:48.780> a<00:04:48.810> good<00:04:49.020> figure<00:04:49.289> I'd<00:04:49.590> actually

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
going to be a good figure I'd actually

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.310 
going to be a good figure I'd actually
put<00:04:50.190> it<00:04:50.280> on<00:04:50.340> my<00:04:50.520> list<00:04:50.789> as<00:04:51.120> the<00:04:51.690> ones<00:04:51.870> to<00:04:52.020> get<00:04:52.139> on
