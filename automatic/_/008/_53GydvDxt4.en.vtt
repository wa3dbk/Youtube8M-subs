heroes dead and Fox will also be brought

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.360 
heroes dead and Fox will also be brought
down<00:07:33.760> it's<00:07:34.300> a<00:07:34.450> five-man<00:07:34.990> wipe<00:07:35.230> I<00:07:35.560> ap<00:07:36.160> with<00:07:36.340> a

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.370 
down it's a five-man wipe I ap with a

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.000 
down it's a five-man wipe I ap with a
valiant<00:07:36.820> effort<00:07:36.970> here<00:07:37.570> but<00:07:38.170> nah<00:07:38.410> be<00:07:38.470> just<00:07:38.890> a

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.010 
valiant effort here but nah be just a

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.700 
valiant effort here but nah be just a
little<00:07:39.040> bit<00:07:39.430> too<00:07:40.240> much<00:07:40.510> firepower<00:07:40.900> in<00:07:41.470> the<00:07:41.560> end

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:41.710 
little bit too much firepower in the end

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.920 
little bit too much firepower in the end
they'll<00:07:41.980> take<00:07:42.190> this<00:07:42.400> game<00:07:42.610> they<00:07:43.390> to<00:07:43.450> all<00:07:43.810> the

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:43.930 
they'll take this game they to all the

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.710 
they'll take this game they to all the
way<00:07:44.020> through<00:07:44.290> the<00:07:44.350> tiebreakers<00:07:45.210> but<00:07:46.210> now<00:07:46.360> I

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 
way through the tiebreakers but now I

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.110 
way through the tiebreakers but now I
imagine<00:07:47.280> exhausted<00:07:48.280> Navi<00:07:48.580> has<00:07:48.760> a<00:07:48.790> date<00:07:49.090> with

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 
imagine exhausted Navi has a date with

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.840 
imagine exhausted Navi has a date with
eg<00:07:49.720> to<00:07:49.900> round<00:07:50.080> out<00:07:50.230> the<00:07:50.350> day<00:07:50.380> and<00:07:50.800> Agee<00:07:51.580> has<00:07:51.640> got

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:51.850 
eg to round out the day and Agee has got

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:53.190 
eg to round out the day and Agee has got
to<00:07:51.970> be<00:07:52.000> sitting<00:07:52.270> back<00:07:52.540> feeling<00:07:52.930> like<00:07:53.080> if

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:53.200 
to be sitting back feeling like if

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.930 
to be sitting back feeling like if
nothing<00:07:53.560> else<00:07:53.680> they'll<00:07:54.370> have<00:07:54.520> the<00:07:54.610> energy

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:54.940 
nothing else they'll have the energy

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.510 
nothing else they'll have the energy
advantage<00:07:55.180> well<00:07:55.870> I<00:07:56.050> mean<00:07:56.320> maybe<00:07:56.950> not<00:07:57.190> with<00:07:57.340> jet

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 
advantage well I mean maybe not with jet

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.400 
advantage well I mean maybe not with jet
lag<00:07:57.730> and<00:07:57.760> all<00:07:58.000> that<00:07:58.180> in<00:07:58.630> theory<00:07:58.960> they<00:07:59.200> showed

00:07:59.400 --> 00:07:59.410 
lag and all that in theory they showed

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.070 
lag and all that in theory they showed
and<00:07:59.650> in<00:07:59.770> beds<00:07:59.980> on<00:08:00.790> the<00:08:00.850> beds<00:08:00.970> they're<00:08:01.600> so<00:08:01.750> hard

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 
and in beds on the beds they're so hard

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:04.540 
and in beds on the beds they're so hard
it's<00:08:02.680> so<00:08:02.710> uncomfortable

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:04.550 
it's so uncomfortable

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.270 
it's so uncomfortable
great<00:08:05.420> performance<00:08:05.870> here<00:08:06.410> by<00:08:06.830> IEP

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 
great performance here by IEP

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.250 
great performance here by IEP
considering<00:08:07.910> how<00:08:08.060> poorly<00:08:08.450> the<00:08:08.660> game<00:08:08.780> started

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:09.260 
considering how poorly the game started

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:10.750 
considering how poorly the game started
and<00:08:09.440> yeah<00:08:09.680> at<00:08:10.070> one<00:08:10.220> point<00:08:10.250> they<00:08:10.490> pulled<00:08:10.700> it

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:10.760 
and yeah at one point they pulled it

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.750 
and yeah at one point they pulled it
back<00:08:10.820> I<00:08:11.090> still<00:08:11.390> feel<00:08:11.600> like
