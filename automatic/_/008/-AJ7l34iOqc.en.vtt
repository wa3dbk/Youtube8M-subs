00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:06.060
 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.520
 never since tonight and jordan like that 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.980
 it's what we put on to hydrate all night 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.470
 exactly all night you leave it and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.769
 we continue softly but effectively 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.699
 then we save the water we put it 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.560
 apart 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.330
 ok very well and we will incorporate what 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.339
 what is the tomato I like the tomato 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.410
 with shell I find it wonderful is a 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:28.109
 good root gives it more flavor and I think that 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 In addition, all condiments and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.279
 properties that you have you have more 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.870
 clear my character is art and I 'm from 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.480
 100% agreement with you is made to me 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.070
 that keep the shell is great ok 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.530
 the seeds there are also people who do not 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.900
 like but there is a whole wave 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.450
 because what I like very much 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.460
 flavor and in the supposed classic that no 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.740
 it may be missing truth I can not I have 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.300
 40 kind of toy from that little bit where 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.780
 moisturized little truth 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.020
 and we are going to liquefy this time it will be of its 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.020
 hand 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.869
 for April 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.070
 it's good that although we are women of 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.710
 I work preaching with her too 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.990
 work it is important that if we go to 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.570
 work but let's not let the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.270
 opportunity that also cook not clear 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.010
 of course heart hey that we're going to 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.680
 incorporate or that I'm going to our 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.690
 tear up company heated with oil 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.690
 there will be very good cold you have not tied 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.650
 and he's going to tell me they take good hyperthermia 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.200
 that is part of what I am learning 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.030
 this truth arme in the kitchen because I 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.240
 I think we put a touch of embroidery 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:47.860
 suddenly half burned so we're going to 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.590
 move until it is integrated but what 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.970
 important is our flavor don andrÃ©s 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.560
 saved and if not I think it's 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.180
 important for me so I stay a little 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.250
 from here I'm going to do it as 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.510
 grandmothers make the return of that 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.410
 is 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.120
 look I 'm going to tell you to be here and here 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.150
 how many minutes about 10-15 minutes 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.890
 it's enough with 10 15 - I know it's loose 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.270
 the first boil ok very well when 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.610
 I'm here, it's important that 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.560
 let's have our potatoes pre-cooked well 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.100
 also already games as you like 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.690
 but this is the suggestion this in 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.400
 squares to give you more 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.850
 presentation of the saucer because also 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.210
 that is important 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.910
 i 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.800
 We hear and has managed to put them 0 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.860
 cook as always contacts itay brook 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:36.750
 garlic and water and water and the ladies 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.750
 ribs meat stuck to the bone yes 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:50.170
 it 's worth it because the best way to 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.240
 to do it is already previously cooked 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.940
 and well imagine if we want to use some 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.950
 ten minutes and we'll put you through 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.170
 that releases the first boil very well 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.510
 we had a great time 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.210
 julieta is that love enters through the mouth 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.020
 he says and I mean he tells you his 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.750
 doctor is not good we're 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.070
 starting this one to work very well in 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.980
 fats of love because it is also 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:16.260
 importantly clear that you are going to use this 14 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.019
 February 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.299
 I do not know yet that it's a surprise 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.319
 that he surprises me I did not strive 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:28.200
 line but also take care exactly that was going 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.970
 because we are always men julieta with 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.409
 it's good that he gives me a good gift and 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.409
 I make a good dinner 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.920
 and the poor will be on both sides 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.300
 things what I would do I have triana 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.940
 beautiful that night 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.100
 I could only a raincoat over 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.060
 and very nice underwear ideal 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.060
 surprise 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.470
 we have to invent women things 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.049
 what we have because we also have to 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.030
 conquer the mire pointed out that he talks 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.860
 I yesterday with my mom a little and they do not go 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.959
 to let the women lie all of a sudden 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.730
 we are careless and we are with the 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.069
 women who do not work especially 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.629
 truth is not bad wave does not have why 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.459
 work and some are very privileged 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.079
 and they do not work but they do 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.849
 we work because we like it now 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.280
 like it's not work because I like it but 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.979
 then they have several that if you work not 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.900
 work and suddenly I'm leaving with my 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.060

 also the man works really is 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:32.860

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.830
 time is also really important 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.740
 men also need a little bit of 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:45.160
