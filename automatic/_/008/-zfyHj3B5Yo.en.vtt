00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
that's what inspired the background here

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.250 
that's what inspired the background here
to<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.970> we're<00:00:21.060> gonna<00:00:21.150> create<00:00:21.510> cool<00:00:21.869> show<00:00:22.170> us

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
to that we're gonna create cool show us

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.870 
to that we're gonna create cool show us
how<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.440> works<00:00:22.529> okay<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.190> we're<00:00:23.609> going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.850> just

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
how it works okay so we're going to just

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029 
how it works okay so we're going to just
start<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.359> basic<00:00:24.779> textured<00:00:25.380> cardstock<00:00:25.920> I

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
start with basic textured cardstock I

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.560 
start with basic textured cardstock I
love<00:00:26.220> textured<00:00:26.670> card<00:00:26.880> stuff<00:00:27.119> i<00:00:27.240> could<00:00:27.449> think

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
love textured card stuff i could think

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.480 
love textured card stuff i could think
it<00:00:27.750> gives<00:00:27.840> that<00:00:28.020> little<00:00:28.050> nice<00:00:28.410> edge<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.460> it

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
it gives that little nice edge to it

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.370 
it gives that little nice edge to it
finish<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.090> it<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.390> we're<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:30.990> using<00:00:31.199> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
finish to it and we're just using the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.350 
finish to it and we're just using the
dohtal<00:00:31.650> template<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:32.550> some<00:00:32.759> watercolors

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
dohtal template with some watercolors

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.030 
dohtal template with some watercolors
now<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.600> may<00:00:33.840> think<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.260> water<00:00:34.470> colors<00:00:34.829> are

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
now you may think the water colors are

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.590 
now you may think the water colors are
all<00:00:35.190> dried<00:00:35.489> up<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.820> they're<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.059> be<00:00:36.390> able<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
all dried up and they're not be able to

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.209 
all dried up and they're not be able to
use<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:36.960> that's<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.290> beauty<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.590> watercolors

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
use but that's the beauty of watercolors

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.760 
use but that's the beauty of watercolors
you<00:00:38.399> just<00:00:38.670> use<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> little<00:00:39.360> spray<00:00:40.050> water<00:00:40.410> and

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
you just use a little spray water and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.010 
you just use a little spray water and
activate<00:00:41.430> them<00:00:41.550> awesome<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.660> once<00:00:42.870> they're

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
activate them awesome so once they're

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.560 
activate them awesome so once they're
activated<00:00:43.710> I'm<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:44.070> using<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.579> simple<00:00:44.879> sponge

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
activated I'm just using a simple sponge

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660 
activated I'm just using a simple sponge
to<00:00:46.290> do<00:00:46.410> regular<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.860> cosmetic<00:00:47.340> wise<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
to do regular and cosmetic wise from the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.880 
to do regular and cosmetic wise from the
drugstore<00:00:47.910> yeah<00:00:48.450> regular<00:00:49.020> cosmetic<00:00:49.620> sponge

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.740 
drugstore yeah regular cosmetic sponge
and<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.250> love<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.820> use<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> watercolors

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
and I love the use of watercolors

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.690 
and I love the use of watercolors
because<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.860> variance<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.579> the

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:53.700 
because you can get the variance in the

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.959 
because you can get the variance in the
color<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.750> pounce<00:00:54.989> really<00:00:55.610> hard<00:00:56.610> to<00:00:56.850> get

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
color so I can pounce really hard to get

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
color so I can pounce really hard to get
a<00:00:57.030> deeper<00:00:57.360> color<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.260> just<00:00:58.289> go<00:00:58.620> very

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
a deeper color or I can just go very

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.770 
a deeper color or I can just go very
light<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.489> get<00:00:59.610> I'm<00:00:59.910> always<00:01:00.180> nervous<00:01:00.539> about

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
light to get I'm always nervous about

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.119 
light to get I'm always nervous about
using<00:01:00.930> watercolors<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:01.980> because

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
using watercolors like this because

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.059 
using watercolors like this because
they're<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.550> wet<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.840> know<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.709> paper<00:01:04.920> is

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:05.069 
they're so wet but you know the paper is

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.980 
they're so wet but you know the paper is
gonna<00:01:05.159> absorb<00:01:05.579> it<00:01:05.789> and<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.630> gives<00:01:06.779> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
gonna absorb it and I think it gives you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.399 
gonna absorb it and I think it gives you
that<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.619> beautiful<00:01:08.749> transition<00:01:09.749> of<00:01:10.109> color

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
that just beautiful transition of color

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.830 
that just beautiful transition of color
so<00:01:10.740> it's<00:01:10.889> not<00:01:11.039> all<00:01:11.310> just<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.880> thing<00:01:12.179> and<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.630> can

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
so it's not all just one thing and I can

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.569 
so it's not all just one thing and I can
control<00:01:13.200> where<00:01:13.409> it<00:01:13.439> goes<00:01:13.529> on<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.009> layout<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
control where it goes on the layout and

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:16.339 
control where it goes on the layout and
I<00:01:14.969> have<00:01:15.149> one<00:01:15.359> here<00:01:15.569> right<00:01:15.810> that's<00:01:16.079> already

00:01:16.339 --> 00:01:16.349 
I have one here right that's already

00:01:16.349 --> 00:01:18.379 
I have one here right that's already
done<00:01:16.649> so<00:01:16.829> here<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.429> can<00:01:17.459> see<00:01:17.609> I<00:01:17.789> didn't<00:01:18.209> finish

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:18.389 
done so here you can see I didn't finish

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:20.330 
done so here you can see I didn't finish
the<00:01:18.749> edges<00:01:18.899> of<00:01:19.319> this<00:01:19.529> I<00:01:19.770> gave<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.099> a<00:01:20.159> little

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
the edges of this I gave it a little

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.190 
the edges of this I gave it a little
dimension<00:01:20.789> by<00:01:21.090> not<00:01:21.270> doing<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.719> not<00:01:21.869> making<00:01:22.109> it

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
dimension by not doing it not making it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.800 
dimension by not doing it not making it
perfectly<00:01:22.649> square<00:01:23.099> so<00:01:23.670> once<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.179> is<00:01:24.389> done<00:01:24.420> I

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
perfectly square so once this is done I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.929 
perfectly square so once this is done I
just<00:01:24.959> also<00:01:25.139> notice<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.469> slightly<00:01:25.709> off<00:01:25.889> center

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
just also notice the slightly off center

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.459 
just also notice the slightly off center
yeah<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.969> like<00:01:27.359> things<00:01:27.630> off<00:01:27.810> centered<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.289> don't

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
yeah I like things off centered I don't

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:29.899 
yeah I like things off centered I don't
want<00:01:28.619> things<00:01:28.859> directly<00:01:29.340> in<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.609> center<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
want things directly in the center and

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.580 
want things directly in the center and
it's<00:01:30.029> a<00:01:30.090> good<00:01:30.270> design<00:01:30.509> tip<00:01:30.899> to<00:01:31.020> just<00:01:31.200> put<00:01:31.349> it<00:01:31.469> to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
it's a good design tip to just put it to

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.050 
it's a good design tip to just put it to
the<00:01:31.709> left<00:01:31.859> or<00:01:32.069> to<00:01:32.099> the<00:01:32.219> right<00:01:32.310> depending<00:01:32.819> on

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the left or to the right depending on

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.940 
the left or to the right depending on
your<00:01:33.179> photo<00:01:33.450> direction<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.319> asymmetry<00:01:34.859> is

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
your photo direction so asymmetry is

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.249 
your photo direction so asymmetry is
always<00:01:35.249> more<00:01:35.369> pleasing<00:01:35.669> yes<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.479> then<00:01:36.990> once

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
always more pleasing yes and then once

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.679 
always more pleasing yes and then once
this<00:01:37.469> is<00:01:37.679> dry<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.520> take<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.789> paintbrush<00:01:39.359> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
this is dry I just take a paintbrush and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.230 
this is dry I just take a paintbrush and
I<00:01:39.929> go<00:01:40.079> back<00:01:40.259> into<00:01:40.529> like<00:01:41.219> to<00:01:41.369> say<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.759> black<00:01:41.969> to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
I go back into like to say the black to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.479 
I go back into like to say the black to
create<00:01:42.569> some<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.020> splatters<00:01:43.529> I<00:01:43.770> just<00:01:44.279> want

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:44.489 
create some little splatters I just want

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:47.330 
create some little splatters I just want
it<00:01:44.579> nice<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.299> juicy<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:46.139> so<00:01:46.739> you<00:01:46.859> mean<00:01:47.159> by

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
it nice and juicy so so you mean by

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.800 
it nice and juicy so so you mean by
juice<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.639> just<00:01:47.819> mean<00:01:47.909> really<00:01:48.149> wet<00:01:48.389> really

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
juice you just mean really wet really

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.529 
juice you just mean really wet really
wet<00:01:48.959> so<00:01:49.469> it's<00:01:49.649> fluid<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.399> bouncing<00:01:51.149> so<00:01:51.329> that

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:51.539 
wet so it's fluid it's bouncing so that

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.139 
wet so it's fluid it's bouncing so that
when<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.719> tap<00:01:51.869> tap<00:01:52.409> tap<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.009> get<00:01:53.189> those<00:01:53.429> drops<00:01:53.849> on

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
when I tap tap tap I get those drops on

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.719 
when I tap tap tap I get those drops on
the<00:01:54.179> paper<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.020> need<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.679> let<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.069> dry<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the paper I need to let that dry and

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.789 
the paper I need to let that dry and
it's<00:01:57.029> going<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.179> look<00:01:57.389> something<00:01:57.419> like<00:01:58.020> that

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it's going to look something like that

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.909 
it's going to look something like that
like<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.009> and<00:01:59.789> you<00:01:59.939> can<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.270> here<00:02:00.569> too<00:02:00.809> I

like that and you can see here too I
really<00:02:01.919> pushed<00:02:02.279> hard<00:02:02.579> into<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.909> stencil<00:02:03.479> it

pattern<00:02:16.680> paper<00:02:16.890> and<00:02:17.069> that's<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.400> beautiful

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
pattern paper and that's the beautiful

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.510 
pattern paper and that's the beautiful
thing<00:02:18.750> about<00:02:19.260> pattern<00:02:19.770> papers<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.160> can<00:02:20.310> take

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
thing about pattern papers you can take

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.590 
thing about pattern papers you can take
something<00:02:21.000> like<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:23.270> turn<00:02:24.270> it<00:02:24.450> into

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600

something like this oh yes so we just
start<00:02:29.400> I<00:02:29.490> just<00:02:29.700> started<00:02:29.940> by<00:02:30.060> trimming<00:02:30.330> down

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
start I just started by trimming down

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.690 
start I just started by trimming down
the<00:02:30.720> pattern<00:02:31.020> paper<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.709> give<00:02:31.950> myself<00:02:32.160> a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
the pattern paper just to give myself a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.180 
the pattern paper just to give myself a
space<00:02:33.000> that<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.300> needed<00:02:33.600> to<00:02:33.930> use<00:02:34.110> and<00:02:34.410> then<00:02:34.920> I

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
space that I needed to use and then I

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.880 
space that I needed to use and then I
took<00:02:35.250> some<00:02:35.700> gesso<00:02:36.239> and<00:02:36.510> Jessa<00:02:37.350> works<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
took some gesso and Jessa works like a

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.400 
took some gesso and Jessa works like a
primer<00:02:38.220> okay<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.360> gives<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.810> paper<00:02:40.050> some

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
primer okay so it gives the paper some

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.260 
primer okay so it gives the paper some
tooth<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:41.130> you're<00:02:41.340> adding<00:02:41.700> water<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.120> your

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
tooth so you're adding water to your

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.850 
tooth so you're adding water to your
gesture<00:02:42.569> but<00:02:42.690> you're<00:02:42.840> probably<00:02:43.020> activating

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
gesture but you're probably activating

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.470 
gesture but you're probably activating
it<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.040> can't<00:02:44.340> reactivate<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.270> just

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
it you can't reactivate you just

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.050 
it you can't reactivate you just
reactivate<00:02:46.230> gesso<00:02:46.650> but<00:02:46.830> i<00:02:46.860> can<00:02:47.220> add<00:02:47.489> water<00:02:47.790> to

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
reactivate gesso but i can add water to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.940 
reactivate gesso but i can add water to
it<00:02:48.090> to<00:02:48.330> make<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.570> like<00:02:48.930> us<00:02:49.110> on<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.320> watch<00:02:49.500> what

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
it to make it like us on the watch what

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.880 
it to make it like us on the watch what
yes<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.690> going<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.019> be<00:02:52.140> a<00:02:52.170> wash<00:02:52.560> because

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
yes and it's going to be a wash because

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.280 
yes and it's going to be a wash because
i<00:02:53.100> don't<00:02:53.280> want<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.760> hide<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.480> pattern<00:02:54.900> paper<00:02:55.170> i

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
i don't want to hide the pattern paper i

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.020 
i don't want to hide the pattern paper i
want<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.680> see<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.040> but<00:02:56.160> i<00:02:56.220> want<00:02:56.459> to<00:02:56.519> give<00:02:56.730> it

want to see it but i want to give it
that<00:02:57.060> grip<00:02:57.570> shin<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:57.989> grabbed<00:02:58.320> for<00:02:58.860> the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
that grip shin that grabbed for the

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.650 
that grip shin that grabbed for the
watercolor<00:02:59.489> so<00:02:59.880> then<00:03:00.000> that's<00:03:00.150> what<00:03:00.269> the<00:03:00.390> gesso

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
watercolor so then that's what the gesso

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.449 
watercolor so then that's what the gesso
is<00:03:00.720> doing<00:03:01.080> is<00:03:01.200> just<00:03:01.230> creating<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:02.160> little<00:03:02.370> bit

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
is doing is just creating a little bit

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.610 
is doing is just creating a little bit
of<00:03:02.550> glitz<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.880> primer<00:03:03.300> it's<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.810> little<00:03:04.080> grab<00:03:04.290> and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
of glitz a primer it's a little grab and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.559 
of glitz a primer it's a little grab and
it's<00:03:04.739> like<00:03:04.890> a<00:03:04.920> little<00:03:05.190> white<00:03:05.370> wash<00:03:05.640> so<00:03:06.360> with

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
it's like a little white wash so with

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.800 
it's like a little white wash so with
the<00:03:06.750> whitewash<00:03:07.260> here<00:03:07.800> I<00:03:07.980> can<00:03:08.610> go<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.360> take<00:03:09.569> a

your finished one here that you're

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.599 
your finished one here that you're
clearly<00:03:50.579> mixing<00:03:51.329> I<00:03:51.630> am<00:03:52.170> colors<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.980> like<00:03:53.340> it

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
clearly mixing I am colors I like it

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.310 
clearly mixing I am colors I like it
when<00:03:53.760> there<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.180> layers<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.780> colors<00:03:55.049> because<00:03:55.260> I

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
when there is layers of colors because I

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.810 
when there is layers of colors because I
think<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.590> provides<00:03:55.709> that<00:03:56.100> depth<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.700> the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
think it provides that depth that the

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.060 
think it provides that depth that the
piece<00:03:57.030> may<00:03:57.209> not<00:03:57.450> already<00:03:57.660> have<00:03:58.049> so<00:03:58.500> with

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
piece may not already have so with

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.300 
piece may not already have so with
layers<00:03:59.400> of<00:03:59.519> paint<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.780> get<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.200> really<00:04:01.769> nice

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
layers of paint you get that really nice

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.580 
layers of paint you get that really nice
effect<00:04:02.850> so<00:04:03.540> with<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:03.959> we're<00:04:04.170> going<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:04.350> just

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
effect so with this we're going to just

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.449 
effect so with this we're going to just
cut<00:04:04.920> these<00:04:05.160> pieces<00:04:05.489> out<00:04:06.200> okay<00:04:07.220> so<00:04:08.220> would<00:04:08.310> you

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
cut these pieces out okay so would you

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.789 
cut these pieces out okay so would you
have<00:04:08.579> any<00:04:08.700> tips<00:04:09.090> on<00:04:09.359> hand<00:04:10.140> cutting<00:04:10.380> well<00:04:10.769> I

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
have any tips on hand cutting well I

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.650 
have any tips on hand cutting well I
think<00:04:10.980> it's<00:04:11.310> always<00:04:11.670> good<00:04:11.880> to<00:04:11.910> use<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.209> smaller

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
think it's always good to use a smaller

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.330 
think it's always good to use a smaller
pair<00:04:12.989> of<00:04:13.170> scissors<00:04:13.530> when<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.799> have<00:04:14.010> something

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
pair of scissors when you have something

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.210 
pair of scissors when you have something
very<00:04:14.730> very<00:04:15.030> detailed<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.440> don't<00:04:16.739> have<00:04:16.979> to

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
very very detailed and you don't have to

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.770 
very very detailed and you don't have to
be<00:04:17.310> perfect<00:04:17.549> people<00:04:18.090> think<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.419> have<00:04:18.570> to<00:04:18.690> be

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
be perfect people think you have to be

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.060 
be perfect people think you have to be
perfect<00:04:19.260> but<00:04:19.350> you<00:04:19.500> don't<00:04:19.709> because<00:04:19.829> that

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
perfect but you don't because that

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.890 
perfect but you don't because that
little<00:04:20.190> edge<00:04:20.489> gives<00:04:20.789> a<00:04:20.970> little<00:04:21.120> something<00:04:21.690> in

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
little edge gives a little something in

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.930 
little edge gives a little something in
there<00:04:22.169> and<00:04:22.380> then<00:04:22.800> when<00:04:22.950> you<00:04:23.039> come<00:04:23.250> to<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.490> corner

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
there and then when you come to a corner

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.149 
there and then when you come to a corner
I<00:04:24.090> usually<00:04:24.300> like<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.690> stop<00:04:25.110> and<00:04:25.349> turn<00:04:25.620> my<00:04:25.890> paper

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
I usually like to stop and turn my paper

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:28.040 
I usually like to stop and turn my paper
with<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.180> direction<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.780> I'm

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
with the direction that I'm

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.249 
with the direction that I'm
cutting<00:04:28.440> so<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:30.300> you're<00:04:30.389> turning<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.960> paper

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
cutting so so you're turning the paper

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.499 
cutting so so you're turning the paper
instead<00:04:31.919> of<00:04:32.099> turning<00:04:32.310> the<00:04:32.520> scissors<00:04:32.849> I<00:04:33.000> am<00:04:33.270> I'm

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
instead of turning the scissors I am I'm

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:35.029 
instead of turning the scissors I am I'm
turning<00:04:33.870> the<00:04:33.930> paper<00:04:34.139> instead<00:04:34.409> of<00:04:34.530> scissors<00:04:34.919> I

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
turning the paper instead of scissors I

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.610 
turning the paper instead of scissors I
think<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.400> gives<00:04:35.580> you<00:04:35.940> an<00:04:36.330> easier<00:04:36.810> time<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.379> cut

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
think it gives you an easier time to cut

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.379 
think it gives you an easier time to cut
in<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.129> direction<00:04:38.400> that<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:38.970> need<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.210> cut

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
in the direction that you need to cut

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.809 
in the direction that you need to cut
without<00:04:39.569> making<00:04:40.020> mistakes<00:04:40.520> okay<00:04:41.520> and<00:04:41.729> I<00:04:41.759> know

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
without making mistakes okay and I know

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:43.159 
without making mistakes okay and I know
that<00:04:42.030> you<00:04:42.120> have<00:04:42.270> some<00:04:42.449> that<00:04:42.539> are<00:04:42.599> already<00:04:42.810> cut

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
that you have some that are already cut

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.290 
that you have some that are already cut
out<00:04:43.289> I<00:04:43.530> do<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:44.099> what's<00:04:44.310> nice<00:04:44.610> about<00:04:44.669> these<00:04:45.240> is

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
out I do and what's nice about these is

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.240 
out I do and what's nice about these is
you<00:04:45.599> can<00:04:45.930> then<00:04:46.169> give<00:04:46.470> them<00:04:46.650> even<00:04:47.009> further

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
you can then give them even further

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.550 
you can then give them even further
dimension<00:04:47.699> by<00:04:48.090> simply<00:04:48.449> taking<00:04:48.599> your<00:04:48.960> pin<00:04:49.259> and
