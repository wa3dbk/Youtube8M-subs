chances<00:00:15.960> are<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.199> egg<00:00:16.320> shells<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.680> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
chances are the egg shells going to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.620 
chances are the egg shells going to
crack<00:00:17.010> especially<00:00:17.670> if<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> egg<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:17.970> cold<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
crack especially if the egg is cold and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
crack especially if the egg is cold and
then<00:00:18.720> you're<00:00:18.810> going<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:18.990> be<00:00:19.080> left<00:00:19.320> with<00:00:19.529> an
