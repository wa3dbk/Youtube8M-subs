00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:15.660
 dear comrades, I would like first of all 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.369
 urge everyone to abstract a little 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.130
 from what we have gathered today is not on 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.010
 party rallies and in order for us 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.580
 must today declare their 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.090
 cohesion and cohesion and don 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.450
 the edges in front of that brown plague 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.190
 which stands on the threshold of our common 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.920
 At home, I looked irritant Kharkov 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.989

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.620

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.280
 fellow party workers and I want 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.280

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.839

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:05.070
 hope hope for Russians hope for 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:08.820
 Russia and the hope that we are all up to 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.670
 being together coping with any 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.270
 disasters with any invasion what is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.539

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.640
