 Saku we need a kilo 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.380
 apricots 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.850
 300 grams of sugar means I will show on 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.730
 example of one jar 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.490
 and then I will say how much it will turn out with 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.330
 kilogram apricot jars half liter 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.129
 jar we prepare jars 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.100
 pre- sterilized caps too 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:43.180
 how do i do it i have on the channel 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.920
 I will give a reference green peas 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.519
 canned there is 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:53.199
 jar sterilization means apricots 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:56.370
 need to wash very well and dry 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:06.360
 so they were sugary mean 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:06.360
 cut halves remove the bone yes 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:19.750
 say flax need to fall asleep a jar 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.820
 sugar now these apricots we will 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.820
 fold 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.820
 way down 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.690
 in this way 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.680
 again about spaceup allsoft.ru 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.380
 cut down 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:04.440
 so fill the jar on 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:09.119
 at some stage it will be more convenient not to pour 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:13.050
 Kuban sugar on apricot q like this 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:25.010
 because sugar dry apricot is poured 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:25.010
 ore down it stays 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:47.750
 Here is such a jar turned out on top 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:48.500
 we again sprinkle with sugar when filling 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.800
 jars 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:56.930
 you need to tamp it a little 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:58.010
 slightly perform slightly higher than the hanger but 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.390
 not until the end of the can 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.610
 Now we cover with a lid and for 8 hours 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.840
 leave the uterus here so insist 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:11.030
 to let the apricots juice in this way 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.220
 fill all the other banks that we 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:20.650
 cooked apricots stood for 8 hours 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.650
 let the juice and share 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.420
 means in order to eliminate 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.050
 shrink add a little apricot and 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.050
 Sahara 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:57.930
 it is in each jar come a little 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.930
 on top of the song itself has ever come trailer 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.080
 after we added apricots 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.910
 after shrinking now need to put 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.010
 cans for sterilization take the right 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:21.610
 container line the bottom with a cloth or 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.610
 some kind of pallet and install banks 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:33.530
 so it turns out from kilogram to doom 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:36.710
 half pipe and jars a little more 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:45.230
 deals because i have to stabilize 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:54.920
 it turns out on 5 cans we light well 

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:58.760
 fire don't forget water one habit we 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:02.890
 covered by glass because any 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.890
 metal order for plastic 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:11.800
 pressurized cream 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.340
 physical cover you have to play everything 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.919
 we finish two thirds 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.360
 sterilize 25 minutes to speed up 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:31.160
 stabilization process 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:35.140
 better of course to cover when 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.140
 boils and after that 25 minutes 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.420
 ready 25 minutes have passed 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:06:04.830
 we get the bank and for the card and 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:09.740
 roll up rolled banks set 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.740
 not covered with lids and wrapped in a warm blanket 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.330
 for 12 hours 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:31.490
 apricots own juice ready pumpkin 

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:34.800
 it does not have the appearance of light amber 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:41.640
 beautiful all the case in the bank form 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:44.330
 Keep such a blank is very beautiful 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:49.430
 I will say goodbye to you bye 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.430
