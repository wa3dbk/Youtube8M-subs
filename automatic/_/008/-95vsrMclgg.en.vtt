00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.600
 hello guys and girls from youtube me 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.550
 I have to make a mini tutorial very 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.650
 quickie of the anti that atlas a mod that 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.630
 It allows us to create us a book craft 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.000
 which will be a map very similar to the one 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.439
 cell to the cell game and let's go 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.910
 to be able to do with this map well 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.890
 we are not going to have to create a map 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.619
 every time we move around the terrain 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.480
 but that is the book that map is going to 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.060
 contain the world map for us 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.530
 where we move more we go 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.410
 to be able to zoom is very similar to 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.880
 race map and good will allow us to put 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.310
 waypoints are worth which we then 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.250
 we can then draw them on that map 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.950
 good as we are going to create this new 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.140
 book or this new book of maps then 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.460
 with a book and a compass will give us the 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.640
 book is worth the empty book of 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.949
 ancient atlas anti that atlas and doing 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.970
 Right click if you have fixed me 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.680
 created the old book 2 the number 2 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.869
 going back to right click 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.549
 I already get the map is worth with the little arrow 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.830
 that is where I am and we also have 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.290
 here to reset the position is worth us 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.680
 says the distance in blocks is worth 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.240
 we can zoom more or less with the 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.950
 numeric keypad the plus and minus of 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.020
 numeric keypad okay that's fine 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.580
 or with the mouse roulette what good 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.429
 well, it makes the thing quite easy 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.229
 and we can go moving 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:34.869
 what I've seen that what we can not 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.229
 use is the mouse ok you can not 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.570
 use directly only the a stv 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.550
 double and good we could put a mark 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.130
 Well, for example, here we are going to put 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.080
 that this town is not there but there is not 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.630
 populated we give you here and just 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.860
 passing the pointer over we would have 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.020
 the village X the truth is that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.520
 it's pretty cool and good 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.159
 Finally, this map also tells us 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.780
 lets good we can leave continue 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:01.100
 with our adventure in any 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.750
 moment to look at the map the truth is that 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.110
 I liked so not because it is 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.520
 quite pretty cool and good what else 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.080
 we could do we can export the 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.489
 image is to say if we liked this 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 very good we can move 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.830
 logically around here but good with the 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.800
 Mouse moves more easily we can 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.470
 Export the image directly 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.730
 because the desktop for example not 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.590
 the export box would come out here 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.880
 image would we then give the desk 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.920
 save now we would close the game and now 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.630
 we have here our exported image of 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.010
 our map 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.010
 so nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.390
 liked and nothing we go with the installation 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.650
 welcome to the installation of 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.659
 old for the version of 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.560
 minecraft 1.7 point 2 and good to tell you 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.760
 that the link will be in the 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.379
 description click and it will take 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.030
 mod page here you can 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.340
 download it let's give it here open in 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.560
 a new tab and we went down a little 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.720
 where can you see what is it for? 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.569
 mod that with the key + and - of the keyboard 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.150
 numerical zoom we have to start 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.670
 from version 2.1 point 1 you can already 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.379
 exporting the PNG is worth what 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.530
 we have seen at the end of the video and you have 

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:07.700
 a few you see the villages as 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.129
 they know the truth is that quite a lot 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.500
 cool and is very very successful 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.290
 it's true that it's pretty cool 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.670
 and good as you could avoid 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.079
 textures you have a link directly 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.970
 to talk to the mother to herself 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.730
 you want to add some block or want 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.290
 make a suggestion and nothing we're going 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.430
 to go here to the page is fly we hope 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.569
 the five seconds you ignore the 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.370
 advertising as always and you give 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.470
 jump advertising this will download the mod 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.290
 perfect and you have to be the 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.609
 hard point file that I have here 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.650
 it's very important that you have a 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.840
 previous installation of force is now 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.280
 the 1060 is an explanatory video here 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.290
 above that tells you how to install force to 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.280
 the latest version and nothing simply we 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.930
 let's go to the folder 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.800
 craft we are going to create a new folder 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.300
 call mods and let's copy the ticket 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.040
 atlas to the folder mod 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.930
 once done this execute our 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.459
 Minecraft 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.409
 and you have to make sure that here in 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.500
 profile you leave in case your 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:02.629
 name and give us an option to change the 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.519
 profile you are going to give a new profile in 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:07.340
 a new profile, then write, I 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:09.469
 that you atlas for example and you give here 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.000
 below where you can use version to 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.790
 you have to make sure that you do not put 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.739
 made 172 but that you release 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.479
 172 and the version of forums that you have 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.880
 installed if it did not come out this is because 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:22.639
 you do not have forums installed and it's very 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.400
 important that the profile version 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.780
 go linked to the version of force like this 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.070
 that if you do not say it to the version of 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.110
 force this will not work 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:34.360
 good we select force or profile 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.360
 that you have created and you give to play 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.450
 ready and we can already see that 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.310
 the mod installed perfectly 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.470
 welcome to the installation of anti that 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.970
 atlas for the version of minecraft 17.2 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.140
 in multiplayer and good to tell you what 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.090
 only thing you have to do is download 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.130
 the latest version of force and double 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:50.570
 Click you to install server but as 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.490
 the folder finds it then we are going to 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.070
 create a new one we will call you can 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.770
 server 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.720
 atlas for example let's look for this 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.370
 folder that is on the server desktop 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.370
 atlas open accept 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.479
 once they are to accept you give 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.039
 you will know your folder and exceptional 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:15.409
 that you have these three files free 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.419
 its universal force and make a server by 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:19.039
 last we run minecraft server for 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:20.899
 that an automatic server be generated 

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.849
 it's worth a normal random server and 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:24.379
 current exposes will do the area and it 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.199
 will generate the necessary files for 

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:29.509
 operate on a server with our 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.819
 friends but without mods it is worth when it leaves to 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:34.699
 removed closed this minecraft window 

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:36.559
 java server is worth to be able to work 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.119
 about these files because if you do not 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.469
 does rice you will not be able to work well 

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:41.149
 what to do for the same thing as before 

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:44.779
 we create a new folder we call it 

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:46.279
 mods and copies the anti that I talked atlas 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:48.679
 to the mod folder but this time 

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:50.629
 we will execute the universal forum this 

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:53.179
 will then on the mod that on the 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.800
 server that we have created will put the mod 

00:05:53.179 --> 00:05:57.110
 that we just installed that we just 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.089
 put in the folder mods there is worth 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.879
 if you put this big face the folder 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:04.189
 is worth the screen of minecraft server 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.800
 I see that loads the world again 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:09.139
 but generating the land with the mod and 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.269
 good when this window has already come out 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.099
 you can minimize it to start machi or 

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:13.700
 give the ip publicly to your friends 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:17.360
 and be able to play 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.470
 together to the mode on a server so 

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.150
 nothing guys if you have served live 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.350
