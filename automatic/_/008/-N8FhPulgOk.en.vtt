00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
ring fingers on the 11th fret right now

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.660 
ring fingers on the 11th fret right now
so<00:01:39.900> let's<00:01:40.350> just<00:01:40.560> see<00:01:40.710> where<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.010> get<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.550> we

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
so let's just see where we get if we

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.520 
so let's just see where we get if we
start<00:01:41.910> with<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> classic<00:01:42.540> D<00:01:42.960> D<00:01:43.830> whole<00:01:44.550> step<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:45.060> e

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
start with a classic D D whole step to e

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.790 
start with a classic D D whole step to e
half<00:01:46.530> step<00:01:46.800> to<00:01:46.830> F<00:01:47.190> whole<00:01:48.090> step<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.479> G<00:01:48.800> whole

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
half step to F whole step to G whole

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.790 
half step to F whole step to G whole
step<00:01:49.830> to<00:01:50.160> a<00:01:50.400> so<00:01:51.090> half<00:01:51.420> step<00:01:51.690> higher<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.440> we<00:01:52.530> call

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
step to a so half step higher so we call

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.790 
step to a so half step higher so we call
it<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.070> sharp<00:01:53.460> or<00:01:53.729> B<00:01:53.790> flat<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.930> lot<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> guys<00:01:55.619> when

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
it a sharp or B flat a lot of guys when

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.350 
it a sharp or B flat a lot of guys when
