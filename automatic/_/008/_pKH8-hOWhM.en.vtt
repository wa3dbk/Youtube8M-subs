00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:04.370 
yeah for the raw gun actually came from

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.020 
yeah for the raw gun actually came from
the<00:00:05.370> Eskimo<00:00:05.810> came<00:00:06.810> from<00:00:06.990> us<00:00:07.429> sealskin<00:00:08.429> if<00:00:08.880> they

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
the Eskimo came from us sealskin if they

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.839 
the Eskimo came from us sealskin if they
show<00:00:09.300> up<00:00:09.510> and<00:00:09.780> fill<00:00:10.200> full<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.559> air<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.460> they

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
show up and fill full of air and they

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.610 
show up and fill full of air and they
use<00:00:12.000> that<00:00:12.210> as<00:00:12.269> an<00:00:12.570> air<00:00:12.750> roller<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.290> they<00:00:13.410> can

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
use that as an air roller and they can

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.400 
use that as an air roller and they can
roll<00:00:13.860> her<00:00:13.980> both<00:00:14.190> around<00:00:14.549> with<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.170> so<00:00:16.170> from

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
roll her both around with it and so from

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.500 
roll her both around with it and so from
there<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.460> whole<00:00:17.670> concept<00:00:17.970> was

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
there this this whole concept was

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.370 
there this this whole concept was
developed<00:00:19.880> and<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.060> is<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.330> photograph<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:22.230> an

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
developed and this is a photograph of an

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.650 
developed and this is a photograph of an
actual<00:00:22.880> Eskimo<00:00:23.880> sealskin<00:00:26.180> here<00:00:27.180> they<00:00:27.330> made

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
actual Eskimo sealskin here they made

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.259 
actual Eskimo sealskin here they made
one<00:00:27.900> out<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.109> rubber<00:00:28.529> covered<00:00:29.039> fabric<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.060> see

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
one out of rubber covered fabric to see

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.310 
one out of rubber covered fabric to see
what<00:00:30.449> they<00:00:30.599> could<00:00:30.660> do<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.080> it

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.680 

started<00:00:34.320> calling<00:00:34.739> them<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> pneumatic<00:00:35.670> roller

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.180 

somebody<00:00:39.690> thought<00:00:40.020> maybe<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.620> was<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.890> way

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
somebody thought maybe this was the way

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.160 
somebody thought maybe this was the way
the<00:00:41.340> Egyptians<00:00:41.489> moved<00:00:42.270> their<00:00:42.510> heavy<00:00:42.780> blocks

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the Egyptians moved their heavy blocks

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.910 
the Egyptians moved their heavy blocks
around<00:00:44.510> then<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.539> started<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.350> try<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.649> figure

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
around then I started to try to figure

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.830 
around then I started to try to figure
out<00:00:47.039> how<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.399> apply<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:47.879> thing<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.510> a<00:00:48.539> vehicle

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
out how to apply this thing to a vehicle

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.990 
out how to apply this thing to a vehicle
so<00:00:51.840> some<00:00:52.199> crude<00:00:52.829> test<00:00:53.219> rigs<00:00:53.520> were<00:00:53.730> built<00:00:56.000> one

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
so some crude test rigs were built one

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.180 
so some crude test rigs were built one
of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> rubber<00:00:57.510> companies<00:00:58.109> made<00:00:58.440> these<00:00:58.680> big

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
of the rubber companies made these big

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.790 
of the rubber companies made these big
bladders<00:00:59.670> like<00:01:00.359> this<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:01.410> fill<00:01:01.649> them<00:01:01.770> full

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
bladders like this they fill them full

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.219 
bladders like this they fill them full
of<00:01:01.980> fuel<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.520> just<00:01:02.699> roll<00:01:03.660> them<00:01:03.809> along<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
of fuel and just roll them along the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.179 
of fuel and just roll them along the
ground<00:01:05.750> what<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:06.780> vehicle<00:01:07.350> was<00:01:07.500> finally<00:01:07.950> built

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
ground what a vehicle was finally built

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.830 
ground what a vehicle was finally built
they<00:01:08.430> found<00:01:08.700> out<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> would<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.450> kind<00:01:09.750> of

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
they found out it would do all kind of

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.770 
they found out it would do all kind of
neat<00:01:10.020> things<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:11.479> driving<00:01:12.479> over<00:01:12.750> a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
neat things like this driving over a

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.960 
neat things like this driving over a
ditch<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.619> couple<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.070> logs<00:01:14.310> over<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.729> top

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
ditch with a couple of logs over the top

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.240 
ditch with a couple of logs over the top
of<00:01:15.180> it

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
of it

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.590 
of it
they<00:01:17.250> found<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.790> thing<00:01:18.030> would<00:01:18.210> climb<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
they found the thing would climb a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.090 
they found the thing would climb a
vertical<00:01:19.229> wall<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.619> would<00:01:22.770> go<00:01:22.979> over

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
vertical wall and it would go over

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.950 
vertical wall and it would go over
ditches<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:24.060> ease<00:01:26.090> traveling<00:01:27.090> over<00:01:27.210> Sandoz

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
ditches with ease traveling over Sandoz

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.170 
ditches with ease traveling over Sandoz
was<00:01:28.409> no<00:01:28.740> problem<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:31.860> could<00:01:32.159> climb<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.759> sand

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
was no problem it could climb a sand

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.749 
was no problem it could climb a sand
dune<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:34.290> difficult<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.100> even<00:01:35.220> walk<00:01:35.490> up

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
dune very difficult to even walk up

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.080 
dune very difficult to even walk up
something<00:01:36.150> like<00:01:36.210> that<00:01:37.430> they<00:01:38.430> found<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.909> it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
something like that they found out it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.789 
something like that they found out it
would<00:01:39.210> travel<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.750> Artic<00:01:40.049> Tundra<00:01:40.079> without

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
would travel the Artic Tundra without

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.319 
would travel the Artic Tundra without
damaging<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:42.890> then<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.159> build<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.579> bigger<00:01:44.939> more

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
damaging it then we build a bigger more

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.010 
damaging it then we build a bigger more
powerful<00:01:45.390> rig<00:01:46.970> that<00:01:47.970> would<00:01:48.149> climb<00:01:48.630> slopes

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
powerful rig that would climb slopes

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.139 
powerful rig that would climb slopes
very<00:01:49.380> easy<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:52.200> do<00:01:52.680> all<00:01:52.979> sorts<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.880> neat

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
very easy and do all sorts of neat

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.020 
very easy and do all sorts of neat
stunts

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.710 

then<00:01:57.510> we<00:01:57.720> built<00:01:58.020> even<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.500> bigger<00:01:58.920> rig<00:01:59.280> with<00:02:00.210> big

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
then we built even a bigger rig with big

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.450 
then we built even a bigger rig with big
power<00:02:01.170> trailer<00:02:03.409> then<00:02:04.409> we<00:02:04.619> found<00:02:04.890> out<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.310> would

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
power trailer then we found out it would

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.190 
power trailer then we found out it would
even<00:02:05.850> float<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.940> would<00:02:09.090> go<00:02:09.270> through<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.569> mud

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
even float and it would go through a mud

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.750 
even float and it would go through a mud
field<00:02:10.530> with<00:02:10.800> ease<00:02:12.800> we<00:02:13.800> designed<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.520> so<00:02:14.550> you

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
field with ease we designed it so you

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.610 
field with ease we designed it so you
could<00:02:15.000> take<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.239> apart<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.900> put<00:02:16.350> it<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.590> a

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
could take it apart and put it on a

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.040 
could take it apart and put it on a
regular<00:02:16.920> semi<00:02:17.370> truck<00:02:17.730> so<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.060> behold<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:18.900> way

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
regular semi truck so to behold the way

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.150 
regular semi truck so to behold the way
and<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.709> took<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:19.950> up<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.190> Alaska<00:02:21.830> once<00:02:22.830> we<00:02:22.980> got

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
and we took it up to Alaska once we got

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.570 
and we took it up to Alaska once we got
it<00:02:23.280> up<00:02:23.430> there<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.850> just<00:02:24.360> took<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.780> off<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
it up there we just took it off the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.640 
it up there we just took it off the
truck<00:02:26.580> and<00:02:26.610> put<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.600> on<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.840> inside<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.380> start

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
truck and put it on the inside and start

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.270 
truck and put it on the inside and start
putting<00:02:28.860> them<00:02:29.010> together<00:02:29.190> again<00:02:31.040> we<00:02:32.040> use<00:02:32.250> the

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
putting them together again we use the

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.040 
putting them together again we use the

it<00:02:46.739> together<00:02:46.890> we<00:02:47.340> started<00:02:47.790> testing<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.569> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
it together we started testing it in the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.320 
it together we started testing it in the
snow

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
snow

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.820 
snow
we<00:02:51.330> found<00:02:51.630> what<00:02:51.870> could<00:02:51.989> go<00:02:52.050> anywhere<00:02:52.500> we

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
we found what could go anywhere we

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.590 
we found what could go anywhere we
wanted<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.310> go<00:02:53.489> in<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.910> snow<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:57.060> we<00:02:57.360> headed

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
wanted to go in the snow so we headed

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.199 
wanted to go in the snow so we headed
for<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.019> North<00:02:58.290> Slope<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.980> drove<00:02:59.910> up<00:03:00.060> the

Yukon there's our first little section
of<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.070> trip<00:03:06.140> we<00:03:07.140> found<00:03:07.440> we<00:03:07.680> had<00:03:07.799> a<00:03:07.829> problem

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
of the trip we found we had a problem

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.220 
of the trip we found we had a problem
trying<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.850> get<00:03:09.060> out<00:03:09.209> of<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.570> valley<00:03:09.840> whether

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
trying to get out of the valley whether

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.780 
trying to get out of the valley whether
the<00:03:10.860> river<00:03:11.070> was<00:03:11.400> banks<00:03:12.329> were<00:03:12.450> too<00:03:12.630> steep<00:03:13.579> so<00:03:14.579> we

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
the river was banks were too steep so we

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.940 
the river was banks were too steep so we
had<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.000> little<00:03:15.209> powwow<00:03:15.600> with<00:03:16.079> some<00:03:16.709> of<00:03:16.860> the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950

had a little powwow with some of the
locals<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.549> they<00:03:17.670> suggested<00:03:18.329> we<00:03:18.680> cut<00:03:19.680> some

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
locals and they suggested we cut some

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.830 
locals and they suggested we cut some
trees<00:03:20.160> down<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.519> drive<00:03:20.940> up<00:03:21.150> them<00:03:21.420> so<00:03:21.690> that's

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
trees down and drive up them so that's

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.520 
trees down and drive up them so that's
just<00:03:22.170> what<00:03:22.350> we<00:03:22.500> did<00:03:23.690> here<00:03:24.690> we're<00:03:24.930> petting<00:03:25.230> the

just what we did here we're petting the
trees<00:03:25.829> down<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.459> drive<00:03:26.910> up<00:03:27.090> them<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.540> that

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
trees down to drive up them and that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.330 
trees down to drive up them and that
worked<00:03:28.019> like<00:03:28.200> a<00:03:28.260> charm<00:03:29.930> so<00:03:30.930> where<00:03:31.500> we<00:03:31.709> go<00:03:31.920> we're

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340
