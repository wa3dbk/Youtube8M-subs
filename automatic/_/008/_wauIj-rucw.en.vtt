00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.670 
see how it's like like they just changed
I<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> S<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.450> anyways<00:01:39.750> that's<00:01:40.259> not<00:01:40.409> really

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
I to the S but anyways that's not really

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.590 
I to the S but anyways that's not really
copying<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.250> all<00:01:41.549> its<00:01:42.060> basic<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
copying because all its basic the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.780 
copying because all its basic the
Apple's<00:01:43.049> idea<00:01:43.350> was<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> put<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.280> one

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
Apple's idea was to put like the one

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.550 
Apple's idea was to put like the one
letter<00:01:45.030> in<00:01:45.210> front<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> cloud<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.290> English

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
letter in front of the cloud but English

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.770 
letter in front of the cloud but English
it<00:01:46.860> seems<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.579> makes<00:01:47.820> sense<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.240> Samsung

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
it seems it makes sense that Samsung

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.630 
it seems it makes sense that Samsung
will<00:01:48.899> do<00:01:48.990> it<00:01:49.110> because<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.530> their<00:01:49.950> Galaxy<00:01:50.520> S

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
will do it because of their Galaxy S

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.999 
will do it because of their Galaxy S
line<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.090> phones<00:01:51.270> anyways<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.869> don't<00:01:52.439> see<00:01:52.710> any

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
problem with that and I don't know why

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.270
