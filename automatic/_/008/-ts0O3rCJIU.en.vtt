00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.850
 I'll leave in the description of the video 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.460
 they only give you a click to dedicate 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.460
 to what is the mediafire page 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.769
 and we are going to load what the page 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.329
 and we're going to do is click on 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.489

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.309
 after that we will save it 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:55.300
 our favorite place or where we 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.790
 I want to keep it on the desk 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 so this is quickly downloaded 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.780
 it only weighs about 23 megs 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.320
 that we were expecting quickly is something 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.509
 ten seconds ready ok and good here 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.630
 we have the actual file we click on 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.700
 right to extract here once done that 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.440
 we wait for it to be extracted 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.909
 it's never being a little bit we're going to 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.259
 wait 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.259
 the list is processing 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:30.020
 is being extracted and ready let's open 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.020
 this folder that we have here 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.460
 we are going to open it and we are going to have this 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.920
 folder we open cheese and surfers and 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.729
 we are going to have two files here that is 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.980
 an installer and the script that is in the 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.390
 folder to be able 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.659
 with keyboard we will open the installer 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.430
 and we will say that if the permits are going to 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.350
 leave the installer and we will give a 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:01.960

 install what is the game 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.470
 this gives a little takes a long time though 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.470
 we must wait some time 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.810
 and since it has loaded what we are going to 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.810
 to do is to click 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.569
 in exit or receive a click and we will open 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.209

 Installer right click executes as 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.319
 administrator we click on yes 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.740
 and wait for the installer to come out 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:49.960
 it takes a little 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.960
 ok wait a moment 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.709
 and to keep it open is not going to come out 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.040
 These two express station and custom 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.560
 installation we would click on express 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.980
 and we hope it will be installed once 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.629
 installed we will click on exit ok 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.629

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.800
 we have downloaded and we are going to have 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.370
 these two files and we want to give it 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:24.300
 a double click to the script that has a 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.260
 double click white icon and we are 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:31.470

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.930
 by double- clicking it, it's ready 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.760
 opened we can see the folder and we just 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.580
 are left to open what is the game with 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.560
 a double click we get this I will lower it 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.490
 the resolution for the window to come out 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.490
 smaller there is and we will click 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.140
 in play 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.030
 As you can see, the window will open 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.000
 of the game and let's wait for it to load 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:55.580
 this small presentation of 7 seconds 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.520
 approximately 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.810
 or wait for this is a bit slow because 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:03.560
 I'm recording with camps that studio 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.450
 but going very fast we will give income and 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.900
 we will run the game by clicking on 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.390
 the game screen 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.700
 have given the click and we can play 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.630
 us with what are the arrows of the 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.400
 keyboard and we're jumping and all that has 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.720
 done that but because I'm recording with 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.430

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:27.000
 try another give him play 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.580
 ok and see if I'm already already when a 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.310
 little better that is very slow by camps 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.009
 towards himself that's the whole game is going 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.870
 to run wonderfully they must have 2 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.840
 gigas ram minutes so you can 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.180
 run and so I hope you have them 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.900
