00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.250
 phone but yes no 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.400

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:37.220
 but if you've been dead for a thousand years 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.890

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.110
 l 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:46.960
 I also have parts of weirdoes 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.810
 drawings of heavy children and our friend 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:56.460
 the fan he always returns 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:59.610
 and let's take a look at the cameras in 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.610
 house that idiot is talking 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.070

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.450

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.450
 a lamp of a duck or is it small and 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.450

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.710
 exit walk here I'm going home 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.970
 every night every morning I do not know 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:25.490
 what time do I go to 56 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.050
 flashing bonnie has no ears and 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.050
 more strange drawings 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.759
 look at the pixar lamp 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.180
 or epoxy that bases here a 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.650
 hallway full of leaves thrown and shit 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.680
 no more drawings and also 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.320
 and here we go back to see what this is 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.320
 no no that has been that 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.980

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.980
 car you came to a secret corridor 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.190
 how to act worker 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.980

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.660
 patient who is dying but good 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.860

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.310
 no bug point to try to kill me 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.730

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.280

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.110

 it can not be six o'clock but if not 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.569

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.900
 tour around the house before dying or how 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.900

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:02.200

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.780

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.090
 it's a new power rangers let's see the 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.090
 error because it happens what happens 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.630
 it was a lilac green of those that 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.400

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:39.160

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.700
 where is that fucking bitch what is it 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.700

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.510
 so low 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.510
 what have I done that I'm playing 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.170
 everything is alright 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:42.650
 you do not have those motherfucker bits 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:42.650
 once the screen those are both 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:48.110
 it's good 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.870
 second try let's go there we're going to 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.740
 find himself said and we will break him 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.900
 head 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.210
 to see where you are, where are you, what are you going 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.550
 to make that amorphous roof face that 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.550
 you have in mind to kill me if you have eggs 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.479
 we are all 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:17.630
 we go again 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:21.050
 where I eat 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.050
 we have already bundled it 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.310
 what are you where are you where has been 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:34.350

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.350
 he has moved away he has moved away he has scared 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.890
 we know this bug as spring trap 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.510
 so people think it 's a trap 

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.600
 spring but I believe in fact that as 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:50.180
 language are spring and that is trampoline 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.789
 I would say something like trap bounce theo 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.039
 something like jumping bounce or we're going to 

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:58.960
 sound this over here to see if it does any 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:58.960

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.399
