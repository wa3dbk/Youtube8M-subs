gay<00:00:45.030> marriage<00:00:45.469> in<00:00:46.469> part<00:00:46.800> because<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.219> thought

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
gay marriage in part because I thought

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.819 
gay marriage in part because I thought
civil<00:00:47.969> unions<00:00:48.329> would<00:00:48.480> be<00:00:48.629> sufficient<00:00:48.829> that

civil unions would be sufficient that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.590 
civil unions would be sufficient that
that<00:00:49.980> was<00:00:50.160> something<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.550> would<00:00:50.910> give

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
that was something that would give

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.600 
that was something that would give
people<00:00:51.989> hospital<00:00:52.469> visitation<00:00:52.890> rights<00:00:53.309> and

people hospital visitation rights and

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
other elements that we take for granted

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.709 
other elements that we take for granted
and<00:00:59.539> I<00:01:00.539> was<00:01:01.260> sensitive<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> fact<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.719> for
