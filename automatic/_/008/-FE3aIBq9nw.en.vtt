00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
to a yin shape as it come across changes

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.320 
to a yin shape as it come across changes
to<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.470> yang<00:03:56.770> shape<00:03:57.070> just<00:03:57.370> after<00:03:57.550> that<00:03:58.090> one<00:03:58.209> see

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
to a yang shape just after that one see

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.729 
to a yang shape just after that one see
that<00:03:58.360> one<00:03:58.510> just<00:03:58.750> gets<00:03:58.989> there<00:03:59.230> and<00:03:59.410> then<00:03:59.590> that

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
that one just gets there and then that

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.010 
that one just gets there and then that
one<00:03:59.920> just<00:04:00.130> finally<00:04:00.850> changes<00:04:01.330> to<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> yang<00:04:01.750> shape

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
one just finally changes to a yang shape

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.690 
one just finally changes to a yang shape
but<00:04:02.170> this<00:04:02.320> one's<00:04:02.530> not<00:04:02.739> as<00:04:02.890> young<00:04:03.190> as<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.520> left

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
but this one's not as young as the left

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.100 
but this one's not as young as the left
one<00:04:03.940> you<00:04:04.209> see<00:04:04.590> so<00:04:05.590> which<00:04:06.040> makes<00:04:06.310> it<00:04:06.459> more<00:04:06.670> yen

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
one you see so which makes it more yen

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:41.460 
one you see so which makes it more yen
so<00:04:08.110> I'll<00:04:08.620> just

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.680 

see<00:04:42.100> how<00:04:42.190> the<00:04:42.250> hands<00:04:42.670> are<00:04:42.790> changing<00:04:43.300> from<00:04:43.450> yin

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
see how the hands are changing from yin

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.520 
see how the hands are changing from yin
to<00:04:43.840> yang<00:04:44.370> while<00:04:45.370> one's<00:04:45.670> yang<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.840> others<00:04:47.170> in

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.720 

now<00:04:50.530> this<00:04:50.710> left<00:04:51.040> one<00:04:51.250> see<00:04:51.460> slightly<00:04:51.910> follows

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
now this left one see slightly follows

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.570 
now this left one see slightly follows
right<00:04:54.730> when<00:04:55.000> you<00:04:55.120> do<00:04:55.240> it<00:04:55.360> three<00:04:55.570> times<00:04:56.010> so<00:04:57.010> I'll

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
right when you do it three times so I'll

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:19.690 
right when you do it three times so I'll
just<00:04:57.640> do<00:04:57.970> the<00:04:58.000> whole<00:04:58.300> section<00:04:59.700> in<00:05:00.700> breath

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:19.700 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:23.550

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
and on the third one that's where we go

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.920 
and on the third one that's where we go
bang<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:25.070> this<00:05:26.030> one<00:05:26.240> that<00:05:26.420> knows<00:05:26.600> that<00:05:26.840> the

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 
bang and this one that knows that the

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.270 
bang and this one that knows that the
left<00:05:27.140> one<00:05:27.320> goes<00:05:27.560> you<00:05:27.980> ah<00:05:29.770> just<00:05:30.770> before<00:05:31.160> the

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
left one goes you ah just before the

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.660 
left one goes you ah just before the
strike<00:05:32.620> and<00:05:33.620> that's<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.040> other<00:05:34.160> feet<00:05:34.460> are

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
strike and that's the other feet are

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.750 
strike and that's the other feet are
there<00:05:34.880> pointing<00:05:35.210> this<00:05:35.420> way<00:05:36.520> also<00:05:37.520> have<00:05:37.610> these

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
there pointing this way also have these

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.610 
there pointing this way also have these
west-northwest<00:05:38.630> both<00:05:38.960> feet<00:05:39.170> are<00:05:39.290> pointing

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
it's got to be a farging movement so

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:55.000 
it's got to be a farging movement so
I'll<00:05:47.360> just<00:05:47.420> do<00:05:47.720> the<00:05:47.840> whole<00:05:47.960> thing<00:05:47.990> for<00:05:48.350> you<00:05:54.010> see

smaller<00:05:56.360> now

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:03.790 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.660

into the next move I'll just show you

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.749 
into the next move I'll just show you
how<00:06:46.229> it<00:06:46.349> works<00:06:46.530> first<00:06:47.159> and<00:06:47.490> then<00:06:47.580> we'll<00:06:47.639> have

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 
how it works first and then we'll have

00:06:47.759 --> 00:07:01.629 
how it works first and then we'll have
to<00:06:47.879> do<00:06:47.970> it<00:06:48.000> slowly<00:06:48.270> of<00:06:48.479> course

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.659 

very<00:07:02.330> slowly<00:07:02.780> half<00:07:03.199> pace<00:07:03.590> with<00:07:03.830> that<00:07:03.979> one<00:07:04.099> and

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:04.669 
very slowly half pace with that one and

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.540 
very slowly half pace with that one and
that<00:07:04.729> right<00:07:05.090> toe<00:07:05.360> heel<00:07:06.009> barely<00:07:07.009> touches<00:07:07.430> the

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
that right toe heel barely touches the

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.510 
that right toe heel barely touches the
ground<00:07:07.669> it's<00:07:08.569> a<00:07:08.599> difficult<00:07:08.810> move<00:07:09.259> is<00:07:10.069> one<00:07:10.370> but

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
ground it's a difficult move is one but

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.839 
ground it's a difficult move is one but
toochie<00:07:11.150> internal<00:07:12.050> chi<00:07:12.229> learning<00:07:12.710> tools<00:07:13.550> that

toochie internal chi learning tools that

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:18.519 
toochie internal chi learning tools that
we<00:07:13.939> have<00:07:15.490> so<00:07:16.490> that<00:07:17.240> far<00:07:17.599> jinglun<00:07:18.080> every<00:07:18.349> fire

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:18.529 
we have so that far jinglun every fire

00:07:18.529 --> 00:07:20.320 
we have so that far jinglun every fire
jingling<00:07:18.949> move<00:07:19.159> we<00:07:19.340> do<00:07:19.520> for<00:07:19.819> instance<00:07:20.270> the

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:20.330 
jingling move we do for instance the

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.050 
jingling move we do for instance the
punch<00:07:20.719> here<00:07:21.499> it<00:07:22.039> doesn't<00:07:22.279> just<00:07:22.400> stop<00:07:22.759> at<00:07:22.819> the

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:23.060 
punch here it doesn't just stop at the

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.010 
punch here it doesn't just stop at the
punch<00:07:23.300> it<00:07:23.449> always<00:07:23.719> up<00:07:25.090> like<00:07:26.090> a<00:07:26.120> wave<00:07:26.479> coming<00:07:26.840> in

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020 
punch it always up like a wave coming in

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.589 
punch it always up like a wave coming in
on<00:07:27.110> the<00:07:27.199> shore<00:07:27.409> goes<00:07:27.650> crash<00:07:28.159> and<00:07:28.849> then<00:07:29.210> slows

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:29.599 
on the shore goes crash and then slows

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:32.980 
on the shore goes crash and then slows
down<00:07:29.900> as<00:07:30.199> it<00:07:30.319> slowly<00:07:30.620> goes<00:07:30.949> back<00:07:31.610> up<00:07:31.639> to<00:07:31.789> see<00:07:32.120> so

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:32.990 
down as it slowly goes back up to see so

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.779 
down as it slowly goes back up to see so
we<00:07:33.110> got<00:07:33.259> the<00:07:33.349> punch<00:07:33.590> you<00:07:35.740> see<00:07:36.740> I'm<00:07:37.219> this<00:07:37.610> one

we got the punch you see I'm this one

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:43.420 
we got the punch you see I'm this one
we've<00:07:38.000> got<00:07:41.289> so<00:07:42.289> doing<00:07:42.560> that<00:07:42.590> slowly<00:07:43.039> what

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.430 
we've got so doing that slowly what

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.320 
we've got so doing that slowly what
happens<00:07:43.759> is<00:07:44.860> as<00:07:45.860> you've<00:07:46.610> done<00:07:46.759> that<00:07:46.909> as<00:07:47.060> soon
