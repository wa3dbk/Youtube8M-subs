the song smile smile smile and what I
particularly<00:00:10.139> love<00:00:10.559> about<00:00:10.800> it<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.130> the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
particularly love about it is the

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.860 
particularly love about it is the
animation<00:00:11.700> this<00:00:11.940> walk<00:00:12.240> cycle<00:00:12.269> used

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
animation this walk cycle used

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.259 
animation this walk cycle used
throughout<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.259> song<00:00:13.469> it's<00:00:14.460> really<00:00:14.549> fun<00:00:15.120> and

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
throughout the song it's really fun and

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.269 
throughout the song it's really fun and
appealing<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:16.260> motion<00:00:16.590> tightly<00:00:16.949> fits<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
appealing the motion tightly fits the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.680 
appealing the motion tightly fits the
staccato<00:00:17.580> bee<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.940> song<00:00:18.240> while<00:00:18.420> still

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
staccato bee to the song while still

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.900 
staccato bee to the song while still
feeling<00:00:18.840> light<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.320> snappy<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:20.310> quickly<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
feeling light and snappy it quickly and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.340 
feeling light and snappy it quickly and
simply<00:00:21.300> captures<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> mood<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.199> whole

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
simply captures the mood of the whole

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.320 
simply captures the mood of the whole
number<00:00:22.680> how<00:00:23.490> does<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.880> do<00:00:24.060> that

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
number how does it do that

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.750 
number how does it do that
how<00:00:25.170> does<00:00:25.439> what<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.710> basically<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.160> simple<00:00:26.580> walk

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
how does what is basically a simple walk

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.759 
how does what is basically a simple walk
cycle<00:00:27.180> feel<00:00:27.359> tight<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.869> rhythmic<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.500> happy

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
cycle feel tight and rhythmic and happy

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.919 
cycle feel tight and rhythmic and happy
and<00:00:28.890> loose<00:00:29.039> all<00:00:29.279> at<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.429> same<00:00:29.580> time<00:00:29.640> well<00:00:30.570> I'm

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
and loose all at the same time well I'm

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.540 
and loose all at the same time well I'm
gonna<00:00:31.140> analyze<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.800> cycle<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.189> sort<00:00:32.460> of

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
gonna analyze this cycle and sort of

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.160 
gonna analyze this cycle and sort of
reverse-engineer<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.840> figure<00:00:34.050> out

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
reverse-engineer it so we can figure out

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.350 
reverse-engineer it so we can figure out
how<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.469> works<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:34.770> learn<00:00:34.950> from<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.360> let's

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
how it works and learn from it let's

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.990 
how it works and learn from it let's
start<00:00:36.480> with<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> technical<00:00:37.079> basics<00:00:38.000> framing

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
start with the technical basics framing

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.220 
start with the technical basics framing
through<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> animation<00:00:39.510> we<00:00:39.750> can<00:00:39.780> see<00:00:40.079> that

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
through the animation we can see that

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.110 
through the animation we can see that
there's<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.469> step<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.800> each<00:00:40.950> beat<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.940> each

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
there's a step on each beat and each

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.869 
there's a step on each beat and each
step<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.540> 9<00:00:42.719> frames<00:00:43.140> which<00:00:44.010> at<00:00:44.190> 24<00:00:44.579> frames<00:00:44.850> per

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
step is 9 frames which at 24 frames per

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.150 
step is 9 frames which at 24 frames per
second<00:00:45.270> matches<00:00:45.600> up<00:00:45.719> with<00:00:45.809> 160<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.739> per<00:00:46.890> minute

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
second matches up with 160 be per minute

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.549 
second matches up with 160 be per minute
tempo<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.610> song<00:00:47.719> so<00:00:48.719> if<00:00:48.809> each<00:00:48.989> step<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.379> 9

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
tempo of the song so if each step is 9

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.470 
tempo of the song so if each step is 9
frames<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.219> means<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.520> need<00:00:50.610> 18<00:00:51.090> frames<00:00:51.300> to

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
frames that means we need 18 frames to

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.479 
frames that means we need 18 frames to
make<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.719> cycle<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.680> first<00:00:53.100> we<00:00:53.280> need<00:00:53.430> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
make the cycle so first we need to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.010 
make the cycle so first we need to
figure<00:00:53.699> out<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.090> key<00:00:54.270> frames<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.780> define

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
figure out the key frames that define

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.260 
figure out the key frames that define
the<00:00:55.170> motion<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.219> case<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.610> walk<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:57.090> need

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
the motion in the case of a walk we need

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.639 
the motion in the case of a walk we need
both<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.420> contact<00:00:58.020> position<00:00:58.440> where<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
both the contact position where the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.200 
both the contact position where the
weight<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.829> down<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.370> foot<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.789> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
weight is down on the foot and the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.670 
weight is down on the foot and the
passing<00:01:00.600> position<00:01:00.750> where<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> weight<00:01:01.379> is<00:01:01.410> up

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
passing position where the weight is up

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.590 
passing position where the weight is up
so<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> feet<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.340> switch<00:01:02.579> looking<00:01:03.359> at<00:01:03.480> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
so the feet can switch looking at the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.119 
so the feet can switch looking at the
animation<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.110> each<00:01:04.260> leg<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.769> divide<00:01:05.010> the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
animation of each leg you can divide the

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.300 
animation of each leg you can divide the
motion<00:01:05.430> into<00:01:05.580> two<00:01:05.790> phases<00:01:06.830> straight<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.040> bent

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
motion into two phases straight and bent

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.210 
motion into two phases straight and bent
both<00:01:09.299> phases<00:01:09.689> are<00:01:09.780> 9<00:01:10.020> frames<00:01:10.409> long<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:10.979> isn't

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
both phases are 9 frames long one isn't

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.530 
both phases are 9 frames long one isn't
favored<00:01:11.580> over<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> other<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.210> they

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
favored over the other and they

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.120 
favored over the other and they
alternate<00:01:12.960> cleanly<00:01:13.320> between<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> two<00:01:13.890> front

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
alternate cleanly between the two front

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.310 
alternate cleanly between the two front
legs<00:01:14.400> they<00:01:15.060> don't<00:01:15.270> ever<00:01:15.390> overlap<00:01:15.930> where<00:01:16.170> both

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
legs they don't ever overlap where both

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.840 
legs they don't ever overlap where both
legs<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.740> straight<00:01:17.040> or<00:01:17.100> bent<00:01:17.369> at<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> same

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
legs are straight or bent at the same

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.910 
legs are straight or bent at the same
time<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:19.140> keyframe<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.710> likely

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
time we know that the keyframe is likely

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.980 
time we know that the keyframe is likely
the<00:01:20.159> most<00:01:20.280> extreme<00:01:20.729> position<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.330> looking<00:01:21.869> at

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the most extreme position and looking at

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.539 
the most extreme position and looking at
the<00:01:22.080> bent<00:01:22.259> leg<00:01:22.350> we<00:01:22.650> can<00:01:22.799> see<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> crest

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the bent leg we can see that the crest

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.950 
the bent leg we can see that the crest
of<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.700> motion<00:01:24.119> where<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.390> highest<00:01:24.630> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
of the motion where it's highest is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.749 
of the motion where it's highest is
right<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.380> middle<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> phase<00:01:26.009> that'll

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
right in the middle of the phase that'll

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.370 
right in the middle of the phase that'll
come<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:26.909> handy<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.420> minute<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.049> look<00:01:28.259> at

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
come in handy in a minute if you look at

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.600 
come in handy in a minute if you look at
the<00:01:28.470> movement<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.890> torso<00:01:29.159> from<00:01:29.430> this

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
the movement of the torso from this

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.950 
the movement of the torso from this
angle<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.060> basically<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.720> ball

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
angle it's basically just a ball

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.390 
angle it's basically just a ball
bouncing<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.590> down<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> beat<00:01:32.159> and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
bouncing up and down with the beat and

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.490 
bouncing up and down with the beat and
the<00:01:32.939> down<00:01:33.150> position<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.869> same<00:01:33.900> frame<00:01:34.380> as

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
the down position is the same frame as

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
the down position is the same frame as
the<00:01:34.590> high<00:01:34.740> position<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> bent<00:01:35.549> leg<00:01:35.720> that

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
the high position of the bent leg that

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.999 
the high position of the bent leg that
looks<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.200> correct<00:01:37.500> frame<00:01:37.770> for<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
looks like the correct frame for the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.649 
looks like the correct frame for the
contact<00:01:38.400> position<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:38.939> let's<00:01:39.119> adjust<00:01:39.240> our

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
contact position so let's adjust our

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.330 
contact position so let's adjust our
chart<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.110> we<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.320> make<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:40.619> frame<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.189> of

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
chart so we can make that frame one of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.069 
chart so we can make that frame one of
our<00:01:41.460> cycle<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.270> same<00:01:42.479> key<00:01:42.720> for<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.960> other

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
our cycle and the same key for the other

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.080 
our cycle and the same key for the other
leg<00:01:43.140> will<00:01:43.439> be<00:01:43.500> at<00:01:43.590> frame<00:01:43.829> 10<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.310> made<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> scene

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
leg will be at frame 10 I made a scene

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
leg will be at frame 10 I made a scene
here<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.420> flash<00:01:45.720> change<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.290> frame<00:01:46.439> rate<00:01:46.500> to

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
here in flash change the frame rate to

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.039 
here in flash change the frame rate to
20<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.189> important<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> put<00:01:48.240> screencaps<00:01:48.840> of

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
20 for important and put screencaps of

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.410 
20 for important and put screencaps of

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the frames on a guide layer then on a

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.060 
the frames on a guide layer then on a
new<00:01:51.659> layer<00:01:51.869> i<00:01:51.930> quickly<00:01:52.290> roughed<00:01:52.710> over<00:01:52.979> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
new layer i quickly roughed over the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.340 
new layer i quickly roughed over the
image<00:01:53.310> with<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> brush<00:01:53.729> tool<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.180> also<00:01:55.049> made<00:01:55.320> a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
image with the brush tool I also made a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.020 
image with the brush tool I also made a
layer<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:55.799> mp3<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.399> song<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:56.880> can

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
layer with an mp3 of the song so I can

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.380 
layer with an mp3 of the song so I can
test<00:01:57.210> my<00:01:57.329> animation<00:01:57.840> in<00:01:57.960> time<00:01:58.110> with<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.350> beat

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.450 

it's<00:02:02.390> not<00:02:02.570> really<00:02:03.140> actually<00:02:03.680> moving<00:02:04.070> yet<00:02:04.250> but

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
it's not really actually moving yet but

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.859 
it's not really actually moving yet but
you<00:02:04.549> can<00:02:04.640> already<00:02:04.760> see<00:02:05.090> from<00:02:05.119> the<00:02:05.360> design<00:02:05.690> how

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
you can already see from the design how

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.719 
you can already see from the design how
the<00:02:05.930> front<00:02:06.229> legs<00:02:06.440> make<00:02:06.650> an<00:02:06.740> appealing<00:02:07.280> dynamic

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
the front legs make an appealing dynamic

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.249 
the front legs make an appealing dynamic
shape<00:02:07.940> that<00:02:08.209> look<00:02:08.420> nice<00:02:08.600> shifting<00:02:09.080> back<00:02:09.229> and

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
shape that look nice shifting back and

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.620 
shape that look nice shifting back and
forth<00:02:09.470> once<00:02:09.800> it's<00:02:09.920> actually<00:02:10.220> animated<00:02:10.700> also

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
forth once it's actually animated also

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.910 
forth once it's actually animated also
note<00:02:11.810> how<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.959> back<00:02:12.170> legs<00:02:12.440> have<00:02:12.590> the<00:02:12.680> same

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
note how the back legs have the same

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.710 
note how the back legs have the same
time<00:02:13.190> as<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.520> front<00:02:13.790> just<00:02:14.030> alternated

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
time as the front just alternated

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.940 
time as the front just alternated
they're<00:02:15.050> not<00:02:15.170> delayed<00:02:15.530> which<00:02:15.740> helps

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
they're not delayed which helps

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.860 
they're not delayed which helps
reinforce<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.670> beat<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:16.940> the<00:02:17.000> music<00:02:17.150> you<00:02:17.810> can

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
reinforce the beat of the music you can

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.350 
reinforce the beat of the music you can
also<00:02:17.989> see<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> pinkies<00:02:18.770> but<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.760> swaying<00:02:20.120> side

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
also see the pinkies but is swaying side

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.880 
also see the pinkies but is swaying side
to<00:02:20.420> side<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.900> counteract<00:02:21.350> the<00:02:21.440> swing<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.800> the

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
to side to counteract the swing of the

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.040 
to side to counteract the swing of the
leg<00:02:22.069> next<00:02:23.030> we<00:02:23.150> need<00:02:23.270> to<00:02:23.360> find<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> passing

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
leg next we need to find the passing

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.449 
leg next we need to find the passing
position<00:02:24.170> where<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.770> weight<00:02:24.920> is<00:02:24.950> off<00:02:25.220> the

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
position where the weight is off the

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:26.860 
position where the weight is off the
legs<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.880> torso<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.390> at<00:02:26.510> its<00:02:26.630> highest

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
legs and the torso is at its highest

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.600 
legs and the torso is at its highest
without<00:02:27.530> even<00:02:27.739> looking<00:02:28.010> at<00:02:28.069> safe<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> say<00:02:28.489> is

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
without even looking at safe to say is

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.070 
without even looking at safe to say is
probably<00:02:28.730> somewhere<00:02:29.239> halfway<00:02:29.660> between<00:02:29.810> the

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
probably somewhere halfway between the

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.500 
probably somewhere halfway between the
contact<00:02:30.530> keys<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:31.610> answer<00:02:31.880> looks<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.300> be<00:02:32.390> at

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
contact keys the answer looks to be at

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.479 
contact keys the answer looks to be at
frame<00:02:32.780> six<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.260> 15<00:02:33.680> which<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:33.950> also<00:02:34.190> where<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
frame six and 15 which is also where the

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.009 
frame six and 15 which is also where the
legs<00:02:34.730> switch<00:02:35.060> between<00:02:35.420> being<00:02:35.630> bent<00:02:35.900> and

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
legs switch between being bent and

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:37.420 
legs switch between being bent and
straight<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:36.620> we'll<00:02:36.769> add<00:02:36.890> those<00:02:37.130> to<00:02:37.400> our

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
straight so we'll add those to our

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.540 
straight so we'll add those to our
animation<00:02:37.850> as<00:02:38.090> our<00:02:38.180> remaining<00:02:38.450> keys<00:02:42.489> now<00:02:43.489> we

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
animation as our remaining keys now we

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.370 
animation as our remaining keys now we
can<00:02:43.940> say<00:02:44.120> our<00:02:44.150> animation<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:44.810> actually<00:02:44.959> moving

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
can say our animation is actually moving

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.100 
can say our animation is actually moving
it's<00:02:46.340> stiff<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.000> choppy<00:02:47.390> and<00:02:47.660> if<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.810> look<00:02:47.989> at

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
it's stiff and choppy and if you look at

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.330 
it's stiff and choppy and if you look at
it<00:02:48.200> long<00:02:48.320> enough<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.620> actually<00:02:48.890> sort<00:02:49.070> of<00:02:49.160> looks

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
it long enough it actually sort of looks

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.009 
it long enough it actually sort of looks
like<00:02:49.400> it's<00:02:49.580> going<00:02:49.790> backwards<00:02:50.000> but<00:02:50.750> it's

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
like it's going backwards but it's

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.620 
like it's going backwards but it's
functional<00:02:51.580> we've<00:02:52.580> got<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.820> basic<00:02:53.150> timing<00:02:53.540> of

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
functional we've got the basic timing of

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.940 
functional we've got the basic timing of
the<00:02:53.690> movement<00:02:54.019> nailed<00:02:54.170> down<00:02:54.380> which<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.769> what's

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
the movement nailed down which is what's

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.650 
the movement nailed down which is what's
important<00:02:55.459> because<00:02:55.820> if<00:02:56.030> it<00:02:56.120> doesn't<00:02:56.360> work<00:02:56.510> at

beginning of our analysis remember how I

straight leg does it crest in the middle
to<00:03:25.549> which<00:03:26.150> we'll<00:03:26.299> put<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.510> right<00:03:26.660> on<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.959> beat

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
to which we'll put it right on the beat

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.850 
to which we'll put it right on the beat
just<00:03:27.230> like<00:03:27.709> the<00:03:27.829> bent<00:03:28.010> leg<00:03:28.209> no<00:03:29.209> it<00:03:29.510> doesn't<00:03:30.049> its

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
just like the bent leg no it doesn't its

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.350 
just like the bent leg no it doesn't its
most<00:03:31.130> extreme<00:03:31.370> position<00:03:31.610> it's<00:03:31.970> actually<00:03:32.209> two

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
most extreme position it's actually two

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.000 
most extreme position it's actually two
frames<00:03:32.660> earlier<00:03:33.170> which<00:03:33.590> would<00:03:33.709> make<00:03:33.890> it

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
frames earlier which would make it

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.090 
frames earlier which would make it
frames<00:03:34.280> 8<00:03:34.519> and<00:03:34.730> 17<00:03:35.030> in<00:03:35.420> our<00:03:35.540> animation<00:03:36.100> having

this extreme ahead of the beats serves

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.420 
this extreme ahead of the beats serves
two<00:03:38.810> purposes

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
two purposes

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.949 
two purposes
first<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.700> creates<00:03:40.850> an<00:03:41.060> accent<00:03:41.540> for<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.780> beat

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
first it creates an accent for the beat

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.569 
first it creates an accent for the beat
emphasizing<00:03:42.769> the<00:03:42.859> weight<00:03:43.010> coming<00:03:43.220> down<00:03:43.310> and

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
emphasizing the weight coming down and

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.060 
emphasizing the weight coming down and
giving<00:03:43.670> more<00:03:43.940> visual<00:03:44.359> mm<00:03:44.989> to<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.890> hoof

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
giving more visual mm to the hoof

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.160 
giving more visual mm to the hoof
hitting<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:46.459> ground<00:03:46.700> it's<00:03:47.600> also<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.900> general

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
hitting the ground it's also a general

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.780 
hitting the ground it's also a general
rule<00:03:48.350> of<00:03:48.410> thumb<00:03:48.530> in<00:03:48.829> animation<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.489> visual

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
rule of thumb in animation that visual

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.490 
rule of thumb in animation that visual
access<00:03:50.090> tend<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.480> feel<00:03:50.720> better<00:03:50.900> placed<00:03:51.320> a

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
access tend to feel better placed a

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.520 
access tend to feel better placed a
frame<00:03:51.769> or<00:03:51.920> two<00:03:51.950> before<00:03:52.340> the<00:03:52.459> actual<00:03:52.760> sound

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
frame or two before the actual sound

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.810 
frame or two before the actual sound
secondly<00:03:54.530> by<00:03:54.680> moving<00:03:54.890> the<00:03:55.100> step<00:03:55.370> two<00:03:55.579> frames

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
secondly by moving the step two frames

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.729 
secondly by moving the step two frames
earlier<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.570> bent<00:03:56.840> leg<00:03:56.930> now<00:03:57.290> has<00:03:57.500> fewer

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
earlier the bent leg now has fewer

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.770 
earlier the bent leg now has fewer
frames<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.190> come<00:03:58.370> down<00:03:58.579> which<00:03:59.209> means<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.600> leg

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
frames to come down which means the leg

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.420 
frames to come down which means the leg
moves<00:03:59.989> faster<00:04:00.440> going<00:04:00.590> down<00:04:00.890> than<00:04:01.160> it<00:04:01.250> does

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
moves faster going down than it does

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.460 
moves faster going down than it does
coming<00:04:01.730> up<00:04:01.880> giving<00:04:02.390> us<00:04:02.570> that<00:04:02.690> snappy<00:04:03.140> feeling

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
coming up giving us that snappy feeling

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.630 
coming up giving us that snappy feeling
we're<00:04:03.590> looking<00:04:03.829> for

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
we're looking for

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.520 
we're looking for
as<00:04:04.880> you<00:04:05.030> can<00:04:05.120> see<00:04:05.300> that<00:04:05.450> one<00:04:05.810> extra<00:04:06.050> drawing

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
as you can see that one extra drawing

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.050 
as you can see that one extra drawing
per<00:04:06.710> step<00:04:06.980> made<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.190> huge<00:04:07.550> change<00:04:07.880> in<00:04:07.970> the

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
per step made a huge change in the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.960 
per step made a huge change in the
feeling<00:04:08.420> of<00:04:08.510> this<00:04:08.600> walk<00:04:08.840> I<00:04:09.340> also<00:04:10.340> draw<00:04:10.670> frames

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
feeling of this walk I also draw frames

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.190 
feeling of this walk I also draw frames
three<00:04:11.240> and<00:04:11.360> twelve<00:04:11.569> at<00:04:11.690> this<00:04:11.810> point<00:04:12.050> but

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
three and twelve at this point but

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.990 
three and twelve at this point but
they're<00:04:12.350> not<00:04:12.560> really<00:04:12.830> break<00:04:13.160> downs<00:04:13.400> just

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
they're not really break downs just

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.490 
they're not really break downs just
basic<00:04:14.390> in-betweens<00:04:14.900> to<00:04:14.990> smooth<00:04:15.230> out<00:04:15.380> the

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
basic in-betweens to smooth out the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.250 
basic in-betweens to smooth out the
motion<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.920> step<00:04:16.190> so<00:04:16.340> it<00:04:16.459> looks<00:04:16.609> less<00:04:16.760> jerky

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
motion the step so it looks less jerky

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.900 
motion the step so it looks less jerky
frames<00:04:18.260> 5<00:04:18.470> and<00:04:18.680> 14<00:04:19.070> are<00:04:19.220> sort<00:04:19.400> of<00:04:19.489> like<00:04:19.579> a<00:04:19.609> mini

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
frames 5 and 14 are sort of like a mini

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.789 
frames 5 and 14 are sort of like a mini
breakdown<00:04:20.239> they<00:04:20.660> help<00:04:20.900> shape<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.380> motion

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
breakdown they help shape the motion

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.050 
breakdown they help shape the motion
instead<00:04:22.070> of<00:04:22.130> just<00:04:22.340> smoothing<00:04:22.610> things<00:04:22.850> out

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
instead of just smoothing things out

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
remaining frames just move it out
