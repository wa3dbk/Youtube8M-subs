whenever when you're in high school in

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.850 
whenever when you're in high school in
college<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.260> what<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.500> would<00:02:13.620> kind<00:02:13.830> of

younger you you you get very protective

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.410 
younger you you you get very protective
and<00:02:31.290> defensive<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.010> your<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:33.090> your<00:02:33.270> own

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
identity and and and you want to

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.280 
identity and and and you want to
validate<00:02:35.940> that<00:02:36.300> your<00:02:36.510> position<00:02:37.020> in<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> world

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290

versus other peoples and stuff like that

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.180 
versus other peoples and stuff like that
so<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.290> happens<00:02:40.590> when<00:02:40.770> you're<00:02:40.890> young<00:02:41.160> and

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
that's a fun thing it's why people like

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.270 
that's a fun thing it's why people like
aligned<00:02:42.989> with<00:02:43.170> sports<00:02:43.410> teams<00:02:43.709> they<00:02:43.950> like<00:02:44.130> this

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
aligned with sports teams they like this

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.309 
aligned with sports teams they like this
is<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:45.030> like<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.390> team<00:02:45.600> like<00:02:46.020> why<00:02:46.170> do<00:02:46.230> you

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
is the I like this team like why do you

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.140 
is the I like this team like why do you
like<00:02:46.500> once<00:02:46.680> one<00:02:47.160> baseball<00:02:47.790> team<00:02:47.940> more<00:02:48.120> than

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
like once one baseball team more than

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.780 
like once one baseball team more than
the<00:02:48.420> other<00:02:48.590> it's<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:49.920> that's<00:02:50.250> how<00:02:50.430> that's<00:02:50.700> a

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
the other it's just that's how that's a

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.190 
the other it's just that's how that's a
part<00:02:51.060> of<00:02:51.150> your<00:02:51.300> that's<00:02:51.780> part<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.080> your

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
part of your that's part of your

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.630 
part of your that's part of your
identity<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.860> so<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.010> think<00:02:53.100> that<00:02:53.340> happens

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
identity and so I think that happens

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.830 
identity and so I think that happens
with<00:02:53.760> rock<00:02:53.970> bands<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.510> think<00:02:54.660> that's<00:02:54.780> a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
with rock bands and I think that's a

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.290 
with rock bands and I think that's a
cool<00:02:54.989> thing<00:02:55.170> it's<00:02:55.410> like<00:02:55.880> but<00:02:56.880> as<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.150> get

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
cool thing it's like but as you get

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.160 
cool thing it's like but as you get
older<00:02:57.570> and<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.750> grow<00:02:57.989> up<00:02:58.019> in<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:59.150> you<00:03:00.170> realize

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
older and you grow up in and you realize

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.020 
older and you grow up in and you realize
that<00:03:01.200> you<00:03:01.530> just<00:03:01.709> start<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:01.920> find<00:03:02.190> the<00:03:02.670> beauty

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
that you just start to find the beauty

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.160 
that you just start to find the beauty
and<00:03:03.120> so<00:03:03.360> many<00:03:03.569> different<00:03:03.840> things<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.050> you

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
and so many different things that you

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.500 
and so many different things that you
kind<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.560> maybe<00:03:05.069> turn<00:03:05.340> your<00:03:05.519> nose<00:03:05.730> up<00:03:05.760> at<00:03:06.769> and

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
kind of maybe turn your nose up at and

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.759 
kind of maybe turn your nose up at and
yeah<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:09.720> so<00:03:10.019> I<00:03:10.050> think<00:03:10.140> a<00:03:10.319> lot<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.470> people<00:03:10.650> now

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
yeah so so I think a lot of people now

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.710 
yeah so so I think a lot of people now
are<00:03:10.920> like<00:03:11.040> are<00:03:11.310> happy<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:12.150> come<00:03:12.180> out<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.630> not

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
are like are happy to come out and not

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.559 
are like are happy to come out and not
not<00:03:12.930> being<00:03:13.140> so<00:03:13.670> worried<00:03:14.670> about<00:03:14.730> being<00:03:15.060> being

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
not being so worried about being being

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.870 
not being so worried about being being
whatever<00:03:16.170> a<00:03:16.410> definition<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.100> cool<00:03:17.280> was<00:03:17.580> when

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
whatever a definition of cool was when

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.520 
whatever a definition of cool was when
they<00:03:18.030> were<00:03:18.090> in<00:03:18.269> high<00:03:18.540> school<00:03:18.600> in<00:03:18.900> college<00:03:18.930> and
