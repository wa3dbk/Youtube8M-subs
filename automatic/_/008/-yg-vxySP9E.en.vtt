um<00:03:30.280> but<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.670> I<00:03:31.850> think<00:03:32.150> that<00:03:32.269> um<00:03:32.420> the<00:03:32.450> other

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
um but it I think that um the other

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.210 
um but it I think that um the other
chapters<00:03:33.019> listed<00:03:33.500> probably<00:03:33.739> saw<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:33.920> least

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
play overall but it wasn't really

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.569 
play overall but it wasn't really

popular parcel even signed it when

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:39.580 
popular parcel even signed it when
you're<00:03:38.209> facing<00:03:38.450> decks<00:03:38.870> that<00:03:39.019> had<00:03:39.170> monster

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
you're facing decks that had monster

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.089 
effect to that great in town weird place
and<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.480> was<00:03:41.600> really

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:42.099 
and it was really

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:44.759 
and it was really
so<00:03:42.489> that's<00:03:43.359> one<00:03:43.569> of<00:03:43.599> my<00:03:43.689> cards<00:03:44.079> next<00:03:44.469> cards

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
so that's one of my cards next cards

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.119 
so that's one of my cards next cards
dust<00:03:45.040> tornado<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:46.540> there<00:03:47.079> was<00:03:47.170> a<00:03:47.200> time<00:03:47.469> when<00:03:47.950> it

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
dust tornado so there was a time when it

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.830 
dust tornado so there was a time when it
must<00:03:48.280> use<00:03:48.459> a<00:03:48.489> one<00:03:48.879> I<00:03:48.909> know<00:03:49.120> believe<00:03:49.540> it<00:03:49.569> or<00:03:49.689> not

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
must use a one I know believe it or not

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.050 
must use a one I know believe it or not
and<00:03:50.170> so<00:03:50.349> what<00:03:50.530> MST<00:03:50.859> was<00:03:50.980> a<00:03:51.040> one<00:03:51.249> heavy<00:03:51.670> was<00:03:51.819> also

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
and so what MST was a one heavy was also

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.789 
and so what MST was a one heavy was also
one<00:03:52.239> but<00:03:52.540> we're<00:03:52.659> gonna<00:03:52.749> ignore<00:03:53.409> that<00:03:53.469> for<00:03:53.739> a

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
one but we're gonna ignore that for a
