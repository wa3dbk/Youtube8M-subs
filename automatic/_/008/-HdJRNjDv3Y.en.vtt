 agent sandwich 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.449
 being here 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.360
 CLCV 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.740
 and percent of all rafah intervening companies 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340
 rv the intrepid clichy of small novelties 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 and then I wanted to make drawings 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.030
 we draw the lessons 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.230
 the study 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.560
 on the drawing 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.670
 it's actually she's here 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.260
 is there a Swiss bonus graduate who is animated 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.020
 10 5 million 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.840
 google read for four years 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.100
 but i'm proud of her and wilfrid tocque crs patrick 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.799
 it's not the ones we call the best but here or that of the comic 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.050
 for me it is she has mediatized 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.330
 there is nothing for 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.780
 artistic 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780
 even if we except of course 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.450
 then on a world a full-fledged engine since it is rather the 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.790
 cartoon Bordeaux technician 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.100
 and she because in fact it is the release does not trust franÃ§ois 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.090
 saint-louis missouri 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.090
 hjc carte blanche in front of the west 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.430
 in other countries without denying that he was cowardly 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.460
 but there are many people who like 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.340
 gm is in particular they are rather authors let loose a lot of ways 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.630
 but they are all stakeholders and the public 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.550
 % one year ago 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.640
 I would not be here 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.480
 I am Christian 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.480
 I also like it a lot better than takashi 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.329
 worse after others 

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.619
 one of the other 

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:14.529
 earlier in the programming and I really like what he does epate 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.559
 for example Tuesday the ministry 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:18.870
 and percent 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.089
 nothing 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.089
 why I do not have a lot of rhythm it creates a toxic flow 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:24.849
 a father for me 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.849
 but if a lot of help asked with billy burke 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:32.439
 it's jubilation and cons 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:35.439
 quality plutonium 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.859
 a clsc decal in the focus of politics 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.069
 and to get infected 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.679
 all the influences that the daily according to a he ever again 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:57.919
 % at the time I was young I can be seduced if Europe can excel 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.329
 to others because he is 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.459
 it's because it's actually a month the means but it's not really 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.169
 the chance to see shine 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.139
 but we could your franco-belgian bd by afp 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.139
 for sandrine ram who leave the police 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.699
 and I found that in the manga in unemployment 

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.229
 laughter and trapping of vlc media player 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.239
 and so here's caxias naming direction the famous series he tells 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:24.719
 the afp 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:25.969
 and percent 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.129
 and so for the rest it's a mix ever 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:30.549
 decidedly fit 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.040
 no i do not want things to happen philippe chaulet 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.390
 and if it was yesterday 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:36.839
 it was a bit 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:37.889
 valves 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.889
 pathetic light fernand he rubs shoulders 

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.339
 it's a wonderful romanticism 

00:03:45.339 --> 00:03:48.829
 however this is really the way when everything I wanted to 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.829
 sign 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.579
 already subject to a very large fine 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:58.799
 still dsk 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.779
 former subsidiary 6% 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:04.779
 even if this one is a little more equity he said at the site 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.140
 the same scenes but it's like that 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.439
 holder tonight 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.749
 by the summer a smic rolled out the english-speaking canada movies and series 

00:04:15.399 --> 00:04:18.599
 this confirms that I come with a lot of fun with seriousness 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.909
 and trap hands 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.129
 in front of Jeremy 

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:26.639
 and r 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:28.309
 and by 

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:29.610
 to your question 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.639
 yes it's a real character 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.639
 character this major impasse form 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.409
 though for the cyclists can recognize themselves in what 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:40.289
 means that if 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.289
 who knows how to seize them is the court of cassation 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.039
 this is common in volunteers and in this sense
