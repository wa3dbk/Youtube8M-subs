00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.200
 in life in which direction to move and 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.630

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.480
 ability to animate not spiritualized

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.790
 always go ahead go ahead through 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.480
 difficulties that will be on the way without them 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.340
 no way 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.650
 if someone thinks he is up to something 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:56.660

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.859
 gives impetus to spend every single day
