figure that out release me yes I see
there's<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.759> light<00:00:33.030> flashing<00:00:33.600> on<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.780> kinect

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
there's a light flashing on the kinect

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.979 
there's a light flashing on the kinect
sensor<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:36.059> as<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.270> use<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.510> device<00:00:36.719> an

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
sensor and it's as to use this device an

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.380 
sensor and it's as to use this device an
update<00:00:37.290> must<00:00:37.469> be<00:00:37.559> applied<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.210> guys

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
update must be applied so if you guys

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.049 
update must be applied so if you guys
still<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.530> after<00:00:41.129> getting<00:00:41.460> kinect<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:41.969> you

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
still have after getting kinect if you

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.479 
still have after getting kinect if you
still<00:00:42.480> have<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.780> controller<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.559> guess<00:00:44.190> now's

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
still have a controller I guess now's

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.830 
still have a controller I guess now's
when<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.760> might<00:00:44.910> want<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> turn<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.420> use<00:00:45.660> it

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
when you might want to turn on use it

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.190 
when you might want to turn on use it
just<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.559> do<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.309> update<00:00:47.730> if<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.840> have<00:00:49.050> one

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
just to do the update if you have one

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.170 
just to do the update if you have one
nexus<00:00:49.440> right<00:00:49.649> so<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.190> looks<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.460> kinect<00:00:51.000> is

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
nexus right so it looks like kinect is

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.380 
nexus right so it looks like kinect is
ready<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.629> go<00:00:52.340> right<00:00:53.340> there<00:00:53.610> ready<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
ready to go right there ready to be the

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.270 
ready to go right there ready to be the
controller<00:00:54.750> let's<00:00:55.079> set<00:00:55.320> up<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.190> we're

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
controller let's set up so what we're

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
controller let's set up so what we're
going<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.460> do<00:00:56.520> now<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:56.940> press<00:00:57.780> a<00:00:57.960> to<00:00:57.989> continue

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
going to do now is press a to continue

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.630 
going to do now is press a to continue
so<00:00:58.590> we're<00:00:58.680> going<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.859> go<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.129> press<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.430> on<00:00:59.460> our

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
so we're going to go and press a on our

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.119 
so we're going to go and press a on our
controller<00:01:00.710> hopefully<00:01:01.710> this<00:01:01.800> will<00:01:01.859> be<00:01:01.949> one<00:01:02.070> of

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
controller hopefully this will be one of

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.950 
controller hopefully this will be one of
the<00:01:02.190> last<00:01:02.280> times<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> use<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.030> best

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
the last times you have to use this best

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.539 
the last times you have to use this best
position<00:01:04.409> make<00:01:04.680> sure<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.979> controller<00:01:05.309> is

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
position make sure your controller is

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.850 
position make sure your controller is

over there you guys can see sensor
placed<00:01:18.979> this<00:01:19.979> process<00:01:20.400> will<00:01:20.549> open<00:01:20.759> go<00:01:20.939> start

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
placed this process will open go start

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.880 
placed this process will open go start
by<00:01:21.689> checking<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.140> background<00:01:22.560> noise<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.860> your

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
by checking the background noise in your

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.039 
by checking the background noise in your
room<00:01:23.250> when<00:01:23.640> available<00:01:23.970> alright<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.720> let's<00:01:24.869> go

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
room when available alright so let's go

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.020 
room when available alright so let's go
ahead<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.350> press<00:01:25.890> test<00:01:26.220> background<00:01:26.700> noise

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.219 

alright<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.479> had<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.750> quite<00:01:34.079> as

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
alright so it had to be quite as

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.780 
alright so it had to be quite as
possible<00:01:34.380> Ted<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:34.979> now<00:01:35.130> your<00:01:35.400> background

possible Ted and now your background

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.240 
possible Ted and now your background
noise<00:01:35.970> level<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.479> okay<00:01:37.020> make<00:01:37.979> sure<00:01:38.009> the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
noise level is okay make sure the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.859 
noise level is okay make sure the
speaker<00:01:38.520> volume<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.939> at<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.180> level<00:01:39.360> you<00:01:39.509> use

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
speaker volume is at the level you use

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.210 
speaker volume is at the level you use
to<00:01:40.020> play<00:01:40.200> games<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.740> will<00:01:40.920> check<00:01:41.070> your

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
to play games this will check your

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.490 
to play games this will check your
speaker<00:01:41.460> volume<00:01:41.610> by<00:01:42.360> playing<00:01:42.689> some<00:01:42.899> sound

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500

much<00:01:50.500> bigger<00:01:50.650> levels<00:01:51.010> okay<00:01:52.320> this<00:01:53.320> test<00:01:53.560> will

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
much bigger levels okay this test will

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.380 
much bigger levels okay this test will
use<00:01:53.860> sound<00:01:54.160> to<00:01:54.280> help<00:01:54.490> orient<00:01:54.730> connect<00:01:55.240> in<00:01:55.360> your
