00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 but hey hello to all guys and how to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.359
 they are usually francs and today I am here for 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.359
 this new installment of frank man 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.759
 imagine the scene of the genre at home 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.220
 yours with some of your friends and you have 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.480
 decided to play some video games 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.800
 very well he had just decided to 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.289
 ruin our final friendship 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.300
 yes because according to many studies and second 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.099
 many searches play video games with i 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.349
 your friends and there are tours 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.000
 competitive causes a great deal 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.010
 breaking your friendship was 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.350
 how many times you find yourself having to 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.719
 master on your there because 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.969
 let us frankly say how many of you 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.040
 they had the courage to put themselves like 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.329
 that year 2 when to avoid some 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.100
 your friend at your home 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.629
 no one can because there is a kind of 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.760
 pride a kind of real 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.250
 respect should be superior to him 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.260
 in all and for all, only one 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.230
 person is able to explain everything to us 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.629
 this in a few simple words if 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.879
 you know who I'm talking to and although I am 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.339
 much loved and although we are despised 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.360
 unsurpassed unparalleled but above all 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.040
 the variable 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.560
 I was freezing so welcome to this one 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.020
 new part of the corner piero also i 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.299
 your friends cause ruins of ours 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.220
 friendship well according to many studies such as 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.960
 even my friends cause 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.939
 definitely a big break in the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.220
 friendship relationship really when 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.439
 enter the house of others and yours 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.100
 sense of pride compared to the matches 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.439
 previous 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.450
 there is more and more there has never been 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.540
 in fact a case in which a player does 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.310
 is shown 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.890
 so much so much weaker 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.890
 derisory enough to have to give up the post of 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.290
 character the number one to his friend 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.770
 it is said that according to the team of 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:50.650
 mystery the player one actually is in 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.080
 close connection with the highs and if 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.780
 I in collaboration with mystery there 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.150
 we propose to achieve naturally 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.490
 following our style which is to 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.530
 inform you without being afraid and 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.530
 resorting to when it is also necessary to 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.950
 irony and sympathy 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.929
 so premised I wish you a good one 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.240
 vision 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:17.950
 behave yourself because you want it so much 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:20.290
 same to you how many times he happened 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.120
 of having to lose against shows in which 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.740
 they are therefore the nations you have with 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.080
 he after somebody is there 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.660
 who reacts well, for example, reacts well 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.940
 always register well calm and calm 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.160
 ugly asshole present but how is you 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.320
 it occurred to me to challenge the meter e 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.390
 when tudini in my house with 23 taxi 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.540
 threshold of the door of my house not 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.630
 you can afford to have to carry or give 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.489
 even assimilating weapons and not even winning 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.560
 because it means winning only because 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:49.450
 I of the star reads and if as they say 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.640
 because I didn't let you lynch her 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.400
 it is called and that unusual radio which 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.569
 in some strange way more just because 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.849
 normally modified 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:00.180
 the heel on the fly and then only in that 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.639
 chance I can tell you that not only way 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.049
 idiot 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.370
 let's say these shots of arrival 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.650
 maybe it's better than yeast because 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.930
 otherwise I bet between three and four 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.930
 that of nervous foods 6 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:24.909
 I lost the air in conclusion 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.859
 what were your relationships with 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.900
 your friends while you play color 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:31.629
 video games you are friendly or you are 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.180
 assholes are kind or you are 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.219
 never played or if they must above all 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.719
 in short, how many times it happened to me 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.840
 having to win with how many times in the 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:42.549
 path of having to lose and above all 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.949
 the most essential question of all 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.840
 the one that will probably cause one 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:49.540
 world catastrophe and the one that must 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.930
 impallare do our youtube server, but 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.599
 it has ever happened to you in your life 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.840
 of having to give in to your home 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.930
 the player 1 to your friend 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.659
 have courage and tell me why if 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.290
 you are form the people I am in 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:11.169
 first person I will go to put in 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.019
 your mind to try to help them 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:16.090
 because these things are resolved a 1 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.310
 we put ourselves and we solve these things 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.759
 because they are unacceptable 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.180
 certain things must be resolved, vote for me 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.180
 new future 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.910
 but apart from all this I would say that with 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.740
 this very great 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.840
 the episode we can also conclude 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.550
 here then let me know ultimately 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.230
 what do you think of all this 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.170
 great topic in the comments here 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.900
 below and I remind you that I will come 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:45.050
 got real extrapolated inside the 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.060
 next episode is jay wait for a 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.620
 moment to know now has arrived 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.500
 time to show what was the 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.610
 comment of the last episode that if 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.220
 award two come out from below and with 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.600
 an incredibly cold 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.780
 increasing that more and more seeks to 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.330
 take advantage of my body of mine 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.610
 dÃ¼rer skill neo-neurosis systems 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.290
 looking for today cycling has as its theme the 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.030
 extension choice of the next episode 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.530
 very fashion 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.020
 see you for a next episode 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.020
 as always straight verdict
