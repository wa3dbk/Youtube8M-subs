00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.840
 We are full 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.850
 look forward to 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.569
 But we are not expecting a miracle 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.969
 Or is it an exact 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.269
 solution. 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.739
 Simultaneously, 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.730
 We did not expect such a big progress. 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.000
 Just 15 days 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.470
 After the first injection 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.749
 We saw the effect 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.579
 We are really excited. 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.070
 improving 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.440
 possibility 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.300
 And the quality of life of Renzo 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.470
 Become a real possibility. 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.150
 This is true 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.150
 Greatly inspired us. 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.640
 I am Enrique Centurión 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.910
 Me and my son Renzo 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.809
 Together. 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.650
 We are from Argentina. 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.969
 Renzo suffers 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:07.470
 Congenital cerebral palsy. 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.530
 because 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.960
 Some complicated reasons in the production process 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.910
 Causing him hypoxia and 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.130
 Causing his brain to be deprived of oxygen, 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.330
 Influenced him 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.700
 whole body 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.860
 Motor function, 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.250
 Especially his right half of the body. 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.580
 his 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.090
 Brain palsy 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.090
 Make 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.370
 His daily life has become difficult. 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.180
 For example, go to the bathroom, wear clothes, 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.850
 Eating and so on are all problems. 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.070
 As his family, 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.719
 We help him 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.820
 Do these things. 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.180
 He still lacks some ability 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.479
 To achieve complete self-care. 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.660
 Since the age of 6, 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.720
 Renzo’s physical condition reached a stagnation period. 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.930
 This is the reason why we came to Beike for treatment. 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.840
 Even if Renzo receives a series of rehabilitation treatments, 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.999
 But the efficacy of rehabilitation 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.909
 It is limited. 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.399
 In fact, Renzo only needs 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.799
 A little more progress, 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.439
 He will be able to take care of himself. 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.969
 We see the possibility of achieving this goal from stem cell therapy. 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:27.169
 Only on the 15th day after the first shot, 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.839
 We are welcoming a very exciting moment, 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:30.930
 He can 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.940
 done. 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.899
 This seems to have only progressed a little bit 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:36.780
 But it is of great significance to Renzo. 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.399
 Now he can hold the cup by himself and drink water by himself. 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.049
 Write with your right hand, 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.989
 Wear clothes and t-shirts, 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.080
 Right hand 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.059
 take things. 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.919
 For him, this is a big step forward. 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:59.099
 Another change we noticed is 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.659
 His upper body, his legs 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.179
 More powerful. His various postures have become more standard. 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.739
 He can go a long way. 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.019
 He can only walk a few blocks before treatment. 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.179
 After a few months of treatment, he can walk to 2-3 kilometers. 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:19.779
 Second time receiving stem cell therapy 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.380
 after that, 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.939
 We found his 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.089
 Muscle's ability to exercise autonomously 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:26.829
 increased. 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.519
 He used to 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.089
 often 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:34.099
 doing 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.199
 Muscle contraction 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.349
 when 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.519
 Compare with me 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.969
 However yesterday 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:44.790
 He can 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.470
 done. 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.639
 and also 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.459
 we 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.060
 Really very happy. Renzo called us in the past and showed us the results. 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.579
 His ability to control his right hand 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.419
 increased. 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.770
 Before, he was very difficult to do 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.409
 this point. 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.449
 Now he can use his right hand more flexibly. 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:12.869
 We are very grateful 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.369
 Beike staff and hospital staff 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.769
 Give us help during the treatment. 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:18.989
 The staff here, 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.609
 Doctors, nurses, etc. 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.039
 They are all very professional. 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.419
 Yes, 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.729
 Here 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.199
 Everything 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.479
 They are very beautiful. 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.749
 This institution 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.539
 Really very good, 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.050
 Rehabilitation here 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.559
 And the staff 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.120
 Professional level 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.120
 They are very high. 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.710
 Catering provided here 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.059
 Also very 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:50.889
 health. 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.199
 Everything 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.580
 Indispensable, 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.210
 Not only the role of stem cells 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.400
 Also includes 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.580
 For the patient's body 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.469
 Careful care. 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.189
 Renzo's skin 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.520
 Getting better 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.139
 His body 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.620
 It is also stronger. In general, 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.400
 We believe this is a very positive and positive experience. 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.610
 No doubt, we will recommend 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.479
 Stem cells to other friends in need, 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.159
 Based on our experience, 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.849
 This is a simple 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.070
 And non-invasive 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.099
 treatment. 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:32.889
 this is 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.939
 based on 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:36.629
 What we see and hear here 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:39.889
 And our experience 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.240
 Still based 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.400
 We and other patients 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.289
 Talk 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.520
 Drawn 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.879
 in conclusion. 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.100
 We feel great, 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.800
 The staff here are very friendly and take care of us. 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.640
 We are very grateful for this. 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.720
 I am also very happy that Renzo has a chance. 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.880
 Accept this treatment.
