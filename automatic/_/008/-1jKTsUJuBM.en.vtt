00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:17.760

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.439
 fun scaly growths to 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.880
 destroy them 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:33.719

 I prefer the usual 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.500
 unrefined sunflower oil and 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.020
 the higher it is the better the wand for the ears 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.020
 I thickly lubricate the affected places 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:07.850
 scares oil and blogs and eyes and 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:14.340

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.280
 with an interval of three to four days during this time 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.070
 looking for die and here are these growths 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.549
 break off 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.259

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.700
