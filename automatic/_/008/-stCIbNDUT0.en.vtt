00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.950
 In 2006, the university received mannheim im 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.719
 framework of the Excellence Initiative 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.929
 Commitment to the promotion of a doctoral candidate 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:15.230
 center the graduate school of economic 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.760
 and social sciences cass was created by bund 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.310
 and land for over five years with six 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.950
 million euros funded in the second 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.660
 round of the 2012 Excellence Initiative was 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.970
 the uni with the guests again for five 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.950
 years successful she is the nationwide 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.900
 first graduate school with common 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.250
 doctoral education for economics 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.840
 and social scientists 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.219
 Her focus is on that 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.749
 empirical and quantitative methods 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.850
 corinna hellmann already has her diploma in 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:42.829
 bwl at the uni mannheim made now 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.050
 she works on her doctor in the field 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.089
 She has marketing for her dissertation 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.620
 many unis would have looked at too 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.719
 like to go abroad 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.510
 but the advantages of the guests they held 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.399
 in the kurpfalz the program of the ges 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.780
 really seemed to be among all of me now 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.879
 programs I have looked at 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.120
 simply as the most meaningful and west 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.790
 So from the course program heer of too 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.020
 of the things in which they are 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.360
 For example, they help us 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.220
 my research is intercultural and 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.170
 the guests also support that in the 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.340
 she helps me with this 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.740
 that I can go abroad 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.150
 financially and of course ideal in 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.190
 In the sense you could say that they are 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.200
 well and encourage me in that 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.690
 I'm currently doing research on that 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.100
 26-year-old the price hearings 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.170
 different cultures 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.390
 she is among others in china the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.340
 usa and soon in australia on the way 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.230
 she thinks that she is in 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.210
 a full course for the first two years 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:40.430
 program completes others 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.830
 getting to know doctorates is difficult 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.540
 So get in touch and that way 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.700
 to take what others actually do 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.890
 knows a lot about their own research what 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.150
 But the people at the chair do it 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.580
 do not know so much what does actually 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.230
 the whole university and the guests opened 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.340
 this one possibility that one there 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:57.470
 a little bit more through this 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.420
 interdisciplinarity this simply gives 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.950
 a bit more notice the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.080
 At first doctoral students are really 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.700
 students they perish so 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.860
 throughout a two-year 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.539
 course program and so first time that 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.970
 Handicraft I say my first 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.250
 get taught what is this year 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.560
 technically methodical craft tool and 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.480
 in the second year 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.670
 then you get the content missed 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.380
 the processed with this craft tool 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.830
 can be or edited 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.599
 can 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.940
 the graduate school consists of three 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.810
 integrated doctorate centers beside 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.340
 business economics and 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.770
 Economics are that 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.819
 social sciences more accurate 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.450
 political science sociology and 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.130
 psychology 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.590
 usually is a very good one 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.840
 master degree admission requirement in 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.880
 exceptionally, the bachelor's rich 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.790
 Excellent Excellent lures the best 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.620
 Heads it is easy to see for 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.780
 the students on the one hand on the 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.670
 become aware of us and then join us 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.340
 to apply and come to us 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.340
 and it just increases the quality of the 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.870
 application enormous and on the other 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.610
 page also allows us a good one 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.880
 offer to structure with the money 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.410
 we can hire and we have very good heads 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.739
 so that the people also offer what I 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.080
 expect to get close to 230 doctoral students 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.549
 almost 100 lecturers of offspring like 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.590
 Teachers become academic 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.090
 services expected we would like people 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.160
 they are international 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.799
 Leading to publicize and important 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.850
 to make relevant contributions to 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.650
 attention 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.239
 the focus on empirical and 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.519
 quantitative methods comes florian 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.290
 Scharnitzky contrary to math 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.180
 His research studies in Heidelberg to 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.430
 theoretically econometrics in the 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.380
 economics develops one 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.450
 test whether instruments for determination 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.910
 causal effects for example in the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.540
 grab politics 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.760
 What I do is help someone 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.410
 precise statement then explain 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.769
 can explain or effects precisely 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.440
 can 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.620
 For example, if someone wants to know 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.889
 what the university or in old like 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.859
 They partly complete the effect 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:58.900
 he has an income , among other things 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:01.090
 use a test that is a 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.769
 promotion at the gesco you deep on that 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.780
 income has an effect 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.090
 past five years and the people 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.510
 take academic position throughout europe 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.579
 on 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:11.799
 also in the whole world though some 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:15.250
 few placement in america or in 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:16.959
 Asia had and those did not 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.940
 to go to an academic field 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.260
 they also find very good employment 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.400
 the institutions we have 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.510
 placements at the European 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.900
 central bank at 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.450
 iwf will of course keep working on that 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.800
 highest level 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.780
 At the moment it looks more like I am 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.370
 remain at the university that is the 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.710
 pursue an academic career 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.620
 I'll do that in two years' time 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:40.510
 I do not know yet but that is 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.370
 currently the plan if the guests 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.110
 Doctorates give their title after four to 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.810
 five years have been theirs 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.090
 excellent prospects and 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.080
 excellence attracts new excellence to the 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.080
 university mannheim
