00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
and then i have soft force from the

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
like this color it's a white gold the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.500 
like this color it's a white gold the
only<00:04:06.440> thing<00:04:06.650> about<00:04:06.860> it<00:04:07.100> is<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:07.970> shimmers

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
only thing about it is that the shimmers

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.740 
only thing about it is that the shimmers
are<00:04:08.840> very<00:04:09.470> large<00:04:09.830> so<00:04:10.760> it<00:04:10.790> does<00:04:11.180> have<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.450> lot<00:04:11.720> of

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
are very large so it does have a lot of

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.009 
are very large so it does have a lot of
large<00:04:12.440> simmers<00:04:12.980> as<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.400> can<00:04:13.550> see<00:04:13.760> and<00:04:14.019> then

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
large simmers as you can see and then

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.740 
large simmers as you can see and then
here<00:04:15.590> i<00:04:15.739> have<00:04:16.070> the<00:04:16.580> bear<00:04:16.850> study<00:04:17.150> paint<00:04:17.510> pot

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
here i have the bear study paint pot

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.210 
here i have the bear study paint pot
which<00:04:18.019> is<00:04:18.049> really<00:04:18.350> nice<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:18.620> then<00:04:19.010> the

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
which is really nice and then the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.810 
which is really nice and then the
rubenesque<00:04:19.730> paint<00:04:20.150> pot<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.630> I<00:04:21.229> do<00:04:21.289> like

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
rubenesque paint pot and I do like

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.950 
rubenesque paint pot and I do like
rubenesque<00:04:22.820> better<00:04:23.210> than<00:04:23.450> their<00:04:23.630> study

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
rubenesque better than their study

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.210 
rubenesque better than their study
because<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.410> think<00:04:24.770> it's<00:04:24.860> a<00:04:24.950> more<00:04:25.130> original

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.220 
because I think it's a more original

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.060 
because I think it's a more original
color<00:04:25.760> but<00:04:26.419> bear<00:04:26.630> study

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
color but bear study

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.370 
color but bear study
is<00:04:27.130> more<00:04:27.310> wearable<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:27.970> then<00:04:28.630> for<00:04:28.840> swatches

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
is more wearable and then for swatches

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.630 
is more wearable and then for swatches
here<00:04:29.620> I<00:04:30.490> have<00:04:30.990> expensive<00:04:31.990> pink<00:04:32.230> and<00:04:32.580> then<00:04:33.580> I

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
here I have expensive pink and then I

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.900 
here I have expensive pink and then I
have<00:04:33.970> floof<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:35.100> next<00:04:36.100> to<00:04:36.160> flew<00:04:36.340> five<00:04:36.550> shroom

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
have floof and next to flew five shroom

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.340 
have floof and next to flew five shroom
so<00:04:37.150> you<00:04:37.240> can<00:04:37.360> kind<00:04:37.600> of<00:04:37.690> see<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.960> difference

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:38.350 
so you can kind of see the difference

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.970 
so you can kind of see the difference
and<00:04:39.040> then<00:04:39.280> down<00:04:39.700> there<00:04:39.970> I<00:04:40.000> have<00:04:40.240> soft<00:04:40.720> force<00:04:41.140> so

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
and then down there I have soft force so

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.650 
and then down there I have soft force so
you<00:04:42.340> can<00:04:42.490> see<00:04:42.640> the<00:04:42.730> difference<00:04:43.030> between<00:04:43.180> soft

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
you can see the difference between soft

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.210 
you can see the difference between soft
forests<00:04:44.140> and<00:04:44.290> flu<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.800> they<00:04:44.920> are<00:04:45.010> there

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
forests and flu and they are there

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.800 
forests and flu and they are there
really<00:04:45.370> is<00:04:45.580> a<00:04:45.610> pretty<00:04:46.120> big<00:04:46.300> difference<00:04:46.450> I

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
really is a pretty big difference I

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.210 
really is a pretty big difference I
think<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.200> then<00:04:48.100> here<00:04:48.730> is<00:04:48.910> beau<00:04:49.360> gray<00:04:50.040> here<00:04:51.040> is

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
think and then here is beau gray here is

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.770 
think and then here is beau gray here is
humid<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:53.070> then<00:04:54.070> here<00:04:54.730> is<00:04:54.910> rubenesque<00:04:55.420> Paint

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
humid and then here is rubenesque Paint

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.960 
humid and then here is rubenesque Paint
Pot<00:04:55.960> and<00:04:56.140> swatch<00:04:56.710> next<00:04:57.130> to<00:04:57.250> it<00:04:57.370> if<00:04:57.580> you<00:04:57.820> can

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
Pot and swatch next to it if you can

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.850 
Pot and swatch next to it if you can
even<00:04:58.150> see<00:04:58.480> the<00:04:58.600> difference<00:04:58.960> there's<00:04:59.440> melon

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
even see the difference there's melon

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.070 
even see the difference there's melon
pigment<00:05:00.400> and<00:05:00.520> they're<00:05:01.150> very<00:05:01.420> similar<00:05:01.630> color

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
pigment and they're very similar color

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.800 
pigment and they're very similar color
melon<00:05:02.530> pigment<00:05:02.920> is<00:05:03.180> more<00:05:04.180> shimmery<00:05:04.570> though

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
melon pigment is more shimmery though

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.070 
melon pigment is more shimmery though
and<00:05:05.080> then<00:05:05.980> here<00:05:06.280> is<00:05:06.430> bear<00:05:06.730> study<00:05:07.060> Paint<00:05:07.600> Pot<00:05:07.780> I

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
and then here is bear study Paint Pot I

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.410 
and then here is bear study Paint Pot I
have<00:05:08.980> vanilla<00:05:09.280> pigment<00:05:09.850> which<00:05:09.880> I<00:05:10.090> haven't

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:10.420 
have vanilla pigment which I haven't

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.140 
have vanilla pigment which I haven't
pressed<00:05:10.660> and<00:05:10.960> then<00:05:11.620> here<00:05:12.100> is<00:05:12.280> a<00:05:12.310> SWAT<00:05:12.760> of<00:05:13.000> it

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
pressed and then here is a SWAT of it

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.310 
pressed and then here is a SWAT of it
and<00:05:13.390> to<00:05:14.230> the<00:05:14.500> left<00:05:14.680> of<00:05:14.890> it<00:05:15.040> I<00:05:15.220> just<00:05:15.580> have<00:05:16.320> white

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
and to the left of it I just have white

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.530 
and to the left of it I just have white
frost<00:05:17.620> pigment<00:05:18.160> and<00:05:18.310> then<00:05:18.580> below<00:05:18.880> it<00:05:18.910> I<00:05:19.120> have<00:05:19.270> X

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
frost pigment and then below it I have X

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:22.740 
frost pigment and then below it I have X
so<00:05:19.810> you<00:05:19.900> can<00:05:20.050> see<00:05:20.230> the<00:05:20.350> difference
