my<00:00:37.020> colleagues<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.679> been<00:00:37.949> studying

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
my colleagues and I have been studying

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.790 
my colleagues and I have been studying
adolescent<00:00:38.760> brain<00:00:38.940> development<00:00:39.620> along<00:00:40.620> with

adolescent brain development along with
their<00:00:41.010> behavior<00:00:41.210> as<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.269> way<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> try<00:00:42.929> to<00:00:43.019> better

their behavior as a way to try to better
understand<00:00:43.949> what<00:00:44.940> changes<00:00:45.210> during

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
understand what changes during

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.450 
understand what changes during
adolescence<00:00:45.989> how<00:00:46.559> young<00:00:46.859> people<00:00:46.890> are

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
adolescence how young people are

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.029 
adolescence how young people are
different<00:00:47.910> from<00:00:48.269> adults<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.839> of<00:00:49.739> course

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
different from adults and of course

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.750 
different from adults and of course
ultimately<00:00:50.510> how<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.539> can<00:00:51.929> use<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.379> knowledge

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
ultimately how we can use this knowledge

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.829 
ultimately how we can use this knowledge
to<00:00:53.760> affect<00:00:54.149> social<00:00:54.480> policy<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.499> and<00:00:56.129> practice

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
to affect social policy and and practice

00:00:56.839 --> 00:00:59.779 
to affect social policy and and practice
and<00:00:57.839> what<00:00:58.679> and<00:00:58.920> what<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.429> and<00:00:59.640> other

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
and what and what we and other

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.119 
and what and what we and other
scientists<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.600> been<00:01:00.780> finding<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
scientists have been finding is that

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.579 
scientists have been finding is that
there<00:01:02.339> is<00:01:02.519> extensive<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.899> very<00:01:04.050> dramatic

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
there is extensive and very dramatic

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.800 
there is extensive and very dramatic
brain<00:01:04.830> maturation<00:01:05.040> during<00:01:05.760> adolescence<00:01:06.270> much

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
brain maturation during adolescence much

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.340 
brain maturation during adolescence much
more<00:01:07.140> than<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.530> anybody<00:01:07.950> had<00:01:08.370> imagined

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
more than I think anybody had imagined

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.260 
more than I think anybody had imagined
previously<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:11.310> know<00:01:11.520> for<00:01:12.180> example

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
previously and so we know for example

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.590 
previously and so we know for example
that<00:01:12.890> parts<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.009> the<00:01:14.070> brain<00:01:14.399> systems<00:01:15.329> of<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that parts of the brain systems of the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.050 
that parts of the brain systems of the
brain<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.439> are<00:01:16.500> very<00:01:17.009> important<00:01:17.579> for<00:01:17.790> things

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
brain that are very important for things

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.310 
brain that are very important for things
like<00:01:18.799> judgment<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.070> decision-making<00:01:20.579> and

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
like judgment and decision-making and

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.100 
like judgment and decision-making and
impulse<00:01:22.320> control<00:01:22.560> are<00:01:23.100> are<00:01:23.909> undergoing<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
impulse control are are undergoing a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.010 
impulse control are are undergoing a
steady<00:01:25.770> maturation<00:01:26.759> during<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> adolescent

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
steady maturation during the adolescent

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.410 
steady maturation during the adolescent
years<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.530> fact<00:01:28.799> into<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.460> mid-twenties<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
years in fact into the mid-twenties and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.550 
years in fact into the mid-twenties and
maybe<00:01:30.930> even<00:01:31.110> beyond<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.399> that<00:01:32.909> means

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
maybe even beyond and that means

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.340 
maybe even beyond and that means
behaviorally<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.890> as<00:01:36.079> individuals<00:01:37.079> move

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
behaviorally that as individuals move

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.230 
behaviorally that as individuals move
through<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.799> stage<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.640> life<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:39.119> they

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
through this stage of life that they

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.170 
through this stage of life that they
become<00:01:39.659> better<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:40.350> thinking<00:01:41.070> ahead<00:01:41.219> at

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
become better at thinking ahead at

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.450 
become better at thinking ahead at
resisting<00:01:42.810> peer<00:01:43.049> pressure<00:01:43.350> at<00:01:43.680> controlling

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
resisting peer pressure at controlling

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.660 
resisting peer pressure at controlling
their<00:01:44.610> impulses<00:01:45.240> at<00:01:46.189> considering<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> future

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
their impulses at considering the future

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.670 
their impulses at considering the future
consequences<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.659> their<00:01:49.079> actions<00:01:49.469> and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
consequences of their actions and

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.020 
consequences of their actions and
decisions<00:01:49.950> not<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.820> immediate

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
decisions not just the immediate

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.029 
decisions not just the immediate
consequences<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.409> that's<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:52.770> very

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:53.039 
consequences so that's one very

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.120 
consequences so that's one very
important<00:01:54.079> aspect<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.170> brain<00:01:55.380> development<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
important aspect of brain development a

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.660 
important aspect of brain development a
second<00:01:57.350> that<00:01:58.350> I'm<00:01:58.469> especially<00:01:58.829> interested<00:01:59.189> in

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
second that I'm especially interested in

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.169 
second that I'm especially interested in
is<00:01:59.880> that<00:02:00.479> around<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.140> time<00:02:01.289> of<00:02:01.740> puberty<00:02:02.179> when

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
is that around the time of puberty when

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.219 
is that around the time of puberty when
the<00:02:03.329> pubertal<00:02:03.719> hormones<00:02:04.109> are<00:02:05.210> increasing

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
the pubertal hormones are increasing

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.320 
the pubertal hormones are increasing
dramatically<00:02:07.229> there<00:02:08.220> are<00:02:08.369> really<00:02:08.789> important

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
dramatically there are really important

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.880 
dramatically there are really important
changes<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:10.250> systems<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.550> brain<00:02:11.810> that<00:02:12.810> are

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
changes in systems of the brain that are

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.360 
changes in systems of the brain that are
important<00:02:13.890> for<00:02:14.130> our<00:02:14.460> sensation<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.600> reward

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
important for our sensation of reward

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.420 
important for our sensation of reward
or<00:02:16.489> pleasure<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:18.370> there's<00:02:19.370> a

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
or pleasure and there's a

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.990 
or pleasure and there's a
neurotransmitter<00:02:20.080> called<00:02:21.080> dopamine<00:02:22.000> which

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
neurotransmitter called dopamine which

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.360 
neurotransmitter called dopamine which
is<00:02:23.120> a<00:02:23.150> very<00:02:23.510> important<00:02:24.049> brain<00:02:24.260> chemical<00:02:24.830> for

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
is a very important brain chemical for

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.479 
is a very important brain chemical for
our<00:02:25.580> experience<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.390> reward<00:02:26.810> or<00:02:27.560> pleasure<00:02:28.159> and

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
our experience of reward or pleasure and

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.300 
our experience of reward or pleasure and
and<00:02:29.209> scientists<00:02:29.989> have<00:02:30.140> found<00:02:30.349> that<00:02:31.040> there's

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
and scientists have found that there's

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.710 
and scientists have found that there's
more<00:02:31.730> dopamine<00:02:32.540> activity<00:02:33.440> in<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.819> prefrontal

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
more dopamine activity in the prefrontal

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.140 
more dopamine activity in the prefrontal
area<00:02:36.349> of<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.739> brain<00:02:36.950> during<00:02:37.640> early

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
area of the brain during early

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.970 
area of the brain during early
adolescence<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.140> middle<00:02:39.349> adolescence<00:02:39.470> and

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
adolescence and middle adolescence and

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.130 
adolescence and middle adolescence and
at<00:02:40.069> any<00:02:40.220> other<00:02:40.459> point<00:02:40.849> in<00:02:41.030> life<00:02:41.360> what<00:02:42.019> does

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
at any other point in life what does

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.699 
at any other point in life what does
this<00:02:42.290> mean<00:02:42.560> it<00:02:43.069> means<00:02:43.579> that<00:02:44.620> adolescents<00:02:45.620> are

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
this mean it means that adolescents are

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.210 
this mean it means that adolescents are
going<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.159> be<00:02:46.280> much<00:02:46.640> more<00:02:47.000> attuned<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.620> reward

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
going to be much more attuned to reward

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.140 
going to be much more attuned to reward
to<00:02:49.910> seeking<00:02:50.660> reward<00:02:51.109> to<00:02:51.739> seeking<00:02:52.190> sensation

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
to seeking reward to seeking sensation

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.110 
to seeking reward to seeking sensation
to<00:02:53.660> seeking<00:02:54.049> thrills<00:02:54.349> to<00:02:55.190> seeking<00:02:55.519> pleasures

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
to seeking thrills to seeking pleasures

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.860 
to seeking thrills to seeking pleasures
and<00:02:57.459> this<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:58.640> important<00:02:59.180> because<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.690> helps

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
and this is important because it helps

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
and this is important because it helps
us<00:03:00.109> understand<00:03:00.879> why<00:03:02.409> adolescence<00:03:03.409> is<00:03:03.530> a<00:03:03.560> time

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
us understand why adolescence is a time

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.640 
us understand why adolescence is a time
when<00:03:04.700> when<00:03:05.299> individuals<00:03:05.870> take<00:03:06.079> more<00:03:06.290> risks

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
when when individuals take more risks

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.050 
when when individuals take more risks
and<00:03:06.890> behave<00:03:07.609> more<00:03:08.390> recklessly<00:03:08.870> why<00:03:09.409> they

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
and behave more recklessly why they

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.089 
and behave more recklessly why they
often<00:03:11.060> start<00:03:11.239> experimenting<00:03:11.599> with<00:03:11.959> drugs<00:03:12.200> and

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
often start experimenting with drugs and

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:17.259 
often start experimenting with drugs and
alcohol<00:03:13.690> why<00:03:14.690> they<00:03:14.900> might<00:03:15.079> engage<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:16.310> in<00:03:16.909> in

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
alcohol why they might engage in in in

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.940 
alcohol why they might engage in in in
delinquent<00:03:17.780> behavior<00:03:18.290> because<00:03:18.799> it's

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
delinquent behavior because it's

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.159 
delinquent behavior because it's
exciting<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.609> because<00:03:20.239> they<00:03:20.419> are<00:03:20.480> only

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
exciting and because they are only

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:23.259 
exciting and because they are only
thinking<00:03:21.560> about<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:22.069> immediate<00:03:22.370> rewards<00:03:23.120> and

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
thinking about the immediate rewards and

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.490 
thinking about the immediate rewards and
they're<00:03:23.419> not<00:03:23.540> thinking<00:03:23.780> about<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.290> long-term

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
they're not thinking about the long-term

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.879 
they're not thinking about the long-term
consequences<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:25.639> so<00:03:26.090> in<00:03:26.959> in<00:03:27.230> in<00:03:27.440> some<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.769> our

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
consequences and so in in in some of our

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.360 
consequences and so in in in some of our
work<00:03:28.160> we<00:03:29.060> have<00:03:29.329> we<00:03:29.660> have<00:03:29.840> said<00:03:30.079> that<00:03:30.319> you<00:03:31.250> know

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
work we have we have said that you know

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.319 
work we have we have said that you know
the<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:31.970> the<00:03:32.680> accelerator<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.970> on<00:03:35.209> the

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
the the the the accelerator is on the

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.599 
the the the the accelerator is on the
floor<00:03:35.569> but<00:03:36.169> the<00:03:36.319> braking<00:03:36.709> system<00:03:36.889> is<00:03:37.190> not<00:03:37.400> in

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
floor but the braking system is not in

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.909 
floor but the braking system is not in
place<00:03:37.849> yet<00:03:37.879> and<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.389> braking<00:03:39.230> system<00:03:39.590> is<00:03:39.709> not

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:39.919 
place yet and that braking system is not

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.099 
place yet and that braking system is not
going<00:03:40.160> to<00:03:40.310> be<00:03:40.430> in<00:03:40.549> place<00:03:40.819> in<00:03:41.419> an<00:03:41.599> adult<00:03:41.930> way

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
going to be in place in an adult way

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.949 
going to be in place in an adult way
until<00:03:42.799> much<00:03:43.010> much<00:03:43.040> later<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:44.090> our<00:03:44.269> work<00:03:44.480> we<00:03:44.690> try

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
until much much later in our work we try

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.400 
until much much later in our work we try
to<00:03:45.019> use<00:03:45.500> it<00:03:45.680> to<00:03:45.769> inform<00:03:46.250> policy<00:03:46.879> and

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
to use it to inform policy and

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.379 
to use it to inform policy and
legislation<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:49.730> there<00:03:49.970> are<00:03:50.090> a<00:03:50.209> couple

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:50.389 
legislation and and there are a couple

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:52.509 
legislation and and there are a couple
of<00:03:50.599> ways<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:50.930> which<00:03:51.049> this<00:03:51.290> work<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.769> think<00:03:51.949> have

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
of ways in which this work I think have

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.189 
of ways in which this work I think have
been<00:03:52.760> important<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.419> I<00:03:53.660> hope<00:03:53.810> will<00:03:54.019> continue

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
been important and I hope will continue

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.369 
been important and I hope will continue
to<00:03:54.530> be<00:03:54.650> important<00:03:55.629> one<00:03:56.629> is<00:03:56.750> in<00:03:56.900> the<00:03:56.989> area<00:03:57.349> of

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
to be important one is in the area of

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:00.930 
to be important one is in the area of
juvenile<00:03:57.949> crime<00:03:57.980> and<00:03:58.819> I<00:03:58.910> said<00:03:59.180> before<00:03:59.769> that

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
juvenile crime and I said before that

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.740 
juvenile crime and I said before that
most<00:04:01.940> adolescent<00:04:02.599> crimes<00:04:02.900> occur<00:04:03.560> in<00:04:03.859> groups

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
most adolescent crimes occur in groups

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.789 
most adolescent crimes occur in groups
adult<00:04:05.750> crime<00:04:05.959> tends<00:04:06.230> to<00:04:06.349> be<00:04:06.440> done<00:04:06.590> by<00:04:06.739> people

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
adult crime tends to be done by people

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.460 
adult crime tends to be done by people
working<00:04:07.160> by<00:04:07.459> themselves<00:04:07.639> now<00:04:08.599> what<00:04:09.440> that

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
working by themselves now what that

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.409 
working by themselves now what that
means<00:04:09.620> is<00:04:10.160> that<00:04:10.190> when<00:04:10.609> adolescents<00:04:11.000> are<00:04:11.299> in<00:04:11.389> a

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
means is that when adolescents are in a

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.949 
means is that when adolescents are in a
group<00:04:11.660> situation<00:04:11.980> they<00:04:12.980> may<00:04:13.220> be<00:04:13.959> especially

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
group situation they may be especially

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.800 
group situation they may be especially
emotionally<00:04:15.709> aroused<00:04:16.070> in<00:04:16.519> ways<00:04:17.120> that<00:04:17.510> make

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
emotionally aroused in ways that make

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.319 
emotionally aroused in ways that make
their<00:04:18.019> judgment<00:04:18.530> much<00:04:18.709> worse<00:04:18.979> and<00:04:19.310> so<00:04:20.120> when

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
their judgment much worse and so when

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.330 
their judgment much worse and so when
the<00:04:20.419> court<00:04:20.750> is<00:04:20.959> looking<00:04:21.199> at<00:04:21.620> a<00:04:21.650> young<00:04:21.979> person

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
the court is looking at a young person

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.810 
the court is looking at a young person
who's<00:04:22.520> committed<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.060> crime<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:25.340> should<00:04:25.700> be

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
who's committed a crime it should be

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.580 
who's committed a crime it should be
asking<00:04:26.300> if<00:04:26.479> this<00:04:26.630> happened<00:04:27.020> in<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.200> group

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
asking if this happened in a group

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.170 
asking if this happened in a group
because<00:04:28.590> if<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:28.830> happened<00:04:29.160> in<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.340> group<00:04:29.760> maybe

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
because if it happened in a group maybe

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.970 
because if it happened in a group maybe
the<00:04:30.390> person<00:04:30.570> should<00:04:31.050> not<00:04:31.230> be<00:04:31.290> held<00:04:31.740> as

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
the person should not be held as

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.480 
the person should not be held as
responsible<00:04:32.730> as<00:04:33.530> if<00:04:34.530> the<00:04:34.770> person<00:04:34.920> did<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.370> by

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
responsible as if the person did it by

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.820 
responsible as if the person did it by
himself<00:04:35.940> now<00:04:36.630> this<00:04:37.260> turns<00:04:37.470> out<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.800> be

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
himself now this turns out to be

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.850 
himself now this turns out to be
important<00:04:38.430> because<00:04:38.550> in<00:04:39.060> the<00:04:39.150> United<00:04:39.480> States

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
important because in the United States

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.580 
important because in the United States
there<00:04:40.860> are<00:04:41.010> some<00:04:42.000> laws<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.720> make<00:04:43.380> the

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
there are some laws that make the

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.730 
there are some laws that make the
penalties<00:04:44.160> for<00:04:44.820> committing<00:04:45.210> a<00:04:45.330> crime<00:04:45.600> in<00:04:46.590> a

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
penalties for committing a crime in a

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.990 
penalties for committing a crime in a
group<00:04:47.010> in<00:04:47.220> a<00:04:47.340> gang<00:04:48.140> much<00:04:49.140> more<00:04:49.440> harsh<00:04:49.770> than<00:04:50.640> the

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
group in a gang much more harsh than the

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.930 
group in a gang much more harsh than the
same<00:04:51.210> crime<00:04:51.510> committed<00:04:51.900> by<00:04:52.020> itself<00:04:52.740> we<00:04:53.610> think

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
same crime committed by itself we think

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.090 
same crime committed by itself we think
that<00:04:54.180> that<00:04:54.630> this<00:04:54.930> may<00:04:55.140> not<00:04:55.320> be<00:04:55.380> a<00:04:55.530> good<00:04:55.770> idea

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
that that this may not be a good idea

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.090 
that that this may not be a good idea
because<00:04:56.550> in<00:04:57.060> fact<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.960> group<00:04:58.200> situation<00:04:58.860> is

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
because in fact the group situation is

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.760 
because in fact the group situation is
the<00:04:59.700> very<00:04:59.940> situation<00:05:00.180> that<00:05:01.170> brings<00:05:01.440> out<00:05:01.650> the

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
the very situation that brings out the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.220 
the very situation that brings out the
worst<00:05:01.980> in<00:05:02.220> adolescence<00:05:02.970> it<00:05:03.570> is<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:04.050> situation

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:04.230 
worst in adolescence it is the situation

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.100 
worst in adolescence it is the situation
that<00:05:04.830> might<00:05:05.250> make<00:05:05.460> them<00:05:05.670> more<00:05:06.270> immature<00:05:06.630> in

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
that might make them more immature in

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.070 
that might make them more immature in
their<00:05:07.950> behavior<00:05:08.430> so<00:05:08.640> that's<00:05:09.030> one<00:05:09.270> way<00:05:09.900> we've

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
their behavior so that's one way we've

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.440 
their behavior so that's one way we've
tried<00:05:10.320> to<00:05:10.350> influence<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.070> law<00:05:11.250> a<00:05:11.520> second<00:05:12.330> has

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
tried to influence the law a second has

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.980 
tried to influence the law a second has
to<00:05:12.480> do<00:05:12.750> with<00:05:12.900> laws<00:05:13.140> about<00:05:13.350> driving<00:05:13.770> so<00:05:14.990> up

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
to do with laws about driving so up

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.740 
to do with laws about driving so up
until<00:05:16.410> fairly<00:05:16.620> recently<00:05:17.450> you<00:05:18.450> could<00:05:18.600> get<00:05:18.720> a

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
until fairly recently you could get a

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.800 
until fairly recently you could get a
driver's<00:05:19.170> license<00:05:19.560> in<00:05:19.680> the<00:05:19.740> United<00:05:20.100> States

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
driver's license in the United States

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:24.440 
driver's license in the United States
usually<00:05:21.810> around<00:05:22.320> the<00:05:22.620> age<00:05:22.770> of<00:05:22.890> 16<00:05:23.370> and<00:05:23.580> you

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
usually around the age of 16 and you

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.120 
usually around the age of 16 and you
would<00:05:24.600> be<00:05:24.720> handed<00:05:25.020> your<00:05:25.050> license<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:25.800> you

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
would be handed your license and you

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.400 
would be handed your license and you
could<00:05:26.280> drive<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:26.730> there<00:05:26.850> would<00:05:26.970> be<00:05:27.000> no

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.410 
could drive and there would be no

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.530 
could drive and there would be no
restrictions<00:05:28.410> on<00:05:28.800> on<00:05:29.640> when<00:05:30.030> you<00:05:30.150> could<00:05:30.330> drive

restrictions on on when you could drive

restrictions on on when you could drive
or<00:05:30.720> how<00:05:30.840> you<00:05:30.900> could<00:05:31.140> drive<00:05:31.320> or<00:05:31.470> where<00:05:31.590> you

or how you could drive or where you

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.290 
or how you could drive or where you
could<00:05:31.860> drive<00:05:32.040> well<00:05:32.780> because<00:05:33.780> of<00:05:33.930> research<00:05:34.590> and

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
could drive well because of research and

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.590 
could drive well because of research and
many<00:05:36.300> states<00:05:36.750> are<00:05:37.080> now<00:05:37.910> saying<00:05:38.910> well<00:05:39.150> maybe

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
many states are now saying well maybe

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.650 
many states are now saying well maybe
for<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.050> first<00:05:40.320> six<00:05:41.310> months<00:05:41.490> or<00:05:41.880> a<00:05:41.940> first<00:05:42.150> year

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
for the first six months or a first year

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.960 
for the first six months or a first year
that<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:43.500> have<00:05:43.680> your<00:05:43.830> license<00:05:44.250> you<00:05:44.730> should

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
that you have your license you should

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.790 
that you have your license you should
not<00:05:45.150> be<00:05:45.330> driving<00:05:45.540> with<00:05:45.870> other<00:05:46.020> adolescents<00:05:46.710> in

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
not be driving with other adolescents in

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.880 
not be driving with other adolescents in
the<00:05:46.890> car<00:05:47.070> because<00:05:47.790> research<00:05:48.210> shows<00:05:48.540> that<00:05:48.960> the

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
the car because research shows that the

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.370 
the car because research shows that the
presence<00:05:50.520> of<00:05:50.640> peers<00:05:51.060> may<00:05:51.540> make<00:05:51.750> adolescents

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
presence of peers may make adolescents

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.440 
presence of peers may make adolescents
take<00:05:52.530> more<00:05:52.740> chances<00:05:52.950> and<00:05:53.460> so<00:05:53.850> this<00:05:54.000> is<00:05:54.120> another

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
take more chances and so this is another

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.600 
take more chances and so this is another
way<00:05:54.690> in<00:05:54.900> which<00:05:55.230> the<00:05:55.560> science<00:05:56.010> of<00:05:56.130> adolescent

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
way in which the science of adolescent

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.430 
way in which the science of adolescent
development<00:05:57.060> including<00:05:57.960> some<00:05:58.110> of<00:05:58.140> the<00:05:58.290> work

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
development including some of the work

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.830 
development including some of the work
that<00:05:58.470> we<00:05:58.770> do<00:05:58.980> can<00:05:59.790> influence<00:06:00.150> policy<00:06:00.810> and

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
that we do can influence policy and

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.870 
that we do can influence policy and
legislation<00:06:01.440> I<00:06:01.770> think<00:06:01.950> one<00:06:02.430> of<00:06:02.550> the<00:06:02.640> most

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 
legislation I think one of the most

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.880 
legislation I think one of the most
important<00:06:03.420> things<00:06:03.690> that's<00:06:03.990> going<00:06:04.230> to<00:06:04.440> come<00:06:04.680> of

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
important things that's going to come of

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.420 
important things that's going to come of
the<00:06:05.040> class<00:06:05.280> yokum's<00:06:05.970> research<00:06:06.330> price<00:06:07.430> is

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
the class yokum's research price is

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.360 
the class yokum's research price is
really<00:06:08.760> not<00:06:08.940> how<00:06:09.150> it<00:06:09.360> influences<00:06:09.900> my<00:06:10.110> work<00:06:10.370> but

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
really not how it influences my work but

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.900 
really not how it influences my work but
how<00:06:11.520> it<00:06:11.700> influences<00:06:12.270> the<00:06:12.480> field<00:06:13.430> because<00:06:14.430> the

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910 
how it influences the field because the

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.840 
how it influences the field because the
the<00:06:15.120> study<00:06:15.360> of<00:06:15.450> adolescent<00:06:16.050> development<00:06:16.850> has

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
the study of adolescent development has

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.460 
the study of adolescent development has
not<00:06:17.880> I<00:06:18.420> think<00:06:18.810> had<00:06:19.050> the<00:06:19.290> the<00:06:19.860> the<00:06:20.340> status<00:06:20.790> of

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
not I think had the the the status of

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.010 
not I think had the the the status of
chemistry<00:06:22.470> or<00:06:22.680> biology<00:06:22.890> or<00:06:23.400> physics<00:06:23.880> but<00:06:24.870> now

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
chemistry or biology or physics but now

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.390 
chemistry or biology or physics but now
here<00:06:25.350> we<00:06:25.500> have<00:06:25.740> a<00:06:26.100> major<00:06:27.170> foundation

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.080 

a<00:06:30.720> very<00:06:31.720> powerful<00:06:31.960> and<00:06:32.919> important<00:06:33.460> foundation

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
a very powerful and important foundation

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:37.680 
a very powerful and important foundation
not<00:06:34.990> only<00:06:35.460> making<00:06:36.460> this<00:06:36.729> award<00:06:37.120> so<00:06:37.270> that<00:06:37.419> one

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
not only making this award so that one

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.219 
not only making this award so that one
person<00:06:37.990> can<00:06:38.560> can<00:06:38.919> do<00:06:39.160> his<00:06:39.880> work<00:06:39.910> but<00:06:40.750> making<00:06:41.110> a

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
person can can do his work but making a

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.560 
person can can do his work but making a
statement<00:06:41.550> about<00:06:42.550> what's<00:06:42.789> important<00:06:43.360> and

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:43.570 
statement about what's important and

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.200 
statement about what's important and
this<00:06:44.199> is<00:06:44.259> a<00:06:44.410> statement<00:06:44.770> that<00:06:45.130> I<00:06:45.220> hope<00:06:45.490> other

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
this is a statement that I hope other

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.110 
this is a statement that I hope other
scientists<00:06:46.960> will<00:06:47.169> pay<00:06:47.650> attention<00:06:48.130> to<00:06:48.310> other

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
scientists will pay attention to other

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.159 
scientists will pay attention to other
foundations<00:06:49.780> will<00:06:49.990> pay<00:06:50.229> attention<00:06:50.949> to

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:52.169 
foundations will pay attention to

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:54.420 
foundations will pay attention to
governments<00:06:53.169> will<00:06:53.380> pay<00:06:53.530> attention<00:06:54.100> to<00:06:54.250> and

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:54.430 
governments will pay attention to and

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:58.100 
governments will pay attention to and
the<00:06:54.759> statement<00:06:55.270> is<00:06:55.389> that<00:06:55.449> we<00:06:55.930> can<00:06:56.650> use<00:06:56.830> science

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
the statement is that we can use science

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.689 
the statement is that we can use science
to<00:06:59.110> facilitate<00:06:59.919> productive<00:07:00.520> youth

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:00.699 
to facilitate productive youth

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:02.820 
to facilitate productive youth
development<00:07:01.240> and<00:07:01.479> we<00:07:01.960> ought<00:07:02.169> to<00:07:02.199> be<00:07:02.380> investing

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
development and we ought to be investing

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.810 
development and we ought to be investing
in<00:07:03.570> good<00:07:04.570> science<00:07:05.080> with<00:07:05.740> this<00:07:06.010> as<00:07:06.250> the<00:07:06.310> goal

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
in good science with this as the goal

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.430 
in good science with this as the goal
and<00:07:07.090> so<00:07:07.449> I'm<00:07:07.539> hoping<00:07:07.960> that<00:07:08.229> the<00:07:08.800> the<00:07:09.280> attention

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 
and so I'm hoping that the the attention

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.120 
and so I'm hoping that the the attention
given<00:07:11.440> here<00:07:11.889> you<00:07:12.550> know<00:07:12.669> is<00:07:12.820> not<00:07:12.970> to<00:07:13.210> me<00:07:13.949> it<00:07:14.949> is

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:15.130 
given here you know is not to me it is

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:19.170 
given here you know is not to me it is
to<00:07:15.430> the<00:07:16.419> the<00:07:16.720> Klaus<00:07:17.169> Jakob<00:07:17.620> surprise<00:07:18.190> because

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
to the the Klaus Jakob surprise because

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.180 
to the the Klaus Jakob surprise because
that<00:07:19.419> it<00:07:19.720> seems<00:07:20.020> to<00:07:20.139> me<00:07:20.289> is<00:07:20.410> what's<00:07:20.620> important

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
that it seems to me is what's important

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:26.610 
that it seems to me is what's important
to<00:07:22.030> to<00:07:22.840> motivate<00:07:23.639> to<00:07:24.639> set<00:07:24.820> an<00:07:24.940> example<00:07:25.360> to<00:07:25.960> show

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 
to to motivate to set an example to show

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.360 
to to motivate to set an example to show
the<00:07:27.250> world<00:07:27.460> that<00:07:28.440> that<00:07:29.440> we<00:07:29.620> need<00:07:29.800> to<00:07:29.949> invest

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.370 
the world that that we need to invest

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:35.189 
the world that that we need to invest
this<00:07:31.210> kind<00:07:31.840> of<00:07:31.990> resource<00:07:32.610> to<00:07:33.610> do<00:07:34.199> quality

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 
this kind of resource to do quality

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:37.680 
this kind of resource to do quality
rigorous<00:07:36.010> science<00:07:36.490> to<00:07:37.090> promote<00:07:37.449> youth

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.690 
rigorous science to promote youth

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.110
