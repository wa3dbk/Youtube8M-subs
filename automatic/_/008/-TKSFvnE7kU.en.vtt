there's like half a page so then you've

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.749 
there's like half a page so then you've
got<00:02:00.450> I've<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.469> got<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.829> pattern<00:02:02.159> paper<00:02:02.399> on

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
got I've just got the pattern paper on

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.990 
got I've just got the pattern paper on
these<00:02:03.299> flips<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.130> so<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:05.490> it's<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> large

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
these flips and so then it's the large

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.749 
these flips and so then it's the large
page<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.659> then<00:02:06.780> the<00:02:06.930> flip<00:02:07.140> pockets<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
page and then the flip pockets and a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.460 
page and then the flip pockets and a
large<00:02:09.030> page<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.539> there's<00:02:09.720> five<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.050> these

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
large page so there's five of these

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.400 
large page so there's five of these
larger<00:02:10.979> pages<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:11.849> between<00:02:12.569> each<00:02:12.720> page<00:02:12.989> is

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
larger pages and between each page is

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.360 
larger pages and between each page is
these<00:02:13.530> cascading<00:02:14.370> flip<00:02:15.330> pockets<00:02:15.930> but<00:02:16.920> I<00:02:16.950> think

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
these cascading flip pockets but I think

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.210
