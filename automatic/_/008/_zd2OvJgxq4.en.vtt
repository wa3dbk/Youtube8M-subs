00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:11.870
 good as I had told you in this video I will teach you some bad things 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:16.630
 that has the xbox 360 slim but it's not because I do not like the console but that 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.720
 is because people have asked me in the previous video as they saw in 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.660
 the other video of a man that when he raises the console and a disc is in 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.519
 spinning the disc comes out of its position and is grated 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:31.400
 because people have said that this man is a fool but I tell them what 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.260
 it would happen if instead of tetuÃ¡n saras the console the al sarao moved your little brother 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.420
 or your pet is why I think that microsoft must have thought about that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.469
 this had already happened in the previous console so I think that if 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.420
 Microsoft already knew about this console problem because it did not solve this 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.600
 problem 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.220
 now let's go to another problem in this video you see a person who is 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:57.550
 playing your new xbox 360 slim but the video shows some white stripes 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.390
 on the television and the man shows that the console he is playing is the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.700
 new xbox 360 slim as you can see the playing but the white stripes do not 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.200
 are removed when I read the video said that according to her overheating 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.070
 now we go to another video where the man shows that the problem is not the console 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.060
 but when you are 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.850
 he was watching a movie on his new slim xbox 360 the console turned off he 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.240
 he investigated the problem and saw that the problem was not the console but 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.259
 that of the electricity current since its power adapter had a 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.070
 red light and that made the new console not learn now in the 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.750
 next video I will show you what happens when you overheat the 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.000
 console instead of appearing the red ring of death to the new console will 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.550
 a red dot appears if, as seen in the video, it is a red dot that shows 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.590
 that the console is overheated but depending on what you see the console is not 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.430
 dead but will only turn off automatically so as not to suffer any 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:53.930
 heating 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.480
 Well for now these are all the problems that this xbox 360 slim has 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.700
 maybe in the future there will be more or maybe the solutions we will not know until 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.950
 later, thanks for watching and soon I will make a video comparison between the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.090
 new xbox 360 is limited and station 3 is cute attention i will be right between 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.209
 the comparatives of the two consoles so subscribe separate the next 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.130
 video and if you have questions or ideas about new videos, leave them in the 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.860
 comments thank you for watching
