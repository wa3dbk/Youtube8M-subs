00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.350
 Now I'm pick szeged and welcome from 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.300
 new to the channel this time I bring a 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.700
 very fast video about the deaths 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.420
 that I got on the last day on 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.240
 Yesterday 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.800
 using the svb if you do not know the sv them 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.240
 could leave the video in the description if 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.099
 they have not seen it and how to get it how 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.660
 use it but well that's not the point 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.910
 of the video the point of the video was how 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.039
 change things put a video out 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.050
 of the common and that you also 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.730
 try and if you want you can record it 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.710
 and send me as video response 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.080
 any things would be fine 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.000
 but I really tell them to try and 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.469
 have fun for a while that I did 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.210
 to vary things a bit since a 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.930
 Although I had double experience and 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.789
 all that sense really did not matter 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.910
 since all the weapons and everything that 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.230
 would be the kits the vehicles already 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.230
 they were unlocked then I said 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.329
 we're going to use the plane a bit and that 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.640
 we can allocate people as we could see 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:00.789
 the sv video has enough stack for 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.129
 flying is very fast it is very easy to 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.900
 control and is not destroyed is impacted 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.510
 against someone then good then 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.520
 you can take out some small clips that more 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.550
 well they are the example so that you 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.250
 try 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.760
 literal if you consider the points 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.340
 of relation of casualties and deaths and work 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.770
 as 4.4 points of that relationship I do not 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.350
 matter as 200 skill points in 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.780
 the ball did not really matter to me either 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.310
 here this was to get a video and 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.740
 it will not matter that he died once 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.930
 again again here what I can 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.310
 to say is if they are really going to try 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.570
 get if someone who gives them a 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.700
 ammunition box because it's going to be 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.010
 too frustrating that if they fail one 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.960
 only once they have to die again to 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.850
 have another that soft as it happened to me 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.440
 also if you can get a 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.790
 box in which you change of quito 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.410
 It is also very useful because they can 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.110
 change back to the kit 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.410
 recognition and hotel and has another 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.210
 sb also if you are safe 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.400
 where or how are you flying uses the 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.010
 third- person camera that's going 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.920
 help a lot and in and mentally that 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.650
 you have already aligned or rather 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.420
 have already taken the course in the direction 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.630
 where are those who camper only 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.060
 want to roll with the svb they change to the 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.100
 first person camera and that circle 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.060
 that they have in the camera to put to the chest 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.220
 that simple 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.500
 do not fall into a tailspin either go to a 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.870
 same horizontal level parallel to the ground 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.580
 and ran into the whys and you 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.080
 try to arrive from a vertical state 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.760
 the way in which you can 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.770
 react is to say if you crouch on the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.140
 enemy catcher move to one side 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.849
 towards the other is very little the angle in 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.680
 which you can maneuver to 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.720
 correct the flight however if they have 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.730
 someone aligned as you can see in the 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.290
 building that looks like a chisel or the tower 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.420
 greatest of those who know the city ​​of 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.860
 mexico will be able to realize that it aligns me 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.870
 with if it was a runway and 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.660
 try to run as fast as possible 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.310
 and yet I escaped some is 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.870
 easier to line up with ocesa del 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.090
 horizontal than attacking them in a line 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.069
 straight as if they were eagles then at 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.319
 start with him with the objective put on 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.760
 in horizontal line use that circle 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.880
 to mark the chest and say the chest 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.500
 because it 's easier to give them there 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.420
 be looking in the head for a leg or 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.549
 something like that if they're going 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.739
 to roll over and if they are crushed it does not matter 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.420
 where they hit us the game is going to 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.190
 record as a death but also 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.930
 it is better to aim at the chest because from 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.849
 the center of the player the center of the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.890
 detection of the blows if they have a 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.340
 little of chili is delayed that box of 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.129
 detection what 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.750
 what is going to happen is that if they point to the 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.849
 leg that was running in the part of 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.590
 back the most likely is that to you 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.019
 even if they see it, it will not be there 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.150
 land then better to put the chest 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.069
 be sure links of the super or enemy and 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.230
 if they will do this not do it calmly 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.780
 despair because there really is not 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.370
 no point of winning in that regard anymore 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.290
 to have fun and if they do not do it for 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.330
 fun then they are 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.980
 doing too badly I leave you with the 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.110
 video to be seen with some others 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.269
 clips and that you also and sell the 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.440
 yours and try it too I hope that 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.420
 you liked the video and if so
