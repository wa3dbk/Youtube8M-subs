I think whatever Mandarin though that's
got<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.960> be<00:00:25.020> like<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.320> grass<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.770> greener<00:00:26.189> on

got to be like the grass is greener on
the<00:00:26.369> other<00:00:26.430> side<00:00:26.610> scenario<00:00:27.390> like<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> kids<00:00:28.110> in

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
the other side scenario like the kids in

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.040 
the other side scenario like the kids in
the<00:00:28.289> poles<00:00:28.529> are<00:00:28.829> thinking<00:00:29.189> oh<00:00:29.539> you<00:00:30.539> know<00:00:30.570> maybe

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050
