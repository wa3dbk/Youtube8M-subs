00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
comfort I'm actually about an inch from

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.650 
comfort I'm actually about an inch from
the<00:04:06.950> saw<00:04:07.160> it's<00:04:07.580> a<00:04:07.670> good<00:04:07.880> idea<00:04:08.150> to<00:04:08.240> keep<00:04:08.420> hands

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
the saw it's a good idea to keep hands

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:20.199 
the saw it's a good idea to keep hands
away<00:04:12.490> cut<00:04:13.490> down<00:04:13.730> about<00:04:13.940> 1/8<00:04:14.390> of<00:04:14.540> an<00:04:14.690> inch

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.270 

this<00:04:21.209> will<00:04:21.389> make<00:04:21.539> a<00:04:21.599> great<00:04:21.810> pocket<00:04:22.379> for<00:04:23.189> the

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
this will make a great pocket for the

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:47.460 
this will make a great pocket for the
linear<00:04:23.460> side<00:04:23.789> bearings

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.170 

the<00:04:48.470> slide<00:04:48.710> bearing<00:04:49.070> is<00:04:49.190> rocking<00:04:49.610> I<00:04:49.790> need<00:04:50.060> to

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
the slide bearing is rocking I need to

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:57.060 
the slide bearing is rocking I need to
remove<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.630> inner<00:04:50.810> material

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:11.579 

this<00:04:57.730> is<00:04:57.940> the<00:04:58.150> second<00:04:58.510> piece

00:05:11.579 --> 00:05:11.589 

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:15.729 

this<00:05:12.589> one<00:05:12.859> is<00:05:13.099> rocking<00:05:13.489> also<00:05:14.259> the<00:05:15.259> material

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:15.739 
this one is rocking also the material

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:25.589 
this one is rocking also the material
between<00:05:15.889> the<00:05:16.219> two<00:05:16.369> grooves<00:05:16.669> will<00:05:17.059> be<00:05:17.209> removed

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:28.359 

let's<00:05:26.599> test<00:05:26.929> the<00:05:27.109> assembly<00:05:27.559> again<00:05:28.069> this<00:05:28.189> is

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:28.369 
let's test the assembly again this is

00:05:28.369 --> 00:06:50.799 
let's test the assembly again this is
tricky<00:05:28.729> without<00:05:28.819> a<00:05:29.179> rigid<00:05:29.599> support

00:06:50.799 --> 00:06:50.809 

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:54.079 

if<00:06:51.809> it<00:06:51.959> is<00:06:52.080> torqued<00:06:52.349> down<00:06:52.409> too<00:06:52.800> tight<00:06:53.129> it<00:06:53.969> is<00:06:53.999> a

00:06:54.079 --> 00:06:54.089 
if it is torqued down too tight it is a

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:56.119 
if it is torqued down too tight it is a
little<00:06:54.360> sticky<00:06:54.629> after<00:06:55.319> loosening<00:06:55.619> it<00:06:55.830> up<00:06:55.919> a

00:06:56.119 --> 00:06:56.129 
little sticky after loosening it up a

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:58.939 
little sticky after loosening it up a
bit<00:06:56.479> it<00:06:57.479> is<00:06:57.629> smooth<00:06:57.929> and<00:06:58.169> still<00:06:58.469> tight<00:06:58.800> and

00:06:58.939 --> 00:06:58.949 
bit it is smooth and still tight and

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:22.190 
bit it is smooth and still tight and
rigid

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.200
