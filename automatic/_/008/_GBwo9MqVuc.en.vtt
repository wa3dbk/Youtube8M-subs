00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.300 
don't have a candy thermometer you can
certainly<00:05:37.810> still<00:05:38.440> make<00:05:39.240> this<00:05:40.240> toffee<00:05:41.310> while

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
certainly still make this toffee while

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:50.400 
certainly still make this toffee while
watching<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.910> color<00:05:48.870> by<00:05:49.870> having<00:05:50.320> a

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.410 
watching the color by having a

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:59.100 
watching the color by having a
thermometer<00:05:54.810> it<00:05:55.810> will<00:05:56.669> for<00:05:57.669> sure<00:05:58.050> allow<00:05:59.050> you

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
thermometer it will for sure allow you

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.050 
thermometer it will for sure allow you
to<00:05:59.350> cook<00:05:59.560> this<00:05:59.860> to<00:06:00.640> the<00:06:00.729> proper<00:06:01.030> temperature

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
to cook this to the proper temperature

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.980 
to cook this to the proper temperature
otherwise<00:06:01.750> it<00:06:01.930> won't<00:06:02.080> set<00:06:02.470> properly<00:06:02.979> and<00:06:03.990> the

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
otherwise it won't set properly and the

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.940 
otherwise it won't set properly and the
texture<00:06:05.500> of<00:06:05.530> the<00:06:05.740> candy<00:06:06.250> will<00:06:06.940> not<00:06:07.120> be<00:06:07.300> as

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
texture of the candy will not be as

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:16.429 
texture of the candy will not be as
pleasing<00:06:10.590> if<00:06:11.590> you<00:06:11.740> don't<00:06:11.890> cook<00:06:12.100> it<00:06:12.250> warm
