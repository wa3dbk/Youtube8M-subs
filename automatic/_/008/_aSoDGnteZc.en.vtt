00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
not exactly as often as I I would with a

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.639 
not exactly as often as I I would with a
virtus<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.640> but<00:00:57.300> um<00:00:57.480> obviously<00:00:58.020> Aram's<00:00:58.440> one

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
virtus one but um obviously Aram's one

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.290 
virtus one but um obviously Aram's one
is<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> lot<00:00:59.070> better<00:00:59.309> right<00:00:59.460> now<00:00:59.699> than<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.940> master

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
is a lot better right now than a master

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.970 
is a lot better right now than a master
10<00:01:00.570> master<00:01:00.960> one<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.260> not<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.620> like<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.920> don't

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
10 master one is not in like I don't

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.039 
10 master one is not in like I don't
consider<00:01:02.309> this<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.550> wand<00:01:02.820> anymore<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.449> feels

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
consider this a wand anymore it feels

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.390 
consider this a wand anymore it feels
like<00:01:04.110> i'm<00:01:04.260> using<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.589> milli<00:01:04.799> weapon<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.220> trying

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
like i'm using a milli weapon and trying

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.160 
like i'm using a milli weapon and trying
to<00:01:05.460> major<00:01:05.640> that's<00:01:06.000> kind<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.360> how<00:01:06.510> shitty<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.960> is

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
to major that's kind of how shitty it is

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.200 
to major that's kind of how shitty it is
so<00:01:08.100> basically<00:01:08.369> looks<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.640> now<00:01:08.850> if<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.030> want

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
so basically looks like now if you want

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.460 
so basically looks like now if you want
start<00:01:09.390> training<00:01:09.630> magic<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.080> need<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.350> have

version<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.860> murderous<00:01:35.130> wand<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:36.180> know

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
version of a murderous wand or you know

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.819 
version of a murderous wand or you know
I<00:01:36.299> mean<00:01:36.450> Aram's<00:01:36.990> one<00:01:37.229> wasn't<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.680> much

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
I mean Aram's one wasn't that much

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.130 
I mean Aram's one wasn't that much
better<00:01:38.070> at<00:01:38.400> all<00:01:38.549> than<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.030> master<00:01:39.689> one<00:01:39.840> effect

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
better at all than the master one effect

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.600 
better at all than the master one effect
I<00:01:40.229> thought<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.560> better<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.310> ever<00:01:41.490> since

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
I thought it was better but ever since

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.609 
I thought it was better but ever since
the<00:01:41.700> buff<00:01:41.970> definitely<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.930> Arabs<00:01:43.229> one<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.590> a

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the buff definitely the Arabs one is a

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.410 
the buff definitely the Arabs one is a
lot<00:01:43.740> better<00:01:43.890> than<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.310> master<00:01:44.700> one<00:01:44.850> now<00:01:45.000> by

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
lot better than the master one now by

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.749 
lot better than the master one now by
like<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.659> fuck<00:01:45.990> lunch<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.470> honestly<00:01:47.189> think<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.610> can

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
trade magic efficiently you basically

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.370 
trade magic efficiently you basically
need<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.880> have<00:03:09.000> 40<00:03:09.330> mil<00:03:09.510> though<00:03:09.959> from<00:03:10.200> what<00:03:10.260> I

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
need to have 40 mil though from what I

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.290 
need to have 40 mil though from what I
have<00:03:10.560> heard<00:03:10.590> is<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.340> staff<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:11.850> white<00:03:12.090> or

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
have heard is that a staff of white or

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.360 
have heard is that a staff of white or
ki<00:03:12.540> AAG<00:03:12.630> staff<00:03:12.930> whatever<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.380> staffs<00:03:13.650> now<00:03:13.920> are

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
ki AAG staff whatever the staffs now are

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.370 
ki AAG staff whatever the staffs now are
actually<00:03:14.730> not<00:03:14.910> as<00:03:15.180> bad<00:03:15.240> as<00:03:15.630> it<00:03:15.959> used<00:03:15.990> to<00:03:16.230> be

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
actually not as bad as it used to be

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.199 
actually not as bad as it used to be
compared<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.040> ones<00:03:17.250> i<00:03:17.489> mean<00:03:17.519> they<00:03:18.060> weren't

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
compared to the ones i mean they weren't

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:19.460 
compared to the ones i mean they weren't
too<00:03:18.420> too<00:03:18.570> bad<00:03:18.720> before<00:03:18.900> but<00:03:19.110> they<00:03:19.410> were

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
too too bad before but they were

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.290 
too too bad before but they were
definitely<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.950> lot<00:03:20.070> slower<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:21.090> hit

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
definitely a lot slower and it hit

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.660 
definitely a lot slower and it hit
anywhere<00:03:21.690> near<00:03:21.959> as<00:03:22.050> as<00:03:22.230> won't<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.340> higher

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
anywhere near as as won't it a higher

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.670 
anywhere near as as won't it a higher
but<00:03:24.030> i<00:03:24.180> mean<00:03:24.390> just<00:03:24.660> overall<00:03:25.110> an<00:03:25.230> hour<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.560> hit

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
but i mean just overall an hour you hit

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.440 
but i mean just overall an hour you hit
a<00:03:25.709> lot<00:03:25.800> more<00:03:26.040> at<00:03:26.130> the<00:03:26.250> wand<00:03:26.459> but<00:03:27.330> yeah<00:03:27.420> I

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
a lot more at the wand but yeah I

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.300 
a lot more at the wand but yeah I
apparently<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:27.989> the<00:03:28.440> staff<00:03:28.680> is<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> lot<00:03:29.130> better

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
apparently the the staff is a lot better

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.170 
apparently the the staff is a lot better
now<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.519> mean<00:03:29.670> if<00:03:29.760> you're<00:03:29.880> going<00:03:29.970> to<00:03:30.030> use<00:03:30.150> a

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
now I mean if you're going to use a

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.490 
now I mean if you're going to use a
master<00:03:30.540> one<00:03:30.660> you're<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.840> lot<00:03:30.930> better<00:03:31.080> off<00:03:31.290> using

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
master one you're a lot better off using

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.650 
master one you're a lot better off using
a<00:03:31.709> staff<00:03:31.920> of<00:03:32.070> liked<00:03:32.310> we<00:03:32.940> does<00:03:33.060> not<00:03:33.180> splashes

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
a staff of liked we does not splashes

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:34.820 
a staff of liked we does not splashes
off<00:03:33.780> them<00:03:33.989> from<00:03:34.110> what<00:03:34.230> I've<00:03:34.320> been<00:03:34.410> quite<00:03:34.650> sure

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
off them from what I've been quite sure

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.400 
off them from what I've been quite sure
of<00:03:35.300> Aram's<00:03:36.300> wand<00:03:36.570> is<00:03:36.750> probably<00:03:37.019> still<00:03:37.200> better

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
of Aram's wand is probably still better

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.890 
of Aram's wand is probably still better
than<00:03:37.440> staff<00:03:37.739> of<00:03:37.890> lights<00:03:38.070> that's<00:03:38.280> for<00:03:38.430> sure<00:03:38.900> but

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
than staff of lights that's for sure but

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.960 
than staff of lights that's for sure but
yeah<00:03:40.260> if<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.590> want<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.010> trade<00:03:41.160> magic<00:03:41.550> with<00:03:41.760> a

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
yeah if you want to trade magic with a

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.289 
yeah if you want to trade magic with a
one<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.510> need<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:42.810> Aram's<00:03:43.110> or<00:03:43.260> virtus<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.299> if

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
one you need it Aram's or virtus and if

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.350 
one you need it Aram's or virtus and if
this<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.959> one<00:03:46.110> thing<00:03:46.230> also<00:03:46.380> figured<00:03:46.799> out<00:03:46.890> is

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 
this is one thing also figured out is

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.240 
this is one thing also figured out is
for<00:03:48.360> what<00:03:49.110> is<00:03:49.200> called<00:03:49.350> skeletal<00:03:49.950> waiver<00:03:50.100> ins

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
for what is called skeletal waiver ins

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.949 
for what is called skeletal waiver ins
those<00:03:50.459> things<00:03:50.700> you<00:03:50.820> have<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.120> have<00:03:51.269> a<00:03:51.299> DFS<00:03:51.780> on

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
those things you have to have a DFS on

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.490 
those things you have to have a DFS on
which<00:03:52.110> means<00:03:52.320> you<00:03:52.410> basically<00:03:52.530> need<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.220> have<00:03:53.430> a

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
which means you basically need to have a

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.440 
which means you basically need to have a
you<00:03:55.500> know<00:03:55.590> mage<00:03:55.830> one<00:03:56.400> girls<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:57.090> mean<00:03:57.209> they<00:03:57.299> read

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
you know mage one girls I mean they read

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.479 
you know mage one girls I mean they read
the<00:03:57.570> magic<00:03:57.959> and<00:03:58.110> immediate<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.620> DFS<00:03:59.160> so<00:03:59.370> no

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
the magic and immediate of DFS so no

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.070 
the magic and immediate of DFS so no
matter<00:03:59.580> what<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.940> have<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.239> use<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.360> long<00:04:00.600> or

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
matter what you have to use a long or

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.780 
matter what you have to use a long or
else<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.530> get<00:04:01.650> butt<00:04:01.799> raped<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.640> it's

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
else you to get butt raped and it's

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.460 
else you to get butt raped and it's
already<00:04:03.060> hard<00:04:03.209> enough<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.660> survive<00:04:04.019> at<00:04:04.410> the

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
already hard enough to survive at the

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.830 
already hard enough to survive at the
scale<00:04:04.980> to<00:04:05.160> weigh<00:04:05.250> ins<00:04:05.580> with<00:04:06.000> using<00:04:06.330> virtus<00:04:06.630> and

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
scale to weigh ins with using virtus and

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.080 
scale to weigh ins with using virtus and
you<00:04:07.350> know<00:04:07.440> DFS<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:07.920> all<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.310> crap<00:04:08.400> soulsplit

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
you know DFS and all that crap soulsplit

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.449 
you know DFS and all that crap soulsplit
and<00:04:09.480> blood<00:04:09.720> barrage<00:04:10.049> and<00:04:10.350> now<00:04:10.980> you<00:04:11.040> basically

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
and blood barrage and now you basically

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:13.490 
and blood barrage and now you basically
need<00:04:11.910> aaron's<00:04:12.330> one<00:04:12.480> there<00:04:12.720> or<00:04:12.870> verse<00:04:13.080> one<00:04:13.350> or

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
need aaron's one there or verse one or

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.990 
need aaron's one there or verse one or
so<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.799> just<00:04:13.950> you<00:04:14.130> have<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.310> skip<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.730> task

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
so you just you have to skip that task
