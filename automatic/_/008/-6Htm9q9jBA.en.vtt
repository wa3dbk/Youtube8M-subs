these<00:00:00.240> photographs<00:00:00.870> of<00:00:01.319> these<00:00:01.530> UFOs<00:00:02.070> are

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:02.340 
these photographs of these UFOs are

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.280 
these photographs of these UFOs are
related<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.939> the<00:00:03.060> Nazi<00:00:03.449> program<00:00:03.689> in<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.110> first

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
related to the Nazi program in the first

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.340 
related to the Nazi program in the first
place<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:05.009> photographs<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:06.120> took<00:00:06.350> were

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
place the photographs that I took were

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.259 
place the photographs that I took were
small<00:00:08.189> models<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.540> built<00:00:09.990> myself<00:00:10.200> just<00:00:11.099> to

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
small models that I built myself just to

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.759 
small models that I built myself just to
try<00:00:12.269> out<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.690> different<00:00:13.080> types<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.500> angles

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
try out the different types of angles

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.490 
try out the different types of angles
focal<00:00:14.610> lengths<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.150> viewing<00:00:15.870> projections

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
focal lengths and viewing projections

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.189 
focal lengths and viewing projections
and<00:00:16.740> how<00:00:16.949> that<00:00:17.010> relates<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.699> other<00:00:17.850> type<00:00:18.210> Case

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
and how that relates to other type Case

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.929 
and how that relates to other type Case
Files<00:00:19.470> that's<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.100> reason<00:00:20.400> why<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.580> created

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
Files that's the reason why I created

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.590

whatsoever<00:00:44.879> they're<00:00:45.120> all<00:00:45.239> models<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.500> you've

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
whatsoever they're all models so you've

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.040 
whatsoever they're all models so you've
placed<00:00:47.550> models<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.809> air<00:00:49.050> film<00:00:50.039> them<00:00:50.370> and

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:51.050 
placed models in the air film them and

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.479 
placed models in the air film them and
that<00:00:52.050> those<00:00:52.410> are<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> flight<00:00:52.980> those<00:00:53.340> are

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
that those are the flight those are

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.090 
that those are the flight those are
models<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.120> flying<00:00:54.780> discs<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.800> correct

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
models of flying discs that is correct

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.360 
models of flying discs that is correct
ok<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.699> they<00:00:56.969> are<00:00:57.030> not<00:00:57.300> actual<00:00:58.370> operating

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
ok so they are not actual operating

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.970 
ok so they are not actual operating
aircraft<00:01:00.270> they<00:01:00.480> are<00:01:00.629> only<00:01:00.960> model<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.829> is

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
aircraft they are only model that is

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.990 
aircraft they are only model that is
correct<00:01:02.250> ok<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.969> were<00:01:03.210> never<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:03.780> any

site<00:01:24.750> at<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.049> time<00:01:25.290> but<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.680> aircraft<00:01:26.250> in

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
site at that time but the aircraft in

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.760 
site at that time but the aircraft in
Windows<00:01:27.060> booked<00:01:27.299> our<00:01:27.540> models<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.500> built

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
Windows booked our models that I built

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.999 
Windows booked our models that I built
ok<00:01:29.549> now<00:01:30.030> let's<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.479> better<00:01:30.750> if<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.470> you

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
photos that you have there and maybe

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.580 
photos that you have there and maybe
give<00:02:13.410> us

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
give us

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.740 
give us

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
them well this craft was operational

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.320 
them well this craft was operational
1960<00:02:19.319> that's<00:02:19.530> nine<00:02:19.769> years<00:02:20.069> before<00:02:20.370> Apollo<00:02:20.819> 11

this<00:02:21.840> may<00:02:22.170> explain<00:02:22.349> why<00:02:22.940> Neil<00:02:23.940> Armstrong<00:02:24.480> will

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
not talk about Apollo 11 because there's

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.000 
not talk about Apollo 11 because there's
a<00:02:27.239> high<00:02:27.420> likelihood<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:28.080> he<00:02:28.470> was<00:02:28.650> not<00:02:28.860> the
