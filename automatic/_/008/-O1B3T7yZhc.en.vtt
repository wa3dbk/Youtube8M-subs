00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.540
 lots to all I tested for you the 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.099
 new baby air from salma so a 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:11.889
 ski on which it can have a 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:14.170
 prioris a ski that is 100 mm in skates 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.090
 so I test them I was pleasantly 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.750
 Surprise it's really a fun ski 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.090
 nice nice mat and despite 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.260
 its 100 mm in the skate can be found 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.510
 shift changes that are when 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.670
 even fairly fluid fast enough again 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.300
 came in the 2013 collection at 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.460
 Solomon is the bbr the 10.0 is a 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.460
 ski that comes hatch the range bbr 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.290
 we know since 2012 the great 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.950
 particularity is that we have a skate 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.760
 is much wider 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.079
 we will be at 97 mm at the level of the skate 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.840
 is going to have a ski that is going to be a lot 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.300
 earlier or very directive a radius of 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.340
 over 20 meters we will go to a 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.789
 customers good skiers or very 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.410
 good skiers rather friendly to what 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:01.090
 is off the tracks we will say we 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.989
 will be off-track at 70 80% it's a 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.449
 which is quite exceptional 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.240
 this year's bbr range had already 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.909
 well mark the spirits this one for 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.740
 the expert clientele is going to be really 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.090
 the essential product for 2013 you 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.400
 have written down that I recommend for 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.170
 good skiers or very good even 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.790
 expert the good skiers what they are going 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.890
 appreciate it's really his tolerance to 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.750
 maneuverability and the fact that it's a ski 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.280
 goes everywhere and the good ones very good 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.470
 skiers what they will really be able to 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.320
 what they will really like is the 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.030
 we are still a ski we go 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.350
 say type is almost even if the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.240
 data in five years even though the data 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.650
 off piste track it's going 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.090
 behavior really resume being 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.220
 excellent and we will find a 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.200
 track behavior despite yet another 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.610
 times the 100 mm to the skate really very 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.619
 nice with quarter changes 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.079
 which are still pretty fast given the 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.119
 width in skate the very good score for 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:50.320
 l use everywhere it's true that his 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.850
 favorite terrain it will be before 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.710
 the whole side of the tracks the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.600
 the off-piste the undergrowth the fir trees 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.880
 where there are no traces he will 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.009
 to please even better though it will be 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.750
 not registered on track quite the contrary 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.080
 we are a rocker who are triggering 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.070
 very early at about that level it's 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.810
 a rocker at these extremes 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.819
 that's why it's a ski that will be 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.650
 relatively interesting on track is 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.770
 very very interesting outside the 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.770
 tracks
