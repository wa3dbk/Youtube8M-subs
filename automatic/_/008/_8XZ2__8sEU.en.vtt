00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello girls how are you welcome to 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:09.390
 my second channel that these talks of 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.110
 friends and well this channel for me is like 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:17.400
 something more personal something more relaxed without 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.340
 edition but that is me like that to which I am 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.340
 and I have been told to make videos as well 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.650
 blogs showing my family and all this 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.539
 but really if you give me a little bit of 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.920
 fear and I have to confess is the one 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.290
 little bit of fear to show my family and 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.540
 that's what it is because they see that sometimes 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.370
 there are many beautiful people on the other 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.100
 side of the screen but the same time 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.110
 Well, that's true, I have because one 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.690
 He does not know who is behind and I hope that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.170
 you can understand this but I such 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.530
 which I am, I stand before you and 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.360
 I want 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.120
 start uploading videos in this other 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.670
 channel and I know they have told me a lot 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:00.239
 that I left this channel that I already left it and 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.949
 recently we were talking in 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.350
 facebook about this that I want 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.450
 upload videos with topics that you 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.580
 say and so that I give them my point 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.780
 view what I think and many me 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.610
 they were saying about the 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.119
 organization that follows how you organize 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.100
 how did you shoot him organize with 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.130

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.229
 mom take care of your children take care of your house and 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.440
 all that and I have to tell you that it is not 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.590
 easy is quite difficult 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.020
 put everything in order but first it is 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.289
 take priority priorities 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.539
 God my family and then I work and for 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.610
 what do I say work because this of the 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.630
 videos and the blog takes me quite 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.670
 time absorbs a lot of my time 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.399
 effort as you can not imagine 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.619
 then apart from being a funny thing 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.420
 something that I love something that I love 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.380
 it requires effort and responsibility 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.290
 so that's why I call him work 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:03.500
 it's a hobby and our hobby and before 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.690

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.880
 is the word means pastime and 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.580
 hobby because it's something that you do not 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.709
 more to spend the time you have but 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.510
 this is not to spend anything else time 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.780

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.820
 work hours responsibility enter 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.170
 on the computer editing or recording a 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.080
 video and I know that those who make videos and 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.090
 they are dedicated to this they know the work and 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.560
 effort that this requires to go up 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.690
 videos and try to do the best 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.820
 possible because then undertake a camera 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.160
 like this video that you know me and 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.200

 put this here there because really 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:52.880
 it comes to work but it's rewarding 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.890

 do not believe in me that it's a pretty 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.340
 gratifying more when 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:13.970
 you start having different projects and 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.750
 those projects are based on your 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.430
 real effort is quite 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.410
 rewarding and it feels very good and 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.560

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:23.560
 well then you have to beat yourself and 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:26.290
 knowing that as a mom I decided to raise 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.740
 my children and educate my children because 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.540
 times one because you have to leave them 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.860
 different reasons or by necessity 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.950
 someone else to take care of them but I 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.050
 I decided to do it and that's why this was 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.300
 make videos because they already had a 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.880
 time to do it and one day 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.669
 I lost the camera and I said let's do 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.320
 something productive I never believed that I 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.780
 were to see more than five people 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.430
 I really just wanted to like 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.300
 express myself turn on a camera and 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.330
 Express myself 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:58.449
 and thank God this has been growing and 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:01.270
 something has been done with a project a 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:04.509
 beautiful project to the problem which I put 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:07.900
 passion heart surrender you imagine 

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:10.419
 hours hours after this I 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.520
 I point out the priority things in a 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.710
 book what I have to do what 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.979
 have a date to do I put it here 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.409
 sometimes I put that day I want 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.960
 record a video sometimes you can not 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:25.870
 because my husband well-being of my children 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.050
 they make noise and you see a video like that 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.569
 If I go there, something nice for you 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:33.250
 something special and I know that maybe they do not 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.800
 It would affect them to see my children there 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:37.960
 running and screaming and making noise 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.909
 the majority of people because 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.469
 they would understand then that I am a mom but 

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:43.659
 many people do not understand it then 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.370
 I try to give my best and 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:47.409
 then my husband helps me take care of 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.539
 children sometimes duck arrived sometimes 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:52.569
 when we recorded videos of outfits he 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.000
 record me and then we're like the 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:06:00.490
 children are there playing and he 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.670
 and it's something that we're a team and always 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:06.250
 his support is essential to organize and 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.350
 get up early to take care of my family and 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.330
 all that then I'm going to work 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.700
 from home on the computer and then 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.710
 I will try to think about creating 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.800
 content new ideas and things like that 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.320
 so yes, it is quite essential 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:22.330
 organization and another thing not to get frustrated 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.130
 when they can not do things because 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.170
 this is the number one thing that I repeat myself 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.090
 always do not ask yourself if you do not 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:29.980
 frustrate because sometimes I have a plan 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:32.110
 is going to do such a thing and you can not 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.790
 because my time revolves around the 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.530
 My children's time and my children 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.100
 allow then then I'm going to do 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:40.840
 the things that sometimes can not be 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:43.480
 could not but good if it could not 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.520
 do already tried another day and succeeded 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.980
 do and that 's why maybe I can not 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.200
 I'm not so constant in the videos 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.750
 because the videos that I would love 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.880
 upload daily video but then to upload 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.240
 a video and edit everything takes me more than 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.639
 one day and that suits me 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:03.460
 and that I fix a piece of hair and I go 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:05.710
 to take care of a child and then I'm going to have 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.440
 another child my life is like that and I 'm not going to 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:10.960
 create a fantasy life and tell them of 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.360
 that I'm going to be, I fix the 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.340
 project because it's not like that my life is 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.830
 normal like anybody's and 

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.720
 that what I want you to see and 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.610
 Well girls, I hope you helped them
