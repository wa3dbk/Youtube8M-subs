00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.530
 wind 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.160
 I arrived young with little experience 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.320
 still in the Spanish team but 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.510
 candle what is global the magnitude is 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.670
 world the organization of a world 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.070
 all that is behind a world not 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.379
 you realize that you are privileged 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.500
 you are not privileged because you have the 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.570
 lucky to play global when when the 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.120
 player is fulfilling stage is going burning 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.190
 stages and now I understand is not the fact 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.500
 that there are wonderful players that 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.660
 have had an extraordinary level to 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.790
 level in your club and have not had the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.790
 luck to play a world cup 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.710
 for me 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.830
 when you are going to depend on the world 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.670
 of the event is going to strain with the 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:13.570
 feeling of greatness of these tournaments 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:16.590
 he leaves with the feeling of him so he is 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:19.140
 pressure so extension yes that there 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.170
 a lot of accumulated tension a lot of pressure 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.060
 of the environment but blessed privileged 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.740
 have the opportunity to play a world cup 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.450
 they played world colors 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.990
 from your country I think that's a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.990
 privilege 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.020
 Switzerland moment was a moment 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.550
 extraordinarily complex difficult 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.870
 where 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.680
 where I think calm calm 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.450
 she was a good adviser a good 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.850
 counselor I think that calm that 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.770
 I think Vincent kept kept you 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.540
 the environment that the federation maintained 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.030
 although he kept it we kept the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.460
 players I think that in that aspect is 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.920
 now one when time passes I think 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.700
 that calm was was was part of the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.700
 success of that 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.050
 I think it's that day to rest 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.080
 many generations of players between 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.330
 which I include myself so as not to stop 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.220
 finally they are already we do not have to 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.170
 listen more Spain never won 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.110
 world spain yes the eternal promise 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.760
 Spain I think it was a 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.510
 tremendous satisfaction of tremendous 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.510
 wonderful 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.720
 but when we lost the first game 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.890
 against Switzerland everyone said 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.380
 nobody who has lost the first match 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.000
 or got a world and everybody 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.150
 says nobody who has been champion of 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.130
 world in previous good that is the challenge 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.260
 it's not the challenge not the statistics has 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.410
 how are you to break them not for another 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.410
 thing
