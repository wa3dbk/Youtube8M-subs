00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.320
 is very good these kids that such 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.250
 as you are and this is a kind of 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.470
 review hbo boxing of my new tablet that 

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.820
 I bought and it's good he said it for 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.230
 twitter and have told me that if you 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.450
 you want to see it and such that you 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.160
 ready I hope you like I take 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.590
 to his job and such because he did not know 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.380
 exactly how to do it and you'll see how 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.790
 images are like this pretty well in 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.240
 quality and then what is the video that 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.890
 he records it with the camera and 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.000
 then I made it a little smaller 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.770
 Well for you to see it better 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.180
 resolution and such I hope you like it is 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.590
 what is left because neither 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.750
 wants to do the typical boxing 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.610
 teaching everything and not knowing how it is that 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.920
 that is, now what are the 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.170
 characteristics and what goes that already 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.970
 is testing how a week ago a 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.160
 week or so or more than I have it so 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.340
 well, I also wanted to heal myself in a 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.260
 little more no and well then you will ask me 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.300
 how is it that you bought yourself because 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.950
 surely you already know what the 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:12.490
 samsung galaxy tab 3 light and is a 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.720
 tablet very well and good is the can 4 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.040
 which is a superior model that brings 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.890
 enough improvements that we are going to tell 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.280
 well the difference the advantages and that 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.150
 what's wrong with it 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.799
 this model regards the taf 4 so 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.020
 more than anything so I asked for it and good 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:29.900
 Well, I'm going to tell you a little bit about what 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.850
 has has a lcd screen of 7 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:37.790
 inches a giga of ram that goes very well 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.560
 brings glonass gps or something like that I do not know for 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.390
 what does this mean I suppose it will be for 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.890
 the maps and all that 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:48.100
 then bring a dual core to 12 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.290
 double 1.2 processor that is very fluid 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:56.710
 the tablet then brings a camera of 2 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:59.260
 megapixels and a 3,600 m battery 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:03.550
 I do not know how I said that but also 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.650
 has 3,600 vouchers and taf 4 has 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.270
 because you also want to know if 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:11.110
 you want to buy one so if you want a 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.580
 superior the taf 4 what it has is 1,5 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.930
 gb of ram 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.950
 I think the screen has the same 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:20.830
 inches I guess it will be high anymore 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.410
 high resolution then bring it the gps 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.980
 brings 5 megapixels and the front camera 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.989
 of 1.3 brings four processors if I do not 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.550
 wrong is to 1.6 there is yes there will be 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.910
 difference and then regarding the battery 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.370
 Well, if it's 6,000 or 7,000 what's 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.850
 Okay , you're already trying a week and if you 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.800
 I tell the truth in camera issues I'm 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.180
 quite satisfied it looks very good what 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.510
 only one that is missing from the front camera 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.130
 Well, I do not know what is missing, I think that one 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.960
 It will cost nothing to put a front camera 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.510
 because it should not cost us a lot 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.820
 a pixel or something you know because there is 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.440
 they burn themes and it's pretty short in 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.620
 the subject of the camera and is the front 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.540
 it lacks then quality issue looks very 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.430
 well it did not come out to see youtube and all 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.950
 those things then it's perfect the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.980
 processor is also quite fast the 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.440
 ram is going very well 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.860
 the theme of the drums is a subject that 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.450
 touches the perendengues takes time to load 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.430
 maybe one hour with the gÃ¼icho and 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.430
 put alone and without an open application 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.530
 I only dropped 5% then I also 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.660
 reheats enough and then I'm 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.970
 playing clans cases that by the way 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.340
 we made a plan and failure 2 but 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.769
 amazing people did not attack or anything 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.660
 so what do I know if you like the idea of 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.730
 have a clan clan class but it comes 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.260
 done this time well also tell me the 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.270
 comments and I know I'll get on 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.850
 agreement with several and we will do it 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.890
 the issue is because he has also bought me 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.110
 why and why you buy a tablet 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.510
 well because if with all the expenses that 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.860
 they have a pirate play 3 because 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.740
 I have them to send and so good with 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.540
 many of you will have already seen her and I have seen her in handsome 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:59.600
 because I'm super hooked 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.050
 It cost me 75 euros when it costs in 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.450
 darfur or incite these hundred and something like 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.890
 so I caught it and also the brightness 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.500
 because I was with the president and everything 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:13.130
 so perfect the truth pretty well 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:18.140
 the theme of that of taf 4 already cost 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:20.390
 and if they were 145 and 160 that's what I remember but 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:22.070
 if they were around that price and that was because 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.230
 a bargain is my first tablet so 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.820
 also that because I will use it especially 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:29.360
 for twitter because I read them out there 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.400
 twitter and little else so I hope that you 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.220
 have liked to see if the mountain 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.570
 carroll clans is also I want to record 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.810
 I want to record hacks, it has also 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.050
 bought because it is that I have it saved 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.210
 ajax or site tools for de gta for 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.830
 tell it with the tablet and it can be very 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.680
 well and I also want to record what 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.360
 that are boxing serum boxing of the play 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.160
 pirate with the design I do not think I do 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.260
