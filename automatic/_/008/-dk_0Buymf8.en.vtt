00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.719
 I discovered the things showroom 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.390
 rational wall there are about six 

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:42.670
 month as a yellow that offers a 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.019
 wide range of products for the bathroom 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.550
 baths so I was pretty happy but 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.780
 that's dreaming it gives you choice 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.299
 is happy it's nice to be able to 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.399
 see a little the possibilities of things 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:54.219
 simpler more sophisticated sometimes 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:55.449
 completely crazy and especially dingo 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:56.530
 in the furniture push the furniture that 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.979
 are the most surprising found at 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.979
 design level 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.150
 I was very happy when I get to 6 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.740
 after contact with me because I 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.390
 did not just come but I had 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.130
 bought an apartment and so had to 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.360
 completely remodel all redo 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.030
 to break everything needed everything because the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.380
 facts so I came to see the day where 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.910
 many choices obviously after all 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.710
 it 's about having choice and then knowing 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.850
 what will happen in my room 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.710
 foam bath that rolled we still 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.760
 limited by the measures and their courses 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.010
 the moment has just chosen 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.479
 I have more confidence in the 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.770
 counselor of scholars s saying 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.479
 here it is more or less good if it is 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.580
 what I want I am limited by the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.750
 measures and by the space for the party 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.070
 something nice and I'm going 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.390
 fully trust so east 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.340
 but obviously she transferred to me 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.710
 choice but I wanted still not bad 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.080
 confidence and I'm happy because 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.460
 the result is nickel but I 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.770
 find it's going to complicate it's not so 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.540
 obvious that it would limit well prevents 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.130
 it was not everywhere, but I 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.720
 hot racing to the counselor who allows 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.240
 really to do a whole bunch of 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.590
 work a little tiring I think it's 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.420
 to say to make a choice in advance 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.650
 possible possibilities and after 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.540
 to compose oneself with what has been 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.580
 choose what then me what I like 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.720
 as mobilizes everything that is done I 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.420
 so am all that is at bnq is 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:10.340
 rather it will fall and that's what I 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.340
 chosen for my home a little style wings 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.790
 my first crush and it was 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.530
 easy for several reasons first the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.160
 clean side in gray and white side 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.630
 I really like 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.250
 with a touch of color that was 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.840
 a little to choose from and if we put glass 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.460
 we can see his fuchsia mom or in 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.890
 purple or so again very purified on 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.270
 goes back to white then is particular 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.220
 that I did not know the combination 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.140
 the color of the chromium and Latvian actually 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.480
 in white it will not hurt its design 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.980
 nice enough because sometimes the white 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.630
 it may be cold but here I find that 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.830
 it's design and it has a side when 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.570
 even warm so that's my 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.570
 first blow of heart here with rafters 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.990
 it is by a crush for the space 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.250
 but more for the design side it's 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.570
 a heater in case you would not have it 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.040
 noticed a hyper design heating 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.900
 seeing them she's here at the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.240
 beautiful faucet is too small 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.290
 for for at home would like the space is 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.730
 too small for m 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.550
 this beautiful heater but that's so 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.020
 space is something rather 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:35.400
 rather design is well here it is a 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:37.510
 nice idea I like a lot of 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.270
 third space third favorite 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.670
 it's the walk-in shower 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.110
 huge space of alone or accompanied or 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:46.630
 with children it can still be 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.040
 fun and l'oreal o2 head rain this 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.690
 famous shower that we see with this big 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.920
 pommel like we want to take 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.810
 a shower years and he had his 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.090
 hair we want to be relaxed so here 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.760
 that's more for the space that is 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.770
 enough pretty big enough and then pros the 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.520
 lovers all the big fans of showers 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.520
 rather than baths 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.700
 we continue with the 4th and that's one of 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.379
 my favourites 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.150
 simply for the wood it's 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:11.890
 solid wood so we see it here not the 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.359
 plywood or what it is wood 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.250
 massive he loves the wood that makes me 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.530
 think a little bit about Asian tech style 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.389
 feng shui faucets are very 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.829
 very beautiful you see them here it's 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.060
 that's really what I 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.580
 I prefer stone and wood 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.320
 together we had to beard recomposed then a 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.509
 little look anyway to duck 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.320
 abl me who seldom take a barca 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:30.820
 what to give anyway 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.699
 this bathtub which is still 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.289
 integrated and that we see his 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.449
 splendid it's really very very beautiful 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:38.620
 game that interests me because it's my 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.740
 lets to refer for the combination 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.720
 of wood and stone and there is a 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.039
 nice energy ci could take a 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.720
 bath but it's a showroom so I do not 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:50.160
 can not take part so that was 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.160
 My fourth favorite space 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:24.839
 m 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.560
 the renault of things in cincinnati 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.020
 purse seiners said that I did you 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:41.050
 in fact we're going to give them the sum of 15 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:41.050
 have defected 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.060
 it's up to you to fight we will hold all 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.060
 dance 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:04.569
 he 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.879
 my predictions will change if a 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.770
 quality anticyclone and a rain of 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.719
 good advice jaurÃ¨s and take care of 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:13.050
