wouldn't<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.950> said<00:01:47.790> John<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.210> don't<00:01:48.390> think<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
wouldn't I said John I don't think it

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.730 
wouldn't I said John I don't think it
has<00:01:48.659> anything<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> do<00:01:49.079> with<00:01:49.110> money<00:01:49.409> I<00:01:49.470> think<00:01:49.590> it

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
has anything to do with money I think it

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.469 
has anything to do with money I think it
has<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.189> name<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.430> the<00:01:50.490> car<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.450> I

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
has to do with the name of the car so I

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.030 
has to do with the name of the car so I
don't<00:01:51.689> think<00:01:51.780> we'd<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.049> together<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.770> John

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
don't think we'd get together so John

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.859 
don't think we'd get together so John
and<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.250> didn't<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.000> together<00:01:54.149> as<00:01:54.450> him<00:01:54.600> working

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and I didn't get together as him working

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.440 
and I didn't get together as him working
for<00:01:54.899> us<00:01:55.110> but<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:55.799> soon<00:01:55.979> as<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.399> put<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.939> car<00:01:57.119> into

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
for us but as soon as I put the car into

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.330 
for us but as soon as I put the car into
bankruptcy<00:01:57.869> he<00:01:58.200> gave<00:01:58.409> me<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> call<00:01:58.770> again<00:01:59.040> and

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
bankruptcy he gave me a call again and

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
bankruptcy he gave me a call again and
this<00:01:59.820> time<00:01:59.880> he<00:02:00.180> wanted<00:02:00.390> to<00:02:00.450> hire<00:02:00.570> my<00:02:00.750> crew<00:02:01.020> and

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
this time he wanted to hire my crew and

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.499 
this time he wanted to hire my crew and
he<00:02:01.649> wanted<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.890> build<00:02:02.100> his<00:02:02.189> own

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
he wanted to build his own

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.410 
he wanted to build his own
and<00:02:03.259> he<00:02:03.469> won<00:02:03.619> of<00:02:03.799> course<00:02:03.829> copy<00:02:04.280> it<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.789> every

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
and he won of course copy it in every

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.480 
and he won of course copy it in every
way<00:02:05.450> name<00:02:05.750> demand<00:02:06.110> and<00:02:06.380> it<00:02:06.560> happened<00:02:06.950> to<00:02:07.009> be<00:02:07.070> I

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
way name demand and it happened to be I

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.479 
way name demand and it happened to be I
happen<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.420> have<00:02:08.599> our<00:02:08.629> pre<00:02:09.050> prototype<00:02:09.590> then<00:02:10.310> he

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
happen to have our pre prototype then he

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.949 
happen to have our pre prototype then he
had<00:02:10.580> seen<00:02:10.789> that<00:02:11.180> he<00:02:11.300> wanted<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.569> copy<00:02:11.780> exactly

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
had seen that he wanted to copy exactly

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.479 
had seen that he wanted to copy exactly
then<00:02:12.620> I<00:02:12.709> gave<00:02:12.860> him<00:02:12.980> permission

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
then I gave him permission

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.050 
then I gave him permission
so<00:02:13.879> John<00:02:14.150> DeLoreans<00:02:14.629> car<00:02:14.900> is<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.830> exact<00:02:16.250> car

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
so John DeLoreans car is the exact car

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.390 
so John DeLoreans car is the exact car
that<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:17.720> reject<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.410> and<00:02:18.620> still<00:02:18.980> have<00:02:19.160> that

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
that I reject it and still have that

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.900 
that I reject it and still have that
prototype<00:02:19.880> that<00:02:20.569> was<00:02:20.720> designed<00:02:20.989> in<00:02:21.230> 1972<00:02:22.010> when

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
prototype that was designed in 1972 when

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.790 
prototype that was designed in 1972 when
we<00:02:23.209> started<00:02:23.599> to<00:02:23.690> build<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.870> car<00:02:24.050> we<00:02:24.440> thought<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
we started to build a car we thought the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.559 
we started to build a car we thought the
car<00:02:24.920> was<00:02:25.099> going<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.280> come<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.790> around<00:02:25.880> 3000

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
car was going to come in around 3000

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.300 
car was going to come in around 3000
pounds<00:02:26.810> because<00:02:27.380> we<00:02:27.650> were<00:02:27.709> using<00:02:27.860> plastic

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
pounds because we were using plastic

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.410 
pounds because we were using plastic
body<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.700> we<00:02:28.760> thought<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:28.970> was<00:02:29.209> going<00:02:29.360> to

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
body and we thought that was going to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.270 
body and we thought that was going to
save<00:02:29.540> us<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> lot<00:02:29.900> but<00:02:30.650> if<00:02:30.830> you<00:02:30.950> look<00:02:31.099> at<00:02:31.220> the

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
save us a lot but if you look at the

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.220 
save us a lot but if you look at the
frame<00:02:31.489> of<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.730> car<00:02:31.879> it's<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.510> very<00:02:32.750> heavy<00:02:32.930> steel

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
frame of the car it's a very heavy steel

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.190 
frame of the car it's a very heavy steel
so<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:34.250> was<00:02:34.370> easy<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.700> weld<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.690> was<00:02:35.870> certainly

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
so it was easy to weld it was certainly

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.320 
so it was easy to weld it was certainly
easy<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.620> buy<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.640> was<00:02:37.760> certainly<00:02:38.030> cheap

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
easy to buy and it was certainly cheap

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.750 
easy to buy and it was certainly cheap
but<00:02:38.840> although<00:02:39.140> we<00:02:39.290> invested<00:02:40.190> in<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.400> tooling

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
but although we invested in the tooling

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.600 
but although we invested in the tooling
for<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.480> The<00:02:42.170> Birdcage<00:02:42.410> around<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.400> frame

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
for the The Birdcage around the frame

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.640 
for the The Birdcage around the frame
which<00:02:44.090> held<00:02:44.329> the<00:02:44.480> doors<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:45.019> it's<00:02:45.319> all<00:02:45.560> the

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
which held the doors and it's all the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.589 
which held the doors and it's all the
pieces<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.099> body<00:02:46.280> we<00:02:46.940> did<00:02:47.150> not<00:02:47.329> have<00:02:47.480> to

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 
pieces of the body we did not have to

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.449 
pieces of the body we did not have to
invest<00:02:47.810> anything<00:02:48.110> into<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.500> frame<00:02:48.680> itself<00:02:48.950> as

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
invest anything into the frame itself as

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.339 
invest anything into the frame itself as
far<00:02:49.760> as<00:02:49.880> tooling<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:50.930> think<00:02:51.170> it's<00:02:51.290> a

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
far as tooling and I think it's a

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.350 
far as tooling and I think it's a
Canadian<00:02:51.560> car<00:02:51.860> it<00:02:52.549> was<00:02:52.670> engineered<00:02:52.910> in

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
Canadian car it was engineered in

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.569 
Canadian car it was engineered in
Detroit<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.989> was<00:02:54.560> conceived<00:02:54.950> in<00:02:55.220> the<00:02:55.340> United

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
Detroit I was conceived in the United

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.240 
Detroit I was conceived in the United
States<00:02:55.819> but<00:02:56.569> it<00:02:56.690> was<00:02:56.810> developed<00:02:57.260> actually<00:02:57.860> in

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
States but it was developed actually in

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.740 
States but it was developed actually in
Canada<00:02:58.430> and<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:58.970> think<00:02:59.150> it<00:02:59.239> was<00:02:59.329> an<00:02:59.420> achievement

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
Canada and I think it was an achievement

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.839 
Canada and I think it was an achievement
to<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.260> political<00:03:00.530> power<00:03:00.980> of<00:03:01.310> a<00:03:01.400> man<00:03:01.579> by<00:03:01.819> the

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
to the political power of a man by the

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.780 
to the political power of a man by the
name<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.180> premier<00:03:02.930> Hatfield<00:03:03.230> who<00:03:03.829> told<00:03:04.519> goal

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
name of premier Hatfield who told goal
