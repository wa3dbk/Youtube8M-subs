transition<00:00:22.790> from<00:00:23.000> day<00:00:23.420> to<00:00:23.480> evening<00:00:23.660> and<00:00:24.290> it's

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
transition from day to evening and it's

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.460 
transition from day to evening and it's
a<00:00:25.460> really<00:00:25.970> it<00:00:26.090> like<00:00:26.450> I<00:00:26.570> said<00:00:26.630> it<00:00:26.870> uses<00:00:27.110> a<00:00:27.140> lot<00:00:27.350> of

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:27.470 
a really it like I said it uses a lot of

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.529 
a really it like I said it uses a lot of
basics<00:00:27.920> and<00:00:28.130> honestly<00:00:28.970> could<00:00:29.270> be<00:00:29.360> put

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
basics and honestly could be put

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.060 
basics and honestly could be put
together<00:00:29.690> in<00:00:30.080> like<00:00:30.289> two<00:00:30.530> minutes<00:00:30.680> it<00:00:31.010> was

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
together in like two minutes it was

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.520 
together in like two minutes it was
really<00:00:31.490> quick<00:00:31.699> and<00:00:31.820> easy<00:00:32.000> and<00:00:32.390> I<00:00:32.840> would<00:00:33.350> say

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
really quick and easy and I would say

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.860 
really quick and easy and I would say
most<00:00:33.800> people<00:00:33.920> have<00:00:34.520> these<00:00:35.090> items<00:00:35.570> or

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.940 
basics and this one is SuperDuper soft
on<00:02:07.969> the<00:02:08.509> bottom<00:02:08.869> I'm<00:02:09.020> wearing<00:02:09.319> a<00:02:09.380> fairly<00:02:09.739> dark

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
on the bottom I'm wearing a fairly dark

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.490 
on the bottom I'm wearing a fairly dark
wash<00:02:10.250> skinny<00:02:10.790> jean

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
wash skinny jean

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.040 
wash skinny jean
and<00:02:11.590> these<00:02:12.040> are<00:02:12.220> kind<00:02:12.430> of<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.970> jegging<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.870> guess

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
and these are kind of a jegging I guess

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.570 
and these are kind of a jegging I guess
because<00:02:14.290> they<00:02:14.410> have<00:02:14.530> a<00:02:14.560> lot<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.890> spandex<00:02:15.160> on

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
because they have a lot of spandex on

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.370 
because they have a lot of spandex on
them<00:02:15.760> so<00:02:16.060> they're<00:02:16.330> thinner<00:02:16.840> than<00:02:17.170> your

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
them so they're thinner than your

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.980 
them so they're thinner than your
standard<00:02:18.450> heavyweight<00:02:19.450> jean<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:20.310> these<00:02:21.310> are

haul and the review I haven't decided

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.110 
haul and the review I haven't decided
yet<00:06:12.780> if<00:06:12.990> I<00:06:13.080> am<00:06:13.230> going<00:06:13.530> to<00:06:13.620> do<00:06:13.770> do<00:06:14.220> a<00:06:14.250> tutorial<00:06:14.580> on

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
yet if I am going to do do a tutorial on

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.690 
yet if I am going to do do a tutorial on
that<00:06:15.180> so<00:06:15.750> I<00:06:16.130> don't<00:06:17.130> know<00:06:17.220> but<00:06:17.460> like<00:06:17.580> I

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
that so I don't know but like I

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:19.160 
that so I don't know but like I
mentioned<00:06:18.090> in<00:06:18.180> that<00:06:18.240> video<00:06:18.420> I<00:06:18.600> really<00:06:18.900> didn't

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:19.170 
mentioned in that video I really didn't

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.230 
mentioned in that video I really didn't
like<00:06:19.260> the<00:06:19.470> eye<00:06:19.590> palette<00:06:20.220> so<00:06:20.520> that's<00:06:20.940> kind<00:06:21.180> of

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
like the eye palette so that's kind of

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.750 
like the eye palette so that's kind of
why<00:06:21.360> I<00:06:21.390> might<00:06:21.660> not<00:06:21.810> do<00:06:22.020> one<00:06:22.200> and<00:06:22.700> instead<00:06:23.700> of

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:23.760 
why I might not do one and instead of

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.000 
why I might not do one and instead of
the<00:06:24.420> red<00:06:24.720> lip<00:06:24.930> that<00:06:25.140> I<00:06:25.170> had<00:06:25.380> on<00:06:25.500> in<00:06:25.620> that<00:06:25.740> video

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
the red lip that I had on in that video

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.980 
the red lip that I had on in that video
because<00:06:26.400> it's<00:06:26.730> still<00:06:27.000> daytime<00:06:27.240> and<00:06:27.780> I<00:06:27.840> thought

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
because it's still daytime and I thought

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.750 
because it's still daytime and I thought
it<00:06:28.110> was<00:06:28.200> a<00:06:28.230> little<00:06:28.350> dramatic<00:06:28.920> with<00:06:29.130> a<00:06:29.160> smokey

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
it was a little dramatic with a smokey

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.090 
it was a little dramatic with a smokey
eye<00:06:29.790> and<00:06:29.940> a<00:06:30.210> red<00:06:30.360> lip<00:06:30.570> so<00:06:31.200> I<00:06:31.620> just<00:06:31.890> took<00:06:32.040> that

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
eye and a red lip so I just took that

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.700 
eye and a red lip so I just took that
off<00:06:32.400> and<00:06:32.610> I<00:06:32.670> put<00:06:32.700> on<00:06:33.120> a<00:06:33.450> pinky<00:06:33.990> nude<00:06:34.020> and<00:06:34.500> I'm

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
off and I put on a pinky nude and I'm

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.800 
off and I put on a pinky nude and I'm
