00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:54.980 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.430 

good<00:00:55.670> lord<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:56.540> strategy<00:00:56.960> takes<00:00:57.170> no<00:00:57.380> skill

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
good lord that strategy takes no skill

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.650 
good lord that strategy takes no skill
to<00:00:57.770> use<00:00:57.800> it's<00:00:58.730> actually<00:00:58.850> pretty<00:00:59.210> infuriating

00:00:59.650 --> 00:00:59.660 
to use it's actually pretty infuriating

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.740 
to use it's actually pretty infuriating
just<00:01:00.230> thinking<00:01:00.739> about<00:01:00.860> it<00:01:01.540> anyways<00:01:02.540> after

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
just thinking about it anyways after

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.570 
just thinking about it anyways after
that<00:01:03.020> awful<00:01:03.170> style<00:01:03.680> I<00:01:03.800> quickly<00:01:04.070> jump<00:01:04.430> back

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
that awful style I quickly jump back

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.000 
that awful style I quickly jump back
into<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.879> fray<00:01:05.089> I<00:01:05.420> soon<00:01:06.200> had<00:01:06.380> another<00:01:06.619> battle

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
into the fray I soon had another battle

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.830 
into the fray I soon had another battle
and<00:01:07.159> my<00:01:07.760> next<00:01:07.820> opponents<00:01:08.390> team<00:01:08.510> looked<00:01:08.750> much

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
and my next opponents team looked much

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.109 
and my next opponents team looked much
more<00:01:08.900> manageable<00:01:09.229> I<00:01:09.740> was<00:01:10.460> pretty<00:01:10.640> confident

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
more manageable I was pretty confident

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:12.880 
more manageable I was pretty confident
that<00:01:11.240> nothing<00:01:11.450> on<00:01:11.690> his<00:01:11.900> team<00:01:12.140> could<00:01:12.380> really<00:01:12.770> do

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
that nothing on his team could really do

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.249 
that nothing on his team could really do
that<00:01:12.920> much<00:01:13.100> damage<00:01:13.220> to<00:01:13.610> me<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.869> only<00:01:14.960> thing<00:01:15.080> on

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
that much damage to me the only thing on

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.660 
that much damage to me the only thing on
his<00:01:15.410> teeny<00:01:15.680> look<00:01:15.890> to<00:01:15.979> be<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.100> slight<00:01:16.430> problem

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
his teeny look to be a slight problem

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.150 
his teeny look to be a slight problem
was<00:01:17.000> is<00:01:17.150> wheezing<00:01:17.600> as<00:01:17.750> none<00:01:18.470> of<00:01:18.590> my<00:01:18.740> team<00:01:18.979> could

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.160 
was is wheezing as none of my team could

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.070 
was is wheezing as none of my team could
hit<00:01:19.340> it<00:01:19.460> super<00:01:19.729> effectively<00:01:20.330> and<00:01:20.540> so

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
hit it super effectively and so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.450 
hit it super effectively and so
therefore<00:01:21.290> I<00:01:21.530> knew<00:01:21.710> I<00:01:21.740> just<00:01:21.979> have<00:01:22.070> to<00:01:22.100> wear<00:01:22.340> it

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
therefore I knew I just have to wear it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.130 
therefore I knew I just have to wear it
down<00:01:22.670> rather<00:01:23.000> than<00:01:23.150> just<00:01:23.390> flat-out<00:01:23.750> killing

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
down rather than just flat-out killing

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.130 
down rather than just flat-out killing
it<00:01:24.940> this<00:01:25.940> match<00:01:26.150> was<00:01:26.360> fairly<00:01:26.600> simple<00:01:26.990> and<00:01:27.110> I

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
it this match was fairly simple and I

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.180 
it this match was fairly simple and I
had<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.440> upper<00:01:27.560> hand<00:01:27.680> throughout<00:01:28.100> the

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
had the upper hand throughout the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.730 
had the upper hand throughout the
majority<00:01:28.340> of<00:01:28.700> it<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.690> only<00:01:29.840> pokemon<00:01:30.080> his<00:01:30.530> team

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
majority of it the only pokemon his team

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.170 
majority of it the only pokemon his team
that<00:01:30.860> actually<00:01:30.950> did<00:01:31.369> give<00:01:31.610> me<00:01:31.700> trouble<00:01:31.880> was

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
that actually did give me trouble was

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.150 
that actually did give me trouble was
still<00:01:32.450> terror<00:01:32.720> as<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.440> annoyingly<00:01:33.830> kept

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
still terror as it annoyingly kept

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.620 
still terror as it annoyingly kept
taking<00:01:34.490> his<00:01:34.640> much<00:01:34.880> better<00:01:35.119> than<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.330> thought<00:01:35.570> it

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
taking his much better than I thought it

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.020 
taking his much better than I thought it
would<00:01:35.920> however<00:01:36.920> I<00:01:37.070> was<00:01:37.280> eventually<00:01:37.580> able<00:01:37.820> to

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
would however I was eventually able to

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.029 
would however I was eventually able to
toxic<00:01:38.390> stall<00:01:38.600> it<00:01:38.720> down<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.140> then<00:01:39.560> zangoose

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
toxic stall it down and then zangoose

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.560 
toxic stall it down and then zangoose
was<00:01:40.220> easily<00:01:40.610> able<00:01:40.700> to<00:01:41.090> clean<00:01:41.330> out<00:01:41.450> the

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
was easily able to clean out the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.960 
was easily able to clean out the
remnants<00:01:42.020> of<00:01:42.080> his<00:01:42.170> team

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.220 

my<00:01:48.970> next<00:01:49.210> opponents<00:01:49.630> team<00:01:49.720> looked<00:01:49.990> at<00:01:50.110> their

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
my next opponents team looked at their

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.690 
my next opponents team looked at their
odds<00:01:50.440> and<00:01:50.680> I<00:01:50.710> didn't<00:01:50.980> really<00:01:51.100> understand<00:01:51.610> how

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
odds and I didn't really understand how

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.390 
odds and I didn't really understand how
it<00:01:51.880> was<00:01:51.970> going<00:01:52.150> to<00:01:52.300> work<00:01:52.740> that<00:01:53.740> was<00:01:53.980> until<00:01:54.340> I

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
it was going to work that was until I

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.670 
it was going to work that was until I
noticed<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.910> ninjask<00:01:55.450> which<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.320> then<00:01:56.470> noticed

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
noticed the ninjask which I then noticed

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.050 
noticed the ninjask which I then noticed
was<00:01:57.070> going<00:01:57.190> to<00:01:57.250> be<00:01:57.370> the<00:01:57.460> obvious<00:01:57.580> patent

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
was going to be the obvious patent

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.540 
was going to be the obvious patent
parser<00:01:58.420> for<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.630> team<00:01:58.920> although<00:01:59.920> was<00:02:00.250> fairly

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
parser for the team although was fairly

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.890

even<00:03:50.650> through<00:03:50.830> dual<00:03:51.040> screens<00:03:51.430> odka<00:03:51.640> na<00:03:51.940> was

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
even through dual screens odka na was

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.940 
even through dual screens odka na was
mauled<00:03:52.420> by<00:03:52.600> Stone<00:03:52.959> Edge

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.040 

and<00:03:59.950> eventually<00:04:00.760> primate<00:04:01.420> managed<00:04:01.660> to<00:04:01.780> redeem

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
and eventually primate managed to redeem

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.600 
and eventually primate managed to redeem
himself<00:04:02.170> by<00:04:02.560> killing<00:04:02.980> both<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.460> and

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
himself by killing both that and

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.730 
himself by killing both that and
seismitoad<00:04:04.150> meaning<00:04:05.140> he<00:04:05.350> only<00:04:05.500> had

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
seismitoad meaning he only had

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.590 
seismitoad meaning he only had
mashaallah<00:04:06.130> left<00:04:06.400> my<00:04:06.580> skuntank<00:04:07.030> and<00:04:07.360> so

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
mashaallah left my skuntank and so

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.130 
mashaallah left my skuntank and so
therefore<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:08.140> obvious<00:04:08.500> how<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.650> matchup<00:04:09.220> went

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
therefore is obvious how I matchup went

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:18.050 
therefore is obvious how I matchup went

that could leave me too under predict
just<00:05:12.769> like<00:05:12.979> in<00:05:13.129> this<00:05:13.249> situation<00:05:13.549> right<00:05:13.849> here

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:14.199 
just like in this situation right here

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:17.019 
just like in this situation right here
it's<00:05:15.199> especially<00:05:15.679> a<00:05:15.919> problem<00:05:16.429> in<00:05:16.519> this<00:05:16.669> tier

00:05:17.019 --> 00:05:17.029 
it's especially a problem in this tier

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:20.379 
it's especially a problem in this tier
because<00:05:17.779> I<00:05:17.809> bloody<00:05:18.349> socket<00:05:18.979> it<00:05:19.129> and<00:05:19.369> it<00:05:20.360> just

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
because I bloody socket it and it just

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.499 
because I bloody socket it and it just
makes<00:05:20.809> things<00:05:20.929> that<00:05:21.259> much<00:05:21.409> harder<00:05:22.509> that's

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:23.509 
makes things that much harder that's

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:26.469 
makes things that much harder that's
when<00:05:23.749> I<00:05:23.809> decided<00:05:24.169> that<00:05:24.589> in<00:05:25.009> nu<00:05:25.429> i<00:05:25.669> am<00:05:26.149> now

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
when I decided that in nu i am now

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:29.259 
when I decided that in nu i am now
aiming<00:05:26.869> for<00:05:26.989> the<00:05:27.019> top<00:05:27.110> 500<00:05:28.119> because<00:05:29.119> i<00:05:29.209> know

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:29.269 
aiming for the top 500 because i know

00:05:29.269 --> 00:05:31.449 
aiming for the top 500 because i know
for<00:05:29.569> a<00:05:29.599> fact<00:05:29.629> that<00:05:30.289> i'll<00:05:30.649> never<00:05:30.979> even<00:05:31.219> be<00:05:31.369> able

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:31.459 
for a fact that i'll never even be able

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:34.179 
for a fact that i'll never even be able
to<00:05:31.550> get<00:05:31.699> close<00:05:31.939> to<00:05:32.059> the<00:05:32.389> top<00:05:32.599> 100<00:05:33.169> with<00:05:34.039> this

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
to get close to the top 100 with this

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:35.949 
to get close to the top 100 with this
knowledge<00:05:34.429> now<00:05:34.699> my<00:05:34.789> mind<00:05:35.059> I<00:05:35.209> set<00:05:35.629> back<00:05:35.779> out

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:35.959 
knowledge now my mind I set back out

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:37.479 
knowledge now my mind I set back out
find<00:05:36.289> a<00:05:36.349> match<00:05:36.529> and<00:05:36.739> I<00:05:36.889> actually<00:05:37.069> found<00:05:37.339> one

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:37.489 
find a match and I actually found one

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:40.119 
find a match and I actually found one
quickly<00:05:37.839> my<00:05:38.839> pawn<00:05:39.110> his<00:05:39.229> team<00:05:39.409> did<00:05:39.679> look<00:05:39.860> fairly

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:40.129 
quickly my pawn his team did look fairly

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:41.649 
quickly my pawn his team did look fairly
solid<00:05:40.399> but<00:05:40.699> at<00:05:40.789> once<00:05:40.969> again<00:05:41.300> lacked<00:05:41.509> an

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.569 
solid but at once again lacked an
obvious<00:05:41.989> special<00:05:42.349> wall<00:05:42.529> the<00:05:43.159> only<00:05:43.369> thing<00:05:43.519> I

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:43.579 
obvious special wall the only thing I

00:05:43.579 --> 00:05:45.189 
obvious special wall the only thing I
could<00:05:43.639> think<00:05:43.759> of<00:05:44.059> was<00:05:44.269> his<00:05:44.419> camera<00:05:44.749> robbed<00:05:44.929> but

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
could think of was his camera robbed but

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.379 
could think of was his camera robbed but
that<00:05:45.529> thing<00:05:45.800> really<00:05:46.129> does<00:05:46.309> suck<00:05:46.759> defensively

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
that thing really does suck defensively

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.329 
that thing really does suck defensively
and<00:05:47.659> should<00:05:48.259> never<00:05:48.469> really<00:05:48.679> be<00:05:48.769> used<00:05:49.039> as<00:05:49.249> a

00:05:49.329 --> 00:05:49.339 
and should never really be used as a

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:52.179 
and should never really be used as a
dedicated<00:05:49.729> wall<00:05:50.029> in<00:05:50.209> my<00:05:50.300> opinion<00:05:51.009> also<00:05:52.009> where

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:52.189 
dedicated wall in my opinion also where

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:54.100 
dedicated wall in my opinion also where
the<00:05:52.339> drift<00:05:52.669> limb<00:05:52.849> could<00:05:53.059> be<00:05:53.149> annoying<00:05:53.479> as<00:05:53.629> with

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
the drift limb could be annoying as with

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.959 
the drift limb could be annoying as with

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 
fullest potential at all as it wasted

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.359 
fullest potential at all as it wasted
its<00:06:08.689> flying<00:06:08.989> gym<00:06:09.259> very<00:06:09.529> early<00:06:09.679> into<00:06:10.099> the<00:06:10.189> match

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:10.369 
its flying gym very early into the match

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:12.369 
its flying gym very early into the match
and<00:06:10.669> was<00:06:10.909> therefore<00:06:11.149> easily<00:06:11.569> toxic<00:06:12.139> stalled

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:12.379 
and was therefore easily toxic stalled

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:15.279 
and was therefore easily toxic stalled
out<00:06:12.529> by<00:06:12.739> Oliver<00:06:13.039> molar<00:06:13.249> and<00:06:14.169> after<00:06:15.169> his

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289 
out by Oliver molar and after his

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.439 
out by Oliver molar and after his
samurott<00:06:15.679> died<00:06:15.889> he<00:06:16.399> seemingly<00:06:16.819> had<00:06:16.939> nothing

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
samurott died he seemingly had nothing

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.209 
samurott died he seemingly had nothing
that<00:06:17.479> could<00:06:17.719> do<00:06:17.839> anything<00:06:18.169> to<00:06:18.439> a<00:06:18.469> walk<00:06:18.769> or<00:06:19.039> and

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:19.219 
that could do anything to a walk or and

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:21.040 
that could do anything to a walk or and
so<00:06:19.759> therefore<00:06:19.999> he<00:06:20.239> was<00:06:20.509> just<00:06:20.659> forced<00:06:20.989> to

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
so therefore he was just forced to

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.139 
so therefore he was just forced to
forfeit<00:06:21.439> and<00:06:24.009> look<00:06:25.009> at<00:06:25.159> my<00:06:25.279> points<00:06:25.699> I<00:06:25.789> am<00:06:25.999> now

00:06:26.139 --> 00:06:26.149 
forfeit and look at my points I am now

00:06:26.149 --> 00:06:30.399 
forfeit and look at my points I am now
at<00:06:26.919> 1693<00:06:27.939> so<00:06:28.939> overall<00:06:29.329> this<00:06:29.599> episode<00:06:30.079> I<00:06:30.319> have

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:30.409 
at 1693 so overall this episode I have

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:32.169 
at 1693 so overall this episode I have
made<00:06:30.489> disappointingly<00:06:31.489> low<00:06:31.579> amounts<00:06:32.059> of

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:32.179 
made disappointingly low amounts of

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:35.229 
made disappointingly low amounts of
progress<00:06:32.860> however<00:06:33.860> I'm<00:06:34.099> not<00:06:34.759> far<00:06:34.999> away<00:06:35.119> from

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:35.239 
progress however I'm not far away from

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:37.059 
progress however I'm not far away from
the<00:06:35.479> number<00:06:35.719> 500<00:06:36.349> spot<00:06:36.559> as<00:06:36.739> that<00:06:36.919> only

00:06:37.059 --> 00:06:37.069 
the number 500 spot as that only

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.089 
the number 500 spot as that only
requires<00:06:37.339> 76<00:06:38.269> more<00:06:38.479> points<00:06:38.899> so<00:06:39.409> hopefully<00:06:39.649> I

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:40.099 
requires 76 more points so hopefully I

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:43.299 
requires 76 more points so hopefully I
should<00:06:40.639> be<00:06:40.729> there<00:06:40.879> soon<00:06:41.179> and<00:06:41.589> that<00:06:42.589> is<00:06:42.889> going

00:06:43.299 --> 00:06:43.309 
should be there soon and that is going

00:06:43.309 --> 00:06:45.609 
should be there soon and that is going
to<00:06:43.459> conclude<00:06:43.699> today's<00:06:44.059> episode<00:06:44.509> it<00:06:44.749> is<00:06:45.589> a

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:45.619 
to conclude today's episode it is a

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:47.499 
to conclude today's episode it is a
shame<00:06:45.709> life<00:06:46.129> had<00:06:46.399> to<00:06:46.489> change<00:06:46.699> plans<00:06:46.999> like<00:06:47.329> this

00:06:47.499 --> 00:06:47.509 
shame life had to change plans like this

00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:49.809 
shame life had to change plans like this
but<00:06:48.110> I'm<00:06:48.259> simply<00:06:48.679> not<00:06:48.860> going<00:06:49.099> to<00:06:49.219> ever<00:06:49.339> get<00:06:49.610> out
