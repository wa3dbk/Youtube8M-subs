case<00:02:29.090> I<00:02:29.330> realized<00:02:29.780> in<00:02:30.770> this<00:02:30.950> moment<00:02:31.370> I

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
case I realized in this moment I

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.880 
case I realized in this moment I
realized<00:02:31.940> that<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.930> pork<00:02:33.170> roast<00:02:33.380> could<00:02:33.710> have

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
realized that the pork roast could have

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.520 
realized that the pork roast could have
been<00:02:34.070> bigger<00:02:37.450> because<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.780> was<00:02:38.900> quite<00:02:39.200> hard<00:02:39.440> to

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
been bigger because it was quite hard to

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.220 
been bigger because it was quite hard to
roll<00:02:39.770> and<00:02:40.160> after<00:02:40.970> rolling<00:02:41.150> it<00:02:41.420> we<00:02:41.570> gonna<00:02:41.780> fix

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
roll and after rolling it we gonna fix

00:02:42.230 --> 00:03:21.850 
roll and after rolling it we gonna fix
this<00:02:42.710> with<00:02:43.190> butcher<00:02:43.940> string

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.480 

yeah<00:03:23.600> looks<00:03:24.600> good<00:03:24.810> here<00:03:25.170> almost<00:03:25.920> ready<00:03:26.400> to

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
grill so let's have a look at the grill

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.400 
grill so let's have a look at the grill
I<00:03:28.730> prepared<00:03:29.730> my<00:03:29.880> monolith<00:03:30.390> tomato<00:03:30.720> cooker<00:03:31.110> for

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
I prepared my monolith tomato cooker for

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.650 
I prepared my monolith tomato cooker for
indirect<00:03:32.040> heat<00:03:32.190> with<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.430> dripping<00:03:32.700> pan<00:03:33.030> with

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
water and cooling temperature is run

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:46.220 
water and cooling temperature is run
about<00:03:39.270> 200<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.520> 225<00:03:42.830> degrees<00:03:43.830> Celsius<00:03:45.230> which

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
about 200 to 225 degrees Celsius which

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.350 
about 200 to 225 degrees Celsius which
is<00:03:46.410> more<00:03:46.620> or<00:03:46.770> less<00:03:46.800> near<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.430> 400<00:03:48.030> degrees

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
is more or less near to 400 degrees

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.210 
is more or less near to 400 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:03:48.870> we're<00:03:49.740> going<00:03:49.860> to<00:03:49.950> grow<00:03:50.070> this

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
Fahrenheit we're going to grow this

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.720 
Fahrenheit we're going to grow this
until<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.730> has<00:03:50.880> an<00:03:51.030> inter<00:03:51.300> temperature<00:03:51.930> of<00:03:52.730> 68

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
until it has an inter temperature of 68

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.270 
until it has an inter temperature of 68
to<00:03:53.760> 70<00:03:54.600> degrees<00:03:56.030> and<00:03:57.740> this<00:03:58.740> is<00:03:58.860> how<00:03:59.010> it<00:03:59.100> looks

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
to 70 degrees and this is how it looks

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:11.410 
to 70 degrees and this is how it looks
like<00:04:00.830> really<00:04:01.830> great<00:04:02.100> after<00:04:03.000> some<00:04:03.510> more<00:04:03.780> time

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.660 

so<00:04:12.420> I<00:04:12.450> must<00:04:12.810> confess<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.440> crust<00:04:13.709> could<00:04:14.459> have

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
so I must confess the crust could have

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
so I must confess the crust could have
