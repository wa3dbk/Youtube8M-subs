00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.199 
it and some people like the relic look
of<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:14.069> know<00:03:14.190> when<00:03:14.370> the<00:03:14.489> thing<00:03:14.670> starts<00:03:15.120> to

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
of you know when the thing starts to

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.589 
of you know when the thing starts to
scratch<00:03:15.870> off<00:03:16.140> but<00:03:16.530> there's<00:03:17.220> plenty<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.420> other

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
scratch off but there's plenty of other

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:48.270 
I just assume go with a that just the
natural<00:03:25.200> bakelite

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.819 

the<00:03:49.280> body<00:03:49.549> would<00:03:49.849> own<00:03:50.060> us<00:03:50.299> guitars<00:03:50.959> I'm<00:03:51.349> Karina

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
the body would own us guitars I'm Karina

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.729 
the body would own us guitars I'm Karina
that's<00:03:52.400> a<00:03:52.609> fairly<00:03:53.030> light<00:03:53.390> piece<00:03:53.780> Karina<00:03:54.709> is

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
that's a fairly light piece Karina is

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:03.089 
that's a fairly light piece Karina is
very<00:03:57.739> similar<00:03:58.250> to<00:03:58.459> mahogany<00:03:59.359> but<00:03:59.659> it<00:04:00.670> it<00:04:01.670> has<00:04:02.060> a

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
very similar to mahogany but it it has a

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.860 
very similar to mahogany but it it has a
nicer<00:04:04.099> high-end<00:04:04.609> to<00:04:04.879> it<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.120> little<00:04:05.359> bit<00:04:05.599> more

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
nicer high-end to it a little bit more

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.490 
nicer high-end to it a little bit more
like<00:04:06.109> swamp<00:04:06.560> ash<00:04:06.829> so<00:04:07.790> this<00:04:08.510> guitar<00:04:08.870> has<00:04:09.049> plenty

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
like swamp ash so this guitar has plenty

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.849 
like swamp ash so this guitar has plenty
of<00:04:09.530> twang<00:04:09.920> to<00:04:10.549> it<00:04:10.579> but<00:04:11.090> still<00:04:11.840> has<00:04:12.319> a<00:04:12.680> nice

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:12.859 
of twang to it but still has a nice

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.620 
of twang to it but still has a nice
mid-range<00:04:13.340> to<00:04:14.030> it<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:15.400> it's<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.549> very<00:04:16.820> full<00:04:17.239> nice

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
mid-range to it so it's a very full nice

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.129 
mid-range to it so it's a very full nice
sounding<00:04:18.079> of<00:04:18.229> all<00:04:18.410> I'm<00:04:19.190> really<00:04:19.870> some<00:04:20.870> of<00:04:20.900> my

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
sounding of all I'm really some of my

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:23.110 
sounding of all I'm really some of my
favorite<00:04:21.530> bars<00:04:21.859> have<00:04:22.099> been<00:04:22.130> clean<00:04:22.699> and<00:04:22.940> I've

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
favorite bars have been clean and I've

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:44.870 
favorite bars have been clean and I've
been<00:04:23.330> using<00:04:23.599> it<00:04:23.870> a<00:04:23.930> lot<00:04:24.080> my<00:04:24.349> building

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.080 

and<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:47.020> majority<00:04:47.500> of<00:04:47.530> my<00:04:47.650> guitars<00:04:48.100> the

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
and the majority of my guitars the

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.810 
and the majority of my guitars the
radius<00:04:49.510> of<00:04:49.660> the<00:04:49.720> fingerboard<00:04:50.110> is<00:04:50.650> gonna<00:04:50.950> be<00:04:51.160> 10

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
radius of the fingerboard is gonna be 10

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.610 
radius of the fingerboard is gonna be 10
inches<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:53.640> sometimes<00:04:54.640> 12<00:04:55.060> I<00:04:55.480> really<00:04:56.410> feel

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
inches and sometimes 12 I really feel

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.070 
inches and sometimes 12 I really feel
that<00:04:56.650> that's<00:04:57.130> the<00:04:57.310> best<00:04:57.520> combination<00:04:57.880> not<00:04:58.810> for

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.080 
that that's the best combination not for

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.230 
that that's the best combination not for
comfort<00:04:59.650> and<00:05:00.010> not<00:05:00.100> fretting<00:05:00.760> out<00:05:00.910> when<00:05:01.120> you

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
comfort and not fretting out when you

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.360 
comfort and not fretting out when you
bend<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.600> strings<00:05:01.990> I<00:05:03.750> really<00:05:04.750> don't<00:05:05.200> see<00:05:05.370> see

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
bend the strings I really don't see see

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.310 
bend the strings I really don't see see
any<00:05:06.520> point<00:05:06.760> in<00:05:07.060> you<00:05:07.540> know<00:05:07.660> trying<00:05:08.080> to<00:05:08.200> be

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
any point in you know trying to be

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.760 
any point in you know trying to be
accurate<00:05:09.100> there's<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.120> use<00:05:10.420> of<00:05:10.600> 7<00:05:10.870> 1/4<00:05:11.380> babies

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
accurate there's the use of 7 1/4 babies

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.750 
accurate there's the use of 7 1/4 babies
it's<00:05:12.040> just<00:05:12.250> not<00:05:12.490> much<00:05:12.700> use<00:05:12.970> for<00:05:14.100> the<00:05:15.100> frets<00:05:15.490> on

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
it's just not much use for the frets on

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.660 
it's just not much use for the frets on
this<00:05:16.270> particular<00:05:16.900> guitar<00:05:17.110> I've<00:05:17.590> been<00:05:17.770> playing

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:18.670 
this particular guitar I've been playing

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.970 
this particular guitar I've been playing
around<00:05:18.820> with<00:05:19.120> different<00:05:19.260> fret<00:05:20.260> wire<00:05:20.500> and

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
around with different fret wire and

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.540 
around with different fret wire and
obviously<00:05:21.940> for<00:05:22.240> me<00:05:22.390> a<00:05:22.420> customer's<00:05:23.550> preference

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
obviously for me a customer's preference

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.020 
obviously for me a customer's preference
to<00:05:24.760> what<00:05:24.910> they<00:05:25.060> get<00:05:25.360> but<00:05:25.660> this<00:05:26.170> one<00:05:26.410> has<00:05:27.030> the

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
to what they get but this one has the

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.520 
to what they get but this one has the
low<00:05:28.210> why<00:05:28.620> Gibson<00:05:29.620> wire<00:05:30.070> and<00:05:30.900> made<00:05:31.900> by<00:05:32.080> Dunlop

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
low why Gibson wire and made by Dunlop

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.470 
low why Gibson wire and made by Dunlop
and<00:05:33.150> um<00:05:34.950> has<00:05:35.950> a<00:05:35.980> real<00:05:36.340> nice<00:05:36.520> feel<00:05:36.970> it<00:05:37.210> bends

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
and um has a real nice feel it bends

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.960 
and um has a real nice feel it bends
nicely<00:05:37.660> but<00:05:38.380> it's<00:05:38.470> the<00:05:38.590> low<00:05:38.770> enough<00:05:39.010> profile

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
nicely but it's the low enough profile

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.610 
nicely but it's the low enough profile
that<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.390> don't<00:05:40.570> feel<00:05:40.870> like<00:05:41.050> your<00:05:41.200> fingers

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
that you don't feel like your fingers

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.060 
that you don't feel like your fingers
