00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.460
 welcome and welcome to games 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.040
 I'm Miguel Gálvez, and how can you 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.950
 see today we come to present the nox 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.289
 combat here we have it on screen as 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.860
 you can see us combas is nothing more than a 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.369
 set a pack of keyboard and mouse 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:28.670
 It is the mouse and firing nox 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.740
 the keyboard the cable these products are 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.770
 very interesting both for its design 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.660
 as for the benefits they bring and 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.480
 all this with a price more than 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.190
 competitive and more than interesting but 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.180
 before talking about the features 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.800
 of the two products we go to the one boxing 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.080
 here we have the product packaging 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.230
 as you can see the two components come in 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.239
 the same package that's why it's a pack and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.330
 you see that on the top of the box 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.739
 it comes that both products are 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.559
 backlit have USB connection the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.410
 membrane keyboard the mouse has the pp 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:08.310
 and adjustable and the sensor of this one is 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.360
 optical said all this we go to boxing 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.360
 Properly said 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.700
 here you see the back of the house 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.840
 that you can see the table of 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.050
 specifications provided by the 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.050
 maker 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.800
 that all this remember that you can see it 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.410
 in the analysis that there is linked in the 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.550
 web in my points is whose link you have in 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.550
 the description of the video 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.850
 view the back of the box 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.850
 we raise these two tabs 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.450
 and we open here you see we have the keyboard 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.930
 on the left and the mouse on the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.930
 Right part 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.979
 let's put it so it looks good 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.520
 while we are taking both the two 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.520
 compartments 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.540
 here comes the change carefully 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.540
 rolled on top 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.720
 and we remove the plastic cover 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.730
 protective 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.030
 he absorbs and here we have our 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.030
 keyboard 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.140
 as you can see the design of this key 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.520
 It is impeccable 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.920
 It is extremely light 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.230
 and in the back we can see the 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.660
 two little legs to put on, it's worth it in the 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.170
 case that we like it more as well as all 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.170
 the keyboards 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.060
 the usb port dipped in gold for 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.060
 increase connectivity to improve it 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.850
 we see that the keys have the part of 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.550
 the transparent letters to leave the 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.040
 lighting pass and on top 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.750
 keys very well 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.320
 and we see less than instructions 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.320
 is delivered 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.150
 pretty simple 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:13.769
 and we go with the mouse 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.250
 if we remove the plastic covers and 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.050
 the mouse comes out with the cable as you see the 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.019
 mouse has a very sober design with the 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.840
 stainless steel logo and on the sides 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.870
 takes as a kind of recording of 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.879
 bee panel to the cable comes reduced 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.310
 in my love a very very fine worked 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:34.830
 pretty nice and the usb bathed in gold 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.870
 to increase connectivity and you see the 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.799
 bee panel the truth is that the mouse 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.799
 is beautiful 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.319
 the middle button is to adjust the 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.530
 the wheels that have in the part 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.120
 rubén touch central rubber and both 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.209
 side buttons 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.490
 in total 6 buttons counting the adjustment 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.530
 of the page 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.000
 let's start with the mouse as we already 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.630
 we have said before it is about a mouse 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.610
 optical with a central button that allows 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.660
 adjust it or ask for resolution between 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:12.510
 800 thousand 200 thousand 600 and 2400 dp and with a 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.220
 refresh rate of 125 hertz on 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.680
 response time to this is from a 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.709
 millisecond and comes with 6 buttons 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.900
 including the bp and the two buttons 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.940
 laterals are located on the left 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.730
 so although the mouse design is 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.290
 ambidextrous is quite more comfortable than 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.930
 use for the days you're being of 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.720
 difficult access for lefties since 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.569
 they should activate them with their finger 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.389
 little finger or the ring 

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:40.919
 the roulette of the central mouse comes 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.559
 backlit just like the logo 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.169
 that comes in the central part in the 

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:48.419
 back nox logo and has 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.129
 touch ruber and the truth that it offers very 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:53.339
 good displacement and it is quite 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:55.110
 common to the part the lateral parts 

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:56.939
 of the mouse as we have said 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.559
 previously it has as a kind of 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.080
 screen printing a kind of engraving on 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:03.270
 hive type that makes this design a 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.219
 authentic success in terms of 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.949
 buttons the truth is that they have very good 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:09.689
 touch and respond pretty well though 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.149
 that yes it is necessary to stand out that the two 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.550
 Main buttons are a tad noisy 

00:05:12.149 --> 00:05:16.680
 do not enter this for its use although 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.809
 The truth is that it can be a little 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.270
 annoying if you are very very fussy with 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:22.889
 this kind of thing said all this and 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.529
 as a conclusion in what the mouse is 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.719
 refers to the design so 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:30.330
 successful that has had the nox with this 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:32.430
 mouse and highlight that it offers some 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.869
 very very interesting features 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.199
 especially considering the price 

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:39.119
 of the set and that have satisfied us 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.099
 more than enough still the result 

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:41.990
 of the analysis you will have at the end of 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:43.910
 video 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.560
 we went to the keyboard here you can see it 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.510
 with the lighting on although 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.910
 has the ability to disable it 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.920
 As you will see later on, it is worth mentioning that 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.570
 a membrane keyboard with the letters 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.600
 engraved in laser to make it more 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.370
 durable and not erase with the use and that 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.170
 consist of six keys 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:02.150
 multimedia the truth is that we have 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.850
 I was very satisfied using this 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.920
 keyboard since it is quite silent and 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.090
 It has very good touch and a good 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.090
 responsiveness 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.310
 and you can see it after turning off as 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.560
 you see the led 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:21.020
 the uppercase and keyboard keys 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.870
 numeric is still on and it also 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.850
 You can use it in the case that you do not 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.630
 you want to have the lights on 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:29.670
 the day 

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.980
 one of the doubts that usually arise with 

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:33.570
 this kind of keyboard is to say good it will be 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.490
 this a spaceship when I turn off the 

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.170
 light here we have recorded a small 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.510
 clip so you can see that it is not like that 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.950
 it's a fairly discreet lighting and 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.170
 that will help us in the sessions 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:45.260
 nocturnal without getting to dazzle 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:48.270
 as if it were a truck on a road 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.240
 said all this we went to the section of 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.310
 conclusions 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.800
 as we have been saying throughout 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.270
 boxing and analysis the design of the 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.610
 two products we liked a lot already 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.560
 that this is a pretty sober design and 

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.139
 very successful in each and every one of the 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.580
 details the backlight in the joust 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:06.500
 so that it does not dazzle or 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.900
 bother in case we have little 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.479
 light and works perfectly well 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.979
 the characteristics taking into account 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:16.310
 the price range in which we 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:19.340
 we move are quite pretty successful 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.289
 the price range the price is more than 

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.479
 adjusted and very competitive the rest of 

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:25.880
 details in the point gaming analysis 

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:27.860
 is we can not finish this video without 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.840
 mention without saying they 're off camber 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.360
 this brand keyboard and mouse pack 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.150
 knox has deserved has earned himself 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:37.250
 the golden award the game point is 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:39.680
 both for its characteristics and for 

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:41.630
 your adjusted price and the gálvez so that 

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:44.800
 my instinct is thank you very much for arriving 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.800
 up here and a greeting
