of the 1940 case in 1940 was that it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
Panerai builds may be a little bit more

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.190

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
than a thousand watches for the Italian

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.350 
than a thousand watches for the Italian

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
so when they bought a watch from Panerai

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.450 
so when they bought a watch from Panerai
the<00:01:39.630> Italian<00:01:40.020> Navy<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.680> needed<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.250> get

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the Italian Navy really needed to get

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.999 
the Italian Navy really needed to get
mileage<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.540> unit<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.380> what<00:01:43.649> Panerai

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
mileage out of that unit so what Panerai

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.440 
mileage out of that unit so what Panerai
did<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.280> nineteen<00:01:44.610> forty<00:01:45.030> was<00:01:45.210> they<00:01:45.360> actually

did in nineteen forty was they actually

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.050 
did in nineteen forty was they actually
