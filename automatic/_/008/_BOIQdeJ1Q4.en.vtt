watching<00:05:31.669> the<00:05:32.270> news<00:05:32.600> but<00:05:32.630> I<00:05:33.320> believe<00:05:33.919> it

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.130 
watching the news but I believe it

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:35.800 
watching the news but I believe it
started<00:05:34.460> on<00:05:34.550> top<00:05:34.880> of<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.150> mountain<00:05:35.510> and<00:05:35.660> it

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
started on top of the mountain and it

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.689 
started on top of the mountain and it
started<00:05:36.169> to<00:05:36.199> come<00:05:36.680> like<00:05:37.130> towards<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.520> front

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.850 
started to come like towards the front
of<00:05:37.760> the<00:05:37.850> mountain<00:05:38.180> but<00:05:38.840> i<00:05:39.199> believe<00:05:39.320> they<00:05:39.680> might

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
of the mountain but i believe they might

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.219 
of the mountain but i believe they might
have<00:05:40.010> contained<00:05:40.580> the<00:05:40.760> front<00:05:41.210> and<00:05:41.479> it's<00:05:42.050> just

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:42.229 
have contained the front and it's just

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:44.290 
have contained the front and it's just

kind of spreading to be back side of the

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 
believed to be at least the only other

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:35.659 
believed to be at least the only other
route<00:06:33.900> shit<00:06:34.860> I<00:06:34.889> don't<00:06:35.190> know<00:06:35.219> why<00:06:35.400> there's<00:06:35.550> so

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:35.669 
route shit I don't know why there's so

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:38.779 
route shit I don't know why there's so
many<00:06:35.729> cars<00:06:36.030> down<00:06:36.300> here<00:06:36.599> I<00:06:37.590> honestly<00:06:38.430> don't

00:06:38.779 --> 00:06:38.789 
many cars down here I honestly don't

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:40.520 
many cars down here I honestly don't
know<00:06:38.940> why<00:06:39.270> there's<00:06:39.569> so<00:06:39.870> many<00:06:39.990> cars<00:06:40.259> down<00:06:40.500> there

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
know why there's so many cars down there

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.189 
know why there's so many cars down there
could<00:06:40.919> be<00:06:40.949> completely<00:06:41.520> on<00:06:41.639> it<00:06:41.789> so<00:06:42.050> I'm<00:06:43.050> gonna

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 
could be completely on it so I'm gonna

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.480 
could be completely on it so I'm gonna
hook<00:06:43.319> around<00:06:43.500> just<00:06:43.949> because<00:06:44.069> there's<00:06:44.370> a

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
hook around just because there's a

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.730 
hook around just because there's a
pretty<00:06:44.789> fat<00:06:45.240> line<00:06:45.569> down<00:06:45.780> there<00:06:45.960> unless<00:06:46.379> just

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
pretty fat line down there unless just

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.260 
pretty fat line down there unless just
one<00:06:46.889> of<00:06:46.979> those<00:06:47.039> things<00:06:47.099> where<00:06:47.460> if<00:06:47.849> you<00:06:48.000> live

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:48.270 
one of those things where if you live

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.629 
one of those things where if you live
down<00:06:48.479> there<00:06:48.719> you<00:06:49.409> are<00:06:49.560> that's<00:06:49.889> the<00:06:49.979> only<00:06:50.190> way

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
down there you are that's the only way

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.529

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:51.539 
you can get down there like you're

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:52.100 
you can get down there like you're
asking

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
asking

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.020 
asking
your<00:06:52.440> address<00:06:52.620> or<00:06:53.040> something<00:06:53.190> and<00:06:53.790> maybe

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
your address or something and maybe

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:55.670 
your address or something and maybe
they're<00:06:54.240> asking<00:06:54.660> you<00:06:54.750> where<00:06:54.990> you<00:06:55.110> live<00:06:55.320> but

they're asking you where you live but

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.260 
they're asking you where you live but
one<00:06:56.190> hundred<00:06:56.460> percent<00:06:56.490> shows<00:06:56.910> a<00:06:56.970> lot<00:06:57.150> of

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
one hundred percent shows a lot of

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.410 
one hundred percent shows a lot of
traffic

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
traffic

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.660 
traffic
sorry<00:06:59.080> about<00:06:59.230> that<00:06:59.380> you<00:06:59.590> guys<00:06:59.740> I<00:07:00.160> try<00:07:00.430> to<00:07:00.490> get

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:00.670 
sorry about that you guys I try to get

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.730 
sorry about that you guys I try to get
his<00:07:00.760> clothes<00:07:00.970> off<00:07:01.300> boy<00:07:01.630> time<00:07:02.200> to<00:07:02.410> get<00:07:02.530> up<00:07:02.590> to

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:02.740 
his clothes off boy time to get up to

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.560 
his clothes off boy time to get up to
that<00:07:02.860> fire<00:07:03.190> but<00:07:03.520> they're<00:07:04.120> starting<00:07:04.330> to<00:07:04.360> block

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
that fire but they're starting to block

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:05.760 
that fire but they're starting to block
off<00:07:04.750> all<00:07:04.870> the<00:07:04.990> road<00:07:05.170> so<00:07:05.320> I<00:07:05.350> guess<00:07:05.500> it's<00:07:05.650> pretty

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
off all the road so I guess it's pretty

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.680 
off all the road so I guess it's pretty
gnarly<00:07:06.010> because<00:07:06.730> up<00:07:06.880> that<00:07:07.060> mountain<00:07:07.240> is

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:07.690 
gnarly because up that mountain is

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.720 
gnarly because up that mountain is
actually<00:07:08.350> like<00:07:08.440> a<00:07:08.500> road<00:07:08.800> that<00:07:09.070> goes<00:07:09.250> from<00:07:09.490> this

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:09.730 
actually like a road that goes from this

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.490 
actually like a road that goes from this
side<00:07:10.030> and<00:07:10.480> it's<00:07:10.720> kind<00:07:10.870> of<00:07:10.900> like<00:07:11.020> a<00:07:11.080> shortcut

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:11.500 
side and it's kind of like a shortcut

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.660 
side and it's kind of like a shortcut
that<00:07:11.710> way<00:07:11.890> you<00:07:11.950> don't<00:07:12.190> have<00:07:12.250> to<00:07:12.370> take<00:07:12.520> another

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670 
that way you don't have to take another

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.940 
that way you don't have to take another
route<00:07:13.000> all<00:07:13.300> the<00:07:13.570> way<00:07:13.660> around<00:07:13.780> the<00:07:13.990> mountain<00:07:14.320> so

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:14.950 
route all the way around the mountain so

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:16.170 
route all the way around the mountain so
it's<00:07:15.070> kind<00:07:15.250> of<00:07:15.280> a<00:07:15.370> shortcut<00:07:15.730> there's<00:07:15.910> a<00:07:15.970> road

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180 
it's kind of a shortcut there's a road

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.320 
it's kind of a shortcut there's a road
that<00:07:16.330> goes<00:07:16.450> straight<00:07:16.780> up<00:07:16.810> the<00:07:16.990> mountain<00:07:17.130> but

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:18.330 
that goes straight up the mountain but

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.610 
that goes straight up the mountain but
obviously<00:07:19.330> if<00:07:19.570> there's<00:07:19.750> a<00:07:19.810> freaking<00:07:20.200> blazing

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:20.620 
obviously if there's a freaking blazing

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.170 
obviously if there's a freaking blazing
fire<00:07:20.860> going<00:07:21.220> through<00:07:21.370> there<00:07:21.610> they're<00:07:22.000> not

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180 
fire going through there they're not

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.580 
fire going through there they're not
going<00:07:22.300> to<00:07:22.360> let<00:07:22.510> you<00:07:22.540> screws<00:07:22.930> through<00:07:23.140> there<00:07:23.350> so

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590 
going to let you screws through there so

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.640 
going to let you screws through there so
it<00:07:24.340> looks<00:07:24.520> like<00:07:24.750> the<00:07:25.750> fire<00:07:25.930> journey<00:07:26.260> has<00:07:26.440> came

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:26.650 
it looks like the fire journey has came

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.430 
it looks like the fire journey has came
to<00:07:26.830> an<00:07:26.920> end<00:07:27.070> I<00:07:27.280> can't<00:07:27.550> really<00:07:28.050> get<00:07:29.050> over<00:07:29.080> there

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.440 
to an end I can't really get over there

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.320 
to an end I can't really get over there
