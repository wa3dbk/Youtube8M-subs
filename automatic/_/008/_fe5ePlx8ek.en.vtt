00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.680
 because a man does not commit this 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.320
 network this question of why why 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.719
 why why he does not do what I do 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.610
 I want because he does not move to where 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.250
 I want him to move because a man 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.589
 Vitriol is not committed to how 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.380
 conquer a dotcom man there are two 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:26.749
 ways in which you can see this that is 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.999
 what are you doing so that he does not 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:31.099
 want to commit to you and what is 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.380
 what is going on with him so that he does not 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.239
 want to commit to you because 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.310
 remember that here I teach you techniques 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.840
 strategies a way to grow as 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.550
 person so you have a better 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.900
 relationship of couple and one of the things 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.430
 that I always drive if you have the 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:47.330
 book or have you seen another of my materials 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.060
 is that I always tell you, you are 100% 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:53.110
 responsable 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:55.300
 of 50 percent of the relationship the other 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.100
 50% of the relationship is the responsibility of 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.500
 the other person therefore you have to 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.420
 how far reaching your limits there 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.220
 a point where you can do many 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.010
 things and there is a point where no longer 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.170
 you can where you have to give opening that 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.840
 the other person move me then I receive 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.880
 emails or messages or what 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.700
 be where they ask me how do I do it for 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.890
 that he does this is manipulate it with what 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.870
 buttons I have to squeeze in your head or 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.140
 in his heart wherever he is so that he 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.729
 do what I want is very complicated 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.550
 if you can, there are things that you can 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.450
 do for him to move though 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.400
 it is not necessarily the first form of 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.869
 see a couple relationship at the beginning 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.400
 you show your best face samples what 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.590
 better of you so that the other person 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.530
 show the best of it and then go 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.990
 growing within the relationship 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.220
 there is a video rather I have an article 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.520
 where I explain what are the three 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.409
 points for which he as a man does not 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.909
 you want to engage in the relationship and 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.590
 from the explain why it is necessary 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.180
 that you understand what happens in 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.570
 the shoes of a man when we are 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.409
 doubtful to enter or move before 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.479
 that you decide 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.180
 if you want to winnow that the roll of that 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.680
 he goes through those problems or better go 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.990
 with someone else 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.509
 you can accompany him during his process 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.480
 and with it ready you're going to be there or 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.430

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.320

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.170
