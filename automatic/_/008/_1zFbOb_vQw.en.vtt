00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Hi, this is an episode number 3 of 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.819
 bible I want to talk this week 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.529
 about spiritual authority 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.780
 after all, what this authority is 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.059
 are men doing right to the 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.679
 breastfeed and demand respect for 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.799
 of those who gave him inside the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.799
 church 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.699
 one of the principles of the Protestant Reformation 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.439
 the authority of the scripture that is above 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.689
 of any man but it seems that today 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.760
 we live a rather dark season 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.890
 when we analyze the history of the church 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.110
 It is evident that the purpose of a 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.480
 in the church is exactly what 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.640
 the whole body moves efficiently in the 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.800
 direction of the lost of the poor of the oppressed 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.379
 and of him who needs God of some 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.780
 Christ himself teaches us that 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.360
 he did not come to be served but to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.640
 to serve and that the one who 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.379
 wanted to be the greatest among us should 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.329
 to be the one who serves the most 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.120
 model we have leadership today 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.320
 contemplate this teaching respect me 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.210
 I'm your leader 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.920
 many have wished to justify their 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.960
 point of view regarding the authority 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.150
 quoting the prophets of the ancient 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.189
 will obviously this argument 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.680
 It's very flawed because we do not live. 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.439
 more at this time the holy spirit 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.810
 it is not something that is reserved anymore 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.850
 only for some special men is 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.580
 It is extremely important to remember that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.189
 the only mediator between God and men is 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 Christ, that means that I'm a pastor. 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.450
 as facilitator of processes more than 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.520
 No way can I be the one that goes 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.290
 be a hindrance in your walk with 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.880
 Christ, if I have to give up my 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.650
 own will for you to reach 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.259
 what is God's will for your 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.159
 Life, this needs to be done more. 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.869
 unfortunately it's not what we've seen 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.759
 many times in the church life 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.130
 if it is clear to every Christian that 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.930
 The word of God has superior authority. 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.180
 that of any man on the face of the 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.100
 So there is still some difficulty 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.509
 in discussions with our leaders to 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.549
 respect for the things we have 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.829
 differences of opinion an errand 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.960
 important if your leader is your 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.790
 pastor is not about to discuss the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.560
 things of the Word of God 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.540
 careful with this man I'm not 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.490
 saying that there really is not 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.560
 spiritual authority but what I am 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.360
 saying that this authority is 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.560
 manifest in a different way 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.989
 from what we have seen 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.270
 a principle that I believe is 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.640
 indispensable in the life of the Christian he 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.920
 understand that authority is delegated 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.110
 This means that I can have 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.270
 authority over their lives to the extent 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.370
 that you give me this authority when 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.680
 we understand that everyone then went 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.930
 called to serve each other 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.970
 authority happens naturally 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.860
 nobody needs to tell you that 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.690
 what should you be doing but you? 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.450
 understands what your share of 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.989
 responsibility and places itself in 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.150
 place 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.890
 The challenge is to be a community where 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.470
 everyone submits to everyone 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.720
 that is, the universal priesthood is indeed 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.299
 exercised but for what is the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.010
 pastor then the pastor the priest or 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.290
 any other leadership you want 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.269
 if he is he is simply a facilitator 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.190
 the process when you read the 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.980
 acts you realize that the very 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.620
 apostles raised some men who 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.660
 are the deacons to take care of the service 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.670
 so that they could devote themselves to the unique and 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.980
 exclusively for teaching 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.500
 But today things are very messed up. 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.000
 there are people who want to teach and to govern 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.600
 same time have control over your 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.310
 life 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.530
 if you are part of the church of christ 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.400
 of course you are accountable for your 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.920
 life someone 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.200
 obviously if you are accountable to someone 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.819
 who is conniving with their sins and the 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.069
 your interests 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.160
 this accountability is not worth the 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:35.799
 challenge in community life, we exercise 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.890
 an authority which is delegated for each 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.720
 individual in a lawful and healthy manner 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.579
 which promotes edification, this means 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.139
 that to the extent that you say I'm wrong 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:46.090
 man help me 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:49.420
 I'll help you, as long as you 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.670
 want to be charged by me 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.750
 I'll be charging you to and where you're going 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.970
 this joke 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.680
 well this joke goes while you 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.569
 have been willing to walk together if any 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.730
 person has to put himself in the place of 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.769
 trying to exert control over the 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.000
 his life in the care of church 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.739
 move away from that person 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.750
 if someone tries to impress you with 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.940
 that talk that you're being 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.980
 rebel distrust the first 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.299
 distrust you have to have is the 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.340
 their own convictions 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.950
 after all you are fighting the struggle of 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.979
 who many people say ah I am the 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.320
 I am a defender of the church. 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.620
 things that are correct most of the time 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.660
 it's just military 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.270
 on its own account so it is important 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.250
 not to walk alone until we talk and 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.560
 make a revolution we need to walk 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.330
 along with other people besides me 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.710
 church is no longer a church of 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.990
 Christ, good if you're walking. 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.360
 alone you also not the church of 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.760
 Christ, there must be two or more 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.560
 more assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.510
 understanding these things then not 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.760
 we can move on to the second step that 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:51.949
 is to assess whether this church is still 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.389
 committed to the gospel I am not 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.340
 telling you to give up your church 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.350
 simply look for another to great 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.000
 The truth is that most people who 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:00.590
 change of church end up having a 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.960
 experience not as enjoyable as 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.850
 would like so it is important that case 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.550
 you are determined to change your church 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:10.370
 You know why you're doing this and 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.870
 besides, look for the pastor of this new 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.699
 church to have a very 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.840
 frank what are your 

00:05:13.699 --> 00:05:16.789
 expectations 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.830
 some conversations in this sense may 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.419
 save so much suffering for you 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.610
 and for people who are in 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:24.740
 new church itself trying still 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.930
 fight for the preservation of values 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.120
 within a community you 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.740
 realize that there is no further commitment 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.780
 with what the word says 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.180
 so it's time to change if you have 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.419
 good friends people who can bring you 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.340
 useful advice ie not advice 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.289
 What do you like more advice? 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.660
 second word of god and if these 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:47.180
 advice points in the direction of 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.860
 need to change you too 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.590
 do not understand that it's time to change 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.130
 community hamas church everything is not alike 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.080
 not 

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:56.150
 it is important to understand that by changing 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.680
 It is normal for the community to repeat 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.930
 some mistakes that we have experienced in our 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.900
 previous religious experience or 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:05.030
 if you have been smothered by an authority 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.330
 within a given model of 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:10.970
 church of course you or 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.349
 resubmit to the same process or 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.660
 so you want to get away completely 

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:15.949
 of what is becoming a model of 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.599
 biblical submission 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.669
 in both cases you are moving away 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.150
 what God's purpose for your 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:21.740
 life 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.349
 when we submit to a 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:26.389
 spiritual authority that is occupying 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.660
 the place that should be of Christ we 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.860
 we are actually outsourcing the 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.639
 responsibility that Christ delegates to our 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.409
 own life 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.539
 after all the first person to pay 

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:36.950
 accounts of your own life is yourself 

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:39.680
 on the other hand when the 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:42.290
 c escapes from this concept of submission 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.570
 voluntary and wants to be independent of 

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:46.280
 anyone else you are in 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.910
 trying to put yourself in the place of 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.800
 Christ 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.480
 evaluating all these parameters I 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.090
 I hope you can stop to think 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.460
 a little on what this concept means 

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.110
 of spiritual authority and understand which 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.000
 is the challenge for us Christians in 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.220
 call responsibility to us 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.860
 that you may be a person who 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.120
 submit to your life other people more 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.890
 mature than you 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.860
 but that this submission does not become 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:11.420
 slavery after all we owe our 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.490
 Christian life and no one else. 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:16.580
 if you have questions or comments 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.380
 you simply want to disagree with everything
