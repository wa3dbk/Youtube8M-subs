here's a look at everything that comes

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.580 
here's a look at everything that comes
in<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.780> box<00:00:12.809> first<00:00:13.440> stop<00:00:13.650> user<00:00:13.950> guide<00:00:15.590> you'll

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
in the box first stop user guide you'll

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.439 
in the box first stop user guide you'll
need<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.800> 9-volt<00:00:17.340> battery<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:18.090> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
need a 9-volt battery for the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.810 
need a 9-volt battery for the
transmitter<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.170> for<00:00:19.650> double<00:00:19.980> a's<00:00:20.130> for<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
transmitter and for double a's for the

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.390 
transmitter and for double a's for the
truck<00:00:21.210> now<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.500> says<00:00:22.769> here<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.100> these

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
truck now it says here that these

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.650 
truck now it says here that these
batteries<00:00:23.789> are<00:00:23.910> not<00:00:24.090> included<00:00:26.599> moving<00:00:27.599> right

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
batteries are not included moving right

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.109 
batteries are not included moving right
along<00:00:27.810> here's<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.650> transmitter<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
along here's the transmitter with the

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.819 
along here's the transmitter with the
detachable<00:00:31.460> antenna<00:00:32.600> you'll<00:00:33.600> want<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.140> have

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
detachable antenna you'll want to have

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.620 
detachable antenna you'll want to have
the<00:00:35.100> antenna<00:00:35.430> all<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> way<00:00:35.880> out<00:00:35.910> so<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.420> get

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the antenna all the way out so you get

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.270 
the antenna all the way out so you get
some<00:00:36.809> better<00:00:37.020> transmission<00:00:37.500> when<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> car<00:00:38.250> is

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
some better transmission when the car is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.080 
some better transmission when the car is
farther<00:00:38.790> away<00:00:38.899> and<00:00:40.550> let's<00:00:41.550> take<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> closer

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
farther away and let's take a closer

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.569 
farther away and let's take a closer
look<00:00:42.239> at<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:43.200> actual<00:00:43.440> transmitter<00:00:43.890> here's

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
look at the actual transmitter here's

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.250 
look at the actual transmitter here's
the<00:00:44.700> power<00:00:45.000> button<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.600> sure<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.930> turn<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
the power button be sure to turn the

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
the power button be sure to turn the
truck<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.680> before<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:47.370> turn<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:48.090> so

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
truck on before you turn this on so

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.619 
truck on before you turn this on so
it'll<00:00:48.600> work<00:00:48.750> oh<00:00:49.280> yes<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.399> truck<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.820> but

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
it'll work oh yes the truck is on but

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.970 
it'll work oh yes the truck is on but
that's<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> turn<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> wheels<00:00:52.530> left<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
that's the turn the wheels left and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.459 
that's the turn the wheels left and
right<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.239> go<00:00:54.360> full<00:00:54.600> forward<00:00:55.170> and

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
right and this is to go full forward and

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.590 
right and this is to go full forward and
backwards<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.460> guess<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.879> guys<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> live

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
backwards I guess you guys get a live

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.889 
backwards I guess you guys get a live
demo<00:00:57.960> right<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.609> and<00:00:59.609> here's<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.539> LED

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
demo right here and here's the LED

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.720 
demo right here and here's the LED
indicator<00:01:01.440> got<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> pretty<00:01:02.370> cool-looking
