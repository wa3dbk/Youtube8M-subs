00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.220
 hello today will teach you how 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.710
 Cut the long sleeve on the fabric not 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.900
 let's make a pattern so they can see that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.390
 it's very easy we just need two 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.860
 measures the length of the sleeve that is taken 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.450
 from the shoulder to the sleeve length 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.169
 desired in this case we're going in the manga 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.579
 Long this in the video of how to take 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.829
 stockings I teach you how to take them 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.920
 exactly we will not need the 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.010
 sleeve length 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.539
 in this case we are going to mark it would be of 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.539
 45 centimeters 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.000
 and we are going to take the other measure that is the 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.570
 arm width half of the contour 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.270
 arm if you have 30 half would be 15 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.060
 centimeters 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.650
 that this is going to be how wide I am going to 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.570
 cut simple nothing more to teach them 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.990
 however you cut in the double the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.880
 cloth 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.730
 I'm going to fold it so that 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.590
 cut the two sleeves at once 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.590
 together they bend it 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.800
 to the half 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.020
 and again in half as we need 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.450
 only 15 centimeters wide can 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.980
 give it 18 or 20 so it does not 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.720
 waste a lot of fabric if they fold it 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.520
 all the way to the other end they go to 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.400
 waste a lot of cloth then let's 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.660
 leave it as my arm half of outline 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.150
 is 32 or 30 forgiveness half would be at 15 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.190
 centimeters has about this piece is 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.880
 well I'm going to mark something and it marks the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.250
 first long 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.250
 already marching long 45 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.460
 45s along the tree we are going to go down 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:57.670
 up to the bottom we're going to go down 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:01.179
 12 to 16 centimeters this varies 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.340
 depending on the body of the 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:07.630
 person not the more it fills the more we 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.220
 let's lower the normal are 14 are 12 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.920
 to 14 centimeters 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.260
 I'm going down in this case 14 when it's 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.610
 for girls only get 12 or at 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.549
 unless you want angels bomb 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.880
 panties but if you get off 14 I'm going to 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.370
 go down 14 and from here of the 14 centimeters 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.459
 I'm going to give you 15 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.740
 centimeters of measurement plus 1 centimeter and 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:32.020
 sewing medium 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.030
 I'm going to mark them to see if they can see 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:37.410
 all right 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.410
 we mark a rectangle 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.620
 and it does not look very good from genre to 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.400
 along the bottom we're going to 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.400
 measure our fist 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:03.269
 are 23 half of the 23 would be 11 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.709
 centimeters plus the seam 12 this what 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.290
 that we are going to leave wide in the part 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.819
 below we have already marked this what 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.819
 I'm cutting so you can see it 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.710
 here we do not arrive 14 in this case no 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.690
 I choose to make a pattern because they are subjects that 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.400
 the body is approached a lot when it is 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.220
 Need pattern are for suits 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.900
 tailors not there yes necessarily 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.460
 they need to make a pattern because they 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.230
 You must be very precise curves 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.540
 that we already have marked here 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.340
 above we already have the 14 centimeters that 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.550
 we got off the only thing we're going to do 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:43.170
 it's a small curve for I'm going to cut 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.770
 to see it well this is what 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.770
 let's do 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.930
 or what are we going to do then a 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.120
 little mosque in the middle to know 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.400
 if this is our half we are going to open it 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.210
 in half and we're going to take one 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.210
 small curve 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.640
 let's remove a small curve this 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.950
 this front I 'm going to do 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.530
 had removed we are taking away one 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.350
 curves so that the front part does not 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.360
 we were very very narrow ball does not 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.940
 we make a mosque in the part of 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.200
 go ahead to know that I was 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.049
 stuck in the clay appointment 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.870
 front and east where we did not 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.240
 curve where we do not get anything goes 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.100
 to go stuck links to pull this for 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.780
 what is so that we do not get too done 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.890
 ball in the bust part a part of 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.110
 the armhole 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.660
 if we do not remove it, it curves many 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.050
 Sometimes we are left bolt is a 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.270
 centimeter what is lowered 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:44.940
 and this fixed we have more copied this 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:49.820
 that in being good because this is all 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.820
 serve him and see you in the next video
