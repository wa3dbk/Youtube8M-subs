okay<00:00:00.840> let's<00:00:01.170> talk<00:00:01.410> about<00:00:01.760> a<00:00:02.760> chord<00:00:03.389> inversion

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
okay let's talk about a chord inversion

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.059 
okay let's talk about a chord inversion
exercise<00:00:04.710> that<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.430> had<00:00:05.879> invented<00:00:06.240> myself<00:00:07.069> what

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
exercise that I had invented myself what

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.790 
exercise that I had invented myself what
we<00:00:08.250> do<00:00:08.490> I'm<00:00:09.210> going<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.450> teach<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.900> what<00:00:10.679> are

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
we do I'm going to teach you what are

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.459 
we do I'm going to teach you what are
called<00:00:11.010> all<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.639> diatonic<00:00:12.290> chord<00:00:13.290> inversions

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
called all the diatonic chord inversions

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.790 
called all the diatonic chord inversions
in<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.160> key<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.400> C<00:00:14.519> major<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:15.230> once<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.500> have

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
in the key of C major and once you have

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.179 
in the key of C major and once you have
that<00:00:17.220> information<00:00:18.800> you'll<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.980> able<00:00:20.070> to

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
that information you'll be able to

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.960 
that information you'll be able to
transfer<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.210> pretty<00:00:22.109> much<00:00:22.260> any<00:00:22.500> chord<00:00:22.970> so

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
transfer it to pretty much any chord so

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.580 
transfer it to pretty much any chord so
first<00:00:24.269> of<00:00:24.390> all<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:24.539> start<00:00:24.930> out<00:00:25.019> with<00:00:25.050> a<00:00:25.199> c-major

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
you're doing is you're looking to build

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.060 
you're doing is you're looking to build
a<00:00:56.910> chord<00:00:57.239> starting<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.109> e<00:00:58.320> right<00:00:58.770> here

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
a chord starting on this e right here

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.369 
a chord starting on this e right here
but<00:00:59.850> however<00:01:00.210> you're<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.840> have<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.050> find

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
but however you're going to have to find

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.500 
but however you're going to have to find
it<00:01:01.590> one<00:01:02.039> octave<00:01:02.430> higher<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.149> would<00:01:03.480> be

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
it one octave higher so that would be

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.630 
it one octave higher so that would be
here<00:01:04.129> so<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:06.390> take<00:01:06.570> your<00:01:06.810> thumb

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
here so what we do is we take your thumb

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.750 
here so what we do is we take your thumb
in<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:08.970> hand<00:01:09.000> place<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> e<00:01:10.760> now

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
in your right hand place it on the e now

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.020 
in your right hand place it on the e now
the<00:01:11.820> second<00:01:12.360> finger<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.890> find<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> g<00:01:14.549> which

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the second finger is to find the g which

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.600 
the second finger is to find the g which
is<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.509> g<00:01:15.810> here<00:01:16.460> here<00:01:17.460> ok<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.150> then<00:01:19.610> last

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
is this g here here ok and then last

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.820 
is this g here here ok and then last
note<00:01:20.909> that<00:01:21.090> we're<00:01:21.240> missing<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:21.900> sea<00:01:22.560> which

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
note that we're missing is the sea which

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.240 
note that we're missing is the sea which
was<00:01:23.009> right<00:01:23.250> here<00:01:24.560> alright<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:25.950> have<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
was right here alright so we have the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.770 
was right here alright so we have the
same<00:01:26.490> three<00:01:26.729> notes<00:01:26.939> see<00:01:27.869> eg<00:01:28.909> just<00:01:29.909> spelled<00:01:30.570> in

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
same three notes see eg just spelled in

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.359 
same three notes see eg just spelled in
a<00:01:30.869> different<00:01:31.290> order<00:01:31.939> hey<00:01:32.939> Jane<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.200> see<00:01:34.590> and

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
a different order hey Jane and see and

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.249 
a different order hey Jane and see and
this<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.729> what<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:35.939> call<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> first<00:01:36.689> inversion

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
this is what we call the first inversion

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.850 
this is what we call the first inversion
cord<00:01:38.780> all<00:01:39.780> right<00:01:39.990> now<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.290> would<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.619> first

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
cord all right now this would be a first

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.289 
cord all right now this would be a first
inversion<00:01:41.310> C<00:01:41.729> major<00:01:41.939> chord<00:01:42.799> ok<00:01:43.799> next<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:45.119> have

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
inversion C major chord ok next we have

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.330 
inversion C major chord ok next we have
what<00:01:45.509> is<00:01:45.540> called<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:46.020> second<00:01:46.500> inversion<00:01:46.829> cord

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
what is called a second inversion cord

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.780 
what is called a second inversion cord
and<00:01:47.630> this<00:01:48.630> time<00:01:48.899> we're<00:01:49.110> going<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.320> build

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
and this time we're going to build

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.910 
and this time we're going to build
starting<00:01:50.790> from<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.299> note<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:52.110> however

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
starting from this note here however

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.310 
starting from this note here however
we're<00:01:53.159> going<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.369> start<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.820> one<00:01:54.090> octave<00:01:54.320> so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
we're going to start it up one octave so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.270 
we're going to start it up one octave so
we<00:01:55.409> start<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.860> thumb<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.610> G

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
we start with a thumb on the G

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.680 
we start with a thumb on the G
okay<00:01:58.760> next<00:01:59.000> we<00:01:59.240> need<00:01:59.270> to<00:01:59.570> see<00:02:01.210> there<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.299> go<00:02:02.450> and

okay so once again see eg is spelled in

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.350 
okay so once again see eg is spelled in
another<00:02:12.830> different<00:02:13.310> word<00:02:15.370> it's<00:02:16.370> now<00:02:16.550> G<00:02:16.880> C<00:02:17.209> and

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
another different word it's now G C and

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.640 
another different word it's now G C and
E<00:02:18.400> otherwise<00:02:19.400> known<00:02:19.760> as<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:20.330> second<00:02:21.319> inversion

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
E otherwise known as a second inversion

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.449 
E otherwise known as a second inversion
c<00:02:22.190> major<00:02:22.400> chord<00:02:22.870> okay<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.170> that's<00:02:24.410> C<00:02:25.280> major

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
c major chord okay so that's C major

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.640 
c major chord okay so that's C major
chord
