00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.310
 joe my little love puppets it's 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.070
 magnon find themselves today for a 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.320
 really nice gameplay on 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.110
 the excellent call of duty black ops 1 he 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.869
 will be a nuclear attempt 1 m 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.160
 me on the map the nayala there is already 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:31.570
 who will tell me but in time told me 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.940
 what are you talking about is no 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.180
 nuclear power not two months ago on 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.100
 call of duty black ops 1 then yes but 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.930
 if you actually want I will go 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.309
 simply the equivalent of a title 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.800
 nuclear, that is, an attempt 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.140
 more than 30 km strict so that's it 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.789
 corresponds to a nuclear on black ops 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.480
 2 so I found that really 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.989
 nice 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.579
 to offer it to you in addition to that it is 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.280
 one even then there and same time there is 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.170
 not necessarily a lot of time to 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.840
 do two big series so I find 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.300
 it's more interesting too 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:07.330
 I was in solo that adds a little 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.880
 so deserves my basic class this is the 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.649
 commando with a laser sight 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.259
 I had also put to charge great 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.479
 ability and my strengths it seems to me 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.189
 I had put picture mh warlords 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.140
 and tactical masks so in fact 

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.700
 I was not even gone to play 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.590
 actually seriously I rode had 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.479
 assets in pro is also for that 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.009
 that you will be able to see me succi on 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:29.290
 monsters and the a3 from time to time for 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.759
 try to ride a ghost in pro 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.920
 short 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.540
 but in any case the gameplay really 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.820
 friendly since there is rush 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.490
 good after I'm going to pick up some 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.680
 weapons since I did not have 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.509
 looters I was forced to do two 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.680
 large series 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.630
 you know that from any 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.479
 way on my channel in that I propose 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.189
 they are months of nuclear on black 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.159
 ops finally d equivalent you have me 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.570
 understood but hey I think we're talking 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.240
 not my channel a little later 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.210
 even I had a subject already to be addressed 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.860
 with you it's just good for 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.780
 still talk about black ops 3 that's right 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.820
 we already talk a lot but that I 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.719
 think we do not talk much about it 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.850
 it's already 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:11.130
 does call of duty black ops 3 go 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.490
 to be available 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.590
 on them holden so ps3 and xbox 360 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.600
 it's true that there are rumors that 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.710
 run like it would not even be 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.480
 available on these consoles so that's good 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.990
 would be amazing anyway I find a 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.030
 financial level for activation this is 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.650
 true it would be a little bit a little 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.290
 little weird it would make them lose 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.510
 money but good on the other hand 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.610
 to say what is for my part I find 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.580
 that really the call of duty the 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.620
 new call of duty on nextgen are 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.020
 really disgusting are really 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.520
 vomiting between us frankly when 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.890
 I see what advanced edouard farah 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.440
 does graphic level 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.690
 it was really disgusting what is 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.880
 moreover precisely if ever call of 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.040
 duty black ops 3 spell on old gen on ne 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.620
 do not know is what it really would be worth 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.630
 the shot of being bought ben me 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.100
 honestly I do not think I 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.810
 will buy it because in fact I'm good 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:08.880
 say that because i have ps3 that follow 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.990
 I do not have any consoles next gen tu 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:15.300
 see but very frankly if he goes out 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.710
 well if he goes out on the young of any 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.850
 way if he goes out on next gen me 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.280
 personally I could not 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.470
 buy it but even if it goes out on all 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.730
 young you see and even though I can 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.340
 buy it I do not think I 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.320
 would simply because ew 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.240
 only because of bad graphics 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.730
 I was completely disgusted beaten I 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.260
 I do not play at all and then 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.660
 there are also many other things that 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.510
 are advantageous for example for 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.940
 the youtuber down no fashion no fashion 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.190
 studio that's really very 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.319
 disadvantageous means you have to 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.569
 always put your 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.550
 acquisition box en route to be 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.560
 sure not to lose parts or even 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.120
 clips for anyone who has not 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.150
 precisely no acquisition box 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.879
 it allowed to be filmed 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.500
 gameplay or the clips by some of 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.000
 their pals I found it really not 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.340
 practice the mad studios also from 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.930
 simply back up eei 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.480
 gameplay to show others 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.549
 in short we will not expand too much e 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.829
 on saab also have no war 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:21.370
 earthly 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:23.200
 finally good many things that make 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.790
 what the go the call of duty the 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.840
 new call of duty coming out on the 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.340
 young sound are less attractive I find 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.169
 that's why I say that I 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.090
 personally I do not think it's worth 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.889
 no more the shot to buy the new ones 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.600
 call of duty on on youth role and 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.760
 again if they come out on years because 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.419
 that I asked a lot of people and 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.669
 apparently it's new call of duty 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:48.610
 would not even go out on all young 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.260
 but good when we see the shit sorry 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.000
 to say that but frankly I find 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.310
 that this is the term we can 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.130
 use the shit that makes us 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.200
 every year now since low call 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.810
 of duty ghost years since the 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.970
 new consoles are out and well 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.870
 I find that the new ones new 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.070
 call of duty really get to shit 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.919
 so good already at first 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.930
 does call of duty black ops 3 go 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.090
 go out on holden this is the first 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.440
 question to ask one to know if that 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.810
 worth buying it first 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.210
 at first know if indeed 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.289
 black ops 3 will come out or not you roll 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.910
 young people besides do not hesitate to me 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.669
 say in the comments you if you 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:29.260
 have information about that and then if 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.550
 he never goes out on the young if you 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.740
 think it's worth buying it 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.440
 and if you intend to buy it because 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:36.940
 that good on one side black ops rank in him 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.590
 even I think is going to be well children 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.080
 trillard I find we still have 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.210
 make good, deserving games as we fight 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.220
 with black ops a black ops two of 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.169
 games that have focused mostly on 

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.950
 merit and they have been excellent 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.990
 games 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.820
 the zombie mode too will have been excellent 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.480
 in France I find that call of duty 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.100
 from treyarch 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.580
 are really not that bad at this 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.650
 level of multiplayer or zombie after 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.580
 of course it only concerns me yet 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.550
 once but me personally 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.100
 as I say I will not buy it 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.530
 on ps3 so let's go back to the gameplay 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.280
 as you saw it there I am in 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.890
 big series 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.110
 there I am it seems to me barely two 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:20.000
 that they of my nuclear if I if I do not 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.170
 do not deceive me so I'm going to do my 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.220
 30th he sees there perfect so the 32nd 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:27.200
 strict so we can say that it is 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.890
 the equivalent of a triple nuclear so 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.290
 anyway 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.370
 look at the 33 buy it is when I 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.410
 I died a first time I was at 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.060
 three of them so if you do the 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.710
 subtraction it's been thirty that he 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.690
 is just homage in the end I 'm dying 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.970
 I could have done a huge ratio will be 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:43.000
 limit effect a perfect gameplay but I 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.440
 find the gameplay really nice 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.030
 so do not hesitate to subscribe 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.010
