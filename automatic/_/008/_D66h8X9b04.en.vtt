00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 this time I'm going to show you my 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.029
 closet like I do not have organized right now 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.460
 that I'm pregnant so I hope that 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.110
 like this video and we start in 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.509
 is written from my class where I add 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.340
 this ledge above the ledge I have 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.830
 all my boots that are not in right now 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:22.519
 use more below I have this this tube that 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.529
 also install is a wooden stick 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.619
 especially for closet and only 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.380
 buy this then the little things that are going to 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.320
 the sides to hold them in hong type 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.880
 and here I have my blazers and jackets 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.950
 now I do not have them in use 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.989
 because obviously to bring it closer in this 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.750
 box I have missions skirts and pants 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.629
 that I do not have left for the moment because 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.469
 I'm pregnant but this one is a 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.660
 good way to have them clean what 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.030
 The only thing I did was to fold them well and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.989
 I added these wipes that smell rich 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.530
 so that they do not get a smell of clothes 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.559
 saved and I put a bag of old navy in 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.270
 the top part so that it does not 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.900
 dirty with the powder below I have 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.300
 this furniture 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.100
 it's not for closed it's for bathroom but 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.820
 they left outside a house and they had it 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.490
 for free so this one occurred to me 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.290
 put it here in this space only 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.900
 I asked my husband to add this 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.030
 wood that you see here because that's where I was going 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.210
 zinc in the part of here in from 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.460
 this piece of furniture I have organized my 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.660
 skinny jeans colored jeans and 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.660
 some jeans 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.299
 as right now they are not in use that's why the 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.090
 I have bent in this way but more 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.550
 go ahead when I regained my weight 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.440
 obviously I'm going to put them somewhere else 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.869
 of my class or the part of in the middle of my 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.810
 closet because this you already saw in the 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.600
 last update only have 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.869
 changed this then some little things like 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.830
 can see and this is the clothes that right now 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.500
 more or less I still have some is this 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.659
 cold weather but then I have it here 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.340
 so that it does not wrinkle and in the part 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.820
 from below where I have my clothes hanging 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.459
 I have this long ledge where I have this 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.340
 Well, some basic strap bags 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.080
 some blouses that I have left now 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.030
 as here are the probable ones that 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.360
 it's also a bathroom that was left out 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.060
 of a house like the other one that I showed you 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.340
 they are from here so that's why I liked them 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.680
 although they are for bathroom I do not use them 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.750
 for that as you can see the point of 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.080
 take advantage of the furniture that 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.460
 we have or that we can get 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.670
 practically in this drawer that is 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:43.000
 super big or I do not know how to call him I have 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:48.310
 all my clothes good all that I do not 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.400
 is my blouses dresses pants and 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.250
 other little things like spring-summer 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.590
 it's all combined but then how am I 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.690
 pregnant right now I have it saved and 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.420
 the other part of my closet also that 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.819
 change this then some little things 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.500
 I will show you quickly as well as 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.500
 it looks at a glance 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.910
 Well the first thing I did was add 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.540
 this magazine where I have my perfumes 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:19.450
 vor and sprays and some other creampie 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.280
 there as you can see what I like 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.010
 of this klose system of hong after 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.610
 that you can add and remove this 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:30.190
 organizer is the way that you 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.080
 accommodate to store your things and then 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.019
 well it's a ledge, it's also a 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.120
 type here as you can see then there is a 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.700
 little bit I will try to 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.590
 get one that is longer and 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.920
 these are also bought in hollywood and 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.319
 nothing being fit this tube 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.280
 that has these holes and then you can 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:54.190
 one to accommodate as one wants higher 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.920
 lower depends on how you go to 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.630
 use 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.120
 I also added this which is for 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.640
 ties but I have my glasses that I do not 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.739
 they are in use but I like how 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.989
 I added this portraits with a photo 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.200
 of an artist so I think super 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.200
 all right 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.060
 and this already had it I got it from a 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.760
 magazine and for the part of here I have 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.030
 organized in the accessories my creams 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.530
 in this furniture of 9 dividers I have 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:27.770
 this some shoes and also these 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.110
 cubes where you can save some 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.419
 things I show you what I have in 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.600
 the first one I have all my creams 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:39.320

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.910
 take care of my deodorant face and what 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.220
 I have like that because I do not like having it 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.070
 the view I feel I do not know how it looks 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.740
 very very accumulated everything then of this 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.370
 way because it is already when what is not 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.370
 I want it to look 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:56.239
 in the middle I do not have anything like they can 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.239
 watch 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.280

 so very very specific from page 3 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.190
 link and in the part below I added 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.800
 this ledge also 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:53.250
 where I have some bags like this 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.740
 small ones that are my favorites too 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.890
 I added this tube and as you can see 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.480
 I have another of these to accommodate 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:03.360

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:13.230
 this pink organizer that you see there 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.840

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.870
 I have a thermometer and little things that go 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:20.610

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.150

 finally I show you this furniture cited 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:47.980
 that I bought in kmart very economically not 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:50.620
 It's very good quality but it's useful 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:55.090
 to store my clothes like socks 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:57.760
 inside and this my leggins and so on 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.400
 that this one makes me very beautiful is very 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.550
 good with the closet decoration but 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.380
 As I tell you, it is not of such good quality 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:07.390
 so then I'll be 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.650
