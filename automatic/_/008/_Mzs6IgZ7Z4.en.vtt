so as you can see today's recording

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.400 
so as you can see today's recording
setup<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> little<00:00:17.910> bit<00:00:18.090> different<00:00:18.539> since<00:00:19.170> my

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
setup is a little bit different since my

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.960 
setup is a little bit different since my
microphone<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.130> already<00:00:20.369> mounted<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:20.880> I

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
microphone is already mounted and I

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.220 
microphone is already mounted and I
didn't<00:00:21.420> really<00:00:21.510> want<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.810> go<00:00:21.869> into<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
didn't really want to go into the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.140 
didn't really want to go into the
trouble<00:00:22.529> of<00:00:22.590> taking<00:00:22.830> it<00:00:23.070> off<00:00:23.220> so<00:00:23.939> we're<00:00:24.029> gonna

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
trouble of taking it off so we're gonna

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.859 
trouble of taking it off so we're gonna
have<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.359> stick<00:00:24.600> with<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.960> for<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.980> video

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
have to stick with this for this video

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.019

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
so like I said the blue snowball ice a

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.569 
so like I said the blue snowball ice a
very<00:00:30.810> well-known<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.740> very<00:00:31.859> respectable

seconds but first we're going to have a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.119 
seconds but first we're going to have a
look<00:00:50.309> at<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> packaging<00:00:51.180> so<00:00:51.840> there<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
look at the packaging so there is the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.740 
look at the packaging so there is the
packaging<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.120> can<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.300> it's

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
packaging now as you can see it's

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.139 
packaging now as you can see it's
reasonably<00:00:55.530> high<00:00:55.710> quality<00:00:56.129> plastic<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
reasonably high quality plastic the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.569 
reasonably high quality plastic the
microphone<00:00:57.539> sits<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> middle<00:00:58.340> with<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
microphone sits in the middle with the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.599 
microphone sits in the middle with the
USB<00:01:00.000> cable<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> stand<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:02.160> bottom

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
USB cable and the stand on the bottom

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.570 
USB cable and the stand on the bottom
now<00:01:03.120> speaking<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.930> stand<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.460> of

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
now speaking of the stand this is one of

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.000 
now speaking of the stand this is one of
the<00:01:05.700> changes<00:01:06.140> comparing<00:01:07.140> this<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the changes comparing this to the

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.469 
the changes comparing this to the
original<00:01:08.369> snowball<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.119> see<00:01:09.270> is<00:01:09.330> no

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
original snowball as you can see is no

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.510 
original snowball as you can see is no
longer<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.960> metal<00:01:10.380> adjustable<00:01:10.979> stand<00:01:11.220> but<00:01:11.490> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
longer a metal adjustable stand but a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.140 
longer a metal adjustable stand but a
very<00:01:11.790> plasticky<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.960> flimsy<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.000> stand<00:01:15.000> with

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
very plasticky and flimsy I stand with

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.359 
very plasticky and flimsy I stand with
three<00:01:15.420> legs<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> bottom<00:01:16.470> now<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.250> can

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
three legs at the bottom now as you can

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.670 
three legs at the bottom now as you can
see<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.580> did<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> bit<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.210> DIY<00:01:18.720> job<00:01:19.110> mounting<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
see I did a bit of a DIY job mounting it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.080 
see I did a bit of a DIY job mounting it
here<00:01:19.950> because<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:20.610> didn't<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
here because I really didn't have a

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.620 
here because I really didn't have a
place<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.659> put<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.560> table<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.420> I<00:01:24.420> just

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
place to put it on the table so I just

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.450 
place to put it on the table so I just
drilled<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.200> couple<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.500> holes<00:01:25.710> into<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.070> table

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
drilled a couple of holes into the table

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.580 
drilled a couple of holes into the table
zip<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.479> whole<00:01:27.750> stand<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.380> table

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
zip like the whole stand to the table

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
zip like the whole stand to the table
and<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.040> works<00:01:29.220> very<00:01:29.369> well<00:01:29.549> doesn't<00:01:30.420> actually

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and it works very well doesn't actually

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.100 
and it works very well doesn't actually
move<00:01:30.930> at<00:01:31.229> all<00:01:31.939> now<00:01:32.939> another<00:01:33.479> difference<00:01:33.689> is

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
move at all now another difference is

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.640 
move at all now another difference is
that<00:01:34.380> well<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.369> most<00:01:35.759> obvious<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.650> the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
that well the most obvious one is the

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.800 
that well the most obvious one is the
color<00:01:38.340> change<00:01:38.610> its<00:01:38.790> now<00:01:38.939> white<00:01:39.270> that's<00:01:39.630> why

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
color change its now white that's why

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.260 
color change its now white that's why
it's<00:01:39.960> called<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.290> ice<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:41.610> original

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
it's called the ice the original

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.539 
it's called the ice the original
snowball<00:01:43.049> comes<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.560> brushed<00:01:43.829> aluminium<00:01:44.040> and

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
snowball comes in brushed aluminium and

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.539 
snowball comes in brushed aluminium and
black<00:01:44.850> weather<00:01:45.439> unlike<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.649> which<00:01:47.009> comes<00:01:47.310> in

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
black weather unlike this which comes in

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.630 
black weather unlike this which comes in
white<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:49.590> main<00:01:49.890> difference<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.579> that

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
white and the main difference is that

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.649 
white and the main difference is that
this<00:01:51.380> only<00:01:52.380> uses<00:01:52.860> one<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.189> their<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.659> single

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
this only uses one of their a single

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.899 
this only uses one of their a single
condenser<00:01:55.530> capsule<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.490> it<00:01:56.549> only<00:01:56.640> has<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
condenser capsule so it only has a
