not<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.070> unlocking<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.760> just<00:01:08.970> waiting

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
not really unlocking it's just waiting

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.530

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
for it to be available so I'll get those

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.030 
for it to be available so I'll get those
trucks<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:18.140> get<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.320> tanks<00:01:19.650> come<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.009> I

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
trucks and get some tanks come in and I

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.380 
trucks and get some tanks come in and I
think<00:01:20.250> once<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> tanks<00:01:20.970> come<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
think once the tanks come in you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
think once the tanks come in you
actually<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.590> laser<00:01:23.220> guided

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
actually get the the laser guided

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.149 
actually get the the laser guided
missile<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> we<00:01:25.350> got<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> couple<00:01:25.650> more<00:01:25.890> trucks

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.310 
missile so we got a couple more trucks
coming<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:26.520> here<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.000> think<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> first<00:01:28.140> time<00:01:28.259> I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
coming in here I think the first time I

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.469 
coming in here I think the first time I
went<00:01:28.500> through<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.740> mission<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.159> didn't<00:01:29.610> ahead

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
two vehicles you can sort a target I

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.819 
two vehicles you can sort a target I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
mean you can target either one or target

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.770 
mean you can target either one or target
in<00:01:55.890> between<00:01:56.159> whatever<00:01:56.399> because<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.570> actually

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
in between whatever because you actually

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.770 
in between whatever because you actually
get<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.110> guide<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.860> missile<00:01:59.040> and<00:02:01.969> here<00:02:02.969> we<00:02:03.060> go

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
get to guide the missile and here we go

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.870 
get to guide the missile and here we go
looks<00:02:04.469> like<00:02:04.590> we<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:04.799> have<00:02:05.009> three<00:02:05.399> tanks

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
looks like we actually have three tanks

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.749 
looks like we actually have three tanks
coming<00:02:06.119> in<00:02:06.439> so<00:02:07.439> I'm<00:02:07.500> going<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.680> wait<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:08.160> few

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
coming in so I'm going to wait a few

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.809 
coming in so I'm going to wait a few
seconds<00:02:09.270> here<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:10.649> that<00:02:10.830> they<00:02:10.950> actually<00:02:11.280> bunch

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
seconds here so that they actually bunch

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.590 
seconds here so that they actually bunch
up

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
up

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.030 
up
because<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.690> think<00:02:14.750> the<00:02:15.020> front<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.440> slows<00:02:15.800> down

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
because I think the front one slows down

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.070 
because I think the front one slows down
a<00:02:16.070> bit<00:02:16.370> or<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.880> two<00:02:17.030> back<00:02:17.300> here<00:02:17.570> bunched<00:02:17.930> up<00:02:18.020> so

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
a bit or the two back here bunched up so

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.450 
a bit or the two back here bunched up so
I'm<00:02:18.230> gonna<00:02:18.320> target<00:02:18.590> the<00:02:18.680> middle<00:02:18.830> one<00:02:19.070> and<00:02:19.100> then

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
I'm gonna target the middle one and then

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.670 
I'm gonna target the middle one and then
you<00:02:19.580> get<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.850> guide<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.930> missiles<00:02:21.320> so<00:02:21.470> just

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
you get to guide the missiles so just

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.500 
you get to guide the missiles so just
land<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.100> right<00:02:22.130> in<00:02:22.400> between<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:22.910> two<00:02:22.940> tanks

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
land it right in between the two tanks

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.050 
land it right in between the two tanks
