00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
many different materials the workers

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.819 
many different materials the workers
that<00:00:47.370> built<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> wall<00:00:48.210> used<00:00:49.079> whatever<00:00:49.559> they

that built the wall used whatever they

that built the wall used whatever they
could<00:00:49.890> get<00:00:50.219> locally<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.600> they<00:00:51.780> were<00:00:51.840> going

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
could get locally so if they were going

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.850 
could get locally so if they were going
over<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.770> mountain<00:00:53.010> they<00:00:53.820> would<00:00:54.000> oftentimes

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
over a mountain they would oftentimes

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.200 
over a mountain they would oftentimes
use<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:55.890> great<00:00:56.340> portion<00:00:56.699> of<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> mountain

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
use a great portion of the mountain

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.319 
use a great portion of the mountain
stone<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.500> build<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.949> wall<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.430> they<00:01:00.270> were

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
stone to build the wall if they were

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.900 
stone to build the wall if they were
going<00:01:00.750> across<00:01:01.020> plains<00:01:01.500> they<00:01:02.039> would<00:01:02.280> compact

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
going across plains they would compact

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.149 
going across plains they would compact
dirt<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.570> mud<00:01:03.840> into<00:01:04.439> something<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:04.979> could

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
dirt and mud into something they could

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.289 
dirt and mud into something they could
build<00:01:05.309> with<00:01:06.080> they<00:01:07.080> also<00:01:07.290> used<00:01:07.740> wood<00:01:08.250> reeds<00:01:08.970> or

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
build with they also used wood reeds or

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.510 
build with they also used wood reeds or
anything<00:01:09.720> else<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.380> could<00:01:10.619> be<00:01:10.799> used<00:01:11.070> to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
anything else that could be used to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.140 
anything else that could be used to
build<00:01:12.000> with<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:14.280> reason<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.909> is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
build with the reason for this is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.800 
build with the reason for this is
because<00:01:15.380> they<00:01:16.759> didn't<00:01:17.759> want<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.970> use<00:01:18.150> too

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
because they didn't want to use too

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.570 
because they didn't want to use too
expensive<00:01:19.439> things<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.950> they<00:01:20.009> didn't<00:01:20.310> want<00:01:20.460> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
expensive things and they didn't want to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.350 
expensive things and they didn't want to
take<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.820> time<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:22.350> ship<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.360> building

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
take the time to ship the building

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.620 
take the time to ship the building
supplies<00:01:24.799> to<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.950> wall<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.430> them<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.450> build

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
supplies to the wall for them to build

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.840 
supplies to the wall for them to build
with<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.560> they<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:28.860> use<00:01:29.100> whether<00:01:29.460> they<00:01:29.670> could

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
with so they just use whether they could

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.280 
with so they just use whether they could
and<00:01:30.150> if<00:01:30.240> they're<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.600> over<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.960> mountain

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
and if they're going over a mountain

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.700 
and if they're going over a mountain
they<00:01:32.270> basically<00:01:33.270> just<00:01:33.420> took<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.079> huge<00:01:34.409> chunk

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
they basically just took a huge chunk

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.520 
they basically just took a huge chunk
out<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.270> and<00:01:36.270> kept<00:01:37.110> going

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
out of it and kept going

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.680 
out of it and kept going
on<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.280> building
