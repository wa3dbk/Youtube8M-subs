that Monday pretty much saying that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.959 
that Monday pretty much saying that
we're<00:00:47.250> abusing<00:00:47.719> cpu<00:00:48.719> usage<00:00:49.309> on<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.700> server

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
we're abusing cpu usage on the server

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.939 
we're abusing cpu usage on the server
that<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.360> were<00:00:51.480> on<00:00:51.690> from<00:00:52.079> our<00:00:52.199> old<00:00:52.469> hosting

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
that we were on from our old hosting

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.520 
that we were on from our old hosting
company<00:00:53.449> the<00:00:54.449> traffic<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.050> were<00:00:55.170> getting

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
company the traffic that we were getting

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010 
company the traffic that we were getting
the<00:00:56.489> server<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.239> were<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.539> couldn't

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the server that we were on couldn't

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.349 
the server that we were on couldn't
handle<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:59.640> guess<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.059> could<00:01:00.180> say<00:01:00.329> that

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
handle it so I guess you could say that

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.479 
handle it so I guess you could say that
is<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> good<00:01:00.960> problem<00:01:01.199> because<00:01:01.949> we<00:01:02.100> are<00:01:02.250> getting

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
is a good problem because we are getting

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.740 
is a good problem because we are getting
bigger<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.090> website<00:01:04.909> but<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.299> hosting

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
bigger as a website but the hosting

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.899 
bigger as a website but the hosting
company<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.350> we<00:01:07.439> were<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.310> my<00:01:08.580> opinion

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
company that we were with in my opinion

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.359
