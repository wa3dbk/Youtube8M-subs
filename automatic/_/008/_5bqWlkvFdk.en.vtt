00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
unfortunately didn't really blend into a

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.950 
unfortunately didn't really blend into a
good<00:01:05.339> fight<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.610> believe<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.420> simply<00:01:06.840> Roy

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
good fight I believe that simply Roy

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.830 
good fight I believe that simply Roy
Jones<00:01:07.640> he<00:01:08.640> doesn't<00:01:08.940> like<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.149> hold<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.660> don't

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
Jones he doesn't like the hold I don't

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.090 
Jones he doesn't like the hold I don't
like<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> whole<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.560> think<00:01:10.770> it's<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.039> to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
like the whole and I think it's going to

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.669 
like the whole and I think it's going to
be<00:01:11.190> a<00:01:11.250> lot<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.670> fireworks<00:01:12.060> involved<00:01:15.590> don't<00:01:16.590> hit
