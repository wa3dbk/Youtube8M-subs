down<00:01:16.039> underneath<00:01:16.369> the<00:01:16.520> water<00:01:16.700> and<00:01:17.060> again

00:01:17.559 --> 00:01:17.569 
down underneath the water and again

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:19.359 
down underneath the water and again
remember<00:01:18.200> it's<00:01:18.319> not<00:01:18.529> going<00:01:18.799> to<00:01:18.889> change<00:01:19.189> the

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:28.399 
arrangements then on this side we'll

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:29.949 
arrangements then on this side we'll
come<00:01:28.609> over<00:01:28.759> here<00:01:29.119> you<00:01:29.240> can<00:01:29.420> see<00:01:29.539> I've<00:01:29.659> taken

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
come over here you can see I've taken

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:32.230 
come over here you can see I've taken
the<00:01:30.229> flat<00:01:30.469> wire<00:01:30.740> formed<00:01:31.639> it<00:01:31.729> into<00:01:31.969> a<00:01:31.999> sphere

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
the flat wire formed it into a sphere

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.239 
the flat wire formed it into a sphere
and<00:01:32.659> then<00:01:32.719> that<00:01:33.049> becomes<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.560> mechanics<00:01:34.039> for

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249 
and then that becomes the mechanics for

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:36.339 
and then that becomes the mechanics for
the<00:01:34.399> design<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.359> that's<00:01:35.749> our<00:01:35.899> flat<00:01:36.170> wire

00:01:36.339 --> 00:01:36.349 
the design so that's our flat wire

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:38.260 
the design so that's our flat wire
collection<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:37.219> hopefully<00:01:37.639> you're<00:01:37.789> using<00:01:38.149> it

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
collection and hopefully you're using it

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.690 
collection and hopefully you're using it
if<00:01:38.420> not<00:01:38.630> pick<00:01:38.899> some<00:01:39.139> up<00:01:39.259> today<00:01:39.590> moving<00:01:40.279> on<00:01:40.579> if
