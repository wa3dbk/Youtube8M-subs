 could I have my horse dolph ziggler in 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.570
 the company of the wwf 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.610
 I hope you like the video and it's from 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.930
 your liking with nothing more to say 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 let's start with this video 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.560
 all right 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.450
 as many will know dolph ziggler received 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.630
 a push on the part of the company going on 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.250
 for the year 2012 to 2013 won the briefcase 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.260
 of money in the bank at the event 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.420
 becoming the mister money inc 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.240
 of sale then in raw April 8, 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.130
 2014 he made his contract in the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.660
 Alberto's fight of the river against jack 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.060
 swagger in which Alberto left 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.160
 defending his bubble gum championship 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.590
 cashier came out as champion had a 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.930
 very short reign as champion lasted 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.820
 Little could only fight a few times 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.100
 taking your title at the entrance until 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.200
 who suffered a concussion cycler 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.390
 which made him injured so the 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.130
 company did not like that cic them out 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.140
 very easy to injure so the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.000
 company had made the decision to 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.250
 take away the title fighting against 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.470
 Alberto, which did not like at all 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.260
 ziggler crazed clay for anger in 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.390
 a ww interview said that in the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.520
 company gave almost no time for 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.620
 recover and that they do not know how to respect what 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.720
 which is to have a cerebral conclusion to 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.520
 the company will upset this so 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.590
 They decided to make him lose the title and 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.850
 from there do it and over losing in 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.920
 all your struggles 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.200
 being the biggest filling but something that 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.300
 always struck me is that everything 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.610
 this time that I have used it to see the 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.770
 public continues to support it as 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.110
 me since I say two years as a fan 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.790
 I'm going from dolph ziggler number one the 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.670
 roster in which I have my room 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.740
 full of good xp posters now I will go to 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.930
 the part of what I want to tell you 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.090
 company has been having plans to 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.740
 ziggler to give you a better push all 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.990
 this thanks to ziggler fans 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.910
 because if ziggler did not have those fans 

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:04.250
 who has always had the company not 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.990
 I would be making these decisions because 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.790
 the company wants to promote it because 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.250
 They know that Sigler is good for 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.380
 business know that Sigler is respected and 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.300
 loved by the fans and claire is one of 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.460
 those with the best-selling shirts 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.800
 that is the reason why they have 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.410
 been ascending but not with titles 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.980
 but with victories rivalries and good 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.780
 shows at the wwl event which does not 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.030
 it was broadcast on television and it was 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.340
 special only for those who attended the 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.050
 which was done in the city by voice per se 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.210
 gave the ziggler fight against the 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.740
 viper randy orton standing out as the 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.720
 great night combat for 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.030
 with a gold clasp in which ziggler 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.770
 got the victory that's a part of 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.720
 the way the company wants it 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.850
 push since randy is one of the 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.010
 big and expensive of the company for now 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.870
 what happens is that Ziggler beats x 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.940
 when cicler won he got to celebrate 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.520
 with the fans taking all the 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.830
 applause and the signs show bus hitler 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.780
 etcetera also wanted to put it in 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.030
 peace of ground to be as second 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.470
 place which made it stand out in being 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.230
 the best of all in that battle 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.240
 real since he himself counts because that 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.340
 cowardly pajero hid under the 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.440
 ring making a feud 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.090
 between them forming a fight to 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.970
 submersion for the intercontinental title 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.980
 With this news, I'm glad 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.390
 a lot because I have hope that 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.610
 fitch will be one of the 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.800
 champions of the company that give back 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.110
 the push and do not make it rain many 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.970
 rumored that the company would have possible 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.250
 plans for cycles to become 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.710
 new intercontinental champion though 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.720
 they are only rumors although I can believe 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.520
 in it maybe we can see cycler 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.100
 leave the sand summers slam with the 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.960
 intercontinental title on his waist I 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.100
 I wish you the best of luck 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.470
 of the world 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.110

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.090
 I will make a celebration party 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.070

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.740
