biggest<00:00:29.869> drawbacks<00:00:30.050> of<00:00:30.439> the<00:00:30.529> simulator<00:00:30.919> is

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
biggest drawbacks of the simulator is

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.980 
biggest drawbacks of the simulator is
that<00:00:31.189> it<00:00:31.279> doesn't<00:00:31.550> scale<00:00:32.060> the<00:00:32.300> image<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.870> the

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:32.990 
that it doesn't scale the image of the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.770 
that it doesn't scale the image of the
screen<00:00:33.350> to<00:00:33.980> fit<00:00:34.160> to<00:00:34.250> do<00:00:34.370> screen<00:00:34.780> obviously

screen to fit to do screen obviously

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.600 
screen to fit to do screen obviously
this<00:00:36.320> can<00:00:36.500> ruin<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.890> experience<00:00:37.190> or<00:00:37.430> some

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
this can ruin the experience or some

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.069 
this can ruin the experience or some
games<00:00:37.820> but<00:00:38.090> you<00:00:38.180> might<00:00:38.360> be<00:00:38.390> surprised<00:00:38.840> how

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
games but you might be surprised how

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.389 
games but you might be surprised how
well<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:39.410> can<00:00:39.500> adapt<00:00:39.829> for<00:00:40.039> sensation<00:00:42.399> luckily

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
well you can adapt for sensation luckily

sanic<00:00:59.269> this<00:00:59.449> comes<00:00:59.719> in<00:00:59.870> handy<00:00:59.899> because<00:01:00.350> you

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
sanic this comes in handy because you

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.220 
sanic this comes in handy because you
get<00:01:00.800> more<00:01:00.980> visibility<00:01:01.550> to<00:01:01.969> your<00:01:02.690> right<00:01:02.929> when

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
get more visibility to your right when

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.869 
get more visibility to your right when
you're<00:01:03.350> going<00:01:03.710> right<00:01:03.920> in<00:01:04.129> more<00:01:04.400> visibility<00:01:04.670> to

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
you're going right in more visibility to

you're going right in more visibility to
your<00:01:05.000> left<00:01:05.120> when<00:01:05.330> you<00:01:05.360> go<00:01:05.510> in<00:01:05.630> that<00:01:05.720> direction

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.920 

now<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.500> course<00:01:09.680> that<00:01:09.890> won't<00:01:10.660> benefit<00:01:11.660> every

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
now of course that won't benefit every

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.480 
now of course that won't benefit every
game<00:01:12.110> say<00:01:12.380> like<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.620> puzzle<00:01:12.800> game<00:01:13.070> where<00:01:13.400> you

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
game say like a puzzle game where you

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.210 
game say like a puzzle game where you
have<00:01:13.700> blocks<00:01:14.150> falling<00:01:14.710> you'll<00:01:15.710> probably<00:01:15.890> want

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:16.220 
have blocks falling you'll probably want

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.700 
have blocks falling you'll probably want
to<00:01:16.460> stay<00:01:16.880> in<00:01:16.970> a<00:01:17.030> fixed<00:01:17.300> position<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:18.380> you<00:01:18.500> plan

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
to stay in a fixed position so you plan

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.890 
to stay in a fixed position so you plan
to<00:01:18.740> turn<00:01:18.980> that<00:01:19.130> off<00:01:19.190> so<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.060> have<00:01:20.660> a<00:01:20.690> game

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
to turn that off so you have a game

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.210 
to turn that off so you have a game
where<00:01:21.050> it<00:01:21.140> has<00:01:21.260> a<00:01:21.290> fixed<00:01:21.590> position<00:01:24.100> you<00:01:25.100> can

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
where it has a fixed position you can

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.990 
where it has a fixed position you can
have<00:01:25.400> that<00:01:25.550> turned<00:01:25.790> off<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:26.650> you<00:01:27.650> can<00:01:27.860> use<00:01:28.000> the

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
have that turned off and you can use the

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.700 
have that turned off and you can use the
left<00:01:29.300> and<00:01:29.480> right<00:01:29.600> triggers<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:32.330> use<00:01:33.230> it<00:01:33.410> the

left and right triggers to use it the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.460 
left and right triggers to use it the
way<00:01:33.740> you<00:01:33.890> want<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.430> if<00:01:35.090> it's<00:01:35.330> if<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:36.170> pause

way you want and if it's if you pause

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.590 
way you want and if it's if you pause
the<00:01:36.650> screen<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.010> can<00:01:37.040> use<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:38.270> left<00:01:38.480> and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
the screen you can use the left and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.320 
the screen you can use the left and
right<00:01:38.690> on<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.050> d-pad<00:01:39.350> to<00:01:39.950> kind<00:01:40.310> of<00:01:40.400> position

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
right on the d-pad to kind of position

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.720 
right on the d-pad to kind of position
it<00:01:41.660> just<00:01:41.840> the<00:01:41.960> way<00:01:42.050> you<00:01:42.110> want<00:01:45.370> let<00:01:46.370> me<00:01:46.460> show<00:01:46.640> you

a couple other games that probably test

a couple other games that probably test
this<00:01:50.600> emulators<00:01:51.140> capabilities<00:01:51.950> look<00:01:52.100> more

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
this emulators capabilities look more

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.640 
this emulators capabilities look more
now<00:01:52.880> unfortunately<00:01:53.510> the<00:01:53.900> emulator<00:01:54.410> has<00:01:54.590> a

effects it is faster but like I said
there<00:04:55.490> is<00:04:55.520> trade-offs<00:04:56.030> so<00:04:56.710> sometimes<00:04:57.710> you

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
there is trade-offs so sometimes you
