00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
so the case itself is made of two

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.769 
so the case itself is made of two
portions<00:00:26.010> we<00:00:26.220> have<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.519> out<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:27.029> frame<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
portions we have this out of frame and

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.330 
portions we have this out of frame and
then<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:27.990> have<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> main<00:00:28.439> body<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.039> case
