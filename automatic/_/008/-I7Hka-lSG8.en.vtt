00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.830
 hello to all tom's hardware friends here 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.080
 at the mobile world congress we found 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.230
 a very interesting idea from sweden 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:23.110
 it's called power trek is a charger 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.950
 and a portable energy battery 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.020
 clean because it goes to hydrogen in practice 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.720
 it is used in the most extreme environments taken 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.060
 in the mountains and half desert places 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:37.660
 to the sea when you want to have a supply of 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.670
 energy can use this one device 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.489
 particular cartridge with sodium salts 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.450
 and very simple water there is an in 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.760
 function 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.680
 then who powertrekk in operation in 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.900
 right now use this type of 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.780
 cartridge that is salt and is one 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.270
 disposable cartridge in the tray a 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.950
 right a little water is inserted this 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.980
 cartridge is placed in the other tray 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.200
 and is able to generate 1200 milian 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.509
 for the device it has a battery 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.549
 however capacity and capacity of 1500 

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.189
 which can also be charged as normal 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.049
 portable battery the output is at a 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.000
 hotel in attention to load a 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.159
 iphone but does not charge us in an ipad for 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.020
 example a tablet with the existence of 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.210
 higher energy 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.920
 when you use the cartridge you can perform a 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.509
 whole code for charging 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.249
 directly to the exit 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:27.429
 or recharge the portable battery 

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:28.780
 is a very interesting idea and sold to 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.490
 a price that might seem 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.060
 the exorbitant because they are practically 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.130
 150 euros but could solve problems 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.170
 otherwise unsolvable because 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.329
 I imagined there is an extreme situation 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.009
 where electricity is completely 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.200
 inaccessible bring some of these 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.329
 recharges and manages to move forward 12 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.119
 phone calls or for more playful uses 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.920
 you can decide whether in a choice between life 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.289
 and death make the last phone call all 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.100
 last shot with the gopro is always one 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:56.140
 choice but 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.310
 question of choice then dear friends 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.060
 given it was completely 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.060
 see you next time
