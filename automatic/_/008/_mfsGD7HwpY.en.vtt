00:00:01.401 --> 00:00:08.642
In the case of the robot of the same size as man(1.7m).

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:16.083
Compared with the last time, theÿþ stability fell, but the speed increased.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:27.628
When you apply the setting of the man's walk to ZAKU (17.5m)...
I will solve this problem.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:34.034
When a robot walks, the falling in front and the support should be repeated.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:39.640
The investigation into the length of falling time for the large robots.

00:00:40.908 --> 00:00:47.814
Man (1.7m), ZAKU (17.5m), IDEON (105m) and MACROSS (1210m).

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:55.422
The bigger robots, the more time they requireÿþ for falling.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:01:02.963
The falling time was almost proportional to the square root of height.

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:10.370
They should be able to walk when theÿþ operating time is adjusted to the falling time.

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:19.546
Since ZAKU (17.5m) is 10 times larger than an adult man, I set the time of ZAKU's one step 3.16 times longer.

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:27.387
Although ZAKU needs longer time for taking a step, the length of one step is 10 times longer than the man's, thus ZAKU is 3.16 time quicker than a man.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.670
Since IDEON (105m) is 61.76 times larger than the man, I set theÿþ time of one step is 7.86 times longer than his.
DAITAN 3 (120m) and IRONGEAR (128.6m) will be similar to this.

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:21.510
MACROSS does not walk, yet let us suppose it walks.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:29.720
Since MACROSS (1210m) is 711.76 times larger than the man, I set the time of MACROSS' one step 26.68 times longer than his.
