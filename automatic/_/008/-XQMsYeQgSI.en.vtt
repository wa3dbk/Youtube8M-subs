this<00:00:03.629> is<00:00:03.780> an<00:00:03.899> empty<00:00:04.140> frame<00:00:04.380> and<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:04.799> need<00:00:04.950> to

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
this is an empty frame and we need to

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.350 
this is an empty frame and we need to
wire<00:00:05.220> it<00:00:05.490> I'm<00:00:06.089> Wall<00:00:06.629> Street<00:00:06.930> do<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:08.210> first<00:00:09.210> of

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
sometimes they're blocks with wax and

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.070 

permit<00:00:25.740> nice<00:00:26.039> and<00:00:26.340> steady

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:01:10.160 

stop

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.900 

okay<00:01:11.850> here<00:01:12.850> we<00:01:12.970> put<00:01:13.180> two<00:01:13.390> nails<00:01:17.760> in<00:01:18.760> the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
okay here we put two nails in the

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:27.090 
okay here we put two nails in the
direction<00:01:19.240> of<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.570> while<00:01:25.590> grab<00:01:26.590> the<00:01:26.770> tip<00:01:26.950> of

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
direction of the while grab the tip of

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.290 
direction of the while grab the tip of
the<00:01:27.190> wire<00:01:28.440> on<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.590> top<00:01:29.620> and<00:01:30.190> twist<00:01:30.820> it<00:01:31.180> around

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:31.300 
the wire on the top and twist it around

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:40.109 
the wire on the top and twist it around
a<00:01:34.080> few<00:01:35.080> times<00:01:38.340> if<00:01:39.340> there<00:01:39.580> is<00:01:39.670> an<00:01:39.760> excess<00:01:40.060> of

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
a few times if there is an excess of

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:52.940 
a few times if there is an excess of
wine<00:01:40.479> just<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:42.250> can<00:01:42.430> cut<00:01:42.670> it<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:47.530> let<00:01:47.740> down

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:07.530 

now<00:01:53.950> all<00:01:54.190> wire<00:01:54.460> needs<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.970> be<00:01:56.880> tight<00:02:06.540> tighten

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
now all wire needs to be tight tighten

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.850 
now all wire needs to be tight tighten
this<00:02:07.960> one<00:02:08.040> see<00:02:09.570> and<00:02:10.570> hold<00:02:11.700> loosen<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:12.790> up

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
this one see and hold loosen this up

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:24.030 
this one see and hold loosen this up
twist<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.010> wire<00:02:21.150> hold<00:02:22.150> there<00:02:22.920> loosen<00:02:23.920> this

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
twist the wire hold there loosen this

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:36.710 
twist the wire hold there loosen this
end

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.260 

now<00:02:37.720> when<00:02:37.870> you<00:02:37.930> get<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.140> here<00:02:38.470> pull<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:39.010> wire

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
now when you get to here pull the wire

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:47.330 
now when you get to here pull the wire
cut<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:41.010> twist<00:02:42.010> it<00:02:42.190> around<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.880> few<00:02:44.280> times<00:02:46.260> and

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
cut it twist it around a few times and

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.950 
cut it twist it around a few times and
funnel<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.640> done

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.090 

now<00:02:55.960> that<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.200> frames<00:02:56.440> are<00:02:56.620> we're<00:02:56.740> ever<00:02:56.950> going

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
now that the frames are we're ever going

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.340 
now that the frames are we're ever going
to<00:02:57.160> put<00:02:57.310> foundation<00:02:57.490> in<00:02:58.000> them<00:03:00.840> max<00:03:01.840> takes<00:03:02.170> his

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
to put foundation in them max takes his

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.710 
to put foundation in them max takes his
own<00:03:02.530> wax<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.190> sends<00:03:03.700> it<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.240> get<00:03:04.510> the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
own wax and sends it in to get the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.630 
own wax and sends it in to get the
foundation<00:03:05.350> made<00:03:05.890> in<00:03:06.210> 100%<00:03:07.210> beeswax

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
foundation made in 100% beeswax

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.370 
foundation made in 100% beeswax
so<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:11.650> frames<00:03:11.920> have<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.580> slot<00:03:13.570> in<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.110> bottom

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
so the frames have a slot in the bottom

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.970 
so the frames have a slot in the bottom
and<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.560> top<00:03:15.840> place<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.050> wax<00:03:19.530> just<00:03:20.530> inside

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
and the top place the wax just inside

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.250 
and the top place the wax just inside
the<00:03:21.130> slot<00:03:23.880> and<00:03:24.880> make<00:03:25.060> sure<00:03:25.270> it's<00:03:25.450> fitted<00:03:26.140> all

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
the slot and make sure it's fitted all

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.460 
the slot and make sure it's fitted all
the<00:03:26.350> way<00:03:26.440> down<00:03:26.680> into<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.190> slot<00:03:28.050> I'm<00:03:29.050> holding

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
the way down into the slot I'm holding

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.370 
the way down into the slot I'm holding
in<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.650> top<00:03:29.980> with<00:03:30.220> your<00:03:30.340> fingers<00:03:31.230> while<00:03:32.230> we

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
in the top with your fingers while we

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.380 
in the top with your fingers while we
place<00:03:32.590> it<00:03:32.770> on<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:32.980> block<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:36.430> block<00:03:36.670> is<00:03:36.940> just

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
place it on the block the block is just

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.120 
place it on the block the block is just
a<00:03:39.180> little<00:03:40.180> bit<00:03:40.270> smaller<00:03:40.600> than<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:41.020> frame<00:03:41.290> so

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
a little bit smaller than the frame so

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.280 
a little bit smaller than the frame so
it<00:03:42.250> pushes<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:42.760> wax<00:03:42.940> against<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.450> wires<00:03:46.290> the

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
it pushes the wax against the wires the

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.430 
it pushes the wax against the wires the
wire<00:03:47.500> fits<00:03:47.860> into<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.310> groove<00:03:48.550> here<00:03:49.080> in<00:03:50.080> the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
wire fits into the groove here in the

00:03:50.440 --> 00:04:09.370 
wire fits into the groove here in the
middle<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.740> the<00:03:50.830> wheel

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.130 

you<00:04:09.950> want<00:04:10.130> just<00:04:10.460> enough<00:04:10.700> pressure<00:04:10.990> not<00:04:11.990> too

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
you want just enough pressure not too

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.860 
you want just enough pressure not too
much<00:04:12.350> not<00:04:12.590> too<00:04:12.770> little<00:04:13.270> in<00:04:14.270> order<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.600> get<00:04:14.750> the

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
much not too little in order to get the

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.910 
much not too little in order to get the
wire<00:04:15.489> right<00:04:16.489> into<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:16.910> wax<00:04:17.650> and<00:04:18.650> now<00:04:18.860> the

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
wire right into the wax and now the

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.120 
wire right into the wax and now the
frame<00:04:19.250> is<00:04:19.489> ready<00:04:19.730> for<00:04:19.940> the<00:04:20.000> hive
