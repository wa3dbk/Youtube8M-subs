00:00:45.488 --> 00:00:54.659
[ Betrayed… by… my… order… ]

00:00:58.094 --> 00:01:06.623
[ Destroyed… by… Kel'Thuzad… ]

00:01:06.623 --> 00:01:16.872
Bow down! Kneel before the Ashbringer! A new dawn approaches, brothers and sisters! Our message will be delivered to the filth of this world through the chosen one!

00:01:10.124 --> 00:01:16.872
[ Made… to serve… ]

00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:33.266

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:34.706
You hold my father's blade.

00:02:34.706 --> 00:02:37.832
My soldiers are yours to control, my Lord.

00:02:37.832 --> 00:02:39.847
Take them… Lead them…

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:41.779
The impure must be purged.

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:44.047
They must be cleansed of their taint.

00:02:59.588 --> 00:03:01.845
Renault…

00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:06.337
Father… But… How?

00:03:06.337 --> 00:03:11.329
Did you think that your betrayal would be forgotten?

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.555
Lost in the carefully planned cover up of my death?

00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:23.103
Blood of my blood, the blade felt your cruelty long after my heart had stopped beating.

00:03:23.103 --> 00:03:27.103
And in death, I knew what you had done.

00:03:27.103 --> 00:03:32.403
But now, the chains of Kel'Thuzad hold me no more.

00:03:32.403 --> 00:03:34.978
I come to serve justice.

00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:39.031
I AM ASHBRINGER.

00:03:40.977 --> 00:03:45.032
Forgive me, father! Please…

00:03:50.536 --> 00:03:54.242
You are forgiven…
