boats and the three reasons were solar

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.840 
boats and the three reasons were solar
flares<00:00:20.680> which<00:00:21.010> would<00:00:21.190> wipe<00:00:21.580> out

people are going to build the grid out
more<00:00:39.070> I'm<00:00:39.790> going<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.059> build<00:00:40.210> the<00:00:40.420> net<00:00:40.600> out<00:00:40.780> more

there's pretty soon not going to be very
much<00:00:43.239> space<00:00:43.390> on<00:00:43.809> it<00:00:43.989> because<00:00:44.320> of<00:00:44.829> all<00:00:45.129> this

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
much space on it because of all this

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.250 
much space on it because of all this
famine<00:00:45.850> and<00:00:46.059> torn<00:00:46.629> to<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:49.570> the<00:00:49.719> percentage

famine and torn to the to the percentage
of<00:00:50.379> 95<00:00:50.980> I'm<00:00:51.309> told<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.989> I<00:00:53.050> was<00:00:53.200> very<00:00:53.260> crowded<00:00:53.890> out

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
of 95 I'm told so I was very crowded out

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.130 
of 95 I'm told so I was very crowded out
there<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:56.320> building<00:00:56.800> out<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.100> net<00:00:58.140> building

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
there so building out the net building

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.779 
there so building out the net building
up<00:00:59.289> the<00:00:59.469> grid<00:00:59.739> and<00:01:00.039> what<00:01:00.250> are<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:00.430> going<00:01:00.579> to<00:01:00.640> do

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
up the grid and what are you going to do

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.639 
up the grid and what are you going to do
but<00:01:01.000> the<00:01:01.120> solar<00:01:01.359> flares<00:01:01.750> well<00:01:02.020> I<00:01:02.050> guess<00:01:02.320> the

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
but the solar flares well I guess the

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.499 
but the solar flares well I guess the
lead<00:01:02.829> line<00:01:03.100> to<00:01:03.250> box<00:01:03.489> is<00:01:03.760> about<00:01:04.030> the<00:01:04.180> best<00:01:04.360> you

00:01:04.499 --> 00:01:04.509 
lead line to box is about the best you

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.760 
lead line to box is about the best you
can<00:01:04.720> do<00:01:05.399> all<00:01:06.399> of<00:01:06.460> these<00:01:06.820> things<00:01:07.380> point<00:01:08.380> out<00:01:08.560> the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
can do all of these things point out the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.520 
can do all of these things point out the
fact<00:01:09.010> that<00:01:09.479> electronic<00:01:10.479> storage<00:01:10.930> is<00:01:11.170> pretty

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
fact that electronic storage is pretty

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.250 
fact that electronic storage is pretty
fragile<00:01:12.330> we<00:01:13.330> want<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.780> keep<00:01:13.960> something

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
fragile we want to keep something

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.039 
fragile we want to keep something
permanently<00:01:15.130> you<00:01:15.909> should<00:01:16.119> probably<00:01:16.450> keep<00:01:16.990> it

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:17.049 
permanently you should probably keep it

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:19.440 
permanently you should probably keep it
in<00:01:17.320> paper<00:01:17.650> form<00:01:18.130> and<00:01:18.430> that<00:01:18.700> is<00:01:18.909> why<00:01:19.119> an

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
in paper form and that is why an

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.719 
in paper form and that is why an
e-version<00:01:19.990> of<00:01:20.020> your<00:01:20.500> will<00:01:20.710> is<00:01:20.950> not<00:01:21.130> acceptable

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
e-version of your will is not acceptable

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.420 
e-version of your will is not acceptable
other<00:01:22.720> reason<00:01:23.170> is<00:01:23.320> it's<00:01:23.530> very<00:01:23.590> hackable<00:01:24.159> and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
other reason is it's very hackable and

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.920 
other reason is it's very hackable and
portable<00:01:25.000> as<00:01:25.540> I<00:01:25.659> said<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.110> net<00:01:26.650> is<00:01:26.890> leaky<00:01:27.930> and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
portable as I said the net is leaky and

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.140 
portable as I said the net is leaky and
a<00:01:29.140> number<00:01:29.439> of<00:01:29.530> other<00:01:29.680> legal<00:01:30.280> documents<00:01:31.000> which

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
a number of other legal documents which

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.350 
a number of other legal documents which
of<00:01:31.299> course<00:01:31.329> drives<00:01:32.170> people<00:01:32.470> crazy<00:01:32.680> because

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
of course drives people crazy because

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.620 
of course drives people crazy because
those<00:01:34.360> paper<00:01:34.750> things<00:01:34.900> take<00:01:35.409> up<00:01:35.619> so<00:01:35.860> much<00:01:35.890> room

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
those paper things take up so much room

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.490 
those paper things take up so much room
so<00:01:37.630> it's<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.990> problem<00:01:38.740> facing<00:01:40.200> businesses<00:01:41.200> what

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
so it's a problem facing businesses what

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.319 
so it's a problem facing businesses what
to<00:01:41.650> do<00:01:41.770> with<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.009> paper<00:01:42.250> what<00:01:43.030> is<00:01:43.180> the

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:43.329 
to do with the paper what is the

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.170 
to do with the paper what is the
alternative<00:01:43.509> to<00:01:44.110> paper<00:01:44.470> when<00:01:45.340> can<00:01:45.610> he<00:01:45.640> use<00:01:45.939> a

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
alternative to paper when can he use a

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.440 
alternative to paper when can he use a
storage<00:01:47.079> etc<00:01:47.619> it's<00:01:48.430> also<00:01:48.670> a<00:01:48.850> problem<00:01:49.420> for

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
storage etc it's also a problem for

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.149 
storage etc it's also a problem for
people<00:01:49.689> for<00:01:50.290> instance<00:01:50.740> with<00:01:50.890> small

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
people for instance with small

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:52.830 
people for instance with small
apartments<00:01:51.850> who<00:01:51.939> like<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.210> read

where are they going to put all the
books<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:56.009> e-reader<00:01:57.009> gives<00:01:58.000> you<00:01:58.770> portability

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
books the e-reader gives you portability

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.630 
books the e-reader gives you portability

it gives you the possibility of having a

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.630 
it gives you the possibility of having a
whole<00:02:06.939> bunch<00:02:07.149> of<00:02:07.270> books<00:02:07.450> with<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.990> at<00:02:08.530> once<00:02:08.950> on

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
whole bunch of books with you at once on

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.420 
whole bunch of books with you at once on
this<00:02:10.000> little<00:02:10.329> device<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.830> for<00:02:12.040> that<00:02:12.129> it's<00:02:12.370> very

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
this little device so for that it's very

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.140 
this little device so for that it's very
very<00:02:12.879> handy<00:02:13.860> those<00:02:14.860> are<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.160> pluses

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
very handy those are the pluses

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.300 
very handy those are the pluses
and<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.690> personally<00:02:17.560> think<00:02:17.769> that<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.129> going
