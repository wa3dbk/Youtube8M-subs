so<00:06:32.610> it's<00:06:32.760> the<00:06:32.880> heal<00:06:33.060> trigger<00:06:33.240> so<00:06:33.960> that<00:06:34.080> was

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
so it's the heal trigger so that was

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.650 
so it's the heal trigger so that was
basically<00:06:34.200> what<00:06:34.950> you<00:06:35.100> get<00:06:35.430> overall<00:06:36.420> I<00:06:36.450> think

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
basically what you get overall I think

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.180 
basically what you get overall I think
it's<00:06:36.900> pretty<00:06:37.080> decent<00:06:37.620> value<00:06:39.620> at<00:06:40.620> the<00:06:40.680> box<00:06:41.010> is

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:41.190 
it's pretty decent value at the box is

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.950 
it's pretty decent value at the box is
what<00:06:41.370> i'll<00:06:41.490> be<00:06:41.580> making<00:06:41.730> you<00:06:42.090> so<00:06:42.330> as<00:06:42.630> well<00:06:42.810> as
