00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.970
 16 tors suddenly began 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.270
 unknown flying object that neither on the 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.000
 radar was still funk contact existed 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.640
 green were threatened by aliens 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.520
 the aliens at work are unlikely 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.859
 imagination but fact is something was 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.470
 there was no appearance of one 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.750
 some even police officers were watching 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.500
 Unknown flying object in the airspace over 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.780
 Bremen 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.450
 because after the ufo was spotted 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.190
 immediately started a consultant 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.410
 Police operation including helicopter 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.530
 but really what was discovered then 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.120
 you can not explain that, of course 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.680
 not then you would already have 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.550
 maybe a bit more and so far 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.190
 we are not that yet 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.590
 Investigations are still relatively early 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.030
 it is like that if someone for example 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.260
 sent up where we are now 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.760
 still do not know what it is and 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.710
 he has noticed then or now 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.270
 a helicopter and then will search 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.180
 he of course with his efforts there 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.800
 stop clearly lit up to it 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.890
 have the thing and then it has become 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.549
 moved from the airport to weser stadium 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.280
 over the dom 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.290
 but suddenly it was gone 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.060
 that someone drone in the flight room 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.770
 could have sent the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.770
 Airport security is unlikely 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.780
 So yesterday at the time what 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.970
 I would be quite windy in that respect 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.980
 want to exclude what is called 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.750
 but want to exclude a game time 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.910
 without which you can buy somewhere 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.980
 could that be for the winter 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.990
 could she have been able to fly me? 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.090
 a real alien thing 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.040
 everyone tries the ufo too 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.380
 At any rate, they were identifiable 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:51.130
 unsuccessful all the persecutions in the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.510
 wagon without result it is one 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.820
 normal situation we work off 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.930
 when the aliens come and an invasion 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.710
 then we threaten them 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.680
 certainly were 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.680
 Well that's kind of reassuring
