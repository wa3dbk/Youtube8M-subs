00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.039
 start - and has a son 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.489
 at least one dead comrade 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:14.579
 Of course we asked for a new drive here now 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.999
 our drive EHEC 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.140
 Of course, Piccard hopes is even closer 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.400
 but it is now 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.159
 in the properties 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:26.869
 as a fat32 system 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.839
 So enter exactly what we want 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.730
 so and now comes Dr Part who is responsible for data security 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.790
 So we do not let ourselves do any software or if we do that ourselves 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.230
 would 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.670
 Mark accrue 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.730
 Files and push them over it by hand 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.730
 Of course it now takes depending on how much data you have 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.960
 and if only they were capable of living because they did not even live 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.780
 her plate was so full 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.620
 and they could only be such one 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.850
 ten percent or 25 percent do not shovel as much as they do 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.290
 just need at least 50 percent 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.340
 Murray, they must now part or push them and the part they do 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:08.020
 could slide over the then will be deleted 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.390
 and then the thing with the release 2 0 what does that mean in the taz 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.110
 the subsystems or the plate on which the horror is currently the subject of the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.760
 is also made to look smaller and smaller 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 until she no longer needs to look around 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.770
 Worries are now at 7 70 percent so much data is that they are not 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.520
 So how should the Wars 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.650
 again 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.920
 back for cases in case of cases that now in the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.440
 Usually only to the file system against 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.050
 Here I have the plate again 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.710
 and here it can be, for example, in the system 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.660
 where are info mixing directory not enough 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.570
 I do not have the rights to that 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.290
 fat32 are interested in these rights but they should not be allowed to take part 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.250
 there can not be saved so I can now here in this 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.719
 Enter directory as normal 

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.749
 and here I see, for example, what is in the case of the cases 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:14.719
 I am concerned 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.829
 the whole drive will continue to be converted we offered again 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.939
 and instead of the Jeep Bartels 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.979
 hang so high 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:38.429
 Jeep is waiting back 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:42.029
 Tobias here too the score you have our data on the new record 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.479
 why then we really need only those in the taz partition completely too 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.069
 Clear 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.429
 our after defect 32 partition 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.819
 Again Right Mouse Rice Travel 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.699
 just as she just could just continue to be as I am that she is 

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:09.649
 at the data the end of the test run Lex now encounter it was in the test run 

00:03:09.649 --> 00:03:11.089
 have completely deleted 

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:12.559
 the garbage truck is 

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:15.209
 move left to the edge 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.119
 that was it now 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.119
 OK 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.679
 so Klose after the operation is completed 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:38.279
 and restart directly 

00:03:38.279 --> 00:03:42.559
 that was it synonymous with the conversion of n the test 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.599
 to fat 32 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:52.939
 reboot 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.939
 Let's start our file manager again 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.229
 look at the debate 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.229
 Tim Hoster Astra 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.860
 fat32 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.330
 all data still there 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.090
 just like before you at the beginning of the video 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.090
 So it worked without any problems 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:51.719
 Of course we are always just as pure as we are 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.400
 in the event that they are fat32 under Windows XP 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.560
 back we want the much easier so for the first time a step 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.550
 back 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.970
 And within seconds this has to be done on the one hand 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.559
 Disable hard disk or the disk that you want to convert 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:14.320
 that means no program is allowed to access it 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.910
 and if I say to myself I leave the contents of Ludwig the advertisements 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.090
 then the agency attacks the Romande on this hard disk 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.339
 I have my console and that's where I just want a bundle 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:30.870
 then the drive letter in this case is ideal 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.249
 colon 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:36.879
 and then Binder dash FT s for File System then again colon 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.270
 c FC St 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.879
 just a few clouds 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:45.879
 the whole well checked 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.790
 then keep the message directly 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.790
 the team convert occurs 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.819
 and the Wars already finished conversion 

00:05:56.819 --> 00:05:58.999
 that will be faster again 

00:05:58.999 --> 00:06:02.089
 but only the step of 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:05.089
 «Z 32» is oriented 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.669
 when the step 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:13.639
 Here it applies to declare as want to do then it is almost like that of us 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.650
 Solution shown is possibility 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.729
 that can be done for free otherwise just commercial software can do that too
