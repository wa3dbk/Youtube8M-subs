00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
guard the eggs and this thing you just

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.960 
guard the eggs and this thing you just
Clank<00:01:38.030> it<00:01:38.149> around<00:01:39.280> like<00:01:40.280> that<00:01:40.340> on<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.640> bed<00:01:40.759> and

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
they think this on fish so they eat this

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.460 
they think this on fish so they eat this
thing<00:01:43.190> up<00:01:43.509> sometimes<00:01:44.509> the<00:01:44.869> baths<00:01:45.050> won't<00:01:45.349> have

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
thing up sometimes the baths won't have

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.109 
thing up sometimes the baths won't have
a<00:01:45.500> big<00:01:45.679> enough<00:01:45.830> mouth<00:01:45.979> to<00:01:46.190> get<00:01:46.310> around<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.090> I

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
a big enough mouth to get around it so I

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.870 
a big enough mouth to get around it so I
cut<00:01:47.509> off<00:01:47.690> the<00:01:47.869> tail<00:01:48.080> but<00:01:48.740> right<00:01:48.920> here<00:01:48.950> but

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
cut off the tail but right here but

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.309 
cut off the tail but right here but
usually<00:01:50.030> if<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:50.509> have<00:01:50.539> a<00:01:50.660> bass<00:01:50.840> that's<00:01:51.110> small

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319 
usually if you have a bass that's small

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:52.270 
usually if you have a bass that's small
you<00:01:51.470> don't<00:01:51.590> want<00:01:51.709> to<00:01:51.770> catch<00:01:51.890> it<00:01:51.920> anyways

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
you don't want to catch it anyways

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.199 
you don't want to catch it anyways
because<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:52.580> won't<00:01:52.729> help<00:01:52.819> you<00:01:52.970> out<00:01:53.090> in<00:01:53.179> a

00:01:53.199 --> 00:01:53.209 
because it won't help you out in a

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:55.990 
because it won't help you out in a
