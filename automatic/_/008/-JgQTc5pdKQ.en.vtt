now<00:00:08.130> let's<00:00:08.340> discuss<00:00:08.639> question<00:00:09.330> number<00:00:09.599> 61

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
now let's discuss question number 61

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.570 
now let's discuss question number 61
which<00:00:12.090> group<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.660> animals<00:00:13.230> belong<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.400> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
which group of animals belong to the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.070 
which group of animals belong to the
same<00:00:14.849> phylum<00:00:15.529> now<00:00:16.529> here<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.160> options<00:00:17.640> are

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
same phylum now here the options are

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.890 
same phylum now here the options are
first<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.460> earthworm<00:00:20.460> that<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.539> generally

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
first one earthworm that is generally

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.769 
first one earthworm that is generally
the<00:00:22.050> pin<00:00:22.800> worm<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.730> in<00:00:23.910> ashqelon<00:00:24.420> teased

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
the pin worm that is in ashqelon teased

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.800 
the pin worm that is in ashqelon teased
or<00:00:25.080> nematoda<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.920> tapeworm<00:00:26.910> platyhelminthes

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
or nematoda and tapeworm platyhelminthes

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.349 
or nematoda and tapeworm platyhelminthes
so<00:00:28.439> these<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.890> three<00:00:29.189> different<00:00:29.220> phyla<00:00:30.029> so

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
so these are three different phyla so

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.170 
so these are three different phyla so
this<00:00:30.510> cannot<00:00:30.810> be<00:00:31.019> our<00:00:31.050> answer

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
this cannot be our answer

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.350 
this cannot be our answer
second<00:00:33.180> option<00:00:33.360> bron<00:00:34.430> scorpion<00:00:35.430> locust<00:00:36.120> ax

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
second option bron scorpion locust ax

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.709 
second option bron scorpion locust ax
all<00:00:36.660> three<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.530> them<00:00:37.890> belong<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.570> Arthropoda

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.880 
all three of them belong to Arthropoda
so<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.820> answer<00:00:42.410> let<00:00:43.410> us<00:00:43.559> see<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
so this is the answer let us see the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.020 
so this is the answer let us see the
other<00:00:44.010> options<00:00:44.520> as<00:00:44.730> well

those cells the sex of the fetus can

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.929 
those cells the sex of the fetus can
certainly<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.570> found<00:01:45.840> out<00:01:46.079> because<00:01:46.860> there<00:01:47.640> can

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
certainly be found out because there can

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.920 
certainly be found out because there can
be<00:01:47.970> either<00:01:48.180> xx<00:01:49.170> condition<00:01:49.710> or<00:01:50.299> XY<00:01:51.299> condition

be either xx condition or XY condition

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.780 
be either xx condition or XY condition
that<00:01:52.200> means<00:01:52.439> whether<00:01:52.770> it's<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.250> male<00:01:53.490> or<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
that means whether it's a male or a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.899 
that means whether it's a male or a
female<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.290> be<00:01:55.439> found<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:55.979> now<00:01:56.610> this

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
female that can be found out now this

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.899 
female that can be found out now this
has<00:01:57.750> been<00:01:58.140> banned<00:01:58.740> in<00:01:59.009> our<00:01:59.189> country<00:01:59.670> that's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
has been banned in our country that's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.749 
has been banned in our country that's
why<00:02:00.180> because<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.500> results<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.310> female

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
why because it results in female

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.730 
why because it results in female

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.969 
feticide Down syndrome is trisomy of 21
that<00:02:08.280> means<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.819> 21st<00:02:09.420> chromosome<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.319> having

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
that means the 21st chromosome is having

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.430 
that means the 21st chromosome is having
three<00:02:11.250> copies

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
three copies

jaundice

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.040 
jaundice
now<00:02:18.240> jaundice<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.640> not<00:02:20.640> affected<00:02:21.240> in<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.600> DNA

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
now jaundice is not affected in the DNA

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.250 
now jaundice is not affected in the DNA
of<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.320> cell<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:24.090> cannot<00:02:24.510> be<00:02:24.750> found<00:02:24.990> out

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
of the cell so this cannot be found out

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
of the cell so this cannot be found out
by<00:02:25.530> amniocentesis<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:27.420> fourth<00:02:27.690> option

Klinefelter<00:02:29.280> syndrome

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
Klinefelter syndrome

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.310 
Klinefelter syndrome
this<00:02:30.450> is<00:02:31.250> XXY<00:02:32.250> condition<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:33.390> means<00:02:33.630> the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
this is XXY condition that means the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.010 
this is XXY condition that means the
child<00:02:34.530> will<00:02:34.860> have<00:02:35.070> 47<00:02:35.850> chromosomes<00:02:36.240> where

child will have 47 chromosomes where
there<00:02:37.230> are<00:02:37.350> two<00:02:37.530> X<00:02:37.800> and<00:02:38.130> one<00:02:38.430> Y<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.420> only

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
there are two X and one Y so the only

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.670 
there are two X and one Y so the only
choice<00:02:40.050> here<00:02:40.560> is<00:02:41.450> jaundice<00:02:42.450> which<00:02:43.140> cannot<00:02:43.500> be

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
choice here is jaundice which cannot be

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.370 
choice here is jaundice which cannot be
detected<00:02:43.950> by<00:02:44.340> amnio<00:02:45.120> synthesis<00:02:45.750> so<00:02:46.260> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
detected by amnio synthesis so the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.550 
detected by amnio synthesis so the
answer<00:02:46.740> is<00:02:47.690> three<00:02:50.240> so<00:02:51.240> let's<00:02:51.270> move<00:02:51.690> on<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:52.200> next

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
answer is three so let's move on to next

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.120 
answer is three so let's move on to next

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:30.230 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.680 

right<00:04:31.230> so<00:04:31.950> these<00:04:32.130> are<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.370> two<00:04:32.760> important

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
right so these are the two important

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.470 
right so these are the two important
modifications<00:04:34.620> of<00:04:34.890> protein<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.760> lipids

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
modifications of protein and lipids

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.560 
modifications of protein and lipids
performed<00:04:37.320> by<00:04:37.530> the<00:04:37.590> Golgi<00:04:38.130> complex<00:04:38.390> so<00:04:39.390> now<00:04:39.510> we

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
performed by the Golgi complex so now we

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.230 
performed by the Golgi complex so now we
can<00:04:39.900> see<00:04:40.140> which<00:04:40.410> is<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.590> right<00:04:40.830> option

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
can see which is the right option

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.360 
can see which is the right option
associated<00:04:42.240> with<00:04:42.420> the<00:04:42.540> role<00:04:42.690> of<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:43.050> ecology

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
associated with the role of the ecology

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.730 
associated with the role of the ecology
so<00:04:44.370> amongst<00:04:44.910> these<00:04:45.210> now<00:04:45.600> the<00:04:45.660> right<00:04:45.960> option<00:04:46.560> is

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
so amongst these now the right option is

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.340 
so amongst these now the right option is
three<00:04:47.190> yes

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
three yes

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.360

glycosylation<00:04:51.210> of<00:04:51.810> Lepidus<00:04:52.500> done<00:04:52.860> so<00:04:53.490> it

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
glycosylation of Lepidus done so it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.900 
glycosylation of Lepidus done so it
means<00:04:53.880> for<00:04:54.270> the<00:04:54.420> question<00:04:54.930> number<00:04:55.320> 63<00:04:56.250> the

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
occurred so that will be occurring

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.390

so<00:06:14.880> the<00:06:15.000> site<00:06:15.210> itself<00:06:15.660> is<00:06:15.900> wrong<00:06:16.170> large

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:17.040 
so the site itself is wrong large

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.850 
so the site itself is wrong large
intestine<00:06:17.840> mainly<00:06:18.840> is<00:06:19.110> concerned<00:06:19.650> with

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
not maltose or cholesterol and then for

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.980 
not maltose or cholesterol and then for
choice<00:06:26.730> glycine<00:06:27.510> that<00:06:28.080> is<00:06:28.230> an<00:06:28.350> amino<00:06:28.590> acid<00:06:28.710> and

glucose absorbed in the small intestine
by<00:06:33.870> active<00:06:34.640> absorption<00:06:35.640> this<00:06:36.210> is<00:06:36.390> the<00:06:36.600> correct

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:36.990 
by active absorption this is the correct

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.200 
by active absorption this is the correct
choice<00:06:37.160> because<00:06:38.160> these<00:06:38.370> are<00:06:38.640> two<00:06:38.850> very

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:39.210 
choice because these are two very

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:40.590 
choice because these are two very
important<00:06:39.930> molecule

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
important molecule

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.590 
important molecule
which<00:06:41.200> are<00:06:41.380> absorbed<00:06:42.100> even<00:06:42.640> by<00:06:42.790> expenditure

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
which are absorbed even by expenditure

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:52.050 
which are absorbed even by expenditure
