00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
thing that i actually mucked up on this

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.389 
thing that i actually mucked up on this
because<00:02:06.899> i<00:02:07.380> released<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.829> source<00:02:08.099> without

because i released the source without

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.400 
because i released the source without
actually<00:02:09.060> because<00:02:09.810> i<00:02:09.869> had<00:02:10.020> on<00:02:10.110> my<00:02:10.170> VPS

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
actually because i had on my VPS

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.320 
actually because i had on my VPS
originally<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.220> then<00:02:11.370> i<00:02:11.610> just<00:02:11.849> gave<00:02:12.030> up<00:02:12.209> on

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
originally but then i just gave up on

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.800 
originally but then i just gave up on
that

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
that

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.320 
that
so<00:02:13.050> that<00:02:13.200> lost<00:02:13.590> all<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.010> currently<00:02:14.760> updated

players thing the other thing that it

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.520 
players thing the other thing that it

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
does and not many people know about this

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.620 
does and not many people know about this
is<00:03:19.739> if<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.220> use<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.579> on<00:03:20.670> itself<00:03:21.000> it<00:03:21.269> gives<00:03:21.480> you

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
is if you use it on itself it gives you

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.780 
is if you use it on itself it gives you
max<00:03:21.930> cash<00:03:22.230> which<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.280> kind<00:03:23.579> of<00:03:23.640> pointless

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
max cash which is kind of pointless

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.240 
max cash which is kind of pointless
since<00:03:24.209> your<00:03:24.450> admin<00:03:24.840> on<00:03:25.230> most<00:03:25.680> servers<00:03:25.920> the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
since your admin on most servers the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.920 
since your admin on most servers the
owners<00:03:26.579> which<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:26.910> race<00:03:27.090> 12<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.720> it's<00:03:27.840> the

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
owners which is race 12 so it's the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.410 
owners which is race 12 so it's the
highest<00:03:28.109> rights<00:03:28.470> can<00:03:28.799> just<00:03:29.010> do<00:03:29.160> item<00:03:29.489> 9<00:03:29.640> 95<00:03:30.060> and

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
highest rights can just do item 9 95 and

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.500 
highest rights can just do item 9 95 and
spawn<00:03:31.410> their<00:03:31.890> own<00:03:32.069> cash<00:03:32.400> if<00:03:32.819> they<00:03:33.030> want<00:03:33.209> it<00:03:33.359> so

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
spawn their own cash if they want it so

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.300 
spawn their own cash if they want it so
that's<00:03:34.290> pretty<00:03:34.470> much<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.650> anti<00:03:35.130> leech

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
that's pretty much the anti leech

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.680 
that's pretty much the anti leech
another<00:03:35.640> ng<00:03:35.940> leech<00:03:36.120> that's<00:03:36.930> not<00:03:37.350> really<00:03:37.890> too

item and the way to fix that would be to

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:54.349 
item and the way to fix that would be to
go<00:03:51.510> into<00:03:51.660> com<00:03:51.959> RS<00:03:52.500> net<00:03:52.889> decoders<00:03:53.579> then<00:03:54.239> in

go into com RS net decoders then in

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.629 
go into com RS net decoders then in

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
handlers and then an inventory options

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.039 
handlers and then an inventory options
handler<00:03:57.090> find<00:03:58.940> where<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.120> the<00:04:00.239> ad<00:04:00.389> search<00:04:00.840> for

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
something then it won't do anything

because the thing wouldn't be coded but
obviously<00:04:28.650> it's<00:04:28.830> already<00:04:29.130> coded<00:04:29.310> so<00:04:29.880> someone

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
obviously it's already coded so someone

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.120 
obviously it's already coded so someone
already<00:04:30.330> has<00:04:30.480> that<00:04:30.780> then<00:04:31.140> yeah<00:04:31.740> that's<00:04:31.980> kind

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130

left<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.800> in<00:04:52.920> there<00:04:53.130> so<00:04:53.520> if<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:53.880> went<00:04:54.090> on<00:04:54.180> servers

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
left it in there so if I went on servers

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.800 
left it in there so if I went on servers
I<00:04:54.900> would<00:04:55.290> be<00:04:55.410> able<00:04:55.500> to<00:04:55.650> get<00:04:55.890> over<00:04:56.430> myself<00:04:56.810> but

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
I would be able to get over myself but

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.070 
I would be able to get over myself but
then<00:04:58.050> obviously<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:59.460> don't<00:05:00.060> know<00:05:00.120> then<00:05:00.840> it<00:05:00.960> can

then obviously I don't know then it can

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.720 
then obviously I don't know then it can
be<00:05:01.170> abused<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:01.890> then<00:05:01.980> other<00:05:02.160> people<00:05:02.280> can<00:05:02.430> find

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
it and I don't know I just don't think

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.150 
it and I don't know I just don't think
that's<00:05:05.190> the<00:05:05.490> best<00:05:06.240> thing<00:05:06.480> to<00:05:06.660> do<00:05:06.810> while<00:05:07.620> I<00:05:07.650> have
