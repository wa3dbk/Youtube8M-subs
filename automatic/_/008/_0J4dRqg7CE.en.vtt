started by grabbing a big bag of
potatoes<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.890> washing<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> outside<00:00:26.400> so

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
potatoes and washing the outside so

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.240 
potatoes and washing the outside so
they're<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.359> nice<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.779> clean<00:00:28.050> now<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:28.980> need

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
they're all nice and clean now we need

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.589 
they're all nice and clean now we need
to<00:00:29.340> chop<00:00:29.550> these<00:00:29.730> up<00:00:29.939> into<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.269> smallest

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
to chop these up into the smallest

to chop these up into the smallest
pieces<00:00:30.990> possible<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:32.160> for<00:00:32.340> convenience<00:00:32.489> I'm

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
pieces possible so for convenience I'm

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.600 
pieces possible so for convenience I'm
using<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.540> food<00:00:33.750> processor<00:00:34.040> if<00:00:35.040> you<00:00:35.250> don't<00:00:35.430> have

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
using a food processor if you don't have

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.370 
using a food processor if you don't have
one<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:36.059> can<00:00:36.210> always<00:00:36.329> chop<00:00:36.719> your<00:00:36.899> potatoes

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
one you can always chop your potatoes

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.830 
one you can always chop your potatoes
with<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> knife<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.340> cutting<00:00:38.370> board<00:00:38.850> when

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
with a knife and a cutting board when

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.450 
with a knife and a cutting board when
you've<00:00:39.960> got<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.260> potatoes<00:00:40.710> reduced<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.219> tiny

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
you've got your potatoes reduced to tiny

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.880 
you've got your potatoes reduced to tiny
bits<00:00:41.550> slide<00:00:42.510> them<00:00:42.719> all<00:00:42.840> into<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.110> large<00:00:43.440> mixing

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
bits slide them all into a large mixing

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.860 
bits slide them all into a large mixing
bowl<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.430> pour<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:44.850> enough<00:00:44.940> hot<00:00:45.329> water<00:00:45.360> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
bowl and pour in enough hot water to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.170 
bowl and pour in enough hot water to
cover<00:00:46.050> them<00:00:46.289> completely<00:00:46.700> we'll<00:00:47.700> need<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.000> stir

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
cover them completely we'll need to stir

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.639 
cover them completely we'll need to stir
this<00:00:48.300> around<00:00:48.450> for<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.840> few<00:00:49.050> minutes<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.590> you

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
this around for a few minutes and you

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.260 
this around for a few minutes and you
may<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:49.980> noticed<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.460> water<00:00:50.640> turning<00:00:50.940> red

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
may have noticed the water turning red

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.689 
may have noticed the water turning red
and<00:00:51.600> that's<00:00:51.780> completely<00:00:52.289> normal<00:00:52.770> now<00:00:52.980> let's

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
and that's completely normal now let's

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.639 
and that's completely normal now let's
grab<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> strainer<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.750> another<00:00:55.079> large<00:00:55.320> bowl

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
grab a strainer and another large bowl

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.920 
grab a strainer and another large bowl
so<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.399> separate<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> potato<00:00:57.360> water<00:00:57.629> from

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
so we can separate the potato water from

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.930 
so we can separate the potato water from
the<00:00:58.020> chunks<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.739> watch<00:00:59.070> closely<00:00:59.489> as

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
the chunks and watch closely as

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.670 
the chunks and watch closely as
something<00:01:00.329> incredible<00:01:00.840> begins<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> happen

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
something incredible begins to happen

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.160 
something incredible begins to happen
after<00:01:02.579> about<00:01:02.789> 10<00:01:03.120> minutes<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.780> can<00:01:03.930> see<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
after about 10 minutes you can see a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.899 
after about 10 minutes you can see a
strange<00:01:04.650> white<00:01:04.920> layer<00:01:05.189> appears<00:01:05.670> at<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
strange white layer appears at the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.210 
strange white layer appears at the
bottom<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.420> bowl<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:07.500> if<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.740> try<00:01:07.890> pouring

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
bottom of the bowl now if we try pouring

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.980 
bottom of the bowl now if we try pouring
everything<00:01:08.580> out<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.689> new

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
everything out you can see this new

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.960 
everything out you can see this new
white<00:01:10.200> layer<00:01:10.500> amazingly<00:01:11.220> stays<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.880> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
white layer amazingly stays in the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.210 
white layer amazingly stays in the
bottom<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:13.049> goop<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.439> little<00:01:13.740> bit<00:01:13.830> dirty<00:01:14.010> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
bottom the goop is a little bit dirty so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.190 
bottom the goop is a little bit dirty so
to<00:01:14.549> clean<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:14.970> let's<00:01:15.240> mix<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> bit<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.960> fresh

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
to clean it let's mix in a bit of fresh

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.109 
to clean it let's mix in a bit of fresh
water<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.799> pour<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.220> into<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.520> tall<00:01:17.820> thin

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
water and pour it into a tall thin

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.050 
water and pour it into a tall thin
container<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> glass<00:01:19.350> or<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> jar<00:01:19.979> when<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
container like a glass or a jar when the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.670 
container like a glass or a jar when the
lid<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.509> tight<00:01:21.780> let's<00:01:22.049> just<00:01:22.259> shake<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.470> all

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
lid is on tight let's just shake it all

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.620 
lid is on tight let's just shake it all
up<00:01:22.710> again<00:01:22.950> then<00:01:23.430> let<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.640> sit<00:01:23.939> for<00:01:23.970> another<00:01:24.210> 10

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
up again then let it sit for another 10

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.080 
up again then let it sit for another 10
minutes<00:01:25.220> once<00:01:26.220> again<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.820> see<00:01:27.000> it

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
minutes once again you can see it

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.030 
minutes once again you can see it
separates<00:01:27.570> into<00:01:27.750> layers<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.770> time

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
separates into layers and this time

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.920 
separates into layers and this time
almost<00:01:29.310> all<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.790> impurities<00:01:30.119> are<00:01:30.509> collected

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
almost all the impurities are collected

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
almost all the impurities are collected
in<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.049> middle<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:32.100> check<00:01:32.400> this<00:01:32.579> out<00:01:32.820> if<00:01:33.119> we

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
in the middle now check this out if we

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.330 
in the middle now check this out if we
quickly<00:01:33.630> dump<00:01:33.960> out<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.140> water<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.829> takes<00:01:34.860> most

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
quickly dump out the water it takes most

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
quickly dump out the water it takes most
of<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> impurities<00:01:36.090> with<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.479> leaving<00:01:36.900> us

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
of the impurities with it leaving us

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.310 
of the impurities with it leaving us
with<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.380> very<00:01:37.619> clean<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.340> magical<00:01:39.000> substance

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
with a very clean and magical substance

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.899 
with a very clean and magical substance
it<00:01:40.320> kind<00:01:40.560> of<00:01:40.590> looks<00:01:40.770> like<00:01:40.950> milk<00:01:41.189> but<00:01:41.549> if<00:01:41.820> you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
it kind of looks like milk but if you

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.490
