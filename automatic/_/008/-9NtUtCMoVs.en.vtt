00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
because of that the thing is to do that

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.380 
because of that the thing is to do that
because<00:02:01.590> sometimes<00:02:02.400> it<00:02:02.550> can<00:02:02.580> drop<00:02:02.880> into<00:02:03.180> lava

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
because sometimes it can drop into lava

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.980 
because sometimes it can drop into lava
if<00:02:03.660> you're<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:03.990> careful<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:05.720> some<00:02:06.720> people

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
if you're not careful and some people

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.570 
if you're not careful and some people
are<00:02:07.080> really<00:02:07.110> lazy<00:02:07.470> I<00:02:07.710> know<00:02:07.830> but<00:02:08.220> it's<00:02:08.369> it

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
are really lazy I know but it's it

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.420 
are really lazy I know but it's it
really<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:09.149> useful<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.959> it<00:02:10.470> it<00:02:10.860> saves<00:02:11.250> you

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
really is useful and it it saves you

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.640 
really is useful and it it saves you
time<00:02:11.610> from<00:02:11.819> going<00:02:12.120> back<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.690> nether<00:02:13.290> over

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
time from going back to the nether over

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.949 
time from going back to the nether over
and<00:02:13.800> over<00:02:14.069> again<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.489> collect<00:02:14.760> closer<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.690> I

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
and over again to collect closer so I

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.280 
and over again to collect closer so I
think<00:02:16.080> all<00:02:16.670> overall<00:02:17.670> it<00:02:17.909> is<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.840> know<00:02:18.959> really

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
think all overall it is you know really

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.660 
think all overall it is you know really
good<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:20.690> you<00:02:21.690> know<00:02:21.810> try<00:02:22.500> try<00:02:22.800> it<00:02:22.860> if<00:02:23.220> you
