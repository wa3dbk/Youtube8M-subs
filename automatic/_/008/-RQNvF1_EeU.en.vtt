00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.959
 in 2004 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.209
 where we are no more and we are in this 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.849
 video to talk about all things 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.310
 that they will possibly add at 0.12 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.050
 so that being said let's start 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.480
 one of the things that are already 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.609
 confirmed is denying something that many 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.980
 of you have been waiting for this already 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.570
 I had confirmed it took several weeks 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.510
 before but he did not give us much information 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.519
 or anything from the version in which 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:36.040
 would add but here we can see that already 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.660
 we have the neder in the 0.2 are 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.850
 appearing some images so that 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.040
 see them in the video of the person who 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.809
 is playing a portal to the neder 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.059
 as we all do in the version of 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.100
 pc using obsidian and a lighter to 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:50.920
 learn something notorious is that at 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.570
 change of world load too fast 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.910
 in less than a second you can go and 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.829
 return without any problem what 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.719
 it seems it will be well optimized 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.000
 although that may vary according to 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.800
 device have also added to the 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.289
 sand of souls something that possibly 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.539
 is confirmed is the language we are 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.759
 seeing on screen is sincerely 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.500
 incredible the effect we have on the 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.310
 Trees that turn white 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.920
 good 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.780
 snow on top and we can also observe 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.630
 that the snow layers act with 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.240
 gravity like gravel or sand 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.289
 he is very cool for the love of god ' 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.659
 another one of the things that are already 

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:27.850
 confirmed are the potions with the 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.710
 addition to the neder and the effects of state 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.990
 there are no more obstacles to not add 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.789
 the potions now you can get all 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.189
 the effects by making the positions in 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.829
 the corner shelf and do all the 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.840
 thrown potions as drinkable all 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:42.640
 the positions of the PC edition 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.159
 will be in minecraft and that is 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.720
 pretty amazing and we will see how 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.179
 they work and all that the truth I am 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.700
 quite excited one of the things that 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.380
 is also confirmed is the bar 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.229
 hungry something that many have been 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.909
 waiting for a long time and something else 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.799
 that they also added was the button 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.110
 run and crouch we are 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.899
 seeing on the screen that was sincerely 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.880
 essential if they added the hunger bar and 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.799
 there we are seeing the bar of hunger 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.450
 will increase the difficulty of the game and 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.430
 will give more use to the variety of 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.920
 food that we have in minecraft and the 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.200
 it really scares pretty cool another of 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.120
 the things that is already confirmed is the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.370
 background experience we will be seeing 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.560
 or gameplay as if we have the bar 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.900
 experience in the video has not 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.610
 shown nothing has not been said nothing is not 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.340
 has confirmed nothing about the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.379
 enchantments but despite this the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.750
 experience can serve to repair 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.819
 the objects in the anvil that that 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.860
 let's see a little bit later another 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.870
 of things that are already confirmed 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.940
 are the anvils now with the experience 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.640
 could not miss the anvil that serves to 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.860
 repair tools or armor or to 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.870
 put enchantments through books or 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.000
 join two equal pieces to form 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.920
 a single one though in the gameplay that 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.170
 we're seeing deep down they do not speak 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.930
 nothing about enchantments or books 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.299
 delighted the anvil is already confirmed 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.239
 with its basic functions and we will see it 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:06.700
 in action possibly by the end of this 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.470
 month to see what if it's true not and 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.140
 well this has been the first part of 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.510
 everything confirmed for 0.12 tomorrow 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.010
