John the Baptist was the Prophet
immediately<00:02:15.410> before<00:02:15.650> Jesus<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.120> there's

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
immediately before Jesus and so there's

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.460 
immediately before Jesus and so there's
another<00:02:17.690> prophet<00:02:18.290> mentioned<00:02:18.470> and<00:02:20.350> John<00:02:21.350> the

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
Baptist said no I'm not that prophet so

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.130 
Baptist said no I'm not that prophet so
who<00:02:24.200> is<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.709> prophet<00:02:25.370> and<00:02:25.580> then<00:02:26.390> if<00:02:26.720> you<00:02:26.870> look
