00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.800
 guided for 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.990
 and move all the staff to the 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.840
 last floor of the building towards the 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.900
 terrace of the hall roof of the building 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.500
 where people could breathe 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.990
 quietly however good 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:34.160

 they told us how the chacao police 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.330
 stopped traffic so you're 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.160
 people will come to the front of the 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.860
 building and they will start doing the 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.530
 damage done by the mayor of chacao 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.320
 did not appear at any time 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.330
 he answered we tried to communicate with 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.840
 the mayor as the municipality's authority 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.690
 to support looking for some kind of 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.229
 solution was unsuccessful there was no way 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.929
 did not go to the site only the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.450
 National Guard police 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.850
 Bolivarian National Police Force 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.180
 capital district that were the ones 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.430
 they put out the fire and we allow between 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.439
 all work together to 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.019
 and evict the building so that 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:29.799
 It was a very dangerous situation 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.989
 very high risk and what it shows is the 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.909
 level of insanity the level of fascism the 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.269
 level of terrorism that is arriving 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:39.409
 these people I have no doubt what 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.900
 propelled by the party will 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.239
 popular a fascist party that was created 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.739
 precisely to start this 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.650
 onslaught of violence against 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.599
 Venezuelan society could enlighten us 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.579
 about the level of damage if you have 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.730
 made some estimate of how much they could 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.730
 reach and I would like you to need a 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.870

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.670
 teams the staff that works there 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.239
 there were people working there who 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.889
 could have been burned alive as well as 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.409
 dogs burn on barricades 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.959

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.400

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.620
 because the great mission housing venezuela 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.410
 good is a great team at a level 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.680
 national that works together but 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.630
 obviously life was put at risk 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.420
 all workers workers 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.950

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.200
 questions and we estimate it by 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.840
 now in the preliminary evaluation is going 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.060
 to need resources there equivalent to 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.330
 the construction of 190 homes for the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:16.760
 town is to say thanks to these 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.010
 terrorists let's stop serving 190 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.410
 families for having to repair the 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.940
 building that they damaged with their onslaught 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.770
 fascist today to finish could 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.100

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.940
 legal actions in view of the 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:36.480
 statement that you have made 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:38.730
 on the performance of the police 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:42.000
 municipality chacao good we are going to 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:46.360
 make the corresponding complaint and 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.820
 let's proceed before the prosecution 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.950

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.010
 activities and how they started and what 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.750
 I repeat the chacao police facilitated the 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.790
 access to these people so that 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.470
 they will arrive at the front of the 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.960
 housing ministry where the 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.840
 great mission housing venezuela already for 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.280
