probably a little short video after this
it<00:07:03.720> gives<00:07:03.960> them<00:07:04.080> do<00:07:04.169> a<00:07:04.199> little<00:07:04.320> bit<00:07:04.440> more

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 
it gives them do a little bit more

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.469 
it gives them do a little bit more
detail<00:07:05.070> a<00:07:05.100> little<00:07:05.340> bit<00:07:05.430> more<00:07:05.759> difficult<00:07:06.330> with
