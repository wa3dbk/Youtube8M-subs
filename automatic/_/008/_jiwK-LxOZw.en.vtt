00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
is to block my skin to remove any excess

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
is to block my skin to remove any excess
oil<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.079> apply<00:00:40.350> some<00:00:40.620> powder<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.309> my

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
oil and then apply some powder and my

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.520 
oil and then apply some powder and my
t-zone<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.570> important<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.110> remove<00:00:43.350> oil

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
t-zone it is important to remove oil

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.369 
t-zone it is important to remove oil
before<00:00:43.860> you<00:00:44.100> apply<00:00:44.309> powder<00:00:44.550> because<00:00:44.879> if<00:00:45.450> you

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
before you apply powder because if you

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.220 
before you apply powder because if you
don't<00:00:46.739> remove<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.780> basically<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:48.989> can

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
don't remove that basically you can

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.020 
don't remove that basically you can
apply<00:00:49.620> all<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> pattern<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.399> world<00:00:50.610> and

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
apply all the pattern in the world and

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.180 
apply all the pattern in the world and
that<00:00:51.690> oil<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.110> just<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> absorb<00:00:52.739> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
that oil is just going to absorb the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.500 
that oil is just going to absorb the
powder<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.520> then<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.820> shines<00:00:54.059> just<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
powder and then the shines just going to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.090 
powder and then the shines just going to
crop<00:00:54.719> back<00:00:54.899> up<00:00:55.050> again<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.620> it's<00:00:56.010> really

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
crop back up again so it's really

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.229 
crop back up again so it's really
important<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.550> remove<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.090> lot<00:00:57.180> of

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
important to remove that and a lot of

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.810 
important to remove that and a lot of
people<00:00:57.600> use<00:00:57.750> blotting<00:00:58.230> papers<00:00:58.559> now<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.070> think

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
people use blotting papers now I think

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.790 
people use blotting papers now I think
personally<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.359> those<00:01:00.809> can<00:01:01.170> be<00:01:01.199> kind<00:01:01.680> of

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
personally that those can be kind of

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.830 
personally that those can be kind of
overpriced<00:01:02.370> especially<00:01:03.030> since<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.449> they<00:01:03.629> are

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
overpriced especially since all they are

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.469 
overpriced especially since all they are
is<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.589> rice<00:01:05.040> paper<00:01:05.369> type<00:01:05.760> material<00:01:06.270> that

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
is like a rice paper type material that

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.080 
is like a rice paper type material that
absorbs<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.990> oil<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.439> your<00:01:07.560> face<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.549> don't

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
absorbs the oil on your face so I don't

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.399 
absorbs the oil on your face so I don't
really<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.540> point<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:09.930> spending<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.290> ton

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
really see the point in spending a ton

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.320 
really see the point in spending a ton
of<00:01:10.470> money<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.770> them<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.280> know<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.000> cleaning

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
of money on them I know the cleaning

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.280 
of money on them I know the cleaning
clear<00:01:12.510> ones<00:01:12.750> are<00:01:12.960> kind<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.260> those<00:01:13.439> blue<00:01:13.770> I

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
clear ones are kind of those blue I

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.780 
clear ones are kind of those blue I
don't<00:01:16.290> know<00:01:16.350> blue<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.369> they're<00:01:17.580> different

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790
