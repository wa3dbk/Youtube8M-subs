00:00:01.769 --> 00:00:08.189
 9 a month I think is outside was a lot better the veterans invariably 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.749
 called the municipality to help him 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.969
 not waiting on time traveling alcohol wrong 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.969
 hope she still comes the sign with spain 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.589
 bring it on 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.240
 I'm looking forward to more 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.950
 the 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.840
 fine but then below 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.240
 now was good 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.860
 trade and walk and you know that was a bite to eat 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.010
 are two 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.120
 now a year later 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.560
 in addition, it is a nice look it is no longer fun you think for this 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.560
 then follow but a spokesperson reported 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.110
 there must be a little better 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.360
 of course 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.360
 becomes interesting 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.470
 sleep at the same time 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.450
 we are real 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 also supports 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.590
 the city with the most who sits 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.590
 except when it comes to conquering the nuclear power plant 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.120
 Yes, that depends on being able to find a solution 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.120
 is that so travel agency 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.889
 Congo 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.989
 mayor unicorn 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.119
 the first place 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:55.689
 i find 4 

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.909
 the next round 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:05.059
 is it over 

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:20.309
 it is a shame 

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:22.529
 that was a success 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.529
 next to the family 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:34.969
 we're going to make it 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.969
 to the guests 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:56.759
 the greatest chance of karst t 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:01.539
 He still suffers from understeer stance when we are not 

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:07.789
 it's not like that 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.650
 he insists 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.050
 only if the lighting along that says trade unionist 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.699
 come on of course sometimes seen 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:30.639
 see if you have succeeded but I think it is the perpetrators 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.400
 I have myself too 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:36.289
 this site 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.289
 I have been wrong 

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.620
 the first from the neighborhood 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.240
 I did not have time 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.070
 Belarus 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.259
 the safety authorities 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.379
 let alone 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.629
 but I am satisfied 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:05.680
 Jesus Christ 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.219
 Utrecht and Amsterdam 

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:10.219
 you always get nothing and cycling is a certification system 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:13.509
 you get my first time heavier 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.139
 3 I still don't think justice is a financial injection 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:18.490
 see 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.000
 the bike to detroit
