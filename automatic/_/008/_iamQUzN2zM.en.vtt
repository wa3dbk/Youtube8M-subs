00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 
to be wiped out well as I suggested

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.519 
to be wiped out well as I suggested
first<00:00:28.490> about<00:00:28.730> 30<00:00:29.060> years<00:00:29.330> ago<00:00:29.570> and<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.380> most

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
first about 30 years ago and the most

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.799 
first about 30 years ago and the most
likely<00:00:30.920> explanation<00:00:30.949> is<00:00:31.910> that<00:00:32.059> a<00:00:32.269> very<00:00:32.750> large

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
likely explanation is that a very large

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.619 
likely explanation is that a very large
asteroid<00:00:33.590> hit<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.190> earth<00:00:34.400> and<00:00:34.820> dramatically

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
asteroid hit the earth and dramatically

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.389 
asteroid hit the earth and dramatically
changed<00:00:36.170> the<00:00:36.320> environment<00:00:36.410> that<00:00:37.040> are<00:00:37.190> dying

clay layer of ejecting material can you

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.810 
clay layer of ejecting material can you
explain<00:01:06.050> what<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.470> different<00:01:06.920> colors<00:01:07.399> in<00:01:07.670> the

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
explain what the different colors in the

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.210 
explain what the different colors in the
animation<00:01:08.149> tell<00:01:08.509> us<00:01:08.690> yeah<00:01:09.349> so<00:01:09.679> you<00:01:09.770> can<00:01:10.099> you

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
animation tell us yeah so you can you

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.870 
animation tell us yeah so you can you
can<00:01:10.340> see<00:01:10.459> the<00:01:10.550> background<00:01:10.789> color<00:01:11.509> is<00:01:11.990> blue<00:01:12.470> and

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
can see the background color is blue and

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.669 
can see the background color is blue and

telling you the density of the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.050 
telling you the density of the
atmosphere<00:01:18.470> so<00:01:19.099> you<00:01:19.160> can<00:01:19.310> see<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.640> atmosphere

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
atmosphere so you can see the atmosphere

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.089 
atmosphere so you can see the atmosphere
is<00:01:20.119> getting<00:01:20.390> denser<00:01:20.780> as<00:01:21.110> you<00:01:21.289> get<00:01:21.619> closer<00:01:21.890> to

00:01:22.089 --> 00:01:22.099 
is getting denser as you get closer to

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:23.770 
is getting denser as you get closer to
the<00:01:22.220> Earth's<00:01:22.369> surface<00:01:22.550> and<00:01:23.270> then<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.539> see<00:01:23.720> the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
the Earth's surface and then you see the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.960 
the Earth's surface and then you see the
subjective<00:01:24.500> particles<00:01:25.009> arriving<00:01:25.550> at<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.729> top

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
subjective particles arriving at the top

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.639 
subjective particles arriving at the top
of<00:01:26.000> the<00:01:26.149> atmosphere<00:01:26.300> and<00:01:26.959> you're<00:01:27.530> watching

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
of the atmosphere and you're watching

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.230 
of the atmosphere and you're watching
how<00:01:28.009> they<00:01:28.160> travel<00:01:28.789> through<00:01:28.819> the<00:01:29.119> atmosphere

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
how they travel through the atmosphere

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.870 
how they travel through the atmosphere
and<00:01:29.929> then<00:01:30.530> eventually<00:01:30.770> land<00:01:31.280> on<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.849> earth

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
and then eventually land on the earth

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.999 
and then eventually land on the earth
surface<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.750> we<00:01:33.050> chose<00:01:33.229> three<00:01:33.619> different

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:34.009 
surface and we chose three different

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.460 
surface and we chose three different
particle<00:01:34.670> sizes<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.509> you<00:01:35.569> see<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:36.200> three

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
particle sizes so you see the three

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.350 
particle sizes so you see the three
colors<00:01:36.709> the<00:01:37.099> yellow<00:01:37.399> is<00:01:37.429> reference<00:01:38.149> the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
colors the yellow is reference the

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.870 
colors the yellow is reference the
largest<00:01:38.780> particles<00:01:39.319> and<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:40.160> red<00:01:40.610> the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
largest particles and the red the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.639 
largest particles and the red the
smallest<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:41.959> can<00:01:42.110> see<00:01:42.229> the<00:01:42.259> large

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
smallest and you can see the large

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.339 
smallest and you can see the large
largest<00:01:43.429> particle<00:01:43.759> traveled<00:01:44.420> through<00:01:44.720> very

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.349 
largest particle traveled through very

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:48.100 
largest particle traveled through very
swiftly<00:01:45.920> whereas<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:46.910> smaller<00:01:47.509> particles

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
swiftly whereas the smaller particles

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.410 
swiftly whereas the smaller particles
take<00:01:48.349> a<00:01:48.380> long<00:01:48.619> time<00:01:49.009> and<00:01:49.369> they're<00:01:49.880> essentially

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
take a long time and they're essentially

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.020 
take a long time and they're essentially
being<00:01:50.780> redistributed<00:01:51.319> by<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:52.069> atmosphere

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
being redistributed by the atmosphere

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.449 
being redistributed by the atmosphere
heating<00:01:53.509> up<00:01:53.630> as<00:01:53.899> the<00:01:54.170> ejector<00:01:54.679> is<00:01:54.800> closed<00:01:55.190> in

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
particles end that way outside the model

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.160 
particles end that way outside the model
if<00:02:04.610> we<00:02:04.759> could<00:02:04.910> take<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.119> satellite<00:02:05.629> image<00:02:06.020> at

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
if we could take a satellite image at

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.469 
if we could take a satellite image at
the<00:02:06.200> time<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:06.770> this<00:02:06.920> impact<00:02:07.459> what<00:02:08.179> would<00:02:08.330> we

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
the time of this impact what would we

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.630 
the time of this impact what would we
see<00:02:08.660> happening<00:02:08.869> to<00:02:09.259> Earth's<00:02:09.440> atmosphere<00:02:10.129> if

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
see happening to Earth's atmosphere if

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.550 
see happening to Earth's atmosphere if
you<00:02:10.789> take<00:02:11.239> a<00:02:11.270> photograph<00:02:11.629> through<00:02:12.170> sitting<00:02:12.470> on

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
you take a photograph through sitting on

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.830 
you take a photograph through sitting on
the<00:02:12.620> satellite<00:02:12.860> what<00:02:13.520> we<00:02:13.640> would<00:02:13.790> see<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:14.540> the

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
the satellite what we would see is the

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.840 
the satellite what we would see is the
earth<00:02:14.960> gradually<00:02:15.620> becoming<00:02:16.130> enveloped<00:02:16.640> in<00:02:16.760> a

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
earth gradually becoming enveloped in a

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.150 
earth gradually becoming enveloped in a
dust<00:02:17.090> cloud

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
dust cloud

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.290 
dust cloud
and<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.430> would<00:02:18.580> it'll<00:02:18.910> be<00:02:19.030> absolutely

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
and that would it'll be absolutely

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.020 
and that would it'll be absolutely
totally<00:02:19.960> envelops<00:02:20.590> probably<00:02:21.190> by<00:02:21.370> about<00:02:21.670> two

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
totally envelops probably by about two

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.730 
totally envelops probably by about two
hours<00:02:22.210> after<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.720> impact<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.320> what<00:02:23.620> would

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
hours after the impact and what would

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.350 
hours after the impact and what would
this<00:02:23.890> dust<00:02:24.220> cloud<00:02:24.550> have<00:02:24.790> done<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.240> the

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
this dust cloud have done to the

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.510 
this dust cloud have done to the
environment<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:26.350> the<00:02:26.440> dust<00:02:26.590> cloud<00:02:26.710> and<00:02:27.400> in

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
environment so the dust cloud and in

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.700 
environment so the dust cloud and in
fact<00:02:27.730> also<00:02:27.940> sulfur<00:02:28.780> being<00:02:29.140> released<00:02:29.410> by<00:02:29.680> the

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
fact also sulfur being released by the

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.540 
fact also sulfur being released by the
impact<00:02:30.190> from<00:02:30.510> sediment<00:02:31.510> for<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.780> impact<00:02:32.140> site

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
impact from sediment for the impact site

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.640 
impact from sediment for the impact site
they<00:02:33.550> would<00:02:33.880> reflect<00:02:34.210> more<00:02:34.810> solar<00:02:35.200> energy

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
they would reflect more solar energy

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.250 
they would reflect more solar energy
from<00:02:36.040> the<00:02:36.640> upper<00:02:36.850> atmosphere<00:02:36.970> out<00:02:37.690> into<00:02:38.110> space

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
from the upper atmosphere out into space

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.110 
from the upper atmosphere out into space
so<00:02:38.800> what<00:02:38.950> you<00:02:39.070> get<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.400> fact<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:39.760> actually<00:02:40.060> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
so what you get is fact is actually the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.940 
so what you get is fact is actually the
upper<00:02:40.330> atmosphere<00:02:40.450> heating<00:02:41.200> up<00:02:41.320> but<00:02:41.650> you<00:02:41.800> get

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
upper atmosphere heating up but you get

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.490 
upper atmosphere heating up but you get
the<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:43.120> earth<00:02:43.210> surface<00:02:43.570> will<00:02:43.990> dramatically

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
the the earth surface will dramatically

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.410 
the the earth surface will dramatically
cool<00:02:45.010> so<00:02:45.370> you'd<00:02:45.520> get<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.880> at<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.330> earth

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
cool so you'd get you at the earth

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.970 
cool so you'd get you at the earth
surface<00:02:46.630> you'd<00:02:46.990> see<00:02:47.200> everything<00:02:47.560> get<00:02:47.710> dark

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
surface you'd see everything get dark

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.700 
surface you'd see everything get dark
and<00:02:48.220> we<00:02:48.550> go<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.150> get<00:02:49.270> very<00:02:49.450> cold<00:02:49.750> how<00:02:50.410> did<00:02:50.590> this

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
and we go to get very cold how did this

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.100 
and we go to get very cold how did this
event<00:02:50.920> change<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.610> course<00:02:51.850> of<00:02:52.000> history<00:02:52.150> well

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
event change the course of history well

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.770 
event change the course of history well
prior<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.920> this<00:02:54.220> impact<00:02:54.430> we've<00:02:55.030> heard<00:02:55.210> the<00:02:55.690> age

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
prior to this impact we've heard the age

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.180 
prior to this impact we've heard the age
of<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.020> dinosaurs<00:02:56.200> for<00:02:56.860> a<00:02:56.920> few<00:02:57.100> hundred

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
of the dinosaurs for a few hundred

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.430 
of the dinosaurs for a few hundred
million<00:02:57.490> years<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:58.090> large<00:02:58.330> animals<00:02:59.230> were

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
million years the large animals were

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.920 
million years the large animals were
essentially<00:02:59.800> in<00:03:00.010> charge<00:03:00.400> on<00:03:00.730> land<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.240> after

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
essentially in charge on land and after

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.170 
essentially in charge on land and after
the<00:03:02.020> impact<00:03:02.320> everything<00:03:02.890> with<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.580> body<00:03:04.060> mass

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
the impact everything with a body mass

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.930 
the impact everything with a body mass
over<00:03:04.690> about<00:03:04.930> 25<00:03:05.560> kilograms<00:03:06.010> was<00:03:06.430> wiped<00:03:06.670> out

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
over about 25 kilograms was wiped out

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.020 
over about 25 kilograms was wiped out
and<00:03:07.300> we<00:03:07.480> saw<00:03:07.930> that<00:03:08.380> smaller<00:03:08.830> animals<00:03:09.520> started

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
and we saw that smaller animals started

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:12.600 
and we saw that smaller animals started
to<00:03:10.210> flourish<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.590> like<00:03:12.100> mammals

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
to flourish and that like mammals

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.490 
to flourish and that like mammals
particularly<00:03:13.300> started<00:03:13.630> to<00:03:13.720> flourish<00:03:13.960> so<00:03:14.410> it

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
particularly started to flourish so it

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.960 
particularly started to flourish so it
changed<00:03:14.830> the<00:03:14.860> course<00:03:15.100> of<00:03:15.220> evolution<00:03:15.460> and

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
changed the course of evolution and

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.660 
changed the course of evolution and
eventually<00:03:16.780> those<00:03:17.140> mammals<00:03:17.590> evolved<00:03:18.280> into

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
eventually those mammals evolved into

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.090 
eventually those mammals evolved into
humans
