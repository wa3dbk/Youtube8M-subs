of a down slope towards the shelf

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.320 
of a down slope towards the shelf
because<00:02:17.950> anything<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.489> put<00:02:18.760> on<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.970> shelf<00:02:19.239> is

because anything you put on the shelf is

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.080 
because anything you put on the shelf is
gonna<00:02:19.480> be<00:02:19.569> pulling<00:02:19.900> down<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.680> course<00:02:21.090> against

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
gonna be pulling down of course against

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.449 
gonna be pulling down of course against
the<00:02:22.180> strap<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.560> little<00:02:23.890> bit<00:02:24.040> of<00:02:24.099> a<00:02:24.250> down

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
the strap so a little bit of a down

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:26.790 
the strap so a little bit of a down
angle<00:02:24.760> coming<00:02:25.120> off<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.480> tree<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.110> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.250 
angle coming off the tree to the the
shelf<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.459> what<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.760> want<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.690> really<00:02:29.080> that
