00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello again to you again max 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.160
 repair and design 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.490
 so I finished work on replacing the case 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:15.120
 and display on this black iphone 5 on 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:17.850
 which the display was broken and the client so 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.609
 he asked me to change the body he chose 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.010
 gold color case classic 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.789
 gold color is not a mirror case 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.660
 This is an ordinary colored case with excellent 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.550
 about paint 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:35.969
 with all the logo inscriptions and how are you 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.640
 see the result is just great on 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.430
 in fact, I have already put such a body 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.610
 last September alone to one 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.160
 I have a short client there too 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.399
 video short video on youtube you 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.289
 You can see more here. 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.280
 one result for replacing the case but 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.829
 here I also added a home button 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.489
 iphone 5 style with gold chrome 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.010
 ring unfortunately ring painted 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.650
 A little bit lighter and does not match 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.890
 a bit of body color in paint color 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.200
 corps but i'm okay customer 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.240
 said that if he doesn't like that 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.850
 the color of the ring I can give him 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.580
 classic black home style button 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.830
 iphone 5s with a black ring where will 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.590
 the ring is merged and the button is merged with 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.170
 display and not stand out i think 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.600
 the overall result is very good 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.280
 iphone has got a new look it is very 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:37.650
 beautiful now in quality I think you 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.380
 You already understand everything and you know what 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.640
 these bodies of excellent quality are important 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.530
 Do not stint if you want to buy them yourself and 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.040
 put or buy bring let in 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.750
 repairman or all times medical center 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.119
 spent better more money on the hull 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.350
 buy more expensive and where the quality of the case 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:02.850
 will be appropriate to its price yet 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.620
 I want to say a little detail of course 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.110
 price 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.010
 by itself not at cost price at 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.180
 this body 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:14.340
 well, even not correctly say 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.440
 the person wants to go to replace the case not 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.910
 because this job is expensive 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.840
 because many iphone 5 owners 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.240
 5s 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.940
 such an attitude to the colored case 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.190
 slightly negative what is the reason 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.990
 many believe that the iphone is starting 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.600
 look as unoriginal as not 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.900
 real like some kind of chinese copy 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.390
 you know here I am not separated I do not 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.820
 I will impose anything on anyone and argue 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.940
 that's purely 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.830
 this is a personal preference of each person 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.740
 someone wants iphone to look like 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:54.000
 a little differently different so he 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.300
 didn't look like all black all white 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.060
 like everyone bought in a store with 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.320
 other side I also support 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.190
 users of black and white owners 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.950
 iphone 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.980
 really apple well done in this regard 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.680
 that two colors have chosen but now still on 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.220
 five with they chose champagne gold color 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.989
 also nice nice and support them 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.380
 owners because there are classics 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.150
 classic she is beautiful she will always be 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.489
 please the eye and 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.860
 really many colored hulls aren't 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.280
 i like her so much i'm fine 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.800
 I understand everyone absolutely so you 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.989
 understand me too i'm not just like that 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.660
 I order no colored body 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.390
 forcing on my part no customers 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.930
 everything goes absolutely and on the initiative 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.690
 the client according to his will wants us coming 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.880
 change for color doesn't want sake of god i'm 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.580
 I'll put the same black white which 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.540
 said before that absolutely 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.390
 you repeat it again 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.360
 preferences of each iphone owner 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.310
 but I order the corps again say 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.530
 not just so i want people to have 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.330
 the choice is to be an alternative to 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.720
 everyone could choose 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:12.970
 what does he want if again I will be taking 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.920
 only black white classic colors and 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.980
 man will have no choice but once again 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.790
 it will be a minus for me and let it be better 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.980
 there will be a choice than it will not be well on it 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.000
 probably still showing you again 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.680
 the finished result switch button 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.610
 minus plus switch buttons 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.590
 silent mode all gaskets 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.480
 were perry set with black five 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:44.090
 headphone jack lightning connector 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:50.030
