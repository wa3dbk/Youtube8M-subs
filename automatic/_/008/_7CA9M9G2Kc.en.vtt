00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:15.219
 the winner of the first prize 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:19.990
 tractor year with the test 245 and 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:21.850
 tractors tl 75e 7 205 a new holland and 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.520
 participates in another edition of the contest 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.270
 which seeks to choose the tractor with 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.270
 technical performance 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.309
 know the five models of tractors new 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.000
 holland who compete for the grand prize 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.110
 in different categories 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.820
 this tractor that brings as great 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.590
 feature your torque reserve 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.440
 of the engine providing the largest economy 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.579
 and operational income combined with 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.770
 this also a 16 by 85 transmission 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.660
 organized with the hydraulic reverser and 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:54.910
 power that provides an improvement 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.550
 operation poor cultor and also the best 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.290
 during their work together 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.149
 This is a tractor that is complete with 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.460
 pre-arranged precision agriculture of 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.469
 factory and also offers how the system 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.329
 hydraulics to a planter valve that 

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.329
 work with pneumatic planters 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:20.190
 he can have 340 horsepower nominally reaches 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:24.150
 385 is with the touch reserve is a tractor 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.440
 which may have as an option agriculture 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.760
 on- board precision 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.380
 he works by pulling big 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.720
 planters then 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.090
 Let's concentrate how many of them 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.490
 we have 15 different types of coupling 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.220
 that product is the coupling 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.840
 fast hydraulic system that frees all 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.780
 the hydraulic system of the machine despite 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.300
 to use the same tractor pump you 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.310
 no auxiliary pump required 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.680
 he is totally free back there to 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.630
 use in other activities beyond 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.940
 There is also a walk system that is a 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.700
 easy test where the operator can 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.580
 do all the activities in gap and 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:08.399
 disengages of implements alone without use 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:10.679
 aliyah you exchange tools which semi 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.290
 people have the chip allows the exchanges 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.150
 automatic margin is another 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.340
 remarkable is the fact that it comes with the 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.440
 precision agriculture and also a 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.330
 cabin is extremely comfortable and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.100
 I would say that it is one of the most complete factors 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.570
 what do we have in Brazil today that is 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.570
 delivery time by your rural producer 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.750
 our new tl with the reverser 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.790
 electro-hydraulic where you make a 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.620
 movement of the front of the tractor and 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.900
 just a lever much more 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.430
 without the use of the clutch is not 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.830
 a great differential of this product 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.720
 Also, he's definitely coming to 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.940
 to win in this category as well as 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.780
 was last year when tl also 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.790
 won with our mechanical version beyond 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.310
 of the voting of the public of a group of 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.230
 media journalists specializing in 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.810
 tractors are evaluated. 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.940
 technically by professors of the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.030
 area of ​​agricultural mechanization 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.340
 this edition of the 2015 rural show 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.410
 technical committee visited the 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.569
 new holland booth to meet 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.680
 the margins better 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.530
 This year we are having a good 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.670
 attention several doubts some 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.440
 some news releases 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.310
 interesting things that have attracted 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.319
 the commission with regard to the explanations 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.540
 differentials of certain then being 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.330
 very interesting this dynamic and this 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.170
 exchange information there to talk about a 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.420
 much more accurate evaluation 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.709
 the votes go until the 28th of 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.709
 February by site
