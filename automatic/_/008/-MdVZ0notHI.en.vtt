00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.319
 so you have your sim card 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.389
 to the original here 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.569
 the micro sim is gone 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:13.759
 misfit your 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:15.589
 6 me 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.829
 classical 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:20.829
 above or soup matters to me 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.140
 book the ideal is to put the souk 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.609
 you go taped 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.609
 the part for the templates 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.810
 putting first well on board 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.240
 There you go 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.810
 then 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.140
 there is no promo 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 ridley scott sharp 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.010
 so it will be better 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.300
 why is that 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.300
 at the bar 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.780
 m 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.940
 so help us 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.880
 for a good part of the cases all the couples the nuts 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.310
 from the cus 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.720
 but it is important not to go beyond the first line 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.720
 couple was slightly above 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.450
 m 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.259
 why does that make him 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.669
 necklace hangman 

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.669
 procedure 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:22.899
 so you take the original top 

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:39.809
 they crossed a proud the jig 

00:02:45.389 --> 00:02:47.779
 so here 

00:02:47.779 --> 00:02:50.139
 as for traces 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:53.139
 perfectly 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:57.949
 the thing 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.559
 so then grow 

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:04.719
 I cut I leave you the tape in itself as it does not go 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:22.219
 this is the angle 

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:29.679
 and disrespect particularly delicate class the duo 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:33.199
 you cut yourself 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.879
 delicately allard 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.919
 and finished 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.899
 It's perfect 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:42.899
 in case of particular concern, divide it immediately 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.539
 sim card exactly 

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:54.539
 identical 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.290
 and it makes in the drawer 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.579
 no problem 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.339
 without having to force 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.069
 little difference that cora on some cards 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.029
 it's the thickness of the plastic that can be a little bit smaller 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:11.809
 feet 

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:14.959
 but for that does not prevent to drag it in the drawers 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.809
 original telecom maps 

00:04:17.809 --> 00:04:20.809
 It was a little thicker than that 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.999
 his concept
