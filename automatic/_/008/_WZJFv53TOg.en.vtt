hard to see but can you see push it pull

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.729 
hard to see but can you see push it pull
it<00:03:41.480> up<00:03:41.630> a<00:03:41.750> little<00:03:41.900> bit<00:03:42.110> if<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.260> can<00:03:42.410> see<00:03:42.590> the

it up a little bit if you can see the

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.640 
it up a little bit if you can see the
rows<00:03:43.030> like<00:03:44.030> so<00:03:44.360> so<00:03:44.810> it<00:03:44.900> looks<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.200> lot<00:03:45.350> better

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
rows like so so it looks a lot better

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.320 
rows like so so it looks a lot better
now<00:03:45.950> looks<00:03:46.370> tons<00:03:46.670> better<00:03:46.880> they're<00:03:47.180> not

now looks tons better they're not
tangling<00:03:48.019> they're<00:03:48.680> not<00:03:48.860> falling<00:03:49.160> over<00:03:49.489> and

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
tangling they're not falling over and

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.120 
tangling they're not falling over and
there<00:03:50.540> this<00:03:50.720> will<00:03:50.959> really<00:03:51.350> strengthen<00:03:51.769> them

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
there this will really strengthen them

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.360

now<00:03:52.310> to<00:03:52.940> grow<00:03:53.150> into<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.540> really<00:03:54.110> nice<00:03:54.320> onion<00:03:54.920> set

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
now to grow into a really nice onion set

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.180 
now to grow into a really nice onion set
now<00:03:56.060> onion<00:03:56.540> sets<00:03:56.780> are<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.080> best<00:03:57.380> green<00:03:57.860> onion

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
now onion sets are the best green onion

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.250 
now onion sets are the best green onion
sets<00:03:58.370> are<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.640> best<00:03:58.880> way<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.390> grow<00:03:59.989> in<00:04:00.170> the

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
sets are the best way to grow in the

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.979 
sets are the best way to grow in the
garden<00:04:00.290> in<00:04:00.950> my<00:04:01.220> opinion<00:04:01.790> they<00:04:02.209> outdo<00:04:02.690> the

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:02.989 
garden in my opinion they outdo the

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:04.600 
garden in my opinion they outdo the
