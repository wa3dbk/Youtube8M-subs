00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.850 
plus of the plan of the program I mean
you<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.720> things<00:02:00.930> in<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.200> certain<00:02:01.290> way<00:02:01.440> and<00:02:01.770> my

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
you I see things in a certain way and my

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.410 
you I see things in a certain way and my
colleagues<00:02:02.160> see<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.370> in<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.550> away<00:02:02.730> so<00:02:03.000> some

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
colleagues see it in it away so some

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.450 
colleagues see it in it away so some
other<00:02:03.540> things<00:02:03.840> work<00:02:04.050> outside<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:04.800> on<00:02:05.040> my<00:02:05.220> side

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
other things work outside and on my side

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.330 
other things work outside and on my side
it<00:02:05.580> works<00:02:05.670> different<00:02:06.060> things<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.740> this<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.920> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
it works different things so this is the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.339 
it works different things so this is the
plus<00:02:08.580> that<00:02:08.789> I<00:02:08.819> see<00:02:09.090> from<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.420> programs<00:02:09.869> for

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
plus that I see from this programs for

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.000 
plus that I see from this programs for
me<00:02:10.470> as<00:02:11.190> well<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:12.209> was<00:02:12.420> blast<00:02:12.720> of<00:02:12.930> my<00:02:13.080> brain<00:02:13.349> was

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
me as well it was blast of my brain was

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.220 
me as well it was blast of my brain was
really<00:02:14.340> crazy<00:02:14.610> about<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.150> because<00:02:15.450> from<00:02:16.079> the

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
really crazy about this because from the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.500 
really crazy about this because from the
very<00:02:16.409> very<00:02:16.500> beginning<00:02:16.829> you're<00:02:17.790> studying<00:02:18.150> with

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
very very beginning you're studying with

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.679 
very very beginning you're studying with
very<00:02:18.840> difficult<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.650> challenging<00:02:20.030> tasks<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
very difficult and challenging tasks and

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.770 
very difficult and challenging tasks and
faces<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.590> had<00:02:23.030> individual<00:02:24.030> classmates<00:02:24.480> bring

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
faces we had individual classmates bring

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.530 
faces we had individual classmates bring
in<00:02:24.900> their<00:02:25.140> perspective<00:02:25.829> of<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.069> real-life

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
in their perspective of the real-life

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.179 
in their perspective of the real-life
environment<00:02:27.540> that<00:02:27.629> they<00:02:27.750> could<00:02:27.930> see<00:02:28.109> so<00:02:28.409> we

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:29.189 
environment that they could see so we

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:31.069 
environment that they could see so we
when<00:02:29.549> we're<00:02:29.730> study<00:02:29.939> frees<00:02:30.150> example<00:02:30.810> certain

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
when we're study frees example certain

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.690 
when we're study frees example certain
companies<00:02:31.409> and<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.709> gas<00:02:31.890> we<00:02:32.189> have<00:02:32.219> people

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
companies and on a gas we have people

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.009 
companies and on a gas we have people
that<00:02:32.730> were<00:02:32.909> talking<00:02:33.299> from<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.569> industries
