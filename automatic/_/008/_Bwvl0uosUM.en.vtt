closer get a little closer okay there we
go<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.219> I'm<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.640> looking<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> screen<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
go so I'm just looking at the screen and

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.260 
go so I'm just looking at the screen and
the<00:00:40.290> cross<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.800> my<00:00:41.250> cursor<00:00:41.640> so<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:41.910> i<00:00:42.000> look<00:00:42.030> out

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
the cross is my cursor so if i look out

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.440 
the cross is my cursor so if i look out
that<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.629> jump<00:00:42.890> moving<00:00:43.890> forward<00:00:44.100> look<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.239> and

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
that can jump moving forward look up and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.090 
that can jump moving forward look up and
jump<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.410> kind<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
jump so this is kind of like just a

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.540 
jump so this is kind of like just a
little<00:00:47.370> simple<00:00:48.149> minecraft<00:00:49.340> little<00:00:50.340> platform

very<00:00:53.190> simplistic<00:00:54.059> demonstration<00:00:54.690> just<00:00:54.989> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
very simplistic demonstration just to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.670 
very simplistic demonstration just to
show<00:00:55.320> how<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:56.219> can<00:00:56.460> use<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.719> eyes<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.260> just

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
show how you can use the eyes to just

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.599 
show how you can use the eyes to just
give<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> direction<00:00:59.600> it's<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:00.930> really

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
give a direction it's not really

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.660 
give a direction it's not really
implementation<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.760> just<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.210> showcase<00:01:03.600> oh

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
implementation it's just a showcase oh

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.140 
implementation it's just a showcase oh
you<00:01:05.670> did<00:01:05.909> psych<00:01:06.689> myself<00:01:06.869> out<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.970> yeah<00:01:08.970> you're

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
just VI but it has pretty effective so

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.719 
just VI but it has pretty effective so
all<00:01:46.710> i<00:01:46.740> really<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.310> do<00:01:47.460> while<00:01:47.640> I'm

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
all i really have to do while I'm

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.830 
all i really have to do while I'm
playing<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.270> look<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.640> average

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
playing this is look at the average

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.640 
playing this is look at the average
but<00:01:52.840> here<00:01:52.930> is<00:01:52.960> a<00:01:53.050> little<00:01:53.170> bit<00:01:53.350> strategy

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
but here is a little bit strategy

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.290 
but here is a little bit strategy
because<00:01:53.860> I<00:01:53.890> have<00:01:54.220> to<00:01:54.370> be<00:01:54.460> aware<00:01:54.730> of<00:01:54.790> the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
because I have to be aware of the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.750 
because I have to be aware of the
movement<00:01:55.720> of<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.900> earth<00:01:56.290> as<00:01:57.010> I<00:01:57.190> destroy<00:01:57.370> all

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
movement of the earth as I destroy all

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.710 
movement of the earth as I destroy all
this<00:01:57.910> it's<00:01:58.890> emotional<00:01:59.890> TWiki<00:02:00.460> after<00:02:01.420> because

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
this it's emotional TWiki after because

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.140 
this it's emotional TWiki after because
