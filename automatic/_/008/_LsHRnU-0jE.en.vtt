ten thousand words long and that's

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.150 
ten thousand words long and that's
fairly<00:00:29.640> average<00:00:30.349> anyways<00:00:31.349> if<00:00:31.679> in<00:00:31.830> your<00:00:31.920> fourth

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
fairly average anyways if in your fourth

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.670 
fairly average anyways if in your fourth
year<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.430> you're<00:00:32.520> doing<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.759> non-jury<00:00:33.210> that's

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
year and you're doing a non-jury that's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.290 
year and you're doing a non-jury that's
nothing<00:00:34.680> another<00:00:35.489> point<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:35.910> they<00:00:36.120> only

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
nothing another point is that they only

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.979 
nothing another point is that they only
take<00:00:36.800> six<00:00:37.800> classes<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.460> year<00:00:38.600> they<00:00:39.600> don't<00:00:39.809> want

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
take six classes a year they don't want

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.020 
take six classes a year they don't want
a<00:00:40.020> semester<00:00:40.559> system<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.160> term<00:00:41.430> system<00:00:41.879> so

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
a semester system it's a term system so

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.420 
a semester system it's a term system so
they<00:00:42.149> have<00:00:42.239> three<00:00:42.450> terms<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.200> they<00:00:43.950> take<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
they have three terms and they take the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.100 
they have three terms and they take the
same<00:00:44.460> classes<00:00:45.149> through<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.390> whole<00:00:45.690> year<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
same classes through the whole year and

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.990 
same classes through the whole year and

it's interesting that he brings that up

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.450 
it's interesting that he brings that up
because<00:01:25.080> there's<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.740> entire<00:01:26.070> documentary

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
because there's this entire documentary

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.149 
because there's this entire documentary
called<00:01:27.000> race<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.210> nowhere<00:01:27.509> where<00:01:28.439> they<00:01:28.890> talk

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
called race to nowhere where they talk

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.219 
called race to nowhere where they talk
about<00:01:29.460> how<00:01:29.700> there's<00:01:30.119> too<00:01:30.450> much<00:01:30.600> pressure<00:01:30.900> on

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
about how there's too much pressure on

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.499 
about how there's too much pressure on
students<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.100> United<00:01:32.430> States<00:01:32.700> right<00:01:32.970> now

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
students in the United States right now

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.870 
students in the United States right now
I<00:01:33.630> personally<00:01:34.079> don't<00:01:34.590> buy<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.070> at<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.369> I

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
I personally don't buy that at all I

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.520 
I personally don't buy that at all I
don't<00:01:36.270> think<00:01:36.479> there's<00:01:36.659> too<00:01:36.869> much<00:01:36.990> pressure<00:01:37.320> in

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
don't think there's too much pressure in

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.990 
don't think there's too much pressure in
terms<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.860> academics<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.610> think<00:01:38.820> there's

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
terms of academics I think there's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.429 
terms of academics I think there's
definitely<00:01:39.210> too<00:01:39.750> much<00:01:39.780> pressure<00:01:40.170> when<00:01:40.380> it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
definitely too much pressure when it

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.340 
definitely too much pressure when it
comes<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.799> standardized<00:01:41.310> testing<00:01:41.340> uh<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:43.079> you

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
comes to standardized testing uh but you

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.929 
comes to standardized testing uh but you
know<00:01:43.500> they're<00:01:43.799> students<00:01:44.220> who<00:01:44.310> complain<00:01:44.729> about

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
know they're students who complain about

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.300 
know they're students who complain about
too<00:01:45.270> many<00:01:45.390> study<00:01:45.780> hours<00:01:46.229> too<00:01:46.530> many<00:01:46.680> classes<00:01:47.159> to

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
too many study hours too many classes to

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.340 
too many study hours too many classes to
take<00:01:47.490> too<00:01:47.820> many<00:01:47.970> tests<00:01:48.329> too<00:01:48.689> many<00:01:48.840> books<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
take too many tests too many books to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.170 
take too many tests too many books to
read<00:01:49.470> oh<00:01:49.710> my<00:01:50.070> god<00:01:50.250> it's<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.549> difficult<00:01:50.790> why

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
read oh my god it's so difficult why

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.969 
read oh my god it's so difficult why
can't<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.509> just<00:01:51.540> focus<00:01:52.049> on<00:01:52.200> living<00:01:52.409> my<00:01:52.649> dream

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
can't I just focus on living my dream

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.710 
can't I just focus on living my dream
and<00:01:53.159> finding<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:53.670> I'm<00:01:53.759> most<00:01:54.000> passionate<00:01:54.270> in

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
and finding what I'm most passionate in

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.660 
and finding what I'm most passionate in
and<00:01:54.990> maybe<00:01:55.409> that's<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.770> model<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.280> they're

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
and maybe that's the model that they're

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.780 
and maybe that's the model that they're
trying<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.149> go<00:01:57.299> after<00:01:57.540> in<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.219> particular

some slacker school or do you think it's
just<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.459> different<00:02:08.789> model<00:02:08.970> than<00:02:09.149> what<00:02:09.360> we're

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
just a different model than what we're

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.850 
just a different model than what we're
used<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.810> in<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:10.050> United<00:02:10.229> States<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.800> it

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
used to in the United States and it

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.340 
used to in the United States and it
could<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.160> of

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
could be of

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.320 
could be of
successful<00:02:12.040> model<00:02:12.370> uh<00:02:12.520> I'm<00:02:13.090> not<00:02:13.270> sure

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
successful model uh I'm not sure

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.180 
successful model uh I'm not sure
unfortunately<00:02:14.200> doesn't<00:02:14.380> say<00:02:14.710> which

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.570 
could work for students you know uh I
definitely<00:03:06.150> see<00:03:07.410> how<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.470> pressure<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.430> do

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
definitely see how the pressure to do

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.220 
definitely see how the pressure to do
well<00:03:09.610> on<00:03:09.910> standardized<00:03:10.450> testing<00:03:10.840> here<00:03:11.050> in<00:03:11.110> the

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
well on standardized testing here in the

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.180 
well on standardized testing here in the
u.s.<00:03:11.560> kind<00:03:12.340> of<00:03:12.660> keeps<00:03:13.660> kids<00:03:14.020> in<00:03:14.380> like<00:03:14.620> this<00:03:14.800> box

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
u.s. kind of keeps kids in like this box

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.010 
u.s. kind of keeps kids in like this box
where<00:03:15.640> they<00:03:15.730> don't<00:03:15.910> focus<00:03:16.210> enough<00:03:16.510> on<00:03:16.840> their

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
where they don't focus enough on their

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.570 
where they don't focus enough on their
futures<00:03:17.500> what<00:03:17.830> they're<00:03:17.950> passionate<00:03:18.190> about

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
futures what they're passionate about

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.130 
futures what they're passionate about
and<00:03:18.760> what<00:03:19.090> they<00:03:19.210> really<00:03:19.480> want<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.780> do

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
and what they really want to do

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.760 
and what they really want to do
so<00:03:20.500> maybe<00:03:21.360> avoiding<00:03:22.360> focusing<00:03:23.110> on<00:03:23.200> numbers<00:03:23.530> so

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
so maybe avoiding focusing on numbers so

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.160 
so maybe avoiding focusing on numbers so
much<00:03:24.040> could<00:03:24.370> be<00:03:24.490> a<00:03:24.520> really<00:03:24.820> great<00:03:24.940> thing<00:03:25.300> so<00:03:25.840> um

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
much could be a really great thing so um

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.870 
much could be a really great thing so um
and<00:03:26.440> I<00:03:26.560> I<00:03:26.590> would<00:03:26.800> love<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.310> get<00:03:27.460> another<00:03:27.670> video

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
and I I would love to get another video

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.060 
and I I would love to get another video
from<00:03:28.180> him<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.570> get<00:03:28.690> a<00:03:28.720> better<00:03:28.870> idea<00:03:29.110> of<00:03:29.380> what

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
from him to get a better idea of what

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.010 
from him to get a better idea of what
university<00:03:30.670> he<00:03:30.820> goes<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.300> and<00:03:31.570> why<00:03:31.780> they<00:03:31.990> use

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
university he goes to and why they use

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.930 
university he goes to and why they use
that<00:03:32.380> kind<00:03:32.530> of<00:03:32.650> model<00:03:33.010> uh<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.820> of<00:03:33.910> course

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
that kind of model uh and of course

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.000 
that kind of model uh and of course
perception<00:03:34.810> is<00:03:34.930> everything<00:03:34.960> maybe<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.830> him

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
perception is everything maybe to him

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.230 
perception is everything maybe to him
it's<00:03:36.250> like<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.520> easiest<00:03:36.820> thing<00:03:36.940> in<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.150> world

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
it's like the easiest thing in the world

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.460 
it's like the easiest thing in the world
into<00:03:37.690> other<00:03:37.840> students<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.260> could<00:03:38.380> be

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
into other students it could be

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.310 
into other students it could be
difficult<00:03:38.650> who<00:03:39.130> knows
