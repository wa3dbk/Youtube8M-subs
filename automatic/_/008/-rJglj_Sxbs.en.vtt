00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.130 
corner by utilizing the blue pencil on
the<00:00:22.669> inner<00:00:22.909> corner<00:00:23.210> of<00:00:23.239> your<00:00:23.300> eye<00:00:23.449> it<00:00:23.509> really

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
creates a lot of intensity and it really

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.899 
creates a lot of intensity and it really
sets<00:00:27.169> the<00:00:27.380> tone<00:00:27.409> for<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.979> rest<00:00:28.009> of<00:00:28.399> the<00:00:28.550> makeup

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:28.909 
sets the tone for the rest of the makeup

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.179 
sets the tone for the rest of the makeup
so<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:29.809> whole<00:00:29.989> thought<00:00:30.199> and<00:00:30.380> idea<00:00:30.649> behind<00:00:30.829> it

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
so the whole thought and idea behind it

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.419 
so the whole thought and idea behind it
is<00:00:31.339> a<00:00:31.429> gradation<00:00:32.119> of<00:00:32.390> color<00:00:33.039> so<00:00:34.039> the<00:00:34.160> next<00:00:34.309> step

00:00:34.419 --> 00:00:34.429 
is a gradation of color so the next step

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.910 
is a gradation of color so the next step
is<00:00:34.910> to<00:00:34.940> take<00:00:35.359> this<00:00:35.629> violet<00:00:36.140> shade<00:00:36.379> and<00:00:36.679> apply

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
is to take this violet shade and apply

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.310 
is to take this violet shade and apply
it<00:00:37.219> onto<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:38.120> middle<00:00:38.660> section<00:00:39.050> of<00:00:39.109> your<00:00:39.289> eye

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
it onto the middle section of your eye

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.979 
it onto the middle section of your eye
or<00:00:39.620> your<00:00:39.649> lower<00:00:40.129> lid<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:40.760> gently<00:00:41.480> buff<00:00:41.780> and

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
or your lower lid and gently buff and

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:44.619 
or your lower lid and gently buff and
blend<00:00:42.320> again<00:00:43.129> slightly<00:00:43.609> beyond<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.359> crease

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
blend again slightly beyond the crease

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.290 
blend again slightly beyond the crease
now<00:00:45.140> that<00:00:45.379> violet<00:00:45.859> is<00:00:46.010> going<00:00:46.339> just<00:00:46.699> beyond<00:00:47.120> the

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
now that violet is going just beyond the

blue and now the next shade will go just

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.829 
blue and now the next shade will go just
beyond<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.089> violet<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:50.690> think<00:00:51.280> gradual<00:00:52.280> steps

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:52.839 
beyond the violet so think gradual steps

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:55.329 
beyond the violet so think gradual steps
gradation<00:00:53.839> of<00:00:53.929> color<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.440> again<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.980> look<00:00:55.159> is
