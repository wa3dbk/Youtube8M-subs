of<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.180> arcade<00:01:56.600> cabinet<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:58.159> decal<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:59.030> think

00:01:59.320 --> 00:01:59.330 
of the arcade cabinet the decal I think

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.179 
of the arcade cabinet the decal I think
is<00:01:59.450> an<00:01:59.600> awesome<00:01:59.780> shape<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.799> just<00:02:00.979> needs<00:02:01.100> a

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
is an awesome shape it just needs a

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.100 
is an awesome shape it just needs a
little<00:02:01.340> touch-up<00:02:01.610> paint<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.750> think<00:02:02.990> we'll

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.559 
so nostalgic it's so cool
now<00:02:17.450> here<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.590> other<00:02:18.769> side<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.569> this

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
now here is the other side and this

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.690 
now here is the other side and this
decal<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.470> in<00:02:21.950> almost<00:02:22.220> perfect<00:02:22.370> condition

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
decal is in almost perfect condition

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.670 
decal is in almost perfect condition
there's<00:02:23.269> a<00:02:23.330> just<00:02:23.569> a<00:02:23.660> few<00:02:23.870> little<00:02:24.050> scuffs<00:02:24.470> up

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
there's a just a few little scuffs up

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.130 
there's a just a few little scuffs up
top<00:02:24.890> here<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:26.030> guess<00:02:26.540> it's<00:02:26.720> not<00:02:26.810> perfect

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
top here I guess it's not perfect

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.559 
top here I guess it's not perfect
condition<00:02:27.440> but<00:02:27.470> still<00:02:27.769> it's<00:02:28.220> pretty<00:02:28.489> good

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
condition but still it's pretty good

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:31.240 
condition but still it's pretty good
just<00:02:29.900> again<00:02:30.260> needs<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.560> little<00:02:30.680> touch-up<00:02:30.950> paint

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.410 
on this side this side is a little in
better<00:02:33.799> condition<00:02:34.190> on<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> other<00:02:34.489> side<00:02:34.700> but

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
better condition on the other side but

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.720 
better condition on the other side but
it<00:02:35.780> is<00:02:35.989> awesome<00:02:36.230> we've<00:02:36.830> got<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.160> coin<00:02:37.340> slots

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
here you can see it's hollowed out so it

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.699 
here you can see it's hollowed out so it
really<00:02:44.299> is<00:02:44.480> just<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.840> shell<00:02:45.080> but<00:02:45.350> that's<00:02:45.500> cool

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
this and see how Y it is I'm assuming

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.970 
this and see how Y it is I'm assuming
it's<00:03:22.459> about<00:03:22.670> 1920<00:03:23.600> inches<00:03:23.840> or<00:03:24.320> whatever<00:03:24.769> but

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
um I'm gonna see how big of a monitor I

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.940 
um I'm gonna see how big of a monitor I
can<00:03:27.920> get<00:03:28.100> to<00:03:28.579> put<00:03:28.850> in<00:03:28.970> there<00:03:29.180> and<00:03:29.590> down<00:03:30.590> below
