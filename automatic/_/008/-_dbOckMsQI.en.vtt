those in like that flip that down snaps

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.679 
those in like that flip that down snaps
in<00:01:51.799> nicely<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.860> becomes<00:01:53.130> his<00:01:53.280> backpack<00:01:53.759> and

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
gives the weight on this figure maybe

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.410 
gives the weight on this figure maybe
one<00:02:07.229> look<00:02:08.099> then<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.700> want<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.910> flip<00:02:09.209> these
