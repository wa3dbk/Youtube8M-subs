put this little spike here if you see
that<00:05:44.080> little<00:05:44.229> spike<00:05:44.589> goes<00:05:45.219> up<00:05:45.460> because<00:05:45.610> they

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
that little spike goes up because they

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:47.459 
that little spike goes up because they
just<00:05:45.969> dumped<00:05:46.300> a<00:05:46.419> lot<00:05:46.509> of<00:05:46.659> cash<00:05:46.870> into<00:05:47.139> it<00:05:47.379> and

then they bring it back in they pull it
back<00:05:49.180> in<00:05:49.389> but<00:05:49.569> it's<00:05:49.690> difficult<00:05:50.259> to<00:05:50.740> pull

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:50.949 
back in but it's difficult to pull

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:52.529 
back in but it's difficult to pull
things<00:05:51.129> back<00:05:51.279> in<00:05:51.639> especially<00:05:52.180> when<00:05:52.300> you<00:05:52.389> have

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539
