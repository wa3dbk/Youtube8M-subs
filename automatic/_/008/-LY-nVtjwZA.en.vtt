00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:14.010 
you envisioned it shaking out like when

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.289

you<00:00:14.100> started<00:00:14.459> the<00:00:14.520> brewing<00:00:14.730> network<00:00:15.000> what<00:00:15.180> was

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
you started the brewing network what was

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.450 
you started the brewing network what was
your<00:00:15.510> idea<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.350> how<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.529> studio<00:00:16.920> situation

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460

was<00:00:17.550> going<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.789> show<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.330> know<00:00:18.509> I<00:00:18.689> don't<00:00:18.839> think<00:00:19.080> I

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:19.169 
was going to show I know I don't think I

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.989 
was going to show I know I don't think I
had<00:00:19.349> any<00:00:19.500> idea<00:00:19.919> whatsoever<00:00:20.250> when<00:00:20.669> I<00:00:20.699> built

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:20.999 
had any idea whatsoever when I built

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:22.970 
had any idea whatsoever when I built
this<00:00:21.150> studio<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.720> we're<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:21.960> now<00:00:21.990> with<00:00:22.439> Doc<00:00:22.710> I

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
this studio that we're in now with Doc I

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.919 
this studio that we're in now with Doc I
thought<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.789> just<00:00:24.029> need<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> good<00:00:24.329> comfortable

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:24.929 
thought we just need a good comfortable

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.079 
thought we just need a good comfortable
studio<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.800> its<00:00:25.919> climate<00:00:26.339> controlled<00:00:26.759> and

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.089 
studio and its climate controlled and

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:28.880 
studio and its climate controlled and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
looks professional for the guests which

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.310 
looks professional for the guests which

I think we succeeded in doing but

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.080 
I think we succeeded in doing but
there's<00:00:32.070> still<00:00:32.189> something<00:00:32.520> about<00:00:32.669> having<00:00:32.880> it

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
to better video it's a larger space that

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.200 
to better video it's a larger space that
we<00:01:15.210> can<00:01:15.450> do<00:01:16.049> multiple<00:01:16.259> cameras<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.069> and<00:01:17.310> people

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
we can do multiple cameras in and people

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.630 
we can do multiple cameras in and people
be<00:01:18.390> able<00:01:18.539> to<00:01:18.630> see<00:01:18.780> bevo<00:01:19.259> instead<00:01:20.039> of<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.399> the

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
be able to see bevo instead of just the

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.149 
be able to see bevo instead of just the
back<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.030> my<00:01:21.060> mug<00:01:21.539> or<00:01:21.869> other<00:01:22.350> you<00:01:22.859> know<00:01:22.950> creepy

back of my mug or other you know creepy
things<00:01:23.460> I<00:01:23.640> think<00:01:24.420> an<00:01:24.569> enhanced<00:01:25.079> video

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
things I think an enhanced video

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.349 
things I think an enhanced video
experience<00:01:26.009> will<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.219> the<00:01:26.310> best<00:01:26.429> part<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.939> hope

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
experience will be the best part I hope

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:29.539 
experience will be the best part I hope
to<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:28.289> always<00:01:28.469> try<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:29.039> our<00:01:29.159> audio

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
to we always try to up our audio

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.959

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
know but mostly I just think it's it's a

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.099 
know but mostly I just think it's it's a
home<00:01:35.490> for<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.759> BM<00:01:35.999> to<00:01:36.179> grow<00:01:36.389> is<00:01:36.719> what<00:01:36.960> we're

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
home for the BM to grow is what we're

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.410 
home for the BM to grow is what we're
