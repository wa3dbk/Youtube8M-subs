moisture<00:04:37.120> crochet<00:04:37.479> braids<00:04:37.720> because<00:04:37.900> I<00:04:38.110> can

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 
moisture crochet braids because I can

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.500 
moisture crochet braids because I can
just<00:04:38.650> do<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.220> song<00:04:39.520> even<00:04:39.850> though<00:04:40.060> crochet

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510

braids<00:04:40.780> are<00:04:41.880> there<00:04:42.880> more<00:04:43.150> convenient<00:04:43.630> I<00:04:43.960> guess

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
braids are there more convenient I guess

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.950 
braids are there more convenient I guess
they<00:04:44.560> take<00:04:44.770> less<00:04:45.160> time<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:45.520> do<00:04:45.940> they<00:04:46.660> last

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
they take less time to do they last

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.140 
they take less time to do they last
longer<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.680> things<00:04:47.889> like<00:04:48.040> that<00:04:48.100> but<00:04:48.580> no<00:04:48.880> they

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
longer and things like that but no they

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.610 
longer and things like that but no they
don't<00:04:49.330> actually<00:04:49.570> been<00:04:50.020> on<00:04:50.139> much<00:04:50.380> longer
