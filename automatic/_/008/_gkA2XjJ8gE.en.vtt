00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.470
 Hello everyone, today I show you a recipe 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.390
 a recipe I learned from my own 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.700
 parents and the simple enough to 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.880
 prepare we talk about the ricotta roll 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.880
 and spinach 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:23.019
 then let's start first 

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:26.019
 preparing the dough for the roll in 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:28.239
 in this case we use 100 g of flour 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:30.909
 and new per person 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.670
 as you can see we have the flour circle 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:36.340
 and in the middle the three eggs adding a 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.800
 pinch of salt and oil as required 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.440
 just not to harden the dough 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.690
 let's take some flour and just like it 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.970
 I'm doing the spar right now 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.370
 we cut a little for the table so that 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:54.290
 the dough does not stick 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.140
 on the wooden table after which we put 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.120
 a little flour also on the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.190
 on the rolling pin just for this 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.220
 motivation and we begin to draw the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.220
 pasta 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.890
 once we spread the dough 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.290
 we begin to prepare the filling 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.280
 the ingredients we will need are the 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.320
 following 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.320
 then of the ricotta about 80 grams 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.950
 the spinach that works relentlessly 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.810
 account and well wrung you see there is not 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.490
 water 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.130
 a beaten egg a pinch of salt e 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.119
 finally in grated Parmesan 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.119
 however enough 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.580
 take the ricotta and put it 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.160
 in spinach we will realize more or 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.890
 less than enough once that 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.830
 that we begin to mix everything later 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:10.780
 what we put new and the principle of 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.780
 finally salt the grated bread 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.770
 once in the filling it is ready 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.410
 let's go to make pasta based 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.520
 which we prepared earlier and 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.520
 we roll it all up 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:43.110
 in truth, looking at it well, it does a little 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:46.050
 impression but I can assure you that 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.420
 the result is really good 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.330
 at this point we roll and roll e 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.580
 we take aluminum paper so 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.420
 you can take the roll and put it 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.440
 inside as i am doing then it is 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.440
 we close well 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.470
 we wrap it an interior so that 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:11.820
 we could put it in boiling water 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.820
 for three or four minutes 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:27.620
 as you can see the roll is a lot 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.440
 great and personally did not have one 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.690
 pot that could contain it all 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.700
 whole I then took a tray from 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.740
 oven and with the help of a ladle 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.740
 immersed in the water slowly 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:05:00.200
 once past 3 bars four 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:03.080
 minutes we turn off the heat and put it on 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.790
 to cool a world in a cool place 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.230
 that when we are going to cut short 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.230
 we will avoid doing much damage 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:14.540
 we put some sauce with a ladle in the 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.360
 in a baking pan and we begin a 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:25.330
 to cut it I personally have eliminated 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.330
 extremes because they are more extensive 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.630
 here are all our parties 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:53.630
 now all we have to do is put his own 

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.630
 bake
