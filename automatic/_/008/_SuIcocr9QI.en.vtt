 I'm talking about one man horse I think I want to turn left and unconsciously steer 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:50.870
 If you turn off the car you don't think- you're going to run- if you think you want to accelerate, be honest 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.440
 I thought the tone was moist like taking an accelerator pedal 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:58.110
 It's salty 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:02.270
 I mean, there's no way there's a car there, but I'm thinking of myself 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.270
 I can run along the street 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:12.770
 It is not simply that that form is moving or that kind of story 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:15.010
