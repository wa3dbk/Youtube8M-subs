I have eaten the raw I do not recommend
it<00:00:19.110> made<00:00:19.320> my<00:00:19.440> lips<00:00:19.680> at<00:00:19.830> my<00:00:19.950> tongue<00:00:20.160> tingly<00:00:20.670> for

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
it made my lips at my tongue tingly for

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.510 
it made my lips at my tongue tingly for
an<00:00:21.270> entire<00:00:21.540> day<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:21.900> today<00:00:22.200> a<00:00:22.770> freshmen<00:00:23.430> have

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:23.520 
an entire day so today a freshmen have

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.340 
an entire day so today a freshmen have
collected<00:00:23.939> some<00:00:24.150> they're<00:00:24.450> not<00:00:24.600> ten<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.960> us<00:00:25.080> I

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
collected some they're not ten of us I

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.990 
collected some they're not ten of us I
think<00:00:25.680> generals<00:00:26.189> would<00:00:26.279> probably<00:00:26.669> the<00:00:26.759> best

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
think generals would probably the best

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.060 
think generals would probably the best
would<00:00:27.480> probably<00:00:27.779> be<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> most<00:00:28.080> tender<00:00:28.410> but

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
would probably be the most tender but

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.830 
would probably be the most tender but
it's<00:00:29.220> too<00:00:29.369> late<00:00:29.550> my<00:00:29.759> early<00:00:29.939> for<00:00:30.180> general<00:00:30.540> so

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
it's too late my early for general so

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.140 
it's too late my early for general so
we're<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.500> do<00:00:31.680> some<00:00:31.860> adults<00:00:32.250> so<00:00:32.880> these

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
with pineapple a little mixed up a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.290 
with pineapple a little mixed up a

kosher salt I'm just going to pull these
wings<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:57.960> because<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.379> don't<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.620> there's

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
wings off because I don't think there's

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.229 
wings off because I don't think there's
any<00:00:58.949> real<00:00:59.100> need<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.399> eat<00:00:59.519> the<00:00:59.670> wings<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.090> don't

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
any real need to eat the wings I don't

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.689 
any real need to eat the wings I don't
know<00:01:00.329> how<00:01:00.420> many<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.989> too<00:01:01.079> many<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:02.100> guessing

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
know how many is too many I'm guessing

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.549 
know how many is too many I'm guessing
probably<00:01:02.850> more<00:01:03.300> than<00:01:03.480> one<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.839> too<00:01:04.019> many<00:01:04.050> but

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
probably more than one is too many but

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.470 
probably more than one is too many but
we'll<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.280> we're<00:01:06.060> going<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.240> put<00:01:06.360> some

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.730 
we'll see we're going to put some
pineapple<00:01:06.960> on<00:01:07.050> into<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.290> think<00:01:07.500> it's<00:01:07.590> going<00:01:07.710> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740

delicious<00:01:25.820> let's<00:01:26.820> see

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
delicious let's see

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.789 
delicious let's see
I<00:01:28.340> also<00:01:29.340> also<00:01:30.090> picked<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.540> beer<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:31.079> went<00:01:31.649> with

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
I also also picked a beer I went with

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.340 
I also also picked a beer I went with
allagash<00:01:32.369> white<00:01:32.790> I<00:01:33.030> didn't<00:01:33.720> want<00:01:33.869> anything<00:01:34.079> to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
allagash white I didn't want anything to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
allagash white I didn't want anything to
overwhelm<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.009> flavor<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.579> thinking<00:01:35.909> these

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
overwhelm the flavor I'm thinking these

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.219 
overwhelm the flavor I'm thinking these
are<00:01:36.090> going<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.299> be<00:01:36.420> pretty<00:01:36.630> delicately

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
are going to be pretty delicately

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.760 
are going to be pretty delicately
flavored<00:01:37.439> if<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.189> ones<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.210> ate<00:01:39.390> raw<00:01:39.770> that

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
flavored if the ones that I ate raw that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.920 
flavored if the ones that I ate raw that
tasted<00:01:41.219> like<00:01:41.390> walnuts<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.659> had<00:01:42.840> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
tasted like walnuts and had the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.649 
tasted like walnuts and had the
consistency<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.560> snot<00:01:44.040> or<00:01:44.700> any<00:01:45.740> or<00:01:46.740> any<00:01:47.420> idea<00:01:48.420> I

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
consistency of snot or any or any idea I

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.600 
consistency of snot or any or any idea I
think<00:01:49.079> they<00:01:49.380> will<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.560> very<00:01:49.680> lightly<00:01:50.219> flavored

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
think they will be very lightly flavored

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.870 
think they will be very lightly flavored
so<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.329> know<00:01:52.170> Sam<00:01:52.469> who's<00:01:52.799> filming<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.610> just

are<00:02:44.830> these<00:02:45.070> are<00:02:45.100> tender<00:02:45.610> I<00:02:45.790> think<00:02:46.060> these<00:02:46.180> would

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
are these are tender I think these would

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.970 
be like grade-a if these were shrimp
good<00:02:49.900> originally<00:02:50.380> I<00:02:50.440> thought<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.650> would<00:02:50.860> use

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
good originally I thought I would use

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.580 
good originally I thought I would use
barbecue<00:02:51.400> sauce<00:02:51.610> but<00:02:51.850> I<00:02:52.150> think<00:02:53.020> barbecue<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.470> a

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
barbecue sauce but I think barbecue is a

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.230 
barbecue sauce but I think barbecue is a
little<00:02:53.800> mess<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.310> flavor<00:02:54.580> yeah<00:02:54.940> that's<00:02:55.120> what

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
little mess the flavor yeah that's what

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.430 
little mess the flavor yeah that's what
I<00:02:55.270> think<00:02:55.390> too<00:02:55.570> I<00:02:55.690> think<00:02:56.080> these<00:02:56.140> are<00:02:56.230> going<00:02:56.380> to

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
I think too I think these are going to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.060 
I think too I think these are going to
be<00:02:56.530> very<00:02:56.890> delicately<00:02:57.459> flavor<00:02:57.760> tonight<00:02:59.070> what

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
be very delicately flavor tonight what

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.760
