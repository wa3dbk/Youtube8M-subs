 then you have the possibility the 

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:38.450
 resolution to change the bits 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.509

 so you can see it all 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.560
 I can shiver a bit and me 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.289
 show you the pictures always the same 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.029
 right after I triggered here 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.139
 and of course I'll show you now too 

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:08.000
 always a small selection of pictures 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:11.270
 outside in daylight 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.860
 recorded and looks so on and so forth 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.710
 look at the pictures with them no 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.530
 gets an overview and can say how 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.790
 I think this 12 megapixel camera 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.460
 personally when I go to the 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.850
 go gallery can say so that is 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.190
 not sharp but otherwise here 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.560
 for example, the pictures are already 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.580
 very sharp as you would if you were 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.360
 properly focused 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.950
 So that looks great and that for 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.410
 his mobile camera so it definitely 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.220
 great and also a digital camera says 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.050
 I would say 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.060
 here you have the possibility of the whole 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.800
 to process picasa google facebook 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.900
 bluetooth as you want to delete 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.670
 you can do all this here 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.260
 add location 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.890
 tap on the screen and a 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.910
 geo day we do not set now 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:01.070
 So we go back and I go back 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.400
 show you a good look 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:10.160
 sometimes to which you then trigger 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.220
 should you look so back out of that 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.000
 relatively you have seen 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.920
 we'll take a quick look 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.959
 video function as I said you can 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.110
 I do not have any videos yet 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:26.450
 said with a resolution of 1920 x 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.280
 1080 pixels so in full hd and you have 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.380
 her other attitudes and that front 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.269
 video or the normal video camera can 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.280
 you can see her set here 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.630
 change then you have the here 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:43.010
 possibility the light worth 1 the 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:47.709
 change exposure so and here too 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:52.400
 lightning on or off, that's what he's like 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:55.070
 continuously on again from here 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.140
 just film and I'll show you now 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.790
 again a video from outside 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.280
 so I synonymous once an example video 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.600
 gets how good the quality is close 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.610
 further away and I also buzz 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.320
 and all in a resolution of 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.930
 1920 x 1080 pixel 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:17.190
 you can as I said just while you 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.680
 turns and that's what I'm showing now 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.050
 For a moment, here you can 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.700
 by pinch to zoom zoom and I like that 

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:25.620
 always very practical and practical 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.410
 About the volume rocker what you 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.120
 Of course you can do it that way 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.840
 it usually faster 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:35.070
 yes I am now quite a clip 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.830
 from camera 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:42.320
 so that you have seen those too 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:45.420
 the camera and the front camera takes this 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:49.590
 makes videos with a resolution of 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.090
 1280 x 720 pixels its 1.3 megapixels 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:55.230
 camera and take pictures with one 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.520
 resolution of 1280 x 1024 pixels here 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.120
 otherwise you have like me already 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.760
 so have shown some apps and widgets 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.250
 including your gallery here again 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.540
 as a widget and when we get up here 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.520
 options go we also look once 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.290
 where below pictures are landing and so on 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.800
 album then it looks like that 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:16.920
 sorted out by date and so on and 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.360
 so very good a very good one 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.620
 Overview you can see here two pictures 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.660

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.650
 Camera makes good pictures 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.110
