wonder<00:02:49.170> why<00:02:49.410> would<00:02:49.590> they<00:02:49.709> could<00:02:50.070> lie<00:02:50.760> in<00:02:51.180> a

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
wonder why would they could lie in a

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.900 
wonder why would they could lie in a
collision<00:02:54.560> but<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:55.739> also<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.190> time<00:02:56.400> using<00:02:56.670> it

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
collision but so also this time using it

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.660
