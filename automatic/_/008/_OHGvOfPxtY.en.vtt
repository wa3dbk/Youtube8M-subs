 to which a claw can not advance the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:30.250
 video at minute 2 with 50 and with 52 with 50 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.860
 before minute 2 with 50 here below so 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.880
 what good if the law does not matter 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.369
 surely I will continue talking 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:41.020
 with you I want to say that in the video that 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.600
 You're looking now at this moment you 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.490
 say that trips to the future would be 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.130
 fantastic that life was so 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:53.860
 you can change the times leave it in 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:57.759
 pause rewind it backwards or better 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.220
 leave it to the best parts dodging 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.470
 the parts where you wanted to call the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.190
 attention that would be the best parts 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.590
 I think it would be a video 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.869
 then we once did something to 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.640
 draw attention others do with 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.790
 his way of being with his appearance 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.940
 physics et cetera et cetera etcetera 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.130
 simply because we want attention and 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.560
 more we want to draw attention 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.180
 If this video did not have visitors, it did not have 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.610
 comments obviously that we are going to 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.950
 get attention in your next video 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.730
 it does not happen by drawing attention goes through 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.610
 express your way of being feel dream 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.250
 your way of reflecting the world in which 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.100
 you live without limits I think that 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.920
 plan to draw attention or 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.800
 hit someone sounds something very 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.400
 false the aussie you called their attention 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:53.510
 in a natural way they would be for nothing 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.390
 watching this video at minute 2 with 50 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:59.320
 you did not miss anything, it's just 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.840
 that you were going a lot of things that I said 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.330
 just to get your attention and if 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.050
 I did it was not in intention 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.050
 but
