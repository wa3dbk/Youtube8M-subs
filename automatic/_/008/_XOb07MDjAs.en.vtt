are wave and storm influenced Delta's

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.590 
are wave and storm influenced Delta's
where<00:01:18.049> waves<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.830> storm<00:01:19.479> redistribute<00:01:20.479> the

where waves and storm redistribute the
sediment<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.140> change<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.619> geometry<00:01:21.890> and

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
sediment and change the geometry and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.179 
sediment and change the geometry and
they're<00:01:22.970> tight<00:01:23.329> influenced<00:01:24.140> Delta's<00:01:24.770> where

tidal<00:01:25.670> currents<00:01:26.060> are<00:01:26.240> one<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.570> main

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
tidal currents are one of the main

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.380 
tidal currents are one of the main
factors<00:01:27.520> redistributing<00:01:28.520> from<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.150> sediment

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
factors redistributing from the sediment

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.260 
factors redistributing from the sediment
those<00:01:30.110> three<00:01:30.500> types<00:01:31.040> of<00:01:31.189> Delta's<00:01:31.640> have<00:01:31.909> very

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
those three types of Delta's have very

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.929 
those three types of Delta's have very
different<00:01:32.810> geometries<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.280> if<00:01:34.490> you<00:01:34.610> look<00:01:34.759> at<00:01:34.880> a

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
different geometries so if you look at a

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.980 
different geometries so if you look at a
river<00:01:35.380> dominated<00:01:36.380> Delta<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:38.180> end<00:01:38.299> up<00:01:38.540> with

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
river dominated Delta you end up with

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.580 
river dominated Delta you end up with
river<00:01:39.409> channels<00:01:40.899> bringing<00:01:41.899> sediment<00:01:42.470> out

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
river channels bringing sediment out

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.300 
river channels bringing sediment out
they<00:01:43.009> build<00:01:43.280> up<00:01:43.460> levees<00:01:43.970> and<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:45.740> rivers

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
they build up levees and the rivers

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.850 
they build up levees and the rivers
become<00:01:46.759> distributary<00:01:47.600> they<00:01:47.869> branch<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.710> so

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
become distributary they branch and so

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.140 
become distributary they branch and so
you<00:01:48.950> end<00:01:49.130> up<00:01:49.280> with<00:01:49.520> multiple<00:01:49.970> channels

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
you end up with multiple channels

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.690 
you end up with multiple channels
and<00:01:52.270> you<00:01:52.900> end<00:01:53.080> up<00:01:53.290> with<00:01:53.799> bars<00:01:55.409> or<00:01:56.409> at<00:01:57.250> the<00:01:57.430> mouth

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
and you end up with bars or at the mouth

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.030 
and you end up with bars or at the mouth
of<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:58.150> river<00:01:58.299> channels<00:01:58.900> where<00:01:59.500> you<00:01:59.770> have

of the river channels where you have

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.730

very rapid and impatient phase between
