00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
watch his video on his theories on how

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.780 
watch his video on his theories on how
to<00:01:15.630> get<00:01:15.750> better<00:01:15.960> supply<00:01:16.380> drops<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.830> how<00:01:17.729> to

get<00:01:17.970> more<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.360> them<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:18.990> recently<00:01:19.470> did<00:01:19.710> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
get more of them so I recently did a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.230 
get more of them so I recently did a
video<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.280> about<00:01:20.580> two<00:01:20.820> months<00:01:21.060> ago

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
video like this about two months ago

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.300 
video like this about two months ago
with<00:01:21.630> my<00:01:21.780> own<00:01:21.930> theories<00:01:22.439> but<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.860> thought<00:01:23.100> in

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
with my own theories but I thought in

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.700 
with my own theories but I thought in
this<00:01:23.520> game<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.090> I'd<00:01:24.299> put<00:01:24.600> his<00:01:25.080> theories<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
this game here I'd put his theories to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.410 
this game here I'd put his theories to
the<00:01:25.740> test<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.549> drops<00:01:26.790> into<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.000> game<00:01:27.180> here

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the test and drops into the game here

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.810 
the test and drops into the game here
and<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.810> purely<00:01:28.290> made<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> class<00:01:28.860> based<00:01:29.520> on

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
and I purely made a class based on

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.330 
and I purely made a class based on
challenges<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:30.630> i<00:01:30.869> use<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.439> ASM<00:01:31.890> one<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.310> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
challenges so i use the ASM one as a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.670 
challenges so i use the ASM one as a
primary<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.030> a<00:01:33.329> vow<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.079> second<00:01:34.500> three

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
primary and a vow as the second three

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.230 
primary and a vow as the second three
guns<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.220> i<00:01:35.280> hadn't<00:01:35.670> really<00:01:35.820> used<00:01:36.030> much

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
guns that i hadn't really used much

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.520 
guns that i hadn't really used much
throughout<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.570> prestige<00:01:36.930> hoping<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.439> get

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
throughout this prestige hoping to get

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.170 
throughout this prestige hoping to get
some<00:01:37.680> challenges<00:01:38.130> done<00:01:38.310> in<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.549> game<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:39.090> if

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
some challenges done in this game see if

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.460 
some challenges done in this game see if
I'd<00:01:39.240> get<00:01:39.420> any<00:01:39.540> supply<00:01:39.810> drops<00:01:40.049> this<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.290> one<00:01:40.439> of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
I'd get any supply drops this is one of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.770 
I'd get any supply drops this is one of
the<00:01:40.619> theories<00:01:40.890> that<00:01:41.159> I<00:01:41.490> tan<00:01:41.909> kid<00:01:42.180> came<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.600> with

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the theories that I tan kid came up with

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.780 
the theories that I tan kid came up with
as<00:01:42.990> well<00:01:43.200> as<00:01:43.290> myself<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.159> I<00:01:44.189> put<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.460> one<00:01:44.640> to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
as well as myself so I put this one to

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.010 
as well as myself so I put this one to
the<00:01:44.880> test<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:45.180> as<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.509> I<00:01:45.570> get<00:01:45.869> my

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
the test and as you can see I get my

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.749 
the test and as you can see I get my
first<00:01:46.290> supply<00:01:46.560> drop<00:01:46.770> here<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.640> was

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
first supply drop here and it was

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.639 
first supply drop here and it was
actually<00:01:48.030> because<00:01:48.329> I<00:01:48.509> went<00:01:49.170> on<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> death

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
actually because I went on a death

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.280 
actually because I went on a death
streak<00:01:49.890> now<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.100> got<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.520> theory<00:01:50.790> that

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
streak now I got this theory that

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.510 
streak now I got this theory that
because<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.439> did<00:01:52.619> really<00:01:52.890> really<00:01:53.009> well<00:01:53.220> in<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
because I did really really well in the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.160 
because I did really really well in the
game's<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.970> coming<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.570> game<00:01:54.899> I

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
game's up coming to this game I

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.440 
game's up coming to this game I
purposely<00:01:56.070> went<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> massive<00:01:56.790> des<00:01:57.149> tricks

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
purposely went on a massive des tricks

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.990 
purposely went on a massive des tricks
here<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:58.079> see<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.530> anything<00:01:59.040> would<00:01:59.130> change<00:01:59.189> now

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
here to see if anything would change now

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.330 
here to see if anything would change now
on<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.540> 7th<00:02:00.930> def<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.560> it<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:02.040> managed

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
on the 7th def I think it is I managed

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.709 
on the 7th def I think it is I managed
to<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.520> more<00:02:02.640> support<00:02:02.939> now<00:02:03.240> what<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> think

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
to get more support now what I think

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.389 
to get more support now what I think
happens<00:02:04.079> is<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.740> do<00:02:05.009> really<00:02:05.310> really

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
happens is that you do really really

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:06.830 
happens is that you do really really
well<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.820> the<00:02:05.909> game's<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.329> coming<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.659> this

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
well in the game's up coming to this

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.930 
well in the game's up coming to this
game<00:02:07.170> say<00:02:07.860> like<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> kds<00:02:08.520> that<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.729> was

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
game say like the kds that I was

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.669 
game say like the kds that I was
produced<00:02:09.330> in<00:02:09.450> which<00:02:09.690> were<00:02:09.869> pretty<00:02:10.440> good

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
produced in which were pretty good

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.650 
produced in which were pretty good
against<00:02:11.280> really<00:02:11.459> good<00:02:11.550> players<00:02:11.879> now<00:02:12.390> that's

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
against really good players now that's

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.880 
against really good players now that's
where<00:02:12.870> I<00:02:12.900> get<00:02:13.260> my<00:02:13.290> first

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
where I get my first

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.380 
where I get my first
supply<00:02:14.250> drop<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.580> was<00:02:14.730> because<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.090> amount<00:02:15.240> of

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
supply drop it was because the amount of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.210 
supply drop it was because the amount of
deaths<00:02:15.660> i<00:02:15.840> get<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.319> is<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> theory<00:02:16.860> though

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
deaths i get so this is a theory though

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.980 
deaths i get so this is a theory though
i<00:02:17.310> came<00:02:17.580> up<00:02:17.700> with<00:02:17.880> in<00:02:18.030> my<00:02:18.120> video<00:02:18.390> as<00:02:18.600> well<00:02:18.660> as<00:02:18.870> i

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
i came up with in my video as well as i

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.530 
i came up with in my video as well as i
attain<00:02:19.290> kid<00:02:19.560> where<00:02:19.830> i<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:20.190> my<00:02:20.220> second<00:02:20.940> supply

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
attain kid where i get my second supply

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.270 
attain kid where i get my second supply
drop<00:02:21.959> by<00:02:22.170> drop<00:02:22.230> here<00:02:22.560> which<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.890> actually<00:02:23.040> get

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
drop by drop here which I actually get

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.670 
drop by drop here which I actually get
and<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.459> don't<00:02:23.880> know<00:02:24.120> why<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.840> randomly<00:02:25.260> came<00:02:25.470> up

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
and I don't know why it randomly came up

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.230 
and I don't know why it randomly came up
so<00:02:25.860> in<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.430> order<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.670> i<00:02:26.819> got<00:02:27.000> these<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
so in the order that i got these the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.699 
so in the order that i got these the
first<00:02:27.480> one<00:02:27.690> came<00:02:27.870> in<00:02:27.930> and<00:02:28.140> I<00:02:28.350> was<00:02:28.440> like<00:02:28.560> okay

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
first one came in and I was like okay

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.860 
first one came in and I was like okay
that's<00:02:29.550> kind<00:02:29.850> of<00:02:29.940> normal<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.480> second<00:02:30.780> one

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
that's kind of normal the second one

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.240 
that's kind of normal the second one
came<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.110> i<00:02:31.320> thought<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.890> know<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.130> happens

every now and again you do gets to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.000 
every now and again you do gets to
supply<00:02:34.050> drops<00:02:34.290> in<00:02:34.380> one<00:02:34.500> game<00:02:34.680> it's<00:02:34.860> not

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
supply drops in one game it's not

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.520 
supply drops in one game it's not
unheard<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.760> it's<00:02:35.970> not<00:02:36.180> unknown<00:02:36.570> does<00:02:37.260> happen

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
just looks at the screen for about a

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.650 
just looks at the screen for about a
minute<00:02:44.310> after<00:02:44.520> this<00:02:44.819> because<00:02:45.120> i<00:02:45.300> didn't<00:02:45.569> know

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
minute after this because i didn't know

what to do I was like is this ever
happened<00:02:48.030> before<00:02:48.060> free<00:02:48.510> supply<00:02:48.870> drops<00:02:49.170> in<00:02:49.350> one

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
happened before free supply drops in one
