00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
unfortunately punching these guys out

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.959 
unfortunately punching these guys out
counts<00:00:49.110> as<00:00:49.230> kills<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.610> have<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.850> go

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
counts as kills and then you have to go

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.000

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
a total of 13 kills all around so you

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.760 
a total of 13 kills all around so you
can<00:01:00.210> only<00:01:00.329> kill<00:01:00.600> two<00:01:00.870> people<00:01:00.899> when<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.590> eat<00:01:01.649> on

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
gives you some information tells you to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.490 
gives you some information tells you to
go<00:01:44.750> down<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.230> harbour

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
go down to the harbour

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.910 
go down to the harbour
so<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:48.590> swim<00:01:48.770> out<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.070> boat<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:54.680> is

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
so you swim out to the boat and this is

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.290 
so you swim out to the boat and this is
the<00:01:55.160> approach<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.610> I<00:01:56.180> take<00:01:57.430> to<00:01:58.430> infiltrating

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
the approach that I take to infiltrating

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.970 
the approach that I take to infiltrating
the<00:01:59.420> boat<00:02:00.370> now<00:02:01.370> for<00:02:01.820> some<00:02:02.830> nonsense

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
the boat now for some nonsense

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.420 
the boat now for some nonsense
arbitrary<00:02:04.640> reason<00:02:05.360> you<00:02:05.630> have<00:02:05.870> to<00:02:06.080> go<00:02:06.230> out<00:02:06.500> on<00:02:06.860> a

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
arbitrary reason you have to go out on a

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.160 
arbitrary reason you have to go out on a
certain<00:02:07.850> part<00:02:08.210> of<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.390> boat<00:02:08.600> where<00:02:08.899> there's<00:02:09.110> a

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
certain part of the boat where there's a

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.990 
certain part of the boat where there's a
patrolling<00:02:09.560> guard<00:02:09.950> which<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.460> just<00:02:10.640> fucking

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
patrolling guard which is just fucking

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.630 
patrolling guard which is just fucking
annoying<00:02:14.590> even<00:02:15.590> though<00:02:15.800> I'm<00:02:15.980> about<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.430> pass

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
annoying even though I'm about to pass

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.760 
annoying even though I'm about to pass
like<00:02:17.060> right<00:02:17.450> by<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:17.840> spot<00:02:18.500> that<00:02:19.270> I<00:02:20.500> have<00:02:21.500> to<00:02:21.650> go

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
like right by the spot that I have to go

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.920 
like right by the spot that I have to go
immediately<00:02:21.920> afterwards<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:23.210> still<00:02:23.630> have<00:02:23.780> to

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
immediately afterwards I still have to

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:35.660 
immediately afterwards I still have to
go<00:02:24.050> out<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.470> back<00:02:24.680> of<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:24.920> boat

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
there but it's sort of a non-issue he'll

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:54.920 
there but it's sort of a non-issue he'll
turn<00:02:43.920> around<00:02:43.980> eventually

long<00:03:16.510> as<00:03:16.659> you<00:03:16.750> get<00:03:16.900> down<00:03:17.319> to<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.680> other<00:03:17.799> side

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
long as you get down to the other side

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
of the roof and across here you won't

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.750 
of the roof and across here you won't
actually<00:03:20.950> get<00:03:21.250> detected<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:23.489> then<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.609> have

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
actually get detected and then you have

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.550 
actually get detected and then you have
to<00:03:24.909> go<00:03:25.030> down<00:03:25.269> to<00:03:25.510> this<00:03:25.690> little<00:03:25.989> spot<00:03:26.290> right

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
to go down to this little spot right

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.220 
to go down to this little spot right
here<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:30.480> then<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.569> got<00:03:31.720> to<00:03:31.810> go<00:03:31.930> do<00:03:32.109> a<00:03:32.139> little

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
here and then you got to go do a little

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.110 
here and then you got to go do a little
eavesdropping<00:03:32.980> of<00:03:33.220> these<00:03:33.489> men<00:03:33.790> at<00:03:33.940> me

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
eavesdropping of these men at me

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.220 
eavesdropping of these men at me
requirements<00:03:35.760> now<00:03:36.760> ii<00:03:37.329> eavesdrop<00:03:37.900> in<00:03:38.079> this

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
requirements now ii eavesdrop in this

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.129 
requirements now ii eavesdrop in this
one<00:03:38.409> actually<00:03:38.590> fucked<00:03:39.069> up<00:03:39.250> on<00:03:39.459> me<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:39.939> we<00:03:40.510> we

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
one actually fucked up on me so we we

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:45.030 
one actually fucked up on me so we we
had<00:03:41.379> to<00:03:41.530> reload<00:03:41.950> and<00:03:42.129> check<00:03:42.370> it<00:03:43.739> at<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.859> very

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
had to reload and check it at the very

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.890 
had to reload and check it at the very
least<00:03:45.400> this<00:03:45.670> game<00:03:45.909> allows<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.569> reload

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
least this game allows you to reload

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.379 
least this game allows you to reload
reload<00:03:47.409> checkpoints<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.489> still<00:03:48.700> get<00:03:48.939> 100%

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
reload checkpoints and still get 100%

00:03:49.389 --> 00:04:13.260 
reload checkpoints and still get 100%
sing

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.090 

so<00:04:14.260> with<00:04:14.410> that<00:04:14.590> eavesdrop<00:04:15.220> done<00:04:15.520> I'm<00:04:15.700> gonna<00:04:15.850> go

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
so with that eavesdrop done I'm gonna go

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.740 
so with that eavesdrop done I'm gonna go
we're<00:04:18.100> here<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:21.220> I'm<00:04:21.610> gonna<00:04:21.730> kill<00:04:22.090> this<00:04:22.420> guard

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
we're here and I'm gonna kill this guard

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.690 
we're here and I'm gonna kill this guard
that's<00:04:23.140> standing<00:04:23.620> here<00:04:23.860> because<00:04:24.100> I<00:04:24.490> don't

that's standing here because I don't

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.720 
that's standing here because I don't
