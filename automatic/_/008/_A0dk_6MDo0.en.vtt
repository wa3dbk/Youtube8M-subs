00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:07.440
 but a video about the little test 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.360
 let's say if I can ever 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.110
 criterion has no qualification 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.260
 will not need it instead of 17 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.980
 let's say my perceptions about the 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.390
 change is in this case an upgrade of the three 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.570
 rear disc 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:30.510
 The girl is in town like I said in there. 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.110
 first video in the city 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.780
 I did not realize much difference except 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.040
 an improvement in the hand brake 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.969
 seems to be stronger is my shoulder 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.969
 was regulated 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.429
 you have a distinct impression that he 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.800
 It's stronger because it 's stronger. 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:58.039
 I do not know if I can say so but he 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.329
 better safe then cold of it he is 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.920
 risk 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.640
 When are you using the car at? 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.770
 movement on the hydraulic part and brake 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:12.860
 a steel cable that has a shoe 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:15.140
 snow the canvas there in the crux of the disk is just 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:19.039
 for the parking brake 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:22.190
 I'm taking a little trip on the 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.679
 city does not feel much difference 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.259
 however in the small stretches in which you 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:31.549
 manages to develop the 80's speed 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.479
 and 90 to 100 per hour that you use the 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.539
 brake 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.940
 I felt a difference that the rear 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:42.860
 He does not get up so much that he seems 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:45.439
 come more so more together 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:49.130
 it's as if a rear disc brake it 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:53.750
 only a joke descends a feeling of 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.860
 stop over was the best so he he 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.920
 give a guided tour 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.899
 the prisoner was at 80 to 100 per hour and 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.720
 You step on the brake to 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.679
 enter for access or make another 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.869
 change 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:10.580
 Do you feel the car does not come all the way? 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.440
 in front he goes more equally 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.340
 a very great concern in relation to 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.080
 to brake and many cars and that 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.930
 really happens 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.760
 but of the meriva as the valve 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:27.060
 then the equalizer return of the brakes 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.579
 it was to the plenary it is the same valve 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.610
 both for the rear disc brake 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:36.150
 how much is the disc as a drum because 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.599
 the design of the measure was already used 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.700
 the four- wheel disc brake is both 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.890
 that the first of the first girls to 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.950
 were 1.8 16 valves 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.519
 she had optional and over time 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.549
 logical mock also in a cost cut 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:56.940
 get out of the project is either taken as 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.400
 optional but you had to adapt 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.260
 It was perfect for me, it was perfect. 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.159
 It's like I said in another video only. 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.549
 I needed to change the flexible side of the brake 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.459
 which is little shorter than the 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.190
 Original girl and I bought a shaft 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.569
 complete of a vectra 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.260
 so I took a full month of one 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.970
 Vectra rear complete and 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.010
 it was even funny because 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.760
 there was the same audience of abs wheel 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:32.099
 baby vectra driver is out like this 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.230
 How I bought what all this 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.739
 background the component after 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.139
 I put his wheel hub with abs 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.090
 on meriva nÃ© 

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:45.239
 After I changed I put a path 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.940
 original fits the same way it is 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.889
 interchangeable be whatever you 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.680
 use a hub hub I bought 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:57.359
 of the vectra while the axis of the meriva are 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.859
 I even bought the kit 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.329
 complete a tear-off as this is more 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.829
 cheap than you buy the parts 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.780
 new 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:06.569
 in these new way of getting almost two thousand 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.790
 real there is already mailable you do 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.419
 transformation while I paid 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.730
 $ 500 a full axle of vega bring a 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:18.100
 full of old 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.620
 so ok the transformation was pretty cool 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.530
 very cool 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.040
 Okay, you do not have to run much more by 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.190
 example when you brake here 3rd japan 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:33.729
 Do you feel that the car is more 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.580
 controlled is it brakes more equally 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.690
 I did not like the result I liked 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.540
 too much 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.639
 are many people talked that does not give 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.000
 difference that the girl's brake is already good 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.590
 really frei is good but sometimes it gives 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.650
 for you to improve a little something here 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.940
 little thing there, did not do not do any 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.949
 change in the engine that justified this 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.710
 change the disk you normally 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:01.510
 puts a disc brake on the rear for 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.110
 that you did not change your power 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.500
 total 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.600
 I really wanted to look at it more. 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.180
 aesthetics stay but I believe in 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.060
 my opinion is more beautiful car with 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:16.080
 four- wheel disc brakes up to 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.180
 you care for brake caliper there is more 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:22.240
 it looks more like the most beautiful 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:26.130
 than paint the drum of the same thing I 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.130
 I think I particularly ugly 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.160
 then the next step will be to paint the 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.580
 tweezers I can a new video but it was 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.320
 more to show you guys this one 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.660
 difference 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.100
 rainy weather today in sÃ£o paulo 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.410
 today May 24 did this video is 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.139
 but to show the people that 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:52.590
 beauty change 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:55.160
 Good weekend for everyone and a 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.160
 big hug
