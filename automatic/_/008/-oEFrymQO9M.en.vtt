00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.390 
concept of this episode out of the way
in<00:01:23.759> my<00:01:24.210> opinion<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.930> death<00:01:25.259> was<00:01:25.530> poorly

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
in my opinion the death was poorly

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
in my opinion the death was poorly
handled<00:01:26.850> there<00:01:27.689> just<00:01:27.900> wasn't<00:01:28.080> enough<00:01:28.290> build

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
handled there just wasn't enough build

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.130 
handled there just wasn't enough build
up<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.070> into<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.479> just<00:01:30.720> felt<00:01:30.900> that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
up to into it so it just felt that

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.560 
up to into it so it just felt that
didn't<00:01:31.409> have<00:01:31.560> much<00:01:31.770> heart<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.490> which<00:01:33.299> is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
didn't have much heart to it which is

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.630 
didn't have much heart to it which is
varying<00:01:34.079> with<00:01:34.590> very<00:01:35.040> unfortunate

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
varying with very unfortunate

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.550

disappointment<00:01:36.360> think<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.259> bothers<00:01:37.530> me

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
disappointment think that bothers me

since<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.790> didn't<00:02:06.210> focus<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.960> since<00:02:07.560> they

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
since it didn't focus on it since they

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.229 
since it didn't focus on it since they
didn't<00:02:08.009> focus<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.610> enough<00:02:08.819> that's<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.209> I
