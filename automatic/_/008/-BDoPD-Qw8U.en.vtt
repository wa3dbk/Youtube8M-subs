you see what it looks like how we get
something<00:00:11.190> like<00:00:11.460> this

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.670 

next<00:00:17.270> step<00:00:17.480> is<00:00:17.750> opening<00:00:18.260> up<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.530> front

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
packing the wire loops and you see the

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.830 
packing the wire loops and you see the
wire<00:00:22.340> runs<00:00:22.610> through<00:00:22.940> the<00:00:23.090> back<00:00:23.300> right<00:00:23.570> here

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.290 
breaker so take the face this particular
one<00:00:32.330> has<00:00:32.480> Balboa<00:00:32.960> in<00:00:33.290> it<00:00:33.440> so<00:00:33.650> we're<00:00:33.830> gonna

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
one has Balboa in it so we're gonna

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.540

and do the hot wires to the Balboa and

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.790 
and do the hot wires to the Balboa and
the<00:00:37.640> ground<00:00:37.880> and<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.210> neutral<00:00:38.570> as<00:00:39.530> we're

bottom of the tub facing beyond the

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.950 
bottom of the tub facing beyond the
thali<00:01:31.760> so<00:01:32.090> what<00:01:32.240> we're<00:01:32.360> going<00:01:32.510> to<00:01:32.540> do<00:01:32.660> is<00:01:32.780> flip

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
thali so what we're going to do is flip

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.740 
thali so what we're going to do is flip
it<00:01:33.080> up<00:01:33.320> on<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.680> young<00:01:34.119> Teflon<00:01:35.119> slider

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
it up on the young Teflon slider

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.920 
it up on the young Teflon slider
spin<00:01:36.410> it<00:01:36.530> around<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.190> then<00:01:37.400> dalian<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.119> just

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
spin it around and then dalian so just

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:59.680 
spin it around and then dalian so just
once<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:39.619> learn<00:01:42.160> you<00:01:43.160> should<00:01:43.190> legs<00:01:43.550> when<00:01:43.850> you
