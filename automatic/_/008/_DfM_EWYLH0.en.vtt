some<00:01:52.320> points<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.220> similar<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.970> don't<00:01:54.659> think

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
some points for I similar I don't think

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.899 
some points for I similar I don't think
that<00:01:55.020> they<00:01:55.530> will<00:01:55.740> win<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.130> match<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.670> only

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
that they will win this match the only

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.590 
that they will win this match the only
question<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.979> is<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.070> lot<00:01:59.280> eh<00:01:59.670> to<00:02:00.240> win<00:02:00.420> this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
question if it is a lot eh to win this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.330 
question if it is a lot eh to win this
match<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.500> think<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.860> they<00:02:01.979> will<00:02:02.159> win

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
match and I think that they will win

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.179 
match and I think that they will win
this<00:02:02.579> match<00:02:02.930> but<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.079> will<00:02:04.259> be<00:02:04.380> hard<00:02:04.619> from<00:02:04.920> both

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
this match but it will be hard from both

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.730 
this match but it will be hard from both
sides<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.060> will<00:02:06.630> assist<00:02:07.049> at<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.259> great

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
sides and will assist at the great

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.779 
sides and will assist at the great
spectacle

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
spectacle

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.209 
spectacle

home win here last year's home record is
strong<00:02:13.680> 2.45<00:02:14.670> good<00:02:15.060> odds<00:02:15.209> but<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:16.409> know<00:02:16.500> would

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
strong 2.45 good odds but you know would

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.069 
strong 2.45 good odds but you know would
you<00:02:16.769> be<00:02:16.890> tempted<00:02:17.099> with<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.579> draw<00:02:17.819> you<00:02:18.569> know

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
you be tempted with the draw you know

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:21.860 
you be tempted with the draw you know
what<00:02:19.290> I<00:02:19.319> said<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.739> you<00:02:19.769> I<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:20.450> it's<00:02:21.450> more

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
what I said to you I think it's more

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.690 
what I said to you I think it's more
likely<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.650> happen<00:02:22.859> that<00:02:23.069> they<00:02:23.340> are<00:02:23.430> here

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
likely to happen that they are here

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.300 
likely to happen that they are here
between<00:02:23.939> those<00:02:24.299> two<00:02:24.450> things<00:02:24.769> okay<00:02:25.769> well<00:02:26.129> the

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
between those two things okay well the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.460 
between those two things okay well the
question<00:02:26.489> is<00:02:26.819> is<00:02:27.060> kinda<00:02:27.540> lat<00:02:27.659> co<00:02:27.840> keep<00:02:28.079> a<00:02:28.200> clean

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
question is is kinda lat co keep a clean

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.199 
question is is kinda lat co keep a clean
sheet<00:02:28.500> could<00:02:29.069> it<00:02:29.129> end<00:02:29.250> up<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.519> nil<00:02:29.730> nil<00:02:29.909> maybe

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
sheet could it end up in nil nil maybe

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.750 
sheet could it end up in nil nil maybe
or<00:02:30.480> we'll<00:02:31.019> both<00:02:31.200> teams<00:02:31.530> score<00:02:31.859> priced<00:02:32.099> at<00:02:32.250> 1.85

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
or we'll both teams score priced at 1.85

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.319 
or we'll both teams score priced at 1.85
with<00:02:33.180> 888<00:02:33.569> sport<00:02:33.599> I<00:02:34.400> think<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.000> Boston

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
with 888 sport I think that the Boston

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.390 
with 888 sport I think that the Boston
more<00:02:36.689> scoring<00:02:36.989> this<00:02:37.200> data<00:02:37.470> became<00:02:37.799> from<00:02:38.069> Syria

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
more scoring this data became from Syria

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.250 
more scoring this data became from Syria
both<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:39.000> them<00:02:39.209> have<00:02:39.450> strong<00:02:39.719> offensive

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
both of them have strong offensive

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.770 
both of them have strong offensive
players<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:40.859> I<00:02:41.340> think<00:02:41.370> various<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> perfect

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
players and I think various is a perfect

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
draw if you don't think it's going to

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:54.649

lend<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.879> a<00:02:53.939> draw<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.180> you<00:02:54.269> see<00:02:54.389> that<00:02:54.510> last

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
lend it a draw and you see that last

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.929 
lend it a draw and you see that last
year<00:02:54.840> will<00:02:55.109> will<00:02:55.650> win<00:02:55.859> here<00:02:56.099> with<00:02:56.250> goals<00:02:56.459> we've

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
year will will win here with goals we've

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.220 
year will will win here with goals we've
got<00:02:57.090> last<00:02:57.299> year<00:02:57.480> minus<00:02:57.720> 0.75<00:02:58.650> at<00:02:59.069> 2.75<00:02:59.909> or

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
got last year minus 0.75 at 2.75 or

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.280 
got last year minus 0.75 at 2.75 or
minus<00:03:01.230> 1<00:03:01.530> at<00:03:01.939> 3.7<00:03:02.939> these<00:03:03.450> are<00:03:03.629> good<00:03:03.870> odds<00:03:04.019> but

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
minus 1 at 3.7 these are good odds but

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.319 
minus 1 at 3.7 these are good odds but
why<00:03:04.530> are<00:03:04.769> they<00:03:04.950> high<00:03:05.159> is<00:03:05.459> an<00:03:05.639> indication<00:03:06.000> that

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
why are they high is an indication that

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.740 
why are they high is an indication that
it<00:03:06.599> could<00:03:06.750> end<00:03:06.840> in<00:03:06.989> a<00:03:07.079> draw<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:09.150> odds<00:03:09.329> are<00:03:09.510> so

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
it could end in a draw the odds are so

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.740 
it could end in a draw the odds are so
high<00:03:09.989> because<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.439> book<00:03:10.769> is<00:03:10.950> loaded<00:03:11.430> AC<00:03:12.150> Milan

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
high because the book is loaded AC Milan

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.719 
high because the book is loaded AC Milan
is<00:03:12.959> still<00:03:13.260> a<00:03:13.290> good<00:03:13.650> team<00:03:13.979> even<00:03:14.370> if<00:03:14.489> they<00:03:14.639> are

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:14.729 
is still a good team even if they are

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:17.990 
is still a good team even if they are
passing<00:03:14.940> car<00:03:15.389> times<00:03:15.659> and<00:03:16.400> they'll<00:03:17.400> also<00:03:17.609> that

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
passing car times and they'll also that

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.930 
passing car times and they'll also that
is<00:03:18.150> a<00:03:18.180> derby<00:03:18.720> match<00:03:19.079> in<00:03:19.260> Italy<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.340> this<00:03:20.579> is<00:03:20.760> why

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
is a derby match in Italy so this is why
