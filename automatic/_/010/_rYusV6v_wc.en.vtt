00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.600
 Hello, Sir, Welcome to the modest cuisine 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.520
 in this section we have a very easy catering recipe 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.520
 We're going to share the "Twig of Olive" 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.520
 But if you want to have a look at the required material first 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.840
 8 pcs square puff pastry 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.840
 3 tablespoons olive paste 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.120
 3 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.720
 and 1 teaspoon of red paprika 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.160
 For the above; 1 piece of egg 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:54.960
 for the olive auger, we begin by mixing our olive paste and other ingredients 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.960
 our flakes ... 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:15.680
 and 3 tablespoons of olive oil and bring together 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.560
 now we take our milfÃ¶y dough 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.560
 we solved a little 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.960
 sprinkle some flour 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.120
 we cut in half 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.600
 and with the help of roller we are slightly expanding 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:02:00.080
 we are now preparing our olive paste 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.640
 verev 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.440
 we've completed our augers 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.680
 We said we have 1 egg 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.080
 break and whisk as a whole 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.400
 and pushing 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.920
 Now let's give it to the 190 degree oven we're preheating 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.920
 20 minutes later 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.920
 olives 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.320
 we cooked about 20 minutes 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.080
 but still I suggest you cook 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.120
 we can serve with a nice brewed tea or lemonade 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.840
 We shared the description of "Twig with Olive" 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.280
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.680
 goodbye...
