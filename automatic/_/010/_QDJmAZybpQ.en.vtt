00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.980 
and the diopters are way bigger way
bigger<00:01:33.819> is<00:01:34.819> if<00:01:35.030> I<00:01:35.149> can

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.470 

catch<00:01:39.590> it<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.010> a<00:01:40.070> light<00:01:40.310> just<00:01:40.610> right<00:01:41.180> maybe

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
catch it and a light just right maybe

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
and they're still not perfect but

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.220 
and they're still not perfect but
they're<00:01:51.130> a<00:01:51.160> lot<00:01:51.400> better<00:01:51.970> than<00:01:52.360> these<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:56.050> then

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 
because the glass is too curved but plus

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.009

it's pretty damn cold out here you know
these<00:03:48.200> are<00:03:48.379> really<00:03:48.769> they're<00:03:49.159> hard<00:03:49.370> to<00:03:49.489> bend

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
these are really they're hard to bend

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.250 
these are really they're hard to bend
and<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.060> don't<00:03:50.239> want<00:03:50.359> to<00:03:50.450> bend<00:03:50.629> it<00:03:50.810> too<00:03:50.989> hard

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
and I don't want to bend it too hard

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.179 
and I don't want to bend it too hard
because<00:03:51.470> I<00:03:52.129> don't<00:03:52.879> want<00:03:53.060> Mariko<00:03:55.030> so<00:03:56.030> I<00:03:57.189> like

00:03:58.179 --> 00:03:58.189 
because I don't want Mariko so I like

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.430 
because I don't want Mariko so I like
the<00:03:58.370> idea

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.030 

but<00:04:03.070> I<00:04:03.600> would<00:04:04.600> need<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.840> pair<00:04:05.170> of<00:04:05.290> glasses<00:04:05.530> like

but I would need a pair of glasses like
this<00:04:06.520> with<00:04:06.820> a<00:04:06.850> with<00:04:07.240> a<00:04:07.270> flat<00:04:07.600> lens<00:04:08.700> for<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.790> to

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
this with a with a flat lens for it to

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.510 
this with a with a flat lens for it to
work<00:04:10.090> so<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:11.470> guess<00:04:11.770> I'm<00:04:11.950> just<00:04:12.070> gonna<00:04:12.250> have<00:04:12.490> to
