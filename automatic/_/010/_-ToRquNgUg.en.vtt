you<00:02:02.670> up<00:02:02.880> alright<00:02:03.979> so<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.790> do<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.119> with<00:02:06.240> this

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
you up alright so if you do it with this

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.450 
you up alright so if you do it with this
for<00:02:07.259> some<00:02:07.590> reason

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.540 

you<00:02:10.490> can<00:02:10.610> see<00:02:10.820> it<00:02:11.090> doesn't<00:02:11.450> give<00:02:11.990> you<00:02:12.200> one<00:02:12.550> but

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
you can see it doesn't give you one but

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.160 
you can see it doesn't give you one but
for<00:02:13.880> every<00:02:14.210> other<00:02:14.360> one<00:02:14.570> that's<00:02:14.750> how<00:02:14.930> you<00:02:14.990> make

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
for every other one that's how you make

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.620 
for every other one that's how you make
them<00:02:15.320> so<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.670> like<00:02:16.760> really<00:02:16.820> good<00:02:17.180> for

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
them so this is like really good for

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.000 
them so this is like really good for
like<00:02:17.660> if<00:02:18.110> you<00:02:18.260> want<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.470> make<00:02:18.590> your<00:02:18.710> house<00:02:18.890> look

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
better so it doesn't have these white

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.200 
better so it doesn't have these white
