00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
got a bit of rotorcraft power here and

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.870 
got a bit of rotorcraft power here and
I've<00:03:05.859> got<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.430> I<00:03:07.000> for<00:03:07.329> God's<00:03:07.510> call<00:03:08.700> this<00:03:09.700> is

mob.org<00:03:16.170> 3<00:03:17.170> crap<00:03:17.650> here<00:03:18.459> we<00:03:18.549> go<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:19.090> is<00:03:19.600> a

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
mob.org 3 crap here we go it is a

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.120 
mob.org 3 crap here we go it is a
induction<00:03:20.769> generator<00:03:21.730> and<00:03:22.889> as<00:03:23.889> you<00:03:24.010> can<00:03:24.100> see

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
induction generator and as you can see

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.970 
induction generator and as you can see
it's<00:03:24.370> got<00:03:24.489> a<00:03:24.519> copper<00:03:24.790> cable<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:25.859> it's<00:03:26.859> got

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
it's got a copper cable and it's got

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.590 
it's got a copper cable and it's got
another<00:03:27.190> cable<00:03:27.400> but<00:03:27.639> this<00:03:27.760> cable<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.209> the

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
another cable but this cable is the

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.809 
another cable but this cable is the
insulated<00:03:29.230> type<00:03:29.410> as<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:30.370> can<00:03:30.430> see<00:03:30.609> these<00:03:30.760> are

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
insulated type as you can see these are

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.119 
insulated type as you can see these are
all<00:03:31.060> the<00:03:31.150> insulated<00:03:31.690> versions<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.319> the<00:03:32.560> cables

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
all the insulated versions of the cables

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.940 
all the insulated versions of the cables
i<00:03:33.220> showed<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.489> before

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
i showed you before

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.089 
i showed you before
and<00:03:35.390> then<00:03:36.390> it's<00:03:36.660> got<00:03:36.810> a<00:03:36.989> induction<00:03:37.680> motor

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
and then it's got a induction motor

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.050 
and then it's got a induction motor
which<00:03:38.790> is<00:03:38.940> output<00:03:39.360> in<00:03:39.480> our<00:03:40.110> to<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.980> gearbox<00:03:41.640> and

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
which is output in our to a gearbox and

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.920 
which is output in our to a gearbox and
you<00:03:42.930> can<00:03:43.080> use<00:03:43.230> an<00:03:43.349> angular<00:03:43.739> transducer<00:03:44.930> to

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
you can use an angular transducer to

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.890 
you can use an angular transducer to
determine<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.640> power<00:03:47.640> going<00:03:47.879> into<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.239> soak

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
determine the power going into it soak

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.570 
determine the power going into it soak
up<00:03:49.160> about<00:03:50.160> eight<00:03:50.400> million<00:03:50.640> watts<00:03:51.200> going<00:03:52.200> at

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
up about eight million watts going at

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.370 
up about eight million watts going at
1024<00:03:53.580> brads<00:03:53.819> and<00:03:54.090> if<00:03:54.720> we<00:03:54.780> look<00:03:54.870> at<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.080> cable

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
1024 brads and if we look at the cable

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.030 
1024 brads and if we look at the cable
we<00:03:55.530> can<00:03:55.650> see<00:03:55.830> that<00:03:56.010> it's<00:03:57.000> amperage<00:03:57.390> is<00:03:57.800> 124<00:03:58.800> and

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
we can see that it's amperage is 124 and

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.710 
we can see that it's amperage is 124 and
so<00:04:00.680> the<00:04:01.790> rads<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:03.209> go<00:04:03.330> into<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:04.069> equals<00:04:05.069> the

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
so the rads that go into it equals the

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.860 
so the rads that go into it equals the
amperage<00:04:06.720> oh<00:04:07.970> no<00:04:08.970> not<00:04:09.180> sorry<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.510> roads<00:04:09.690> it's

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
amperage oh no not sorry the roads it's

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.229 
amperage oh no not sorry the roads it's
not<00:04:12.260> it's<00:04:13.280> actually<00:04:14.280> if<00:04:14.730> we<00:04:14.790> look<00:04:14.970> at<00:04:15.090> the

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
not it's actually if we look at the

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.199 
not it's actually if we look at the
machine<00:04:16.139> here<00:04:17.540> the<00:04:18.540> rads<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.870> go<00:04:18.989> into<00:04:19.169> it

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:20.209 
machine here the rads that go into it

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:29.890 
machine here the rads that go into it
equals<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:23.960> equals<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.080> average<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:27.919> the

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
equals the equals the average and the

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:39.710 
equals the equals the average and the
voltage<00:04:34.729> equals<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:35.970> talk<00:04:36.300> oh<00:04:38.419> no<00:04:39.419> sorry

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
voltage equals the talk oh no sorry

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.490 
voltage equals the talk oh no sorry
sorry<00:04:39.990> my<00:04:40.289> bad<00:04:40.470> my<00:04:40.830> bad<00:04:40.860> stuffed<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:41.850> up<00:04:41.940> again

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
sorry my bad my bad stuffed it up again

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.760 
sorry my bad my bad stuffed it up again
it's<00:04:43.500> confusing<00:04:43.889> it's<00:04:44.130> not<00:04:44.310> reversed<00:04:45.770> the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
it's confusing it's not reversed the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.700 
it's confusing it's not reversed the
speed<00:04:48.200> here<00:04:49.200> a<00:04:49.410> few<00:04:50.039> times<00:04:50.100> by<00:04:50.639> eight<00:04:51.710> will

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
speed here a few times by eight will

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.420 
speed here a few times by eight will
give<00:04:52.919> you<00:04:53.039> the<00:04:53.220> voltage<00:04:54.080> so<00:04:55.080> the<00:04:55.740> speed<00:04:55.979> times

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
give you the voltage so the speed times

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.990 
give you the voltage so the speed times
x<00:04:56.729> 8<00:04:57.000> equals<00:04:57.510> the<00:04:57.840> voltage<00:04:58.229> so<00:04:58.620> 1024<00:04:59.490> x<00:04:59.639> x<00:04:59.820> 8

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
x 8 equals the voltage so 1024 x x 8

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.710 
x 8 equals the voltage so 1024 x x 8
equals<00:05:01.220> 8192<00:05:02.240> so<00:05:03.240> you're<00:05:03.360> gonna<00:05:03.450> know<00:05:03.539> a<00:05:03.600> bit

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
equals 8192 so you're gonna know a bit

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.180 
equals 8192 so you're gonna know a bit
of<00:05:03.810> mass<00:05:04.020> and<00:05:04.430> with<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.990> talk<00:05:06.990> it's<00:05:07.410> actually

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
of mass and with the talk it's actually

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.029 
of mass and with the talk it's actually
the<00:05:08.639> opposite<00:05:09.000> so<00:05:09.240> it's<00:05:09.510> divided<00:05:10.350> by<00:05:10.440> a<00:05:10.650> gives

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
the opposite so it's divided by a gives

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:16.460 
the opposite so it's divided by a gives
you<00:05:11.160> the<00:05:12.200> amperage<00:05:14.270> okay<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:15.720> let's<00:05:16.200> see<00:05:16.350> what

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
you the amperage okay so let's see what

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.100 
you the amperage okay so let's see what
else<00:05:16.560> we<00:05:16.710> can<00:05:16.770> do<00:05:16.970> here<00:05:17.970> we've<00:05:18.780> got<00:05:18.810> the<00:05:18.960> same

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
else we can do here we've got the same

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.560 
else we can do here we've got the same
out<00:05:19.229> of<00:05:19.320> power<00:05:19.440> here<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:20.250> so<00:05:21.240> we<00:05:21.360> should<00:05:21.510> get

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
out of power here and so we should get

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.180 
out of power here and so we should get
about<00:05:21.720> 8<00:05:21.930> million<00:05:22.169> watts<00:05:22.650> of<00:05:22.830> power<00:05:22.979> Gramps

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
about 8 million watts of power Gramps

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.700 
about 8 million watts of power Gramps
through<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:23.490> cable<00:05:23.639> if<00:05:23.940> we<00:05:24.930> check<00:05:25.169> how<00:05:25.620> much

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710 
through the cable if we check how much

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:27.290 
through the cable if we check how much
power<00:05:25.950> is<00:05:26.070> painted<00:05:26.340> it's<00:05:26.460> one<00:05:26.610> is<00:05:26.760> only<00:05:26.970> four

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
power is painted it's one is only four

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.409 
power is painted it's one is only four
mil<00:05:27.479> here<00:05:28.349> for<00:05:29.130> mill<00:05:29.310> as<00:05:29.430> well<00:05:29.639> we're<00:05:30.270> losing

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
mil here for mill as well we're losing

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.629 
mil here for mill as well we're losing
about<00:05:30.720> one<00:05:30.960> right<00:05:31.200> a<00:05:31.229> second<00:05:31.650> because<00:05:32.370> that's

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
about one right a second because that's

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.200 
about one right a second because that's
the<00:05:33.020> voltage<00:05:34.020> loss<00:05:34.260> over<00:05:34.680> the<00:05:34.770> cable<00:05:35.070> let<00:05:36.060> me

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
the voltage loss over the cable let me

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.270 
the voltage loss over the cable let me
see<00:05:36.330> the<00:05:36.450> cable<00:05:36.720> here<00:05:36.810> split<00:05:37.169> so<00:05:37.470> when<00:05:38.190> you

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
see the cable here split so when you

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.480 
see the cable here split so when you
split<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.580> cable<00:05:38.880> do<00:05:39.680> the<00:05:40.680> speed<00:05:40.979> remains<00:05:41.280> the

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
use so you have a black a zero brand as

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810 
forth each one equal one so you can have

there which is a 10 times it will be 220
I<00:07:04.560> think<00:07:04.860> I'll<00:07:05.490> to<00:07:05.700> check<00:07:05.880> that<00:07:06.620> and<00:07:07.620> I<00:07:08.430> think

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:08.640 
I think I'll to check that and I think

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.180 
I think I'll to check that and I think
that's<00:07:08.760> about<00:07:08.850> it<00:07:08.970> for<00:07:09.060> days<00:07:09.950> spotlight<00:07:10.950> it's

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
that's about it for days spotlight it's

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.600 
that's about it for days spotlight it's
