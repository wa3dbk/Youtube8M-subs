by<00:04:56.800> just<00:04:56.949> kind<00:04:57.129> of<00:04:57.219> combing<00:04:57.639> the<00:04:57.819> brow<00:04:57.969> and

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
by just kind of combing the brow and

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.730 
by just kind of combing the brow and
this<00:04:58.509> one<00:04:58.719> has<00:04:58.960> a<00:04:59.259> little<00:05:00.069> bit<00:05:00.250> of<00:05:00.759> a<00:05:01.389> scar<00:05:01.870> so<00:05:02.229> I

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
different and I've had that since I was

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.519 
different and I've had that since I was
a<00:05:08.469> kid<00:05:09.029> so<00:05:10.029> I've<00:05:10.419> always<00:05:10.509> kind<00:05:10.599> of<00:05:10.930> had

00:05:11.519 --> 00:05:11.529 
a kid so I've always kind of had

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:13.469 
a kid so I've always kind of had
problems<00:05:11.860> that<00:05:11.979> I'm<00:05:12.520> aroused<00:05:12.729> by<00:05:12.909> no<00:05:13.120> means

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:13.479 
problems that I'm aroused by no means

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.420 
problems that I'm aroused by no means
need<00:05:13.930> to<00:05:14.139> be<00:05:14.259> filled<00:05:14.560> in<00:05:14.740> every<00:05:14.979> day<00:05:15.099> and<00:05:15.339> I

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
need to be filled in every day and I

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.920 
need to be filled in every day and I
really<00:05:15.759> don't<00:05:16.029> do<00:05:16.300> it<00:05:16.419> every<00:05:16.599> day<00:05:16.629> but<00:05:16.839> it

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
really don't do it every day but it

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.269 
really don't do it every day but it
makes<00:05:17.080> such<00:05:17.289> a<00:05:17.319> big<00:05:17.439> difference<00:05:17.710> when<00:05:18.129> I<00:05:18.159> do

00:05:18.269 --> 00:05:18.279 
makes such a big difference when I do

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:19.980 
makes such a big difference when I do
and<00:05:18.819> then<00:05:19.150> you're<00:05:19.300> going<00:05:19.389> to<00:05:19.449> start<00:05:19.749> with<00:05:19.870> your

part<00:05:24.610> I'm<00:05:25.449> gonna<00:05:25.719> fill<00:05:25.990> in<00:05:26.139> just<00:05:26.469> very<00:05:26.529> lightly

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
part I'm gonna fill in just very lightly

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:30.089 
part I'm gonna fill in just very lightly
the<00:05:27.520> scar<00:05:28.000> and<00:05:28.389> apply<00:05:29.139> less<00:05:29.500> than<00:05:29.770> you<00:05:29.860> think

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
you can kind of see that transfers

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.079 
you can kind of see that transfers
really<00:05:31.779> well<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:32.379> then<00:05:33.370> I<00:05:33.400> like<00:05:33.669> to<00:05:33.699> kind<00:05:34.029> of

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:34.089 
really well and then I like to kind of

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:36.179 
really well and then I like to kind of
go<00:05:34.300> at<00:05:34.689> the<00:05:34.930> tail<00:05:35.229> of<00:05:35.500> it<00:05:35.620> and<00:05:35.860> then<00:05:35.949> just

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:36.189 
go at the tail of it and then just

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:39.420 
go at the tail of it and then just
lightly<00:05:37.409> fill<00:05:38.409> that<00:05:38.620> in<00:05:38.800> you<00:05:38.949> see<00:05:39.099> how<00:05:39.250> it<00:05:39.339> kind

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
lightly fill that in you see how it kind

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.809 
lightly fill that in you see how it kind
of<00:05:39.550> made<00:05:39.699> a<00:05:39.729> nice<00:05:39.969> shape<00:05:40.270> on<00:05:40.479> the<00:05:40.839> arch<00:05:41.080> I<00:05:41.819> go

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:42.819 
of made a nice shape on the arch I go

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:45.719 
of made a nice shape on the arch I go
around<00:05:43.089> the<00:05:43.180> top<00:05:43.449> I<00:05:44.310> find<00:05:45.310> that<00:05:45.370> if<00:05:45.490> you<00:05:45.580> define

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
around the top I find that if you define

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.350 
around the top I find that if you define
the<00:05:46.389> eyebrow<00:05:46.870> along<00:05:47.409> the<00:05:47.560> top<00:05:47.849> it's<00:05:48.849> much<00:05:49.149> more

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
the eyebrow along the top it's much more

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.839 
the eyebrow along the top it's much more
flattering<00:05:49.870> than<00:05:50.310> defining<00:05:51.310> it<00:05:51.430> along<00:05:51.699> the

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
flattering than defining it along the

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:58.860 
flattering than defining it along the
bottom<00:05:55.529> so<00:05:56.529> start<00:05:56.889> off<00:05:57.069> by<00:05:57.430> filling<00:05:58.330> in<00:05:58.689> any

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
bottom so start off by filling in any

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:00.450 
bottom so start off by filling in any
areas<00:05:59.289> to<00:05:59.379> see<00:05:59.529> how<00:05:59.589> that<00:05:59.740> made<00:05:59.919> that<00:06:00.039> so<00:06:00.279> much

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
areas to see how that made that so much

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.209 
areas to see how that made that so much
smoother<00:06:01.000> and<00:06:01.589> right<00:06:02.589> there<00:06:02.770> like<00:06:03.009> if<00:06:03.129> I

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:03.219 
smoother and right there like if I

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:05.010 
smoother and right there like if I
really<00:06:03.550> combed<00:06:03.819> down<00:06:03.969> this<00:06:04.270> top<00:06:04.539> part<00:06:04.810> of<00:06:04.870> my

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
really combed down this top part of my

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.050 
really combed down this top part of my
brow<00:06:05.229> you<00:06:05.469> can<00:06:05.500> see<00:06:05.919> like<00:06:06.159> where<00:06:06.759> it's<00:06:06.879> not

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:07.060 
brow you can see like where it's not

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.579 
brow you can see like where it's not
filled<00:06:07.300> and<00:06:07.569> if<00:06:07.659> that<00:06:07.839> is<00:06:08.110> something<00:06:08.529> that

00:06:08.579 --> 00:06:08.589 
filled and if that is something that

00:06:08.589 --> 00:06:10.019 
filled and if that is something that
helps<00:06:08.949> you<00:06:09.129> like<00:06:09.339> you<00:06:09.430> can<00:06:09.580> see<00:06:09.819> right<00:06:09.969> there

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:10.029 
helps you like you can see right there

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:11.909 
helps you like you can see right there
then<00:06:10.990> you<00:06:11.080> can<00:06:11.229> do<00:06:11.319> that<00:06:11.439> but<00:06:11.560> I<00:06:11.620> find<00:06:11.830> that

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
then you can do that but I find that

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:13.110 
then you can do that but I find that
sometimes<00:06:12.129> if<00:06:12.399> you<00:06:12.460> do<00:06:12.580> that<00:06:12.759> you<00:06:12.879> end<00:06:12.909> up

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
sometimes if you do that you end up

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.119 
sometimes if you do that you end up
applying<00:06:13.300> too<00:06:13.659> much<00:06:13.839> I'd<00:06:14.349> rather<00:06:14.589> just<00:06:14.860> comb

00:06:15.119 --> 00:06:15.129 
applying too much I'd rather just comb

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.100 
applying too much I'd rather just comb
them<00:06:15.339> out<00:06:15.460> into<00:06:16.029> the<00:06:16.149> best<00:06:16.330> shape<00:06:16.479> you<00:06:16.750> can<00:06:16.930> get

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
them out into the best shape you can get

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:19.619 
them out into the best shape you can get
them<00:06:17.319> just<00:06:18.069> from<00:06:18.279> like<00:06:18.430> combing<00:06:19.120> them<00:06:19.300> and

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:19.629 
them just from like combing them and

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.420 
them just from like combing them and
then<00:06:20.229> fill<00:06:20.500> in<00:06:20.620> what<00:06:20.770> you<00:06:20.949> need<00:06:21.069> so<00:06:21.279> you<00:06:21.310> don't

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
then fill in what you need so you don't

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.879 
then fill in what you need so you don't
apply<00:06:21.699> too<00:06:21.819> much<00:06:23.580> just<00:06:24.580> going<00:06:24.879> around<00:06:25.029> the<00:06:25.180> top

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:25.889 
apply too much just going around the top

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:29.040 
apply too much just going around the top
very<00:06:26.889> lightly<00:06:27.659> especially<00:06:28.659> when<00:06:28.839> you<00:06:28.899> get

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
very lightly especially when you get
