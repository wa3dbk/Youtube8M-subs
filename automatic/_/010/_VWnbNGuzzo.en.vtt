long shot zoom I can never figure out is

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:49.210 
long shot zoom I can never figure out is
in<00:02:41.470> wow<00:02:42.760> this<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:43.940> a<00:02:43.970> very<00:02:44.390> well<00:02:44.720> done<00:02:45.019> mod<00:02:48.220> it's

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
in wow this is a very well done mod it's

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.130 
in wow this is a very well done mod it's
a<00:02:49.280> kind<00:02:49.519> of<00:02:49.579> a<00:02:49.730> bolt-action<00:02:50.180> type<00:02:50.629> thing<00:02:50.930> I

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
a kind of a bolt-action type thing I

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.479 
a kind of a bolt-action type thing I
don't<00:02:54.140> really<00:02:54.260> need<00:02:54.379> to<00:02:54.560> reload<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.370> like

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
don't really need to reload it like

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.490 
don't really need to reload it like
cocks<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.299> back<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.720> reloads<00:02:57.079> again<00:02:57.349> it's

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
cocks it back and reloads again it's

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.240 
cocks it back and reloads again it's
kind<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:57.739> odd<00:02:57.859> but<00:02:58.129> whatever<00:02:58.489> um<00:03:00.040> see<00:03:01.040> you

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
kind of odd but whatever um see you

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.259 
kind of odd but whatever um see you
Nasher<00:03:01.879> oh<00:03:02.120> my<00:03:02.480> git<00:03:06.430> doesn't<00:03:07.430> reload<00:03:07.940> like<00:03:08.239> I

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
Nasher oh my git doesn't reload like I

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.089 
Nasher oh my git doesn't reload like I
should<00:03:08.599> but<00:03:09.349> that<00:03:09.500> doesn't<00:03:09.739> really<00:03:09.859> matter

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
should but that doesn't really matter

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.960 
should but that doesn't really matter
I'm<00:03:11.000> guessing<00:03:11.390> it<00:03:11.480> takes<00:03:11.950> regular<00:03:12.950> like<00:03:13.310> for

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
I'm guessing it takes regular like for

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.580 
I'm guessing it takes regular like for
example<00:03:14.060> this<00:03:14.510> probably<00:03:14.780> takes<00:03:14.959> shotgun

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
example this probably takes shotgun

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.720 
example this probably takes shotgun
shells<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:17.230> all<00:03:18.230> that<00:03:18.560> shit<00:03:18.919> what<00:03:19.280> else<00:03:19.459> they
