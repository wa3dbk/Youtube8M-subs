describe<00:00:56.129> your<00:00:56.760> brand<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.379> think<00:00:58.739> it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
describe your brand what do you think it

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.549 
describe your brand what do you think it
is<00:00:59.340> about<00:00:59.670> your<00:00:59.969> brand<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.840> identifiable

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
is about your brand that is identifiable

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.979 
is about your brand that is identifiable
and<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.579> makes<00:01:02.820> it<00:01:03.000> successful<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.780> think

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
and that makes it successful I think

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.160 
and that makes it successful I think
it's<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.680> range<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.250> different<00:01:05.659> areas<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:07.140> think

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it's a range of different areas I think

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.750 
it's a range of different areas I think
it's<00:01:07.439> definitely<00:01:07.619> something<00:01:08.400> that's

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it's definitely something that's

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.030 
it's definitely something that's
feminine<00:01:09.090> something<00:01:09.659> that's<00:01:09.810> timeless

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
feminine something that's timeless

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.510 
feminine something that's timeless
something<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.810> is<00:01:12.810> on<00:01:13.170> trend<00:01:13.650> with<00:01:14.310> our

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
something that is on trend with our

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.969 
something that is on trend with our
different<00:01:15.030> prints<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.080> use<00:01:16.259> each<00:01:16.470> season

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
different prints that we use each season

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
different prints that we use each season
I<00:01:17.189> think<00:01:17.640> makes<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.090> identifiable<00:01:18.900> because

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
I think makes that identifiable because

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.240 
I think makes that identifiable because
you're<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.439> going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> find<00:01:19.770> them<00:01:19.920> anywhere

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
you're not going to find them anywhere

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.980 
you're not going to find them anywhere
else<00:01:20.430> we<00:01:20.670> designed<00:01:20.939> them<00:01:21.060> specifically<00:01:21.570> for

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
else we designed them specifically for

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.560 
else we designed them specifically for
our<00:01:22.320> brand<00:01:22.979> specifically<00:01:23.790> for<00:01:24.000> us<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.479> then

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
our brand specifically for us and then

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.880 
our brand specifically for us and then
we<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.810> them<00:01:24.990> printed<00:01:25.350> whether<00:01:25.560> it's<00:01:25.770> on

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
we have them printed whether it's on

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.609 
we have them printed whether it's on
silk<00:01:26.189> or<00:01:26.369> chiffon<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> think<00:01:28.409> that's

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
silk or chiffon and so I think that's

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.870 
silk or chiffon and so I think that's
definitely<00:01:28.799> something<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.400> people<00:01:29.610> come

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
definitely something that people come

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.330 
definitely something that people come
back<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.210> us<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:31.320> leather<00:01:31.890> detailing

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
back to us for the leather detailing

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.950 
back to us for the leather detailing
also<00:01:32.790> makes<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.150> really<00:01:33.299> important<00:01:33.840> and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
also makes it really important and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.630 
also makes it really important and
identifiable<00:01:34.619> too<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.159> think<00:01:35.220> people<00:01:35.549> who

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
identifiable too and I think people who

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.219 
identifiable too and I think people who
have<00:01:35.729> seen<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.000> season<00:01:36.420> after<00:01:36.509> season<00:01:36.840> are
