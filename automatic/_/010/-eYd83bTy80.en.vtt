come<00:01:02.450> is<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:02.750> wii<00:01:02.900> u<00:01:03.080> as<00:01:03.320> well<00:01:03.500> as<00:01:03.680> pc<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.309> this

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
come is the wii u as well as pc and this

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.480 
come is the wii u as well as pc and this
seems<00:01:05.239> like<00:01:05.300> a<00:01:05.420> bit<00:01:05.660> of<00:01:05.690> an<00:01:06.290> odd<00:01:06.770> choice<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:07.400> be

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
seems like a bit of an odd choice to be

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.130 
seems like a bit of an odd choice to be
honest<00:01:07.790> it<00:01:07.940> seems<00:01:08.150> a<00:01:08.390> bit<00:01:08.510> odd<00:01:08.570> that<00:01:08.720> they

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
honest it seems a bit odd that they

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.740 
honest it seems a bit odd that they
bring<00:01:09.350> it<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:09.620> the<00:01:09.740> wii<00:01:09.890> u<00:01:09.950> but<00:01:10.790> i<00:01:11.030> guess<00:01:11.420> the

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
bring it to the wii u but i guess the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.870 
bring it to the wii u but i guess the
art<00:01:12.140> style<00:01:12.440> and<00:01:12.890> they<00:01:12.980> can't<00:01:13.190> demographic

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
art style and they can't demographic

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.730 
art style and they can't demographic
they<00:01:14.030> going<00:01:14.300> for<00:01:14.330> they<00:01:15.050> think<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:15.380> the<00:01:15.620> way

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
they going for they think that the way

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.220 
they going for they think that the way
you<00:01:15.920> will<00:01:16.010> work<00:01:16.250> well<00:01:16.550> for<00:01:16.760> it<00:01:16.910> and<00:01:17.330> maybe<00:01:17.720> they

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
you will work well for it and maybe they

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.320 
you will work well for it and maybe they
see<00:01:18.440> some<00:01:18.620> potential<00:01:18.980> in<00:01:19.250> the<00:01:19.370> wii<00:01:19.520> u<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:19.730> it's

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
see some potential in the wii u and it's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.940 
see some potential in the wii u and it's
just<00:01:20.630> good<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:20.840> be<00:01:21.020> getting<00:01:21.260> some<00:01:21.440> third<00:01:21.650> pies
