00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
increasing the movement of the muscles

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.399 
increasing the movement of the muscles
in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.949> spine<00:01:05.220> that's<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.790> first<00:01:06.060> move

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
in the spine that's the first move

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.500 
in the spine that's the first move
second<00:01:07.409> move<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.770> reach<00:01:08.189> scoop<00:01:08.610> what<00:01:09.270> are<00:01:09.360> we

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the muscles that attach to the spine and

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.460 
the muscles that attach to the spine and
the<00:01:23.430> third<00:01:23.850> move<00:01:24.450> which<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.840> actually<00:01:25.439> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
activating all the muscles of the spine

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.539 
activating all the muscles of the spine
t-tapp<00:01:37.950> twist<00:01:38.310> or<00:01:38.610> maybe<00:01:38.930> jazz<00:01:39.930> twists<00:01:40.549> doing

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
t-tapp twist or maybe jazz twists doing

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.870 
t-tapp twist or maybe jazz twists doing
the<00:01:41.700> same<00:01:42.000> thing<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.829> as<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.280> see<00:01:44.610> all

twisting scooping extending and
stretching<00:01:53.820> that's<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.899> secret

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
stretching that's the secret

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.950 
stretching that's the secret
that's<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.100> secret<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.729> fat<00:01:57.000> burning<00:01:57.030> so

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
that's the secret to fat burning so

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.920 
that's the secret to fat burning so
those<00:01:58.320> are<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.740> three<00:01:59.070> top<00:01:59.430> moves<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.600> you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
those are the three top moves that you

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350 
those are the three top moves that you
can<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.560> supercharge<00:02:02.460> your<00:02:02.520> fat<00:02:02.909> burning

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360
