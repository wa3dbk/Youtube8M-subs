00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.480
 alone and then I hope you go 

00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.940
 well today I present you my 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.679
 five favorite lip products from 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.459
 autumn so it's lipsticks 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:14.619
 and good backs or glosses that 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.789
 are I like to wear for 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.640
 autumn on colors really 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.650
 perfect for the fall so we start 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.170
 with what I'm wearing right now and 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.140
 it's the color deeply a finger of 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.699
 mc5 waste with a color that 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.499
 supported the least funny naval action 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:35.160
 go think and I think he wants 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:38.649
 exit already but good and because it's a 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.750
 burgundy raspberry really but 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.079
 really nice game really like it 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.890
 a lot 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.020
 there is so think so I need to 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.180
 apply it with a student brush 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.730
 but I find that the rendering is really 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.680
 handsome said word but he's not going too choppy 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.410
 the other m be i like so 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.179
 it was a favorite flame for 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.929
 hot autumn bunny that is pretty 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.789
 talking to the lake if we accept this is going 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.100
 really want so he would have recovered 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.210
 in color the plane blow there that I you 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.759
 present it's a color that 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.070
 looks a lot like a lot said 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.310
 mac theodore but that come from the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.530
 pharmacy dance the inherited elk twist 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.970
 annabelle so it goes on we all know 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.650
 that it's really very very similar 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:26.439
 as of May 12th and lidl and brighter who 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.259
 plays faithful is slightly more paul 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:31.720
 but you know if relative enough but is 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:36.070
 this club sound that I like a lot 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.450
 are in the details of the more blacks 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.939
 argue that it's more red 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.549
 but I really like it for its color 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.070
 then it is very affordable and the 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:45.810
 sad up and away 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.300
 really a lot usually launches a 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.510
 range that I like so much this one 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.670
 for the fall is perfect there was that 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.380
 here is the last lip object I have at 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.840
 introduce yourself he comes from my home 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.550
 beautiful reid and if the mauve magnan color 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.220
 is what I like is that's what 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.619
 it's a guy at the darkest this 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.720
 that I usually wear but it's pretty 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.670
 important for every day so that's 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.959
 not too intense message of a small 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.320
 autumn touch that I like a lot 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:15.560
 then strangely the smell of red to 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.000
 lips has all the cheats 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.610
 jean-paul lauda it gives me a bad heart 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840
 but she this one I think it's me 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.670
 scared it's so she that if I 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.040
 I am small it is this color the in 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.300
 done and I find that he will stand 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.540
 long on the lips the votes of the 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:33.270
 hide public also then ipo 13 have a 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.310
 so chat and sagem books and simon fuller 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.530
 that goes well with several skin tones 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.530
 so I like of course a club that I like 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.430
 a lot in one of the two social ills 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.500
 lipsticks 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.459
 now we'll go to gloss and 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.160
 lip balms 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.260
 the gallery in color is a bios sls 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.540
 to laugh white who is not very 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.920
 pigmented but what I like is that 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.650
 it just gives a small size to 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.900
 lips a tinge of autumnal colors 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.690
 b a little darker than my lips 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.700
 natural I really like it sticks but 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.319
 I love the texture of 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.629
 these rankings so it's the gloss 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.269
 support to the south at each white club and he 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:12.060
 find that it is a beautiful texture to 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.910
 lips a beautiful shine but it holds 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.230
 good it will be held all day 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.750
 thank you not started for the pleasant 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.980
 that are not expensive from a pharmacy 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:25.480
 managing a lot so me someone that 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.110
 their latest products that I have 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.569
 represent 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.910
 it is a tinted lip jump chicken 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:36.069
 run in the lineup of shirts etc the 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.870
 hashtag so diaz jtm so redeemed I 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:39.250
 love you and it's a lip balm that 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.049
 I love because I was there and 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.180
 and then it's a color a bit of a 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.650
 little bit the move in darker what 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.530
 I really like it but it's not a 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.880
 color that is very intense and could 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.950
 apply it if we see it so that's 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.180
 really nice it will help very well 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.620
 do others think that the 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.980
 lips not really seen that it's a 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.190
 lip balm, but it will not wear 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.319
 acquired so does this oath but who 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.690
 find that I had them 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.010
 and then I reins them by emptying his bag 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.930
 hand to be able to advance on me 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.970
 since for the fall we do not need 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.430
 to think that goes with several local 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.810
 that we presented on the eyes and that's 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.810
 quite natural but it's true a little 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.010
 not I find in that it's this 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.109
 it is to show the difference of 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.630
 first game demonstrated but it's the 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.639
 five products that I leave you often 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.680
 the autumn colors that parliament of the 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.419
 darker to most but who 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.360
 are adapted for the fall precisely 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.100
 so here are my sons hoping it does not 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.720
 wants more like video I hope the 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.910
 colors you liked too and 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.070

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.440

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:44.919
 autumn no that is a color a 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.349

 ferries
