00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.710
 but this one of v television and internet in only one welcome to the third of a 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:07.440
 series of six programs on ecological livestock our topic today 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.440
 no pressure and feeding 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.869
 this livestock production is fundamental the nutritional aspect 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.590
 how to handle it and what are its benefits elements when taking into account 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.589
 at the time of feeding his cattle 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:32.230
 take care of him 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.760
 gonzález 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.150
 friend an apprentice herself 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.480
 and friend ranchers nutrition and food tournaments are a basis 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.490
 fundamental for both development of our Canary Islands 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:43.600
 let's remember 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.670
 that this aspect 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.150
 largely because animals are presented with their genetic value 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.430
 for a long time 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.840
 Many small and medium-sized farmers have faced serious problems of 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.780
 nutrition 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.510
 for which livestock has been seriously affected 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.610
 It will be fine because this topic is so important 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.380
 if a farmer does not continue he knows the context of the productive unit of his 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.730
 cattle raising 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.090
 it can lead to failure 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.250
 therefore the canadair or must know 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.590
 all the integrality of your farm 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:21.940
 to 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.670
 achieve 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.899
 tnt success and route 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.830
 sublime approval of this one 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.899
 taking into account the nutritional aspects 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.210
 and feeding 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.720
 In what aspects is a farmer going to meet his own objectives? 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.110
 the farmer can achieve 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.290
 the marshall objectives in mind first 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.290
 knowing by identifying foods that he has in his end 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.359
 percent the composition of a test ration 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.090
 the nutritional requirements of animals 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.930
 if the concept this context look at nutritional deficiencies kelly have 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.350
 all 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.350
 all these elements that minka has done 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.399
 leads him to provide some nutritional supplements such as the block 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.930
 nutritional silage 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.540
 along with other aspects such as protein banks 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:20.869
 lars arvenses that the animal can consume 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:22.240
 therefore therefore 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.209
 With all this the breeder can 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.329
 take us 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.099
 to an end and achieve a good success within your ranch leo leo conca 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.119
 food resources account in your farm 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:36.259
 I have the energy part etc that is the pact 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.389
 but I'm missing what protein and minerals 

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:42.769
 taking into account the resources that she has 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:45.879
 with the help of luis gabriel of today naleo and other companions 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.439
 we are going to look from the nutritional and nutritional point of view as 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.439
 establishes an ecological livestock farm 

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:57.789
 for its part 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:02:59.529
 that the births 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:02.529
 the corn that flours that the concentrates 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.190
 but actually a rancher like you can procure 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.809
 or like to qualify for the cup america 

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:13.290
 on the one hand opposite credit the food in the following way 

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:19.359
 in grasses and pastures the 2 can go what are the grasses 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.989
 what are those pastures 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.629
 that have 12 percent protein down 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:28.299
 the legumes 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.279
 which are those that have 16 percent protein up 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:37.999
 since there we can also find some trees that can have a 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.409
 good percentage of protein 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.069
 of 22 30 percent 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.819
 so it is not legume 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.169
 for solá one finds 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.169
 Hardcore is that I know the country so high 

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:54.379
 whole area of ​​the colt have claimed cold temperate media 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.689
 we can find trees that can use it in feeding 

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:02.519
 of cattle what is is that soon people do not know them 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.719
 when there is very little to be a bastion 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.599
 from the winner of the rancher 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.669
 there that animals really consume and that can be complicated in the 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:13.349
 cattle feeding 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.989
 Lusa ready for the Jews can be classified as follows 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:19.979
 puebla 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.449
 concentrates 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.499
 protein supplements 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:25.680
 minerals and vitamins 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.040
 so that cattle to your farm receive the right nutrients eye 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.080
 It is convenient to know the digestive physiology of the animal 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.069
 Digestive tract functions 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.639
 the chewing and the blonde reduce the size of the particles expose the 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:46.639
 candidates present in the tibia for bacterial fermentation 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:52.499
 produces up to 180 liters of saliva per day when a cow ruminated between six and 

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:53.209
 eight hours daily
