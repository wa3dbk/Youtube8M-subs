00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.990
 ah ah ah can build a series of 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.840
 things in a language that seemed 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.920
 which facilitated the work of the 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.630
 your detractors 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.539
 then he speaks for example in the rest of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.699
 ur in the rest of Freudian hulu is that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.399
 that remains of the waking dream or 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.050
 what reverberates in the dream whose 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.719
 origin is in the experience of vigil 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.809
 behind the vigil still reverberating 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.829
 before and we can measure in the then 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.070
 this statement was the target is a 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.800
 affirmation was a scientific formation 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.500
 testable and corroborated something else 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.899
 Fred said that is that childhood traumas 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.059
 can modify adult behavior 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.430
 then for example people who have passed 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.660
 childhood abuse may have a 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.049
 use of the promoter region one year 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.780
 and allowing transcription of the gene that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.490
 coding for the glucocorticoid receptor 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.979
 means that it would reduce the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.659
 expression of this receptor that is 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.180
 involved in the stress response then 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.890
 people become hyper expressed or 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.530
 person who has passed through a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.110
 for one to a trauma she will pass the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.630
 rest of life is more sensitive to 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.090
 stress so again returning to 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.079
 systematised multiply ie 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.460
 totally biological what happens 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.750
 in the light of the experience 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.869
 experience generates modification 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:42.540
 long-term behavioral 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:44.729
 also postulated that what makes the dream is 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.009
 I wish the phrase he used is that 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.990
 Wish the dream engine is OK today. 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.079
 demonstrated that people who are 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.970
 without the dopaminergic system or 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.490
 be the system that allows you to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.619
 good things and avoid negative things 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.400
 when people do not have this system 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.940
 but I do not dream so I really want to motor 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.119
 the lot was the person who wrote the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.009
 unconscious repression of memories and 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.290
 conscious suppression of memory 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.280
 something very unpleasant 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.630
 consciously or unconsciously 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.630
 you can put it under the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.220
 rug that the person actually thinks 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.440
 that memory does not exist so much memory 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.920
 is there and in psychoanalytic theory this 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.390
 Memory May Occur Symptoms 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.160
 nowadays there is a line of research 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.660
 several different researchers 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.390
 published in magazines of the highest level 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.890
 showing that there is indeed 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.680
 this phenomenon and compositions of the cortex 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.780
 activate and inhibit activity 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.440
 mines by suppressing these 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.440
 memoirs 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.200
 this is a research program is 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.150
 absolutely central to science and it is 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.770
 so inspired by fraud that you will 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.410
 articles and in the summary itself the first 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.760
 The word that appears is according to 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.770
 what was postulated confident 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.750
 so fred is coming back to the 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.390
 neuroscience and I believe that we 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.459
 years it will once again occupy a 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.520
 place that he should have always occupied 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.709
 to what is the place next to santiago del 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.680
 monte carlo next to the boss of your side 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.540
 brother next to big new priest 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.110
 founders of neuroscience at the beginning of 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.110
 20th century
