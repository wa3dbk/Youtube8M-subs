hello<00:00:17.180> in<00:00:17.330> this<00:00:18.080> tutorial<00:00:18.260> for<00:00:18.620> noiseless

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
hello in this tutorial for noiseless

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.080 
hello in this tutorial for noiseless
we'll<00:00:20.180> be<00:00:20.270> looking<00:00:20.420> at<00:00:20.750> presets<00:00:21.790> presets<00:00:22.790> are

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
we'll be looking at presets presets are

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.880 
we'll be looking at presets presets are
located<00:00:23.570> on<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:23.810> right<00:00:24.140> side<00:00:24.170> of<00:00:24.619> your<00:00:24.740> window

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
located on the right side of your window

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.220 
located on the right side of your window
and<00:00:25.279> are<00:00:25.640> a<00:00:25.670> very<00:00:26.090> powerful<00:00:26.420> way<00:00:26.810> of<00:00:26.930> working

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
and are a very powerful way of working

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.800 
and are a very powerful way of working
with<00:00:27.529> the<00:00:27.650> application<00:00:28.310> they're<00:00:29.119> often<00:00:29.599> all

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
with the application they're often all

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.109 
with the application they're often all
you'll<00:00:30.170> need<00:00:30.410> to<00:00:30.800> improve<00:00:31.460> any<00:00:31.699> photo<00:00:32.000> you

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
you'll need to improve any photo you

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.140 
you'll need to improve any photo you
take<00:00:32.410> now<00:00:33.410> presets<00:00:33.920> represent<00:00:34.520> the<00:00:34.640> relative

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
take now presets represent the relative

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.390 
take now presets represent the relative
amount<00:00:35.510> of<00:00:35.720> noise<00:00:35.989> reduction<00:00:36.230> that's<00:00:37.129> been

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
amount of noise reduction that's been

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.460 
amount of noise reduction that's been
applied<00:00:37.640> to<00:00:38.030> an<00:00:38.150> image<00:00:38.420> in<00:00:38.660> this<00:00:39.140> particular

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
applied to an image in this particular

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.549 
applied to an image in this particular
image<00:00:39.800> noiseless<00:00:40.520> defaults<00:00:41.090> to<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.270> 200%<00:00:42.199> zoom

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
image noiseless defaults to a 200% zoom

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.460 
image noiseless defaults to a 200% zoom
so<00:00:43.190> you<00:00:43.250> can<00:00:43.489> see<00:00:43.790> the<00:00:44.000> amount<00:00:44.300> of<00:00:44.420> noise<00:00:44.660> in

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
so you can see the amount of noise in

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.400 
so you can see the amount of noise in
the<00:00:45.739> image<00:00:45.890> up<00:00:46.640> here<00:00:47.210> at<00:00:47.330> the<00:00:47.510> upper<00:00:48.020> left<00:00:48.260> you

the image up here at the upper left you

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.210 
the image up here at the upper left you
see<00:00:48.680> ISO<00:00:49.210> 6400<00:00:50.210> that<00:00:50.840> that<00:00:51.590> denotes<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.040> the

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
little bit more of the lovely models

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.219 
little bit more of the lovely models
face<00:01:03.699> so<00:01:04.699> as<00:01:04.820> I<00:01:04.940> mentioned<00:01:05.330> strong<00:01:05.720> has<00:01:05.990> been

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229

the<00:01:06.410> default<00:01:06.590> preset<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:07.759> you'll<00:01:08.600> notice

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
the default preset and you'll notice

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.340 
the default preset and you'll notice
that<00:01:10.000> there<00:01:11.000> are<00:01:11.149> a<00:01:11.180> variety<00:01:11.390> of<00:01:11.810> presets

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
that there are a variety of presets

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.410 
that there are a variety of presets
there<00:01:12.470> ranging<00:01:13.220> from<00:01:13.399> light<00:01:13.729> all<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.240> way<00:01:14.360> to

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
there ranging from light all the way to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.560 
there ranging from light all the way to
extreme<00:01:15.050> in<00:01:15.710> addition<00:01:16.190> we<00:01:16.340> have<00:01:16.490> two<00:01:16.700> presets

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
extreme in addition we have two presets

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.210 
extreme in addition we have two presets
down<00:01:17.750> at<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:17.990> bottom<00:01:18.140> here<00:01:18.320> balanced<00:01:18.979> and

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
down at the bottom here balanced and

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.800

can also have its amount adjusted

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.630 
can also have its amount adjusted
meaning<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.479> noise<00:01:29.690> reduction<00:01:29.959> is<00:01:30.640> currently

meaning the noise reduction is currently

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.730 
meaning the noise reduction is currently

on the strong setting at a hundred

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.580 
on the strong setting at a hundred
percent<00:01:33.950> we<00:01:34.789> can<00:01:34.970> also<00:01:35.119> slide<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:35.959> down<00:01:36.200> a

percent we can also slide it down a

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.790 
percent we can also slide it down a
little<00:01:37.280> bit<00:01:37.520> less<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:38.450> provide<00:01:38.840> maybe<00:01:39.440> a<00:01:39.560> more

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
little bit less to provide maybe a more

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.389 
little bit less to provide maybe a more
natural<00:01:40.250> result<00:01:40.399> or<00:01:40.819> result<00:01:41.209> that's<00:01:41.390> more

natural result or result that's more
dedicated<00:01:43.399> to<00:01:43.670> your<00:01:43.880> particular<00:01:44.330> image<00:01:44.869> I'm

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
dedicated to your particular image I'm

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.529 
dedicated to your particular image I'm
going<00:01:45.679> to<00:01:45.740> use<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:45.979> quick<00:01:46.160> preview<00:01:46.610> button<00:01:46.880> to

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
going to use the quick preview button to

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.660 
going to use the quick preview button to
show<00:01:47.750> very<00:01:48.200> very<00:01:48.470> quickly<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.009> before<00:01:49.399> and

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
show very very quickly the before and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.499 
show very very quickly the before and
then<00:01:49.940> the<00:01:50.060> after

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
then the after

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.650 
then the after
I<00:01:50.690> might<00:01:51.530> actually<00:01:51.970> crease<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.209> strong

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
I might actually crease that strong

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.730 
I might actually crease that strong
setting<00:01:54.170> just<00:01:54.470> a<00:01:54.679> little<00:01:54.979> just<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.729> little<00:01:55.940> bit

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
setting just a little just a little bit

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.870 
setting just a little just a little bit
so<00:01:57.740> you'll<00:01:57.890> notice<00:01:58.069> that<00:01:58.160> noise<00:01:58.459> this<00:01:58.640> also

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
so you'll notice that noise this also

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.510 
so you'll notice that noise this also
contains<00:01:59.420> three<00:01:59.869> tabs<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.649> access<00:02:01.099> different

contains three tabs to access different

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.910 
contains three tabs to access different
presets<00:02:01.940> there's<00:02:02.209> a<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.720> favorites<00:02:03.349> tab<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.890> a
