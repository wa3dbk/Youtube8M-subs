00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
you're a netbook something like that

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.909 
you're a netbook something like that
it'll<00:03:10.730> turn<00:03:11.000> off<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.419> turbo<00:03:11.810> for<00:03:12.409> you<00:03:12.560> as<00:03:12.739> well

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
and then it just won't work so that'll

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:17.800 
and then it just won't work so that'll
be<00:03:16.579> something<00:03:16.760> you'll<00:03:17.000> have<00:03:17.180> to<00:03:17.329> turn<00:03:17.449> back<00:03:17.629> on

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
if you decide to use it again like let's

dollars spent on another controller this

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.180 
dollars spent on another controller this

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
broke my original ps3 controller that I

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:53.199 
broke my original ps3 controller that I
have<00:03:52.010> right<00:03:52.220> now<00:03:52.280> I<00:03:52.639> would<00:03:52.940> have<00:03:52.970> definitely

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
have right now I would have definitely

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.819 
have right now I would have definitely
purchased<00:03:53.840> this<00:03:53.930> product<00:03:54.229> the<00:03:54.470> only<00:03:54.650> thing<00:03:54.799> is

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
purchased this product the only thing is

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.559 
purchased this product the only thing is
it's<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.340> little<00:03:55.579> bit<00:03:55.669> heavier<00:03:55.970> than<00:03:56.060> the

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
it's a little bit heavier than the

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.990 
it's a little bit heavier than the
actual<00:03:57.229> standard<00:03:57.769> PSD<00:03:58.129> control<00:03:58.400> but<00:03:58.639> you<00:03:58.849> get

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
actual standard PSD control but you get

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.849 
actual standard PSD control but you get
used<00:03:59.209> to<00:03:59.329> the<00:03:59.419> weight<00:03:59.599> after<00:03:59.810> a<00:03:59.989> while<00:04:00.169> so<00:04:00.680> it's

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
used to the weight after a while so it's

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.429 
used to the weight after a while so it's
not<00:04:00.949> that<00:04:01.010> big<00:04:01.310> of<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.549> deal<00:04:01.760> but<00:04:02.629> it's<00:04:02.959> got<00:04:03.199> a

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 
not that big of a deal but it's got a

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.580 
not that big of a deal but it's got a
great<00:04:03.620> feel<00:04:03.919> to<00:04:03.979> let's<00:04:04.370> go<00:04:04.489> like<00:04:04.609> a<00:04:04.639> rubberized

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
great feel to let's go like a rubberized

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.809 
great feel to let's go like a rubberized
feel<00:04:06.590> across<00:04:06.829> the<00:04:07.069> whole<00:04:07.220> control<00:04:07.579> where<00:04:07.729> it

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
feel across the whole control where it

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.399 
feel across the whole control where it
looks<00:04:07.939> like<00:04:08.060> a<00:04:08.209> nerf<00:04:08.540> controller<00:04:08.989> be<00:04:09.199> honest

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409
