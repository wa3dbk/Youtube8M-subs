00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.069
 Hello, today I want to tell you how 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:11.809
 Drill burst windshield 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:18.600
 so that the crack does not spread further 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:23.550
 Here we have it several times 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:28.949
 bored and cracks set glass and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:34.050
 crack went below here you need to remove 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:38.149
 stress to crack further down 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:46.250
 did not go for that we need 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:55.020
 Means here is an engraver scotch and glass 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:58.230
 well and diamond cutter so 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:05.519
 at home you can do it 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:09.830
 now I will show it from the glass 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.830
 remove dust and dirt 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.110
 then 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:43.079
 here we are at the end of the crack 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:53.429
 Now you need to fix the glass mirror I 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:02:00.110
 secured with masking tape now 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:00.110
 you can see where it ends very well 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:14.840
 Now we take the engraver and here on one 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:22.430
 millimeter below the crack 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:26.870
 We make the deepening to the second glass 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.030
 his well, there is no income-producing property 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:36.950
 mirror and serves to not 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:41.810
 do more than you need well 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:45.959
 I will not shoot and how I will drill as 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:51.389
 if you give both to do such 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:58.459
 I will do what is impossible to drive him 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:58.459
 will be so show the same result 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:02.180
 the process itself 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:30.700
 need to drill to the second glass 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:30.700
 if not to drill the crack will go well 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:40.630
 That's all 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:43.880
 with such glass you can still ride 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:48.500
 a short period of time until you find 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:54.430
 replacing the windshield as such 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:57.350
 the crack is already punished even by ours 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.400
 law enforcement well and 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:04.120
 security of course for yourself 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.120
 Thanks for attention
