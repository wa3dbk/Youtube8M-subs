00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 St. Petersburg showed new cars 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.899
 who will be on the routes soon 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.550
 Russian railways largest 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.670
 interest of the participants of the railway 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:14.130
 the exhibition caused a double-decker car conveniently 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.509
 do ride the train on the second floor in 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.039
 I found out all the details 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:22.590
 elena dodonova double-decker car 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.029
 serial number 001 out of tsykov 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.130
 Tver Carriage Works 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.750
 just a few months ago 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.730
 idea to build such rolling stock 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.099
 for Russian railways at all 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.739
 little and attempts were in the eighties 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.780
 thirties and even before the revolution only here 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.430
 further prototypes did not go 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.690
 now a two-story car in Tver 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.969
 had to design considering 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.590
 modern state of railways 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.510
 main focus on climatic 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.910
 features the car should go without 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.559
 failures severe frosts to minus 50 and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.780
 to withstand heavy loads because 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.640
 passengers in the double-decker car will succeed 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.940
 fit almost twice as much as in 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.980
 it was very difficult to achieve that 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.180
 so that the double-decker car would like 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.699
 existing dimensions 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.680
 for this were applied unique 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.659
 design solutions ie this 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.970
 the car has no spinal beam it has 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.979
 space frame this allowed us 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.710
 lower the center of gravity of the car reduce it 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.330
 height and at the same time as shown 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.280
 Cheat wagon tests 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.280
 fully complies with our Russian 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.930
 body rigidity requirements there we are 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.939
 checked about the twisting we performed 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.159
 brake tests double deck cars 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.750
 for economy class transportation therefore 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.520
 every centimeter in multilayer 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.220
 constructions try to use as 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.200
 can be more rational so that 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.759
 double-decker carriage fit as much as possible 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.590
 more passengers space inside 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.869
 I had to limit as much as possible 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.329
 so for example the place between the shelves in the compartment 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.680
 it became much less but what to do 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.460
 passengers will have to suffer 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.890
 feel spacious 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.200
 a double-decker car is prevented by low ceilings 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.299
 above 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.159
 tier took just over five meters 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:56.320
 cube and had to remove the usual 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.689
 luggage racks suitcases can be put 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.210
 except under the seat but safety 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.350
 passengers took care of the wagon made of 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.420
 non-combustible materials 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.560
 and in each compartment put smoke sensors 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.300
 in case of fire or some 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.160
 authorized smoking allowed 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.110
 stingy if it hits us works 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.860
 sensor means information goes here 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.170
 sound signal 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.880
 we have shutters automatically closed 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.230
 in this swim well for people with 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.879
 limited opportunities with 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.830
 double-decker carriage adapted here 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:25.569
 such a special lift that with 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.209
 by pressing just one button 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.099
 will take you straight to the door though 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.760
 this way and heavy suitcase and in 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.620
 the wagon can also be loaded on 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.239
 the second floor of the car really their bags 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.340
 will have to bring the stairs 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.530
 but now in the new seating modifications 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.799
 2 floor as a doctor promise to provide 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.840
 in the cabin lifts for personal belongings 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.760
 annually we plan upon confirmation 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.349
 declared characteristics and parameters 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.280
 yah type turned up was the 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:56.980
 we plan to order from 50 to 200 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.230
 wagons every year and now we 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.850
 in addition to the declared type, we 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.850
 Now Tver car rest plant 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.200
 worked out by the questions of the regional 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.480
 interregional cars that is carriage with 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.049
 seating places with the first 2 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.670
 class 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.769
 new rolling stock on iron 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.930
 Roads of Russia will appear in the summer of this 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.819
 years the first high train will go 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.650
 from Moscow to Adler and then to Kazan 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.870
 Voronezh and Saransk in the plans to put 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.220
 double-deck cars to those directions where 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.200
 the number of passengers will be 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.000
 to increase Elena Dodonova Oleg 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.959
 polischuk st petersburg specially for 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.959
 transportation programs
