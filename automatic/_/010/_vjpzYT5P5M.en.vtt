00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.899 
you're bored anyway so here um yeah so
have<00:01:37.740> enough<00:01:38.009> used<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.430> be<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.700> little

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
have enough used to be like a little

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.880 
have enough used to be like a little
shop<00:01:39.119> too<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.630> love<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.110> place<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.680> I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
guess because the quality of the tea is

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.380

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
pretty good they ended up expanding to a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.920 
pretty good they ended up expanding to a
bigger<00:01:46.110> branch<00:01:46.409> but<00:01:47.180> here's<00:01:48.180> another<00:01:48.299> shop

it's<00:01:52.290> it's<00:01:52.560> probably<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.250> it's<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.610> little

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
it's it's probably because it's a little
