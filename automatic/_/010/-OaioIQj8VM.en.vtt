we want to talk about divots and the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.289 
we want to talk about divots and the
quality<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.840> strike<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.740> your<00:01:53.520> tendency<00:01:54.150> they

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
quality of strike in your tendency they

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.500 
quality of strike in your tendency they
hit<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.630> golf<00:01:54.840> ball<00:01:54.990> fat<00:01:56.270> but<00:01:57.270> should<00:01:57.479> you

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
hit the golf ball fat but should you

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.120 
hit the golf ball fat but should you
make<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.869> same<00:01:58.110> divots<00:01:58.470> with<00:01:58.680> your<00:01:58.920> long

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
make the same divots with your long

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.890 
make the same divots with your long
irons<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.790> do<00:01:59.939> with<00:02:00.060> your<00:02:00.240> short<00:02:00.540> items

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
irons as you do with your short items

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.050 
irons as you do with your short items
okay<00:02:01.500> great<00:02:01.950> question<00:02:02.580> and<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.030> a

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
okay great question and this is a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.170 
okay great question and this is a
question<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.720> affects<00:02:04.140> all<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.380> us<00:02:04.619> golfers

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
question that affects all of us golfers

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.419 
question that affects all of us golfers
because<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.869> want<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.320> hit<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> ball<00:02:07.770> solidly

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
because we want to hit the ball solidly

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.490 
because we want to hit the ball solidly
when<00:02:08.760> we<00:02:08.940> swing<00:02:09.269> whatever<00:02:09.720> iron<00:02:10.049> we<00:02:10.350> are

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
when we swing whatever iron we are

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.979 
when we swing whatever iron we are
swinging<00:02:11.010> obviously<00:02:11.850> much<00:02:12.120> less<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.720> an<00:02:12.810> issue

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
swinging obviously much less of an issue

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.690 
swinging obviously much less of an issue
with<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.470> driver<00:02:13.739> off<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.040> tee<00:02:14.220> or<00:02:14.580> the

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
with the driver off the tee or the

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.039 
with the driver off the tee or the
fairway<00:02:15.090> woods<00:02:15.360> which<00:02:15.570> are<00:02:15.750> more<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:15.930> a

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
fairway woods which are more of a

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.979 
fairway woods which are more of a
sweeping<00:02:16.350> type<00:02:16.950> of<00:02:17.160> Swing<00:02:17.510> but<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.660> probably

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
sweeping type of Swing but the probably

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.630 
sweeping type of Swing but the probably
the<00:02:19.049> biggest<00:02:19.290> difference<00:02:19.590> between<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.370> long

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
the biggest difference between the long

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.060 
the biggest difference between the long
irons<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.120> short<00:02:21.360> irons<00:02:21.690> are<00:02:21.890> number<00:02:22.890> one

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
irons and the short irons are number one

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.620 
irons and the short irons are number one
the<00:02:23.250> length<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.760> golf<00:02:23.970> club<00:02:24.269> the<00:02:24.450> long

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
the length of the golf club the long

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.600 
the length of the golf club the long
irons<00:02:24.840> are<00:02:25.110> longer<00:02:25.530> than<00:02:25.799> the<00:02:26.040> short<00:02:26.280> irons

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
irons are longer than the short irons

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.640 
irons are longer than the short irons
but<00:02:26.880> number<00:02:27.299> two<00:02:27.329> the<00:02:27.720> distance<00:02:28.200> we<00:02:28.410> then

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
but number two the distance we then

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.860 
but number two the distance we then
stand<00:02:29.160> from<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.820> golf<00:02:30.060> ball<00:02:30.299> because<00:02:30.720> with

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
stand from the golf ball because with

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.780 
stand from the golf ball because with
the<00:02:30.989> shorter<00:02:31.350> irons<00:02:31.650> I'm<00:02:31.799> much<00:02:32.010> closer<00:02:32.340> to<00:02:32.549> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the shorter irons I'm much closer to the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.880 
the shorter irons I'm much closer to the
golf<00:02:33.000> ball<00:02:33.239> with<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.110> longer<00:02:34.440> irons<00:02:34.709> I'm

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
golf ball with the longer irons I'm

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.770 
golf ball with the longer irons I'm
further<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.610> that<00:02:35.640> indeed<00:02:36.060> does<00:02:36.299> become<00:02:36.570> a

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
further and that indeed does become a

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.830 
further and that indeed does become a
little<00:02:37.230> bit<00:02:37.260> more<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.890> sweeping<00:02:38.250> swing

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
little bit more of a sweeping swing

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.160 
little bit more of a sweeping swing
although<00:02:40.590> my<00:02:41.069> goal<00:02:41.340> with<00:02:41.760> all<00:02:42.239> of<00:02:42.540> my<00:02:42.690> divots

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
although my goal with all of my divots

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.130 
although my goal with all of my divots
are<00:02:43.560> all<00:02:43.950> of<00:02:44.160> my<00:02:44.310> strikes<00:02:44.760> is<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.720> have<00:02:45.930> the

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
are all of my strikes is to have the

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.580 
are all of my strikes is to have the
ball<00:02:46.430> hit<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.629> middle<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.140> my<00:02:49.319> club

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
ball hit in the in the middle of my club

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.210 
ball hit in the in the middle of my club
face<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.250> then<00:02:51.239> this<00:02:51.450> soul<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.709> golf<00:02:52.950> club

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
face and then this soul of the golf club

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.440 
face and then this soul of the golf club
to<00:02:53.370> be<00:02:53.489> riding<00:02:54.090> along<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.660> turf<00:02:55.640> ideally<00:02:56.640> with

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
to be riding along the turf ideally with

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.380 
to be riding along the turf ideally with
this<00:02:57.750> shaft<00:02:58.080> angle<00:02:58.640> leaning<00:02:59.640> forward<00:03:00.239> at

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
this shaft angle leaning forward at

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.080 
this shaft angle leaning forward at
impact<00:03:00.810> what<00:03:01.470> I<00:03:01.500> don't<00:03:01.769> want<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:02.310> scooping

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
impact what I don't want is a scooping

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.670 
impact what I don't want is a scooping
action<00:03:03.510> where<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.780> shaft<00:03:04.080> angle<00:03:04.349> goes

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
action where the shaft angle goes

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.910 
action where the shaft angle goes
backwards<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:06.239> is<00:03:06.510> most<00:03:07.019> indicative<00:03:07.530> of

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
backwards this is most indicative of

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.580 
backwards this is most indicative of
high<00:03:08.190> handicap<00:03:08.910> golfers<00:03:09.450> they<00:03:09.629> will<00:03:09.840> scoop<00:03:10.349> at

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
high handicap golfers they will scoop at

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.830 
high handicap golfers they will scoop at
it<00:03:10.739> with<00:03:10.920> their<00:03:11.099> hands<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:11.819> then<00:03:12.450> they<00:03:12.599> run

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
it with their hands and then they run

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.120 
it with their hands and then they run
into<00:03:13.079> all<00:03:13.230> kinds<00:03:13.560> of<00:03:13.620> problems<00:03:13.799> because<00:03:14.069> you

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
into all kinds of problems because you

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.130 
into all kinds of problems because you
can<00:03:14.250> see<00:03:14.459> I<00:03:14.489> just<00:03:14.640> turned<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.329> 7-iron<00:03:15.989> that

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
can see I just turned this 7-iron that

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.229 
can see I just turned this 7-iron that
I'm<00:03:16.260> holding<00:03:16.500> into<00:03:17.130> a<00:03:17.160> nine<00:03:17.549> iron<00:03:17.790> or<00:03:18.030> pitching

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
I'm holding into a nine iron or pitching

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.420 
I'm holding into a nine iron or pitching
wedge<00:03:18.569> and<00:03:18.930> then<00:03:19.530> that's<00:03:19.739> when<00:03:19.920> people<00:03:20.099> will

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
wedge and then that's when people will

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.059 
wedge and then that's when people will
say<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.970> tend<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.720> hit<00:03:21.900> all<00:03:22.049> my<00:03:22.290> clubs<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.799> same

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
say I tend to hit all my clubs the same

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.100 
say I tend to hit all my clubs the same
distance<00:03:23.610> so<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.120> run<00:03:24.390> into<00:03:24.569> all<00:03:24.720> kinds<00:03:25.049> of

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
distance so you run into all kinds of

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.809 
distance so you run into all kinds of
problems<00:03:25.319> so<00:03:25.650> ideally<00:03:26.129> we<00:03:26.280> want<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.610> have<00:03:26.790> the

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
problems so ideally we want to have the

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.180
