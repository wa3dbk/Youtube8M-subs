00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:35.389 
let the result look after itself there

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:37.930 
let the result look after itself there
are<00:02:35.480> other<00:02:35.569> areas<00:02:36.639> concentration<00:02:37.639> being

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
the one time that you just switch off

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.509 
the one time that you just switch off
this<00:02:44.540> be<00:02:44.810> the<00:02:44.959> time<00:02:45.200> when<00:02:45.950> you<00:02:46.069> might<00:02:46.250> need<00:02:46.280> to

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
this be the time when you might need to

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.160 
this be the time when you might need to

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
make that decision I make that save

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.440 
make that decision I make that save
which<00:02:48.440> could<00:02:48.709> end<00:02:48.739> up<00:02:49.069> in<00:02:49.190> either<00:02:49.370> winning<00:02:50.209> or

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
which could end up in either winning or

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.550 
which could end up in either winning or
losing<00:02:50.720> again<00:02:51.170> so<00:02:51.920> remember<00:02:52.299> concentration

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
losing again so remember concentration

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.920 
losing again so remember concentration
absolutely<00:02:54.560> vital<00:02:54.769> in<00:02:55.069> the<00:02:55.160> modern<00:02:55.430> day<00:02:55.459> game

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
absolutely vital in the modern day game

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.539 
absolutely vital in the modern day game
reaction<00:02:56.930> speed<00:02:57.290> so<00:02:57.829> when<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.069> do<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.310> you<00:02:58.370> go

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
reaction speed so when you do and you go

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.879 
reaction speed so when you do and you go
keep<00:02:58.700> in<00:02:58.880> that<00:02:59.000> kind<00:02:59.329> of<00:02:59.389> speed<00:02:59.660> but<00:02:59.900> also<00:03:00.049> the

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:00.889 
keep in that kind of speed but also the

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.949 
keep in that kind of speed but also the
speed<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.459> you<00:03:01.609> need<00:03:01.790> when<00:03:01.819> you<00:03:02.060> faced<00:03:02.720> with

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
speed that you need when you faced with

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.349 
speed that you need when you faced with
either<00:03:03.109> a<00:03:03.260> 1v1<00:03:03.739> or<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.459> through<00:03:04.850> ball<00:03:05.120> the

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:05.359 
either a 1v1 or the through ball the

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:06.940 
either a 1v1 or the through ball the
speed<00:03:05.660> of<00:03:05.810> coming<00:03:06.079> off<00:03:06.170> your<00:03:06.290> line<00:03:06.470> to<00:03:06.500> collect

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
speed of coming off your line to collect

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.979 
speed of coming off your line to collect
the<00:03:07.069> ball<00:03:07.250> so<00:03:07.880> there's<00:03:08.090> two<00:03:08.269> kinds<00:03:08.690> of<00:03:08.780> speed

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
the ball so there's two kinds of speed

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.830 
the ball so there's two kinds of speed
as<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.350> say<00:03:09.620> which<00:03:09.829> are<00:03:10.010> absolutely<00:03:10.400> vital
