00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello dear good colleagues 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.430
 traditions I celebrate every new year 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.049
 different countries and this time I got into 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.540
 United Arab Emirates 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:15.629
 actually in dubai where decided to meet 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.720
 2015 and for good reason 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.480
 for me, dubai is a miracle 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.090
 of the world because as you know 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.220
 united arab emirates this place 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.320
 where the desert used to be and actually 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.769
 nothing was here except camels 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.629
 novels and some incomprehensible pieces 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.579
 today all people from all over the world come 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.309
 here to look at 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.980
 amazing skyscrapers on perfectly 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.530
 some unreal things that all these 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.770
 Arabs and generally the whole world build it here 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.680
 fantastically here in theory can not 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.230
 be trees can not bloom flowers but 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.449
 there is absolutely everything and this again 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.120
 proves that nothing is impossible 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.239
 there is the most important thing is daring 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.059
 desires are opportunities that we ourselves 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.980
 We also include the courage for 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.410
 to implement all this exactly 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.510
 these qualities are exactly these goals I want 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.270
 To become the main for each of the 20 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.090
 Dare to put on the new year the most 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.910
 do not be afraid of large planks 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.400
 don't listen to what other people say 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.220
 don't prepare me for anything bad 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.270
 god take your life your hands 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.340
 take responsibility for your life 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.590
 and start doing what you want because 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.649
 that there is no better time for this than 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:36.170
 Now remember this and I really want 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.509
 to exactly one year when you will 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.340
 read your goals that you spelled out i 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.929
 I'm sure you did it because I 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.360
 your whole brain has already buzzed over it 

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.759
 you looked about and said cool 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.240
 achieved everything and no matter what happened 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.590
 around 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.020
 the most important thing is to be a fan 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.049
 your life being a person who 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.420
 sick for themselves for their loved ones and nothing 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.640
 not being afraid of myself on this one 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.789
 finish your congratulations to the president 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.810

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.160
 spent with me and promise that 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.500
