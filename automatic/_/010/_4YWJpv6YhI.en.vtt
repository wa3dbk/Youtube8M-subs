00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:10.370
 round 24 thousand 259 to a hundred more 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.019
 next to the nearest hundred 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.480
 you will see that these exercises are very 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:17.150
 simple but what do you want to do now? 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.880
 reflect on what it means to give 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.980
 the nearest hundred what I'm going to do is 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.869
 draw a number line or draw 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.970
 a numerical goal and will mark 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.939
 hundreds on the number line 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:34.940
 I will start by starting at 24 thousand and 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:39.350
 leave after we have the 24,200 after the 24 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:41.540
 thousand three hundred and twenty-four thousand 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.520
 I think they should notice that I am doing 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.039
 I'm just dialing hundreds. 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.840
 I'm walking 100 in 100 now in this 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:53.270
 numerical straight when the 24 thousand 259 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.000
 if we look at the number line it is larger 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:02.120
 than 24 thousand two hundred and less than 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.170
 24 thousand and three hundred to dig in 259 59 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.330
 distance equal to 100 59 is more or 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.159
 less here more or less here our 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.470
 numbers 24 thousand 259 if you are asked to 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.330
 stop walking the nearest hundred 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.970
 I'm telling you to round off a 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.170
 of these values to the value of the hundred 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.689
 nearest 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.270
 if you look at the number in this way if 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:31.430
 look at me even if it's closer 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:34.759
 of 24 thousand and 300 than of 24,200 when 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.250
 we inherited for 24 thousand three hundred 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.159
 be endowed with the nearest hundred 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.790
 answer and 24 thousand and 300 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.009
 this is conceptual interpretation and reason 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.860
 to say is the nearest hundred 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.140
 so it will be closer and 24 thousand and 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.090
 three hundred when they resolve the exercise 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.460
 these do not have money always a goal 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.469
 and go through all this step 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.540
 although they may think about them 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:02.000
 a more symbolic method or perhaps more 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.560
 mechanic and look at the number or 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.690
 write it again 24 thousand 259 we want 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.610
 round the nearest hundred by 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.610
 This we look at the hundreds 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.180
 This is the house of hundreds when you do not 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.250
 to give 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.129
 we no longer want cremation organisms 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.170
 06 to go to the house of hundreds 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.760
 What we do is look at the house next. 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.560
 to which we are walking 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.170
 this is the house of hundreds so 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.079
 We looked at the 5's next door if the 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:34.040
 number is 5 or greater than 5 if it is 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:36.950
 yes 6789 we round up 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.519
 if it is 5 or greater than 5 rounds 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:43.730
 up we walk up 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:47.269
 gift give up in this case as we have 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.849
 15 is equal to or greater than 5 is good to give 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.389
 for up means that we get 24 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.840
 thousand 

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.970
 the writing this 24 000 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.109
 as we are rounding up the 2 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.389
 to spend 3 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:04.849
 we increased one we are round to 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:08.030
 in which four thousand and 324 thousand and 306 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:13.359
 mean of walking up against 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:16.790
 examples we had 24 thousand 249 24 thousand 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:20.329
 249 and we wanted to round off the hundred 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.819
 we would say ok to round it off 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.549
 the nearest hundred has to look at 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.729
 house of tens is home and send talents 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.569
 that the right is not equal thus the greater 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:32.030
 than five 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.229
 so we give it down rondon we give 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.359
 down 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:37.459
 when we roll down and we need to 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.349
 being careful does not mean that we have to 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.030
 decreasing these two means that 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.579
 we were only 2 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.959
 we have eliminated everything that is going on 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:50.329
 24 thousand and 200 horses downstairs 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.780
 Uh, sure, let's go upstairs and get 24 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:56.949
 thousand and three hundred and makes sense 24 thousand 249 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.340
 stay the course because it is closer to 

00:03:56.949 --> 00:04:03.620
 24,200 in this case 24,200 and hundreds more 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.519
 next when we turn down 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:10.099
 in the case of the exercise 24 thousand 259 hundred 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:13.389
 and 24 thousand and 300 is 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.389
 round up
