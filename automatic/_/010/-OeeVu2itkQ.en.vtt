00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.110
 that they placed their process that is an equal process are for clarion to the 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.109
 sure head that will be a process 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.060
 one 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.079
 task ship to follow to open up 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:25.779
 objective press 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.840
 let's say it saves lives an exact goal 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.510
 this is a simple 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.690
 The closeness that justice can not follow a process has been reflected in a 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.780
 document in which they point out that this is so 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.520
 I think it is a compilation that has to be adapted and I would award the 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.200
 people who are involved 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.340
 but as much as possible try to do it as much 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.340
 the request 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.860
 I may be 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.910
 13 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.220
 that they and their surroundings 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.739
 general guidelines 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.790
 virosque 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.590
 conjuncture p 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.430
 the market 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.930
 as it lends a lot to plate sudden changes not 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.530
 the client 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.270
 it was a change a one-time campaign 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.270
 a change in your market strategy that makes you apply in other processes 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.050
 because they probably let us know shortly in advance 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.050
 and just rational killings is that ever 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.680
 in sequence to sixth loquillo 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.900
 to yesterday's performance 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.690
 their competitor and they are something that makes them win something therefore 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.120
 We've changed 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.120
 our water processes 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.630
 in the siemon area 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.210
 the market is much more dynamic modern 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.979
 speed and very fast key campaigns 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.100
 very dynamic 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.480
 and the week response time then 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.240
 it is more likely that there is a lag in the process 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.370
 which we are going to have some flexibility 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.200
 in such a dynamic market 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.530
 but overall 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.230
 let's say yes they wanted to receive a recommendation to the hearing of seville 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.959
 I will treat 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.739
 hence they anticipate as much as possible 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.989
 including some change in 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.159
 between customer orders 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.259
 down a path 

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:22.469
 sing year 

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:25.749
 with a change of strategy of its competitors 

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:30.179
 and is that every time since long they are as predictable as possible and 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:32.739
 the visit of the heels in the same process 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.300
 determine contingency case contingency 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.300
 for this year it happened that we have 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.599
 what has processes 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.999
 helps you meet the needs of the client an official report 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.769
 stacie for being an entity without more frequency is a fact 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:54.509
 in which as I say there is 

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:55.949
 which we should 

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.639
 make a small return to the process to be able to satisfy a need 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:00.189
 punctual
