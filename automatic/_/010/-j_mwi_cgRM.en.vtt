the<00:02:27.879> field<00:02:28.209> is<00:02:29.110> city<00:02:29.790> from<00:02:30.790> here<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.690> looks<00:02:31.870> as

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
the field is city from here it looks as

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:35.339 
the field is city from here it looks as
if<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:33.090> field<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.299> actually<00:02:34.810> really<00:02:35.019> bigger

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
if the field is actually really bigger

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.780 
if the field is actually really bigger
than<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.680> sea<00:02:36.480> which<00:02:37.480> is<00:02:37.659> pretty<00:02:37.870> weird<00:02:38.140> I

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
than the sea which is pretty weird I

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.619 
than the sea which is pretty weird I
mean<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.940> can<00:02:40.180> understand<00:02:40.599> that<00:02:40.659> the<00:02:40.870> farms<00:02:41.409> and

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
mean I can understand that the farms and

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.750 
mean I can understand that the farms and
mines<00:02:43.629> and<00:02:43.870> everything<00:02:44.200> without<00:02:44.319> bought<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
mines and everything without bought the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.360 
mines and everything without bought the
farm<00:02:46.030> actually<00:02:46.420> looks<00:02:46.540> bigger<00:02:46.870> than<00:02:47.370> what

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370
