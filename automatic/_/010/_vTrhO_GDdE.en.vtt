00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:12.220
 well I think it's a difficult group with 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:17.080
 good names good teams a priori 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.080
 the ascetic who is a classic of the 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.160
 of the competition usually 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.970
 participate in European competitions 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.970
 the same as partizÃ¡n 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.199
 is a team that comes from the champions and 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.650
 you have to remember that he is the champion of 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:40.570
 Serbian and good league and Burbano 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.570
 of the bundesliga that was fifth 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.740
 that where in front of the schalke 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.700
 in front of the dortmund which is another team 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.510
 in front they play in 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.120
 in the champions then then now 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.200
 I think they are an attractive group and 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.620
 complicated 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.700
 we do not know yet how we will know two 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.500
 bears when we have to compete 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.199
 nor how our rivals will be 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.940
 it is clear that the calendar is going to 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.790
 be very tight for everyone to 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.470
 we also have many parties 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.280
 also of league between week and we have 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.740
 to manage it 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.650
 we will need the whole template and with 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.660
 with respect to the rivals because unit 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.940
 we will see and we will see how they are going 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:26.500
 his championships but he accepts it has 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.990
 a fairly new team the groups then 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.430
 good arrived at the matches has got 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.430
 a point so far 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.840
 with the bat borisov in the preview of the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.080
 champions 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.920
 we still do not have references but 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.840
 we have to have more references 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.610
 immediate when it's good when 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.320
 we want opposites truth is the same 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.720
 I do not have any 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.370
 the difference in that sense for the 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.370
 last game home games you can 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.380
 have some advantage in the sense of 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.189
 that you can correct some problem that 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.420
 may miss more points but 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:09.280
 regardless of that 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.920
 I want to get well in conditions 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.390
 with our full team and still 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.600
 knowing that we are going to use all the 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.600
 template
