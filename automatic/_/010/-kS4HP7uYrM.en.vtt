00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
from my phone it was really hard to

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.030 
from my phone it was really hard to
define<00:01:14.400> cases<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.000> fit<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.360> phone<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:16.380> they<00:01:16.710> had

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
define cases I fit my phone so they had

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.160 
define cases I fit my phone so they had
they<00:01:17.580> had<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.820> nice<00:01:18.060> array<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.390> think<00:01:18.689> about<00:01:18.840> 20

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
they had a nice array I think about 20

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.990 
they had a nice array I think about 20
cases<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.650> could<00:01:19.799> choose<00:01:19.979> from<00:01:20.220> for<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.520> fun

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
cases I could choose from for this fun

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
cases I could choose from for this fun
and<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.229> a<00:01:22.259> nice<00:01:22.409> array<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.650> all<00:01:22.830> types

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
and they have a nice array of all types

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.710 
and they have a nice array of all types
of<00:01:23.189> phone<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:23.700> can<00:01:24.030> probably<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.509> there

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
of phone so you can probably go there

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.149 
of phone so you can probably go there
whatever<00:01:24.990> form<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.320> have<00:01:25.409> probably<00:01:25.830> find<00:01:26.100> a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
whatever form you have probably find a
