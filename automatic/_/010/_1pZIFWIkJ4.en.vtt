the low E middle finger on the high E

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.070 
the low E middle finger on the high E
then<00:00:57.250> go<00:00:57.460> a<00:00:57.780> d<00:00:59.610> g/b

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.100 

my<00:01:05.040> fingering<00:01:05.430> I'm<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:06.090> thumb<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.840> middle

my fingering I'm going thumb in middle

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.780 
my fingering I'm going thumb in middle
and<00:01:07.350> thumb<00:01:07.770> thumb<00:01:08.700> index<00:01:09.120> middle<00:01:09.990> index<00:01:10.800> you

and thumb thumb index middle index you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.080 
and thumb thumb index middle index you
could<00:01:12.000> go<00:01:12.260> like<00:01:13.260> thumb<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:14.100> index<00:01:14.760> middle

could go like thumb and index middle

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.910 
could go like thumb and index middle
ring<00:01:15.390> it's<00:01:16.110> not<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.620> wrong<00:01:16.740> either

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
ring it's not going to be wrong either

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.190 
ring it's not going to be wrong either
way<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.700> more<00:01:17.910> figures<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.330> involve<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
way the more figures you involve the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.050 
way the more figures you involve the
better<00:01:19.410> the<00:01:19.710> practice<00:01:20.190> and<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.670> gets<00:01:20.820> the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
better the practice and it gets the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.700 
better the practice and it gets the
other<00:01:21.180> finger<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.810> little<00:01:21.930> more<00:01:22.230> comfortable

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
other finger a little more comfortable

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.640 
other finger a little more comfortable
so<00:01:25.190> okay<00:01:26.190> then<00:01:26.370> we<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.820> b-minor<00:01:27.240> bar

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
so okay then we go to a b-minor bar

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
so okay then we go to a b-minor bar
cover<00:01:28.650> fret<00:01:29.400> two<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> all<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.330> way<00:01:30.390> to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
cover fret two on the a all the way to

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.660 
cover fret two on the a all the way to

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.880 

so<00:01:50.370> I'm<00:01:50.700> going<00:01:50.940> some<00:01:51.300> little<00:01:51.900> hand<00:01:52.230> X<00:01:52.500> thumb

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.390 

it's<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> good<00:01:58.290> idea<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.560> subgroup<00:01:59.010> that<00:01:59.220> and

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
it's a good idea to subgroup that and

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.800 
it's a good idea to subgroup that and
just<00:01:59.640> keep<00:01:59.790> repeating<00:01:59.939> it

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.160 

then<00:02:04.810> C<00:02:05.110> major<00:02:05.320> three<00:02:05.860> A<00:02:06.330> to<00:02:07.330> D<00:02:08.010> 1<00:02:09.010> B<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.460> go

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
then C major three A to D 1 B and go

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.660 
then C major three A to D 1 B and go
middle<00:02:11.170> finger<00:02:11.440> on<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.920> a<00:02:11.950> string<00:02:12.070> of<00:02:12.550> your
