00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.609 
let's listen to it sound play also
before<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.909> does<00:01:18.119> have<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:19.290> doesn't<00:01:19.530> work

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
before that it does have it doesn't work

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.100 
before that it does have it doesn't work
with<00:01:19.799> NFC<00:01:20.189> or<00:01:20.520> near<00:01:20.549> field<00:01:20.729> communications<00:01:21.509> so

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
with NFC or near field communications so

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.660 
with NFC or near field communications so
you<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.350> actually<00:01:22.500> use<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.159> other<00:01:23.460> ways

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
you can actually use it in other ways

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.940 
you can actually use it in other ways
other<00:01:23.909> than<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.240> blue<00:01:24.659> cheese<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.710> I'm<00:01:25.799> gonna

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
idea of the overall sound so we're going

00:01:35.610 --> 00:02:02.960

so<00:02:11.740> overall<00:02:12.190> actually<00:02:12.760> it's<00:02:12.880> good<00:02:13.030> clean

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
so overall actually it's good clean

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.490 
so overall actually it's good clean
sound

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
sound

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.520

it<00:02:14.820> doesn't<00:02:15.820> absolutely<00:02:16.030> boom<00:02:16.870> with<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.350> bass

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
it doesn't absolutely boom with the bass

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.320 
it doesn't absolutely boom with the bass
but<00:02:18.070> for<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.310> size<00:02:18.460> that<00:02:18.760> actually<00:02:19.030> sounds

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
but for the size that actually sounds

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.300 
but for the size that actually sounds
better<00:02:19.480> than<00:02:19.690> I<00:02:19.720> expected<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.380> has<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.920> good

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
better than I expected it has a good

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.370 
better than I expected it has a good
mid-range<00:02:21.520> response<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.480> could<00:02:22.960> clean<00:02:23.200> high

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
mid-range response and could clean high

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.730 
mid-range response and could clean high
so<00:02:23.650> it's<00:02:23.830> a<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.790> me<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.690> these<00:02:26.110> different

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
so it's a to me and these different

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.560 
so it's a to me and these different
Bluetooth<00:02:27.100> speakers<00:02:27.490> it<00:02:27.970> probably<00:02:28.300> has<00:02:28.420> this

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
Bluetooth speakers it probably has this

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.260 
Bluetooth speakers it probably has this
good<00:02:28.750> a<00:02:28.780> sound<00:02:29.110> as<00:02:29.290> I've<00:02:29.410> heard<00:02:29.760> it's<00:02:30.760> not<00:02:30.970> real

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
good a sound as I've heard it's not real

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.600 
good a sound as I've heard it's not real
deep<00:02:31.480> for<00:02:32.230> bass<00:02:32.380> but<00:02:32.650> if<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.950> size<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.430> power

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
deep for bass but if the size and power

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.880 
deep for bass but if the size and power
rating<00:02:34.080> it<00:02:35.080> probably<00:02:35.440> does<00:02:35.560> better<00:02:35.740> than<00:02:35.860> I

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
rating it probably does better than I

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.910 
rating it probably does better than I
thought<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.220> would<00:02:36.280> do<00:02:37.230> okay<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.470> couple<00:02:38.800> more

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
thought it would do okay a couple more

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.560 
thought it would do okay a couple more

it<00:02:57.520> at<00:02:57.610> full<00:02:57.730> volume<00:02:57.970> it--<00:02:58.300> get<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.600> little<00:02:58.900> bit

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
it at full volume it-- get a little bit

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.449 
it at full volume it-- get a little bit
less<00:02:59.140> than<00:02:59.290> that<00:02:59.350> so<00:02:59.709> keep<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.070> mind

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
less than that so keep that in mind

standby it has 700 hours of standby time
which<00:03:04.750> is<00:03:04.930> pretty<00:03:05.680> good<00:03:05.890> I<00:03:05.950> guess<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:07.450> is

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
which is pretty good I guess it is

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.090 
which is pretty good I guess it is
pretty<00:03:08.080> tough<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.709> rubberized

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
pretty tough this is a rubberized

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.760 
pretty tough this is a rubberized
surface<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.940> if<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.120> drop<00:03:10.330> it<00:03:10.390> I'm<00:03:11.110> not<00:03:11.380> too

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
surface so if you drop it I'm not too

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.890 
surface so if you drop it I'm not too
worried<00:03:12.040> about<00:03:12.070> it<00:03:12.220> getting<00:03:12.489> damaged<00:03:12.910> or

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
worried about it getting damaged or

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.110 
worried about it getting damaged or
scuffed<00:03:14.530> even<00:03:14.799> for<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:14.980> matter<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:15.519> it<00:03:15.700> is

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
scuffed even for that matter so it is

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.600 
scuffed even for that matter so it is
pretty<00:03:16.420> good<00:03:16.540> so<00:03:16.810> my<00:03:17.320> final<00:03:17.769> verdict<00:03:18.340> on<00:03:18.430> the
