is mr. Buffington and today we're going
to<00:00:08.040> be<00:00:08.130> talking<00:00:08.370> about<00:00:08.840> set<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:10.170> not<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.219> drum

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
to be talking about set and not the drum

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.879 
to be talking about set and not the drum
set<00:00:11.760> or<00:00:12.120> swing<00:00:12.389> set<00:00:12.600> or<00:00:12.750> CD<00:00:13.049> set<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.320> trend<00:00:13.590> set

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
set or swing set or CD set a trend set

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.709 
set or swing set or CD set a trend set
but<00:00:14.490> we're<00:00:14.760> going<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.059> be<00:00:15.150> talking<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.599> little

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
but we're going to be talking a little

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.980 
but we're going to be talking a little
bit<00:00:15.870> more<00:00:16.020> about<00:00:16.439> what<00:00:16.650> we<00:00:16.800> discussed<00:00:16.980> before

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 
bit more about what we discussed before

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.130 
bit more about what we discussed before
about<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.020> set<00:00:19.560> being<00:00:19.920> just<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.430> list<00:00:20.610> of<00:00:20.730> numbers

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
about a set being just a list of numbers

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.769 
about a set being just a list of numbers
so<00:00:22.140> quick<00:00:22.710> quick<00:00:23.220> recap<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.789> set<00:00:24.240> is<00:00:24.449> just<00:00:24.689> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
so quick quick recap a set is just a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.320 
so quick quick recap a set is just a
series<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.230> numbers<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:26.279> in<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.789> past<00:00:27.060> is

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
series of numbers that in the past is

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.480 
series of numbers that in the past is
substituted<00:00:28.140> into<00:00:28.289> an<00:00:28.529> equation<00:00:28.859> or<00:00:29.279> an

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
substituted into an equation or an

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.479 
substituted into an equation or an
expression<00:00:30.410> it's<00:00:31.410> usually<00:00:31.590> represented

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
expression it's usually represented

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.450 
expression it's usually represented
using<00:00:32.669> these<00:00:33.480> of<00:00:33.629> squiggly<00:00:34.110> parentheses<00:00:34.920> so

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
using these of squiggly parentheses so

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.610 
using these of squiggly parentheses so
that<00:00:35.489> would<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.059> set<00:00:36.330> of<00:00:36.570> negative<00:00:36.840> 1<00:00:37.199> 2<00:00:37.440> &amp;

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
that would be the set of negative 1 2 &amp;

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.250 
that would be the set of negative 1 2 &amp;
4<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.270> today<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:39.480> will<00:00:39.630> actually<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:40.140> using

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
4 and today we will actually be using

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.010 
4 and today we will actually be using
these<00:00:40.980> sets<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.610> make<00:00:41.640> groups<00:00:42.120> which<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:42.989> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
these sets to make groups which is a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.389 
these sets to make groups which is a
little<00:00:43.320> different<00:00:43.680> than<00:00:43.829> what<00:00:43.950> we<00:00:44.040> did<00:00:44.190> with

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
little different than what we did with

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.420 
little different than what we did with
sets<00:00:44.670> before<00:00:44.940> I'll<00:00:45.629> show<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.870> what<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.079> mean

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
sets before I'll show you what I mean

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.670 
sets before I'll show you what I mean
there's<00:00:47.430> two<00:00:47.640> ways<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.149> write<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.930> phrase

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
there's two ways to write this phrase

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.450 
there's two ways to write this phrase
this<00:00:50.010> sentence<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.920> either<00:00:53.039> write

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
this sentence here you can either write

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.590 
this sentence here you can either write
all<00:00:53.760> even<00:00:54.480> numbers<00:00:54.690> from<00:00:55.500> 0<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> 10<00:00:56.239> or<00:00:57.239> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
all even numbers from 0 to 10 or you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.520 
all even numbers from 0 to 10 or you
could<00:00:57.809> use<00:00:58.050> our<00:00:58.320> set<00:00:59.390> notation<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.809> actually

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
could use our set notation and actually

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.410 
could use our set notation and actually
write<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.520> set<00:01:02.850> out<00:01:03.120> so<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.110> one<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.410> these

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
write the set out so which one of these

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.920 
write the set out so which one of these
sets<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.259> list<00:01:08.039> of<00:01:08.250> even<00:01:08.759> numbers<00:01:08.970> from<00:01:09.540> 0

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
sets is the list of even numbers from 0

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.740 
sets is the list of even numbers from 0
to<00:01:10.049> 10<00:01:10.409> by<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.369> way<00:01:11.549> zeros<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.420> really

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
to 10 by the way zeros not really

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.719 
to 10 by the way zeros not really
counted<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.229> an<00:01:13.350> even<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:13.770> an<00:01:13.799> odd<00:01:14.070> number<00:01:14.130> so

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
counted as an even or an odd number so

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.640 
counted as an even or an odd number so
that's<00:01:14.880> not<00:01:15.119> going<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.570> our<00:01:15.720> set<00:01:15.930> so

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that's not going to be in our set so

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.859 
that's not going to be in our set so
it's<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.460> all<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.150> even<00:01:18.540> numbers

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
it's going to be all the even numbers

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.710 
it's going to be all the even numbers
from<00:01:19.170> 0<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.650> 10<00:01:20.010> it's<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> be<00:01:21.119> option<00:01:21.509> C

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
from 0 to 10 it's going to be option C

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.249 
from 0 to 10 it's going to be option C
when<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.080> doubt<00:01:22.200> pick<00:01:22.470> C<00:01:22.710> right<00:01:23.070> 2<00:01:23.640> 4<00:01:24.150> 6<00:01:24.540> 8<00:01:24.810> 10

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
when in doubt pick C right 2 4 6 8 10

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.070 
when in doubt pick C right 2 4 6 8 10
even<00:01:26.040> numbers<00:01:26.610> from<00:01:27.030> 0<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.360> 10<00:01:27.570> so<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.900> could

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
even numbers from 0 to 10 so we could

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.990 
even numbers from 0 to 10 so we could
either<00:01:28.200> write<00:01:28.500> all<00:01:28.830> even<00:01:29.189> numbers<00:01:29.490> from<00:01:29.670> 0<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
either write all even numbers from 0 to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.620 
either write all even numbers from 0 to
10<00:01:30.210> or<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.200> write<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.460> this<00:01:33.299> set

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
10 or we can write this and this set

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
10 or we can write this and this set
would<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.110> all<00:01:34.470> of<00:01:34.710> all<00:01:35.070> of<00:01:35.310> those<00:01:35.460> numbers

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
would have all of all of those numbers

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.390 
would have all of all of those numbers
listed<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:38.180> another<00:01:39.500> grouping<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.159> do

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
listed in it another grouping that we do

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.210 
listed in it another grouping that we do
with<00:01:41.790> sets<00:01:42.270> other<00:01:42.570> than<00:01:42.900> even<00:01:43.350> or<00:01:43.470> odd<00:01:43.619> numbers

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
with sets other than even or odd numbers

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.359 
with sets other than even or odd numbers
is<00:01:44.820> called<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.479> union<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.439> an<00:01:46.619> intersection

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
is called a union and an intersection

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.590 
is called a union and an intersection
and<00:01:47.520> I'm<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.820> talk<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.090> little<00:01:48.329> bit<00:01:48.570> about

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.289 
and I'm going to talk a little bit about
unions<00:01:49.320> first<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.070> then<00:01:50.340> intersections<00:01:51.149> and

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
unions first and then intersections and

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.399 
unions first and then intersections and
then<00:01:51.420> we're<00:01:51.509> going<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.689> do<00:01:51.810> some<00:01:51.990> practice

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
then we're going to do some practice

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.160 
then we're going to do some practice
questions<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:53.009> them<00:01:53.390> Union<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.570> represented

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
questions with them Union is represented

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.550 
questions with them Union is represented
with<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.799> looks<00:01:55.979> like<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> capital<00:01:56.670> u<00:01:57.229> that's<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
with it looks like a capital u that's a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.230 
with it looks like a capital u that's a
nice<00:01:58.710> easy<00:01:58.979> way<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.250> remember<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.060> in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
nice easy way to remember that it is in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.190 
nice easy way to remember that it is in
Union<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.500> in<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:02.310> union<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.240> set<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.869> is

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
Union and it's in a union of a set it is

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
any number in either set you'll be given

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.609 
any number in either set you'll be given
two<00:02:07.439> or<00:02:07.469> three<00:02:08.190> sets<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.509> union<00:02:10.019> is<00:02:10.290> any

number it is in either set here's an

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.650 
number it is in either set here's an
example<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.270> have<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.540> set<00:02:15.780> N

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
example you have the set N

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.750 
example you have the set N
that's<00:02:16.870> one<00:02:17.200> two<00:02:17.380> three<00:02:17.410> four<00:02:17.620> five<00:02:18.010> and<00:02:18.670> we

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
that's one two three four five and we

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.810 
that's one two three four five and we
have<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.000> set<00:02:19.270> M<00:02:19.830> which<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:20.860> two<00:02:21.280> four<00:02:21.580> six

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
have the set M which is two four six

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.000 
have the set M which is two four six
eight

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.800 
eight
we're<00:02:24.010> asked<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.310> find<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.880> union<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.750> N<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.620> M

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
we're asked to find the union of N and M

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.970 
we're asked to find the union of N and M
all<00:02:28.810> right<00:02:28.870> now<00:02:29.050> so<00:02:29.200> two<00:02:29.260> quick<00:02:29.440> letters<00:02:29.800> have

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
all right now so two quick letters have

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.340 
all right now so two quick letters have
sounded<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.400> little<00:02:30.490> bit<00:02:30.730> different<00:02:31.240> but<00:02:31.390> N<00:02:31.600> and

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
sounded a little bit different but N and

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.430 
sounded a little bit different but N and
M<00:02:33.030> we're<00:02:34.030> going<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.300> find<00:02:34.570> that<00:02:34.660> Union<00:02:35.230> so

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
M we're going to find that Union so

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.230 
M we're going to find that Union so
we're<00:02:35.620> going<00:02:35.830> to<00:02:35.950> list<00:02:36.160> any<00:02:36.460> number<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:36.970> is

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
we're going to list any number that is

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.510 
we're going to list any number that is
in<00:02:37.420> either<00:02:37.780> one<00:02:38.170> of<00:02:38.350> those<00:02:38.560> sets<00:02:39.010> in<00:02:39.310> other

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
in either one of those sets in other

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.280 
in either one of those sets in other
words<00:02:39.760> we're<00:02:39.970> going<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.330> list<00:02:40.510> four<00:02:40.660> numbers<00:02:40.960> 1

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
words we're going to list four numbers 1

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.010 
words we're going to list four numbers 1
2<00:02:41.710> 3<00:02:42.040> 4<00:02:42.430> 5<00:02:42.670> because<00:02:43.060> that's<00:02:43.180> all<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:43.750> set

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
2 3 4 5 because that's all in this set

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.910 
2 3 4 5 because that's all in this set
and<00:02:45.030> well<00:02:46.030> we've<00:02:46.180> already<00:02:46.360> got<00:02:46.510> 2<00:02:46.990> &amp;<00:02:47.230> 4<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:47.800> we

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
and well we've already got 2 &amp; 4 so we

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.850 
and well we've already got 2 &amp; 4 so we
just<00:02:48.160> would<00:02:48.340> list<00:02:48.610> from<00:02:48.940> that<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:50.140> second<00:02:50.620> set

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
just would list from that the second set

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.220 
just would list from that the second set
M<00:02:51.160> rootless<00:02:52.150> 6<00:02:52.480> &amp;<00:02:52.690> 8<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.160> see<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:55.230> numbers

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
M rootless 6 &amp; 8 so you see the numbers

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
M rootless 6 &amp; 8 so you see the numbers
2<00:02:56.950> &amp;<00:02:57.160> 4<00:02:57.340> appear<00:02:57.760> in<00:02:57.880> both<00:02:58.150> sets<00:02:58.920> but<00:02:59.920> we<00:03:00.100> only

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
2 &amp; 4 appear in both sets but we only

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.130 
2 &amp; 4 appear in both sets but we only
list<00:03:00.610> them<00:03:00.820> one<00:03:01.060> time<00:03:01.360> we<00:03:01.630> list<00:03:01.870> in

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
list them one time we list in

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.800 
list them one time we list in
chronological<00:03:03.070> order<00:03:03.670> all<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.420> numbers<00:03:04.780> that

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
chronological order all the numbers that

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.310 
chronological order all the numbers that
are<00:03:05.020> located<00:03:05.500> in<00:03:05.890> either<00:03:06.310> set<00:03:06.940> all<00:03:07.780> right<00:03:08.140> so

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
are located in either set all right so

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.610 
are located in either set all right so
the<00:03:08.440> union<00:03:08.830> of<00:03:09.010> N<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.610> M<00:03:09.850> is<00:03:10.420> 1<00:03:10.630> 2<00:03:10.720> 3<00:03:10.780> 4<00:03:11.050> 5<00:03:11.200> 6<00:03:11.500> 8

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:18.520 
other side of this and it's represented

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.430 
other side of this and it's represented
by<00:03:18.550> symbol<00:03:19.090> or<00:03:19.270> franking<00:03:19.630> upside<00:03:19.930> down<00:03:20.170> you

by symbol or franking upside down you

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.980 
by symbol or franking upside down you
like<00:03:21.130> a<00:03:21.160> little<00:03:21.280> mountain<00:03:21.550> or<00:03:21.850> whatever<00:03:22.090> and

the<00:03:23.200> intersection<00:03:23.740> is<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.160> number<00:03:24.640> that<00:03:24.820> is

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
the intersection is the number that is

in both sets
all<00:03:28.210> right<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:28.690> for<00:03:28.900> example<00:03:29.350> with<00:03:29.470> our<00:03:29.500> same

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
all right so for example with our same

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.830 
all right so for example with our same
set<00:03:30.190> and<00:03:30.460> M<00:03:30.850> and<00:03:31.540> M<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.430> then<00:03:33.430> 1<00:03:33.700> 2<00:03:33.820> 3<00:03:33.940> 4<00:03:34.180> 5<00:03:34.360> and<00:03:34.660> M

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
set and M and M and then 1 2 3 4 5 and M

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.190 
set and M and M and then 1 2 3 4 5 and M
being<00:03:35.140> 2<00:03:35.500> 4<00:03:35.890> 6<00:03:36.160> 8<00:03:36.400> if<00:03:36.850> we're<00:03:37.390> asked<00:03:37.570> to<00:03:37.690> find<00:03:37.810> the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
being 2 4 6 8 if we're asked to find the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.610 
being 2 4 6 8 if we're asked to find the
intersection<00:03:38.950> of<00:03:39.370> N<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.150> M<00:03:40.360> we<00:03:41.140> would<00:03:41.350> just

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
intersection of N and M we would just

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.950 
intersection of N and M we would just
list<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.100> numbers<00:03:42.430> that<00:03:42.580> are<00:03:42.640> in<00:03:42.760> both<00:03:43.210> sets

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
list the numbers that are in both sets

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.770 
list the numbers that are in both sets
so<00:03:44.080> in<00:03:44.200> this<00:03:44.350> case<00:03:44.650> 2<00:03:45.280> &amp;<00:03:45.520> 4<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:46.060> only<00:03:46.240> numbers

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
so in this case 2 &amp; 4 the only numbers

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.840 
so in this case 2 &amp; 4 the only numbers
that<00:03:46.900> are<00:03:47.050> listened<00:03:47.470> in<00:03:47.590> both<00:03:47.920> sets

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
that are listened in both sets

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.470 
that are listened in both sets
all<00:03:49.630> right<00:03:49.990> that's<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:51.220> intersection<00:03:52.060> of

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
all right that's a the intersection of

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.590 
all right that's a the intersection of
these<00:03:52.780> two<00:03:53.110> sets<00:03:53.940> let's<00:03:54.940> practice<00:03:55.390> a<00:03:55.480> little

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
these two sets let's practice a little

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.210 
these two sets let's practice a little
bit<00:03:55.780> for<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.740> set<00:03:56.980> a<00:03:57.270> which<00:03:58.270> is<00:03:58.420> 4<00:03:58.660> 5<00:03:58.840> 7<00:03:59.110> 9<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.680> B

we have these numbers 4 6 8 9 and 2 4 5

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.880 
we have these numbers 4 6 8 9 and 2 4 5
6<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:25.300> so<00:05:25.330> what's<00:05:25.630> the<00:05:25.720> intersection<00:05:26.350> of<00:05:26.620> set

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
6 and so what's the intersection of set

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.940 
6 and so what's the intersection of set
a<00:05:27.130> and<00:05:27.310> B<00:05:27.490> now<00:05:27.850> all<00:05:28.690> the<00:05:29.170> numbers<00:05:29.530> that<00:05:29.650> are<00:05:29.800> in

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
a and B now all the numbers that are in

a and B now all the numbers that are in
both<00:05:30.190> a<00:05:30.460> and<00:05:31.000> B<00:05:31.840> are<00:05:32.850> 4<00:05:33.850> &amp;<00:05:34.060> 6<00:05:34.300> so<00:05:34.870> we<00:05:34.960> have<00:05:35.080> 4<00:05:35.410> in

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
both a and B are 4 &amp; 6 so we have 4 in

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.880 
both a and B are 4 &amp; 6 so we have 4 in
both<00:05:35.950> and<00:05:36.220> 6<00:05:36.940> in<00:05:37.150> both<00:05:37.360> so<00:05:38.200> that'll<00:05:38.500> be<00:05:38.590> in<00:05:38.710> the

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 
both and 6 in both so that'll be in the
