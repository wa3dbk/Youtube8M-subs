00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
it's really not that hard um it does

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.630 
it's really not that hard um it does
take<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> lot<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.530> practice<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:40.950> really<00:00:41.190> control

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
take a lot of practice to really control

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.340 
take a lot of practice to really control

it but I'll give you a few pointers so
that<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.559> can<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:44.610> doing<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:45.000> pretty

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
that you can be doing this pretty

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.869 
that you can be doing this pretty
quickly<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:46.340> lot<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.399> people<00:00:47.640> think<00:00:47.789> I'm

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
quickly a lot of people think I'm

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:48.979 
quickly a lot of people think I'm
bending<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.210> cards<00:00:48.329> backwards<00:00:48.840> because

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
bending the cards backwards because

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.160 
bending the cards backwards because
that's<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:49.649> how<00:00:50.039> they<00:00:50.570> feel<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.809> cards

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that's that's how they feel like cards

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.250 
that's that's how they feel like cards
should<00:00:52.940> shoot<00:00:53.940> off<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:54.539> they<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
should shoot off if they think that

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.560 
should shoot off if they think that
there<00:00:55.469> should<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:56.149> tension<00:00:57.149> with<00:00:57.390> your

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
there should be tension with your

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.569 
there should be tension with your
pointer<00:00:58.079> finger<00:00:58.379> just<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.710> you're<00:00:58.890> rippling

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
pointer finger just like you're rippling

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.430 
pointer finger just like you're rippling
the<00:00:59.699> cards<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.600> that's<00:01:00.809> not<00:01:00.960> what<00:01:01.079> I'm<00:01:01.170> doing

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the cards but that's not what I'm doing

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.810 
the cards but that's not what I'm doing
I'm<00:01:01.559> actually<00:01:01.739> bending<00:01:02.160> on<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> opposite

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
I'm actually bending on the opposite

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.549 
I'm actually bending on the opposite
direction

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
direction

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.340 
direction
bending<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.840> what<00:01:06.840> happens<00:01:07.229> is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
bending like this and what happens is

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.770 
bending like this and what happens is
the<00:01:07.470> cards<00:01:07.860> will<00:01:08.900> use<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.170> tension<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:11.780> and

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the cards will use this tension and and

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.570 
the cards will use this tension and and
once<00:01:13.080> my<00:01:13.260> once<00:01:13.710> they<00:01:13.860> kind<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.130> get<00:01:14.250> released

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
once my once they kind of get released

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.270 
once my once they kind of get released
by<00:01:14.760> my<00:01:14.909> thumb<00:01:15.210> they'll<00:01:16.170> shoot<00:01:16.439> out<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:16.860> they

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
by my thumb they'll shoot out and they

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.039 
by my thumb they'll shoot out and they
do<00:01:17.549> end<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:17.909> kind<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.210> shooting<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.600> backwards

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
do end up kind of shooting out backwards

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:19.719 
do end up kind of shooting out backwards
a<00:01:19.140> little<00:01:19.170> bit

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
a little bit

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.740 
a little bit
um<00:01:20.729> but<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.180> can<00:01:21.330> use<00:01:21.450> that<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.689> your

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
um but you can use that to your

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.030 
um but you can use that to your
advantage<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.530> something<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:22.860> really

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
advantage it's something that's really

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.890 
advantage it's something that's really
crucial<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.490> catching<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> cards<00:01:24.180> because

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
crucial is catching the cards because

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.240 
crucial is catching the cards because
these<00:01:25.170> cards<00:01:25.470> are<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.650> flying<00:01:26.040> all<00:01:26.220> over

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
these cards are really flying all over

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.679 
these cards are really flying all over
the<00:01:26.520> place<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.000> you've<00:01:27.119> got<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.390> be<00:01:27.450> able<00:01:27.540> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the place and you've got to be able to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.569 
the place and you've got to be able to
catch<00:01:28.619> them<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.829> your<00:01:28.860> hand<00:01:29.130> without<00:01:29.310> dropping

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
catch them in your hand without dropping

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.539 
catch them in your hand without dropping
any<00:01:29.820> otherwise<00:01:30.270> you're<00:01:30.450> gonna<00:01:30.509> look<00:01:30.720> like<00:01:30.780> um

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
any otherwise you're gonna look like um

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.149 
any otherwise you're gonna look like um
you<00:01:32.549> don't<00:01:32.700> know<00:01:32.790> what<00:01:32.909> you're<00:01:33.030> doing<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:34.159> the

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
you don't know what you're doing and the

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.859 
you don't know what you're doing and the
key<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.610> really<00:01:36.150> catch<00:01:36.540> them<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.840> your

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
key to this really catch them in your

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.390 
key to this really catch them in your
hand<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.350> pinky<00:01:37.710> because<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.340> said

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
hand is this pinky because like I said

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.170 
hand is this pinky because like I said
the<00:01:38.759> cards<00:01:39.060> shoot<00:01:39.270> off<00:01:39.420> backwards<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:41.180> so

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the cards shoot off backwards and so

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.219 
the cards shoot off backwards and so
that<00:01:42.299> means<00:01:42.450> that<00:01:42.570> when<00:01:42.780> they<00:01:42.869> land<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.200> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
that means that when they land in the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.560 
that means that when they land in the
hand<00:01:43.530> they're<00:01:44.490> gonna<00:01:44.640> bump<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.149> against<00:01:45.450> this

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
hand they're gonna bump up against this

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.380 
hand they're gonna bump up against this
pinky<00:01:45.930> my<00:01:46.409> bottom<00:01:46.740> pinky<00:01:47.009> here<00:01:47.390> because

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
pinky my bottom pinky here because

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.789 
pinky my bottom pinky here because
they're<00:01:48.659> they're<00:01:48.990> coming<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.649> this

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
they're they're coming in in this

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.789 
they're they're coming in in this
direction<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.780> so<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.110> they're<00:01:52.320> squaring

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
direction and so that they're squaring

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.710 
direction and so that they're squaring
off<00:01:52.979> against<00:01:53.399> my<00:01:53.520> pinky<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.000> these<00:01:54.329> fingers

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
off against my pinky and these fingers
