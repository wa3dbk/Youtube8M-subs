00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello everybody we are from gti control 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.599
 I'm recording the tutorial that will help 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.370
 to solve a very annoying error this error 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.780
 prevents the installation of several 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.240
 sql server core office applications etc 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.010
 I'm doing it because I've suffered until 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.160
 discover the code that really 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.650
 worked before I found out I did 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.590
 updates wiped cleaned folders 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.310
 staley record of staley frameworks and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.160
 anything 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.829
 The problem is that there is a lot of tori ice 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.230
 on the internet and none of them solve 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:42.980
 come on, I'll explain what 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:46.680
 really works first here oms 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.289
 some applications does not even show the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.879
 what is the mistake 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.710
 for example when you start to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.530
 install an office version 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.379
 he starts you start talking the same 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.070
 thing happened to the sql server when 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.689
 was to install the code it also goes up 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:15.900
 a part of the relationship and then it 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:18.960
 let's see an example here look there 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.590
 staff has already appeared error 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.909
 the case of hote 2013 he does not even show which 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.659
 is the error code 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:33.290
 other programs it ends up showing 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:38.490
 so I'll close close it soon 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:40.740
 the same happens with off 2013 and 2003 and 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.740
 office 2007 various versions of office 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.430
 The same thing happens from this error too. 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.799
 older newer versions 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.369
 now I'll show here in some 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.759
 messages that can appear then he 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:02:02.149
 can give the message of being plus is 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:04.200
 in 1935 he then has several messages 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.719
 now let's take a tutorial on how 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.490
 solve this big problem 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:15.070
 First you go there to negotiate and open 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:19.890
 the command and administrative mode can 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:23.440
 dictate right-click cm 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.070
 on top of the cmd run as 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.070
 administrator 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.800
 then just get this code here 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:41.980
 copy he stayed there remembering that seel 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.690
 main unit your computer 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.730
 You do not enter there. 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.300
 has been successfully completed 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.510
 close it just install the program that 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.530
 you see that solves this solves 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.150
 easily many people put it there 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.310
 Huge tutorial to do a lot of 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.420
 all things are a lot of thing and nothing 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.150
 resolved 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.150
 only this code that ready solved everything 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:37.670
 just have it already passed the half of the bar 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:40.130
 where the error protection installed and 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.470
 Working perfectly 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.780
 solved the problem that it comes days 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.040
 to find the code that 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:55.700
 It really works to close here. 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:59.030
 show everything installed only paralyze 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.530
 then move will leave the code in 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.720
 video description 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.990
 It's just you copy and paste and you're done. 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.990
 See you
