second storage facility that I'm here

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.879 
second storage facility that I'm here
now<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.810> first<00:03:28.109> time<00:03:28.409> this<00:03:28.590> particular

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
now is the first time this particular

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.099 
now is the first time this particular
auctioneer<00:03:29.790> has<00:03:29.909> ever<00:03:30.120> done<00:03:30.359> an<00:03:30.480> auction<00:03:30.900> here

so<00:03:31.349> my<00:03:31.919> inclination<00:03:32.280> is<00:03:32.879> that<00:03:33.090> there's<00:03:33.299> an

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
so my inclination is that there's an

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.589 
so my inclination is that there's an
accumulation<00:03:33.749> of<00:03:34.260> inventory<00:03:35.129> here<00:03:35.909> but<00:03:36.510> I'm

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
accumulation of inventory here but I'm

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.289 
accumulation of inventory here but I'm
about<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.959> walk<00:03:37.139> in<00:03:37.409> and<00:03:37.680> find<00:03:37.950> out<00:03:38.299> that's

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
about to walk in and find out that's

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.110 
about to walk in and find out that's
just<00:03:39.540> my<00:03:39.689> hunch<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.200> don't<00:03:40.439> know<00:03:40.560> for<00:03:40.739> certain

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120
