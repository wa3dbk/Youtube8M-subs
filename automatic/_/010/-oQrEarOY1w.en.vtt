00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.650
 that's pretty fish of the price tonight 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.660
 I'm going to show you how I 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.609
 found the fishing was not easy at 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.140
 departure and then we think without a 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.359
 little bit I could find a technique 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.410
 who allowed me to take three 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.449
 fish in the night so it's rather 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.460
 well on a body of water that has a very 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.840
 very big fishing pressure so here 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:38.520
 I will put it back in the water and then I 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:40.829
 show you all that fish 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.390
 located in a security zone that is 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.100
 relatively far from my rods to more 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.770
 150 meters so I do not throw 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.020
 so far so here I am going to try 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.030
 so we can see this area 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.770
 look I'm going to zoom in it's 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.660
 all this part 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.620
 so they are there so ok trees 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.670
 I think they are very much the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.829
 nobody bother them 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.329
 so there is a lot of sault and me my 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.390
 goal it's going to be to make them come 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.619
 of this area on my spot to me who 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.840
 located at 100 m 120 m that is to say they 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.799
 have they are going to have a distance of 50 60 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.280
 meters to go 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:19.290
 so here I am I start the area of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.430
 security and at the same time I'm doing a 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.290
 way up on metal so I put the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.170
 to gwadar this because I want to do the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.729
 turn of the water for vale started the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.170
 fish holding area and I'm going 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.420
 try to boot this area of outfits 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.049
 rather broadly and at the same time my 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.939
 fishing area 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.590
 the goal is to bring out 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.790
 their fish holding area of their 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.590
 security zone where there is not bad 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.119
 of trees so that they can come on 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.079
 my rods the problem is that I'm going 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.270
 go around the water because 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.189
 from here serotin less far is more 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.630
 150 meters and I can not boot 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.660
 with small diameters at this 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:57.250
 distance there just rsa in 14 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.170
 at the same time a dense crowd 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.680
 brouillette and that's gone I'm going to do 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.680
 the tour of the water 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.750
 this is the prom line I used to 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:52.780
 take these fish so it is 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.890
 consisting of a fiber tech part 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.080
 so he's going to allow me to have some 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.390
 rather very very strong thing very 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.580
 solid and then also this one 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.349
 she went east coast ie 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.970
 that around them fiber tech have a 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.760
 plasticized part which allows 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.019
 also to favor places where there is 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.879
 a little abrasion a little bit of 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.780
 pebbles something else like that next 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:16.160
 above I came to do so on one side a 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.840
 so doerig so simple I made a 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.140
 small but also with a loop and I 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.430
 will be to doerig around my soul are and 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.379
 finally at the other end I came 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.890
 simply make a small loop for 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.970
 to be able to fix it easily 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.629
 good at the level of my long clip on a 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:37.430
 staple then on this part 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:41.989
 I have a hook sv 4 so small 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.900
 size in number 8 hook that is going to be 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.700
 rather robust and then these are these 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.720
 techniques I also chose to 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.430
 take a small size because I 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.859
 know that there are no fish 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.019
 easy to take and then they have they 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.579
 have enough mouth to 7 years so 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.620
 normally it should have penetrated well 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:04.430
 the jaws of the fish and I have little 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:05.480
 change to pick up then we notice on 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.819
 said yes the world is rich united put 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.680
 simply a solid rig that suits him 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.919
 allow my to promote precisely this 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.859
 phenomenon excrement we find a stop 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:19.880
 floats a boil is dense so a rs 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:22.220
 a pardon a rs 1 dance and finally here a 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.870
 bundle that will be able to achieve the 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.710
 snowman 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.419
 why I left on a color 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:27.740
 a little flashy like yellow always 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.889
 because the fishing pressure is 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.380
 important and to really take some 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.599
 fish theirs and I decided to 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:40.370
 to leave on one on a color really 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:43.220
 a little flashy on a bottom of line 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.849
 I came to position small 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.349
 pieces two not to plumb who she is going 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:51.940
 also allow me to have a 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:51.940
 maximum discretion 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.639
 so this is a bottom of line who is 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:00.430
 relatively simple easy to make and 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.660
 who can trap fish in the 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.280
 places where it's a bit complicated 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.870
 to these techniques and especially overfished 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:10.889
 so the last fish I took 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:13.630
 around 2 am because very massive 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.979
 who made me a great fight 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.310
 in a can finally short it was enough 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.979
 epic 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.199
 so that's great fish super fight I 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.750
 am very very happy so I'm going to 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.750
 put back in the water and then and that's it
