00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
1/4 cup of water and pour it into the

1/4 cup of water and pour it into the
boiler<00:00:34.850> along<00:00:35.850> with<00:00:36.030> 1<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.600> 1/4<00:00:36.989> cup<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.440> sugar

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
me it's enough so to measure the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.479 
me it's enough so to measure the
temperature<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.379> sugar<00:00:43.950> water<00:00:44.070> we're

Fahrenheit just watch it it takes a
little<00:00:51.660> while<00:00:51.899> when<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> sugar<00:00:53.219> starts<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
little while when the sugar starts to

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.639 
little while when the sugar starts to
bubble<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.270> get<00:00:54.420> sick<00:00:54.660> that's<00:00:54.989> probably<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
bubble and get sick that's probably a

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.869 
bubble and get sick that's probably a
good<00:00:55.890> time<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.129> check<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:56.670> it<00:00:56.789> should

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
good time to check it because it should

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.970 
good time to check it because it should
be<00:00:57.059> about<00:00:57.239> 250<00:00:57.539> at<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.930> point<00:00:58.170> now<00:00:58.829> while

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
be about 250 at that point now while

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.810 
be about 250 at that point now while
that's<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.340> on

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820

it comes out to about a cup into your

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.039 
it comes out to about a cup into your
stand<00:01:04.650> mixer<00:01:05.060> along<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.240> 1<00:01:06.420> teaspoon<00:01:06.900> of

helps to stabilize the egg white helps

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.980 
helps to stabilize the egg white helps
them<00:01:10.619> whip<00:01:10.740> up<00:01:10.860> really<00:01:11.100> nice

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.109 

so<00:01:14.500> you<00:01:14.590> want<00:01:14.740> to<00:01:14.799> let<00:01:14.890> that<00:01:14.950> go<00:01:15.100> until<00:01:15.430> soft

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
so you want to let that go until soft

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.330 
so you want to let that go until soft
peaks<00:01:16.240> form<00:01:16.869> now<00:01:17.440> that<00:01:17.680> soft<00:01:17.890> peaks<00:01:18.130> have

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
peaks form now that soft peaks have

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.620 
peaks form now that soft peaks have
formed<00:01:18.670> in<00:01:18.790> the<00:01:18.909> egg<00:01:19.000> whites<00:01:19.180> we're<00:01:19.360> gonna<00:01:19.450> add

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
formed in the egg whites we're gonna add

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.500

1/3<00:01:20.110> cup<00:01:20.619> of<00:01:20.860> sugar<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.460> usually<00:01:22.240> keep<00:01:22.390> it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
1/3 cup of sugar I usually keep it

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.270

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
separate next to the bowl so that I

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.649 
separate next to the bowl so that I
don't<00:01:24.460> forget<00:01:24.580> it's<00:01:25.090> really<00:01:25.270> easy<00:01:25.420> to<00:01:25.570> forget

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659

incorporate<00:02:26.950> about<00:02:27.610> two<00:02:27.790> minutes

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
incorporate about two minutes

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.000 
incorporate about two minutes
right<00:02:30.190> so<00:02:30.519> once<00:02:30.730> your<00:02:31.390> mixture<00:02:32.050> looks<00:02:32.470> light

and fluffy you want to take the last

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.000 
and fluffy you want to take the last
step<00:02:34.810> which<00:02:34.989> would<00:02:35.110> be<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> add<00:02:35.409> a<00:02:35.620> tablespoon

you can either boil it down on a double

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.520 
you can either boil it down on a double
boiler<00:02:58.239> or<00:02:58.599> you<00:02:58.930> can<00:02:59.079> just<00:02:59.230> put<00:02:59.349> it<00:02:59.409> in<00:02:59.470> the
