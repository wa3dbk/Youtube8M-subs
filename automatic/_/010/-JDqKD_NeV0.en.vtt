00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
sure that you do keep your distance

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.009 
sure that you do keep your distance
now<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.790> next<00:02:53.150> ability<00:02:53.389> is<00:02:53.629> going<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:53.930> be

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
now the next ability is going to be

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.629 
now the next ability is going to be
Thunder<00:02:54.349> crush<00:02:54.590> that's<00:02:54.950> exactly<00:02:55.400> what<00:02:55.549> it

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
Thunder crush that's exactly what it

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.069 
Thunder crush that's exactly what it
looks<00:02:55.790> like<00:02:55.939> right<00:02:56.120> there<00:02:56.329> that<00:02:56.599> blue<00:02:56.810> aura

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
looks like right there that blue aura

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.720 
looks like right there that blue aura
that<00:02:57.260> sponsor<00:02:57.799> in<00:02:57.859> front<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.099> the<00:02:58.220> war<00:02:58.370> bringer

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
that sponsor in front of the war bringer

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.300 
that sponsor in front of the war bringer
now<00:02:59.269> this<00:02:59.480> is<00:02:59.659> an<00:02:59.870> interrupted<00:03:00.500> cast<00:03:00.889> like<00:03:01.159> all

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
now this is an interrupted cast like all

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.979 
now this is an interrupted cast like all
the<00:03:01.489> other<00:03:01.639> war<00:03:01.849> bring<00:03:02.030> instability<00:03:02.209> so<00:03:02.780> be

the other war bring instability so be

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.170 
the other war bring instability so be
smart<00:03:03.439> and<00:03:03.590> stay<00:03:03.859> out<00:03:04.069> of<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:04.849> pretty

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
smart and stay out of that it's pretty

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.699 
smart and stay out of that it's pretty
simple<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:05.689> straightforward<00:03:05.900> if<00:03:06.379> you<00:03:06.500> stay

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
simple and straightforward if you stay

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.740 
simple and straightforward if you stay
in<00:03:06.889> that<00:03:06.919> it<00:03:07.250> basically<00:03:07.700> hits<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.269> for<00:03:08.480> around

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
in that it basically hits you for around

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.369 
in that it basically hits you for around
anywhere<00:03:09.139> between<00:03:09.290> 200<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.280> 300<00:03:11.269> K<00:03:11.480> damage<00:03:11.959> now

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
anywhere between 200 to 300 K damage now

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.199 
anywhere between 200 to 300 K damage now
the<00:03:12.439> consecutive<00:03:12.859> ability<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.579> called<00:03:13.849> stun

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
the consecutive ability is called stun

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.119 
the consecutive ability is called stun
serum<00:03:14.659> and<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:14.930> basically<00:03:15.049> stuns<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:15.859> for

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
serum and it basically stuns you for

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.280 
serum and it basically stuns you for
around<00:03:16.310> 5<00:03:16.489> seconds<00:03:16.970> now<00:03:17.449> I<00:03:17.479> actually<00:03:17.720> do<00:03:18.109> not

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
around 5 seconds now I actually do not

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.140 
around 5 seconds now I actually do not
remember<00:03:18.799> ever<00:03:19.010> accounting<00:03:19.729> this<00:03:19.819> ability

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
remember ever accounting this ability

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.210 
remember ever accounting this ability
it's<00:03:20.750> not<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.049> cast<00:03:21.440> and<00:03:21.680> from<00:03:21.919> what<00:03:22.069> I<00:03:22.099> can

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
it's not a cast and from what I can

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.069 
it's not a cast and from what I can
remember<00:03:22.489> I've<00:03:22.909> never<00:03:23.180> seen<00:03:23.449> it<00:03:23.540> before<00:03:23.659> so

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:24.079 
remember I've never seen it before so

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:25.629 
remember I've never seen it before so
other<00:03:24.229> than<00:03:24.470> that<00:03:24.680> what<00:03:24.949> it<00:03:25.069> states<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.519> the

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:25.639 
other than that what it states in the

other than that what it states in the
description<00:03:26.180> I'm<00:03:26.389> not<00:03:26.599> really<00:03:26.720> quite<00:03:26.959> sure

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
description I'm not really quite sure

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:27.969 
description I'm not really quite sure
what<00:03:27.349> to<00:03:27.440> make<00:03:27.470> of<00:03:27.590> it

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:27.979 
what to make of it

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.099 
what to make of it
the<00:03:28.340> only<00:03:28.609> defense<00:03:28.970> that<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.269> would<00:03:29.479> suggest<00:03:29.629> is

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
the only defense that I would suggest is

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.020 
the only defense that I would suggest is
to<00:03:30.139> maybe<00:03:30.440> equip<00:03:30.889> a<00:03:30.919> PvP<00:03:31.489> trinket<00:03:31.879> that

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
to maybe equip a PvP trinket that

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.670 
to maybe equip a PvP trinket that
removes<00:03:32.329> all<00:03:32.479> movement<00:03:32.900> pairing<00:03:33.199> effects<00:03:33.470> and

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
removes all movement pairing effects and

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.890 
removes all movement pairing effects and
you<00:03:33.739> should<00:03:33.919> definitely<00:03:34.549> definitely<00:03:35.090> take

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
you should definitely definitely take

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.289 
you should definitely definitely take
out<00:03:36.109> one<00:03:36.319> of<00:03:36.349> your<00:03:36.500> trinkets<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.159> put<00:03:37.790> on<00:03:38.000> a

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
out one of your trinkets and put on a

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.809 
out one of your trinkets and put on a
PvP<00:03:39.199> trinket<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:39.889> will<00:03:40.069> explain<00:03:40.489> more<00:03:40.549> on

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
PvP trinket and I will explain more on

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:41.589 
PvP trinket and I will explain more on
that<00:03:41.150> later

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
that later

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.689 
that later
this<00:03:42.169> next<00:03:42.470> ability<00:03:42.680> is<00:03:42.949> going<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.280> be<00:03:43.370> meteor

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
this next ability is going to be meteor

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.610 
this next ability is going to be meteor
shower<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.299> it<00:03:44.389> is<00:03:44.510> really<00:03:44.750> simple<00:03:44.989> you<00:03:45.349> cast

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
shower and it is really simple you cast

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.319 
shower and it is really simple you cast
it<00:03:45.859> and<00:03:46.010> wherever<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.459> war<00:03:46.609> bringer<00:03:46.909> stance

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
it and wherever the war bringer stance

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.899 
it and wherever the war bringer stance
meteors<00:03:47.840> will<00:03:48.109> fall<00:03:48.349> down<00:03:48.590> around<00:03:49.159> him<00:03:49.370> so

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 
meteors will fall down around him so

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.699 
meteors will fall down around him so
just<00:03:50.150> make<00:03:50.329> sure<00:03:50.359> a<00:03:50.540> meteor<00:03:50.989> does<00:03:51.199> not<00:03:51.379> fall<00:03:51.680> on

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
just make sure a meteor does not fall on

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.349 
just make sure a meteor does not fall on
you<00:03:51.979> while<00:03:52.159> you're<00:03:52.340> attacking<00:03:52.669> him<00:03:52.940> otherwise

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
you while you're attacking him otherwise

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.659 
you while you're attacking him otherwise
you<00:03:53.569> will<00:03:53.720> take<00:03:53.900> around<00:03:54.169> 300k<00:03:54.829> damage<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.400> think

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
you will take around 300k damage I think

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:57.819 
you will take around 300k damage I think
at<00:03:55.790> the<00:03:55.970> minimum<00:03:56.389> it<00:03:56.569> really<00:03:56.930> really<00:03:57.620> doesn't

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
at the minimum it really really doesn't

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.800 
at the minimum it really really doesn't
number<00:03:58.159> on<00:03:58.280> you<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:58.939> next<00:03:59.180> ability<00:03:59.540> you<00:03:59.689> need

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
number on you the next ability you need

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.839 
number on you the next ability you need
to<00:03:59.930> know<00:04:00.079> is<00:04:00.260> horrific<00:04:00.439> visage<00:04:01.159> and<00:04:01.519> this

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:01.849 
to know is horrific visage and this

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.460 
to know is horrific visage and this
ability<00:04:02.150> is<00:04:02.419> the<00:04:02.569> most<00:04:02.750> dangerous<00:04:02.930> of<00:04:03.349> them

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
ability is the most dangerous of them

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.830 
ability is the most dangerous of them
all<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:04.430> only<00:04:04.729> reason<00:04:05.090> why<00:04:05.209> I<00:04:05.239> might<00:04:05.629> actually

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
all the only reason why I might actually

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.439 
all the only reason why I might actually
wipe<00:04:06.379> when<00:04:06.739> I'm<00:04:06.919> soloing<00:04:07.400> a<00:04:07.639> war<00:04:07.909> bringer<00:04:08.269> is

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
wipe when I'm soloing a war bringer is

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.170 
wipe when I'm soloing a war bringer is
this<00:04:08.750> ability<00:04:09.139> right<00:04:09.620> here<00:04:09.949> what<00:04:10.579> it<00:04:10.699> does<00:04:10.909> is

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
this ability right here what it does is

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.749 
this ability right here what it does is
it<00:04:11.359> CCS<00:04:11.989> you<00:04:12.139> for<00:04:12.379> around<00:04:12.560> 6<00:04:12.949> seconds<00:04:13.459> and<00:04:13.609> then

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:13.759 
it CCS you for around 6 seconds and then

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.670 
it CCS you for around 6 seconds and then
the<00:04:13.879> war<00:04:14.120> bringer<00:04:14.449> just<00:04:14.689> mows<00:04:14.959> you<00:04:15.169> down<00:04:15.439> with

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
the war bringer just mows you down with

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.170 
the war bringer just mows you down with
this<00:04:15.799> Auto<00:04:16.039> Attack<00:04:16.430> which<00:04:16.759> is<00:04:16.909> around

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
this Auto Attack which is around

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.170 
this Auto Attack which is around
1:52<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.209> 200k<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:20.169> think<00:04:20.799> each<00:04:21.249> auto-attack<00:04:21.999> so

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
1:52 a 200k I think each auto-attack so

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.510 
1:52 a 200k I think each auto-attack so
he<00:04:22.330> does<00:04:22.719> hit<00:04:22.930> pretty<00:04:23.110> hard<00:04:23.199> and<00:04:23.620> this<00:04:24.370> is

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520
