00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.720
 it involved a whole technical reinvention of

 mission to locate the arm whereabouts 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.090
 a unit disappeared during the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.050
 investigation of some mysterious 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.729
 murders on the outskirts of racing city 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.590
 after the initial recognition the mission 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.119
 it does not take long to get complicated when attacked 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.009
 by an enraged herd of dogs 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.380
 savages publishes our protagonists 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.890
 to willy take refuge in a gigantic 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.840
 mansion caught in its crisis interior 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.030
 and he will soon find out about this 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.550
 abandoned a priori mansion hides in 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.500
 reality a dark secrets 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:51.090
 from huesca huesca 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.530
 young out and everything to adopt 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.530
 and you 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.920
 and when we in the accounting section do not 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.970
 we found great changes regarding 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.550
 what was seen in the original title 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.990
 finding us once again before a resident 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.850
 classic evil in which the 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.590
 exploration and solving of puzzles 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.360
 as well as the rest of the clichÃ©s that have 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.800
 popularized the saga before the 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.800
 appearance of resident evil 4 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.200
 in this way the first thing that we should 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.730
 to do at the beginning of the game will be to choose 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.370
 between the two available characters 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.440
 video profile or jill valentine which 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.450
 as a curiosity in this version have 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.930
 with an alternative attire besides the 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.930
 original 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.680
 the choice of the character not only 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.870
 will modify some aspects of the 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.460
 adventure but that conditions enormously 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.470
 our style of play as well as 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.420
 that in the original title each of 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.300
 they have their own virtues and 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.130
 limitations for putting an example chris 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.960
 He is an expert in the use of weapons 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.460
 ideal to face the moments of 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.440
 action that, on the other hand, has a 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.690
 somewhat limited inventory while 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.820
 hill is to make more fragile disposes of a 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.290
 pick that allows you to explore multiple 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.660
 rooms with relative ease 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.580
 although its worst use of firearms 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.070
 will make us waste a greater amount 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.050
 of bullets to bring down the enemies something 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.670
 quite significant if we have in 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.620
 account that the ammunition will not be a 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.620
 especially abundant resource 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.290
 once in the game the first thing that 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.000
 will call our attention is the renewed 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.740
 control scheme by which with 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.870
 the left script we can move 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.610
 freely by mapping what is 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.200
 a breath of fresh air and one of the 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.600
 greater virtues of this remastering 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.610
 that will definitely bring the game closer to a 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.990
 greater type of users all without 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.850
 put aside those who prefer 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.920
 Enjoy the adventure with your style 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.750
 of traditional control will be possible 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.650
 to alternate between one or the other in any 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.650
 moment of the game 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.769
 graphically it is quite tangible 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.930
 of leap in fluency and detail that has 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.730
 suffered this edition by exhibiting now 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.290
 a greater quality of texturing and 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.930
 lighting in addition to a considerable 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:19.799
 increase in resolution than in xbox one 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.240
 and playstation 4 now reaches 1080p 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.979
 will you look better than ever 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.539
 scenarios but rendered so 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.789
 characteristic of the original version 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.889
 which thanks to the application of 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:32.919
 some filters now look much more 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.419
 dark and not poor also another 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.190
 remarkable novelty lies in the 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.080
 possibility of being able to play the game in 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.300
 panoramic format something that many 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.949
 users will appreciate taking into account 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.370
 the standard h of televisions 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.370
 current 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.650
 For its part, the sound section has been 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.750
 conveniently remastered 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.760
 showing now with higher quality but 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.590
 keeping the effects of dubbing in 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.760
 English and the great soundtrack 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.760
 environmental already known 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.130
 all this offers us a sound set 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.410
 brilliant that once again he gets with 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.389
 great expertise to play with the rhythm in 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.130
 scare and silence to create that 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:19.960
 atmosphere of tension where the sound 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:22.000
 Far from written footsteps and creaks 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.340
 mysterious make us feel the sensation 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.960
 of loneliness and fear of the unknown so 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.570
 characteristics of the beginning of the 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.520
 franchise this we can enjoy 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:32.080
 more intensely than ever thanks to 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.900
 the inclusion of compatibility with 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.910
 5.1 sound systems which increases the 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.970
 immersion and it has seemed like a 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.970
 success 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:54.789
 in conclusion resident evil hd remaster 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.740
 has managed to solve with great success 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.389
 some of the defects that to this day 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.310
 can be ascribed to the original work 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.529
 with the debate of not altering in the 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.389
 process the essence of classic survival 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.009
 updated that he made of the remake of 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:08.080
 clean one of the best adaptations 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.710
 that are remembered in the history of the 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.710
 video game 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:15.409
 unfortunately this remastering is not going 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:17.210
 way beyond what your own 

00:06:15.409 --> 00:06:18.889
 name tells us so for effects 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.319
 Practitioners who have already played 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.150
 original title will not find in this h 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.009
 of remaster more incentive than 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.259
 nostalgia to re play it one more time 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.639
 enjoying those and that updated 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:31.509
 control scheme I have renewed 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:31.509
 audiovisual section 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.230
 in any case we only have left 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.150
 celebrate that once again the classic 

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.650
 mansion spencer reopen us his 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.330
 doors to relive in the new 

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.220
 generation all the secrets and 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.140
 ins and outs of a title that despite 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.330
 the years passed is still capable of 

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:50.050
 keep us in tension and offer more than 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.050
 a start
