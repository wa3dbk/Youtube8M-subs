compatible with any MIDI device I have a

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.249 
compatible with any MIDI device I have a
connected<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> synthesizer<00:01:21.990> you

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
connected here to a synthesizer you

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.480 
connected here to a synthesizer you
could<00:01:22.380> also<00:01:22.500> hook<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.070> foot<00:01:23.310> pedal

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
could also hook it up to a foot pedal

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.520 
could also hook it up to a foot pedal
and<00:01:23.729> control<00:01:24.150> your<00:01:24.270> car<00:01:24.540> apps<00:01:24.750> from<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.110> it

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
and control your car apps from it it

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
and control your car apps from it it
also<00:01:25.650> works<00:01:25.920> with<00:01:26.070> pretty<00:01:26.280> much<00:01:26.369> any<00:01:26.580> app<00:01:26.759> that

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
also works with pretty much any app that

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.219 
also works with pretty much any app that
you<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> connect<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.200> a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
you want to connect it to I have a

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.600 
you want to connect it to I have a
connected<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.740> Nord<00:01:28.979> beat<00:01:29.159> here<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.579> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
connected to Nord beat here which is a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.940 
connected to Nord beat here which is a
very<00:01:29.820> simple<00:01:30.030> step<00:01:30.990> sequencer<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.799> MIDI

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
very simple step sequencer for MIDI

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.399 
very simple step sequencer for MIDI
basically<00:01:35.210> you<00:01:36.210> can<00:01:36.329> also<00:01:36.450> use<00:01:36.600> iRig<00:01:37.049> MIDI<00:01:37.229> to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
basically you can also use iRig MIDI to

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.929 
basically you can also use iRig MIDI to
connect<00:01:37.650> an<00:01:37.740> external<00:01:37.950> controller<00:01:38.549> into<00:01:38.790> play

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939
