 We are very cordial today 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.820
 this year beckons welcome as a passion 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.860
 hereby full party portal and 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.629
 Although you get yours from us today 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.519
 First, we'll take care of you afterwards 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.470
 just if you are in mallorca or 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.970
 Ballermann or otherwise generally on 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.250
 Campfire is sitting with a few friends 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.960
 you can play this song around the 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.539
 Worry, what do I know ? 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.700
 is recognized by rod stewart i'm saying 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:10.460
 and here is our german hit 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.729
 Mate Mickie Krause had a song 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.440
 built out of the means I'm solo and 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.450
 we explain how these songs work 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.740
 step by step there is a small one 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.020
 we bring all the pennies in it 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.610
 Step by step and it just pulls 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.619
 the entire song should be through 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.570
 that it is a problem at the campfire 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:31.119
 Canada accompanies you to sing 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.119
 your friends because I am the one to see 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.470
 and so on okay we are all none 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.479
 Born singers therefore have it on 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.159
 Start on digital try whole game 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.799
 did you know you can pass better ok 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.030
 So go for a drawstring 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.250
 my back pattern is rhythm 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.810
 important in acting like that is 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.149
 just do not let's start time to 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.130
 on the cd or rhythm is in principle 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:00.940
 It must be easy 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:02.860
 played through but the whole thing 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.320
 make it a little more interesting 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.750
 may count since 2 and since four and 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:14.019
 percussive blow 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:15.459
 that's just a whole lot like that 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.530
 always on two and four of the song 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.550
 percussion beat and always through 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.290
 confessed the eighth 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.910
 the whole thing serves exactly with each account 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.190
 the same exactly with which rhythm 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.519
 that you too will learn this panel now 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.530
 can from the adac has can bring 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.209
 your step by step at the very 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.290
 At the beginning we just try that 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.600
 normal eight hours 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.060
 play through too slowly pour ok and 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.799
 Although I set the pace and then 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.620
 we save together and we always count 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.660
 one and two and three and four and and 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.269
 it means but if you think the 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.890
 Target time one has two three and four 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.780
 spit with a leaflet or with a 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.200
 thumb again just come down 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.560
 direction ground and at the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.930
 between times what you between 124 and 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.239
 three have this and and you are standing 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.870
 Simply upwards so toward you so 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.870
 one and two and three and four and that 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.450
 Slowly I make 10 1 1 and 2 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.450
 and 3 and 4 and 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.910
 2 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.739
 now olli explained at the 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.480
 Chime is very important to it 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.610
 Pay attention that you rarely do that 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.739
 sound sarkozy has strong and is so 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.260
 Ethnologists no sounding sounds too 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.910
 damped even from thinking that I think 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.760
 rather bad easy with yours 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.250
 Hand back your palm here on the 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.810
 but I sound so from above 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:45.190
 the electron still grabs the pages 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.209
 no matter which one understands the chords 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.209
 to her books 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.750
 this panel with this bang 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.580
 then pulls the whole song 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.670
 just there is totally easy if it is 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.330
 can and sometimes must also slow it 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.830
 to be practiced 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.720
 how do you want to move in but together 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:07.739
 see it again before mine 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.739
 count 1234 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.500
 okay now she can never have the fans 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.910
 we are so complicated or if douglas 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.490
 have understood the then you can 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.610
 what soundtrack to this video 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.020
 just back there is right 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.330
 then slowly explain how it works 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.940
 building up the song and that's where it starts 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.870
 with a c major 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.110
 the next act is then a few times 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.840
 and then comes a f major 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.340
 there we go back to the 10 o'clock till 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.780
 We'll go there together 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:54.370
 and as I said with this 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.370
 bang slowly 1234 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.000
 2 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.159
 si 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:10.159
 hmm 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.310
 That's the beginning of the song now 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.170
 it goes on in the 2 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.890
 in the second part of him say how 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:25.270
 against napoli there is the change of 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.750
 demos but back from the ear and up 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:30.730
 on show 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:38.470
 played under c major has a heart for ca 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:38.470
 exactly how does it all sound like this 1234 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.050
 With 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.610
 Euro 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.250
 the 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.250
 With 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.849
 to 1 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.949
 that was it from our side with this 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.660
 say now you do the following and indeed 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:38.210
 Now you go somewhere until you enter 

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.669
 sheet of paper and a pen and then 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:44.389
 Do you also write the following mickie 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:48.520
 krause i'm running solo song and then 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:50.889
 do you first write two big 10? 

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:55.449
 it just stands for two clocks long 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:59.470
 cdu and then you write two armor 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:03.030
 are or write like america 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:06.380
 you want and then eleven times 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:10.230
 then again twice cdu 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:13.380
 and then sign twice the 9 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.700
 do you write it twice a minor 

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:18.729
 and twice again the 1 

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:21.139
 last but not least cdu 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:24.650
 and once you go 

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:25.280
 deleted that is 125,000 times 

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.590
 to repeat 

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.180
 who can not find the song in it anymore 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:31.009
 that was from my side and 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.740
 personal opinion page saying it was 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:37.219

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:40.689
