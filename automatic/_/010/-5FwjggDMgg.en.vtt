 pepper salt oil and a spoonful of honey 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.220
 First we drive the peeled ginger 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.340
 very fine and then give it 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.810
 immediately rub into a casserole dish 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.480
 We dismissed half of the rejected 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.220
 lemon the peel off and then 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.250

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.899
 Now everything gets together thoroughly 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:12.480
 mulled into this marinade we put the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.090
 swine salmon slices turn these 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.160

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.510
 wrap and leave the pigs 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.750

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.040
 feel it with cold water and 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.050
 Although so long to clear water 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.030
 flows through and the series is in fact 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.610
 We go cursed garden into a pot 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.050
 300 milliliters of water a teaspoon 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.480

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.580
 Let's give it a quick boil then 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.350
 Put a lid on the pot and leave it 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.820

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.660
 then we pull him from the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.820
 stove top and leave it for at least 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.489
 covered for another ten minutes 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.380
 now we were at the popular one 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.170
 we have previously washed the cut 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:01.560
 stream out and then distribute it in 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.330
 more or less little roses that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.730
 then most popular we go into one 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.370
 bowl with boiling sauce 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.660
 water pay attention to that too 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.180
 really all are covered with water 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.910
 then cover the keys and leave 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.700

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.750
 quenched with cold water and 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.880
 Mousseline in a sieve or on 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.299
 drain kitchen paper thoroughly 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.890
 in a pan, we heat some oil 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.959
 Give the pigs salmon a wait 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.010
 from one side for about one 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.049
 minute on 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.670
 if that then and proceed with the 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:40.670
 other side as well after that we give 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.920

 Two times the oven door and pour 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.160
 the meat slices with the marinade 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.959
 This makes the taste more intense 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.959
 So you should not give it up 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.790
