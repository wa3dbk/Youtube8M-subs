00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello dear friends subscribers and 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.280
 casual viewers with you as hacking and 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.550
 Today I will tell you how easy it is to remove 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.040
 scratches transmitted in addition to the background 4 4s 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.650
 from that they have a glass panel 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.150
 although also possible to remove from and will not 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.189
 strongly in-depth for this to us 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.410
 need ordinary toothpaste 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.170
 a piece fit a cotton pad but i 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.400
 I prefer a sponge with their my double 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 the throne is scary for a start wipe well 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:39.300
 screen sponge or cotton pad are 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.309
 refined that's us at the moment I'm not 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.780
 I can show me a scratch on video 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:50.129
 there is such a small put on a sponge 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.039
 a little toothpaste 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:01:00.180
 here's a pea at all 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.719
 there is a prominent here somewhere like this map 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.719
 and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:14.290
 after looking at the scratches and starting 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.290
 apply on and device with toothpaste and 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:22.460
 it now remains the most simple little by little 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:26.420
 toothpaste begin to rub into our 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:29.660
 kills right away I will say that this method is not 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.020
 very effective but still he hides 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.670
 scratches for a while 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.380
 such a procedure can be carried out with 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.530
 you have a big scratch times somewhere in 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:47.210
 week and here yesterday they look here 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:49.400
 way until something like a light 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.950
 fasting is really not completely 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:57.800
 it will be erased by such circular movements 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:02.380
 the interior of the second piran in our screen is barely 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.380
 it's dishes 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.780
 Soon he will be short on his device 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.780
 overview 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.390
 I 'll be almost here fast 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:32.060
 used by rubbing in circular 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:32.060
 movements smell delicious 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.079
 and 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.079
 electric fireplaces 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.230
 where do you know him from behind to see 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.080
 my soul with 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.600
 well yes 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.380
 when you already feel that pasta begins 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.770
 dry 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.470
 already in principle can be washed another 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.100
 sides of the sponge or animal disk tooth 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.020
 pasta 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.260
 but I prefer to do to full 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.260
 drying out 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:26.780
 Here I feel that our start me 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.780
 so you can not leave here 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:34.519
 like this so that the buttons and I had 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.519
 Toothpaste 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.120
 by masses 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.630
 gold 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.630
 painted 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.239
 despite smok for the summer 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.239
 don't emily love him 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.170
 casavir 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.150
 and then I see the park already bolted and do not need anything 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.030
 if it burns 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:49.139
 take the reverse side and good 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:53.479
 wipe our slide let's sort the screen 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.479
 what is called completing toothpaste 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:26.360
 and now we check for scratches and 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:29.889
 somewhere around 90 percent of what she leaves 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:36.110
 I can't show you right now 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:39.710
 sort of disappeared yes guys she disappeared behind 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.740
