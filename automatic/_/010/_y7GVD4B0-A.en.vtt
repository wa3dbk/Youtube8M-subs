00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.740 
actually is a thing you could even make
it<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.370> multiplayer<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:52.420> could<00:02:52.600> have

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
it so that in multiplayer you could have

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.509 
it so that in multiplayer you could have
two<00:02:53.019> people<00:02:53.440> from<00:02:53.620> different<00:02:53.709> worlds<00:02:54.190> meeting

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
two people from different worlds meeting

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.220 
two people from different worlds meeting
to<00:02:54.610> each<00:02:54.730> other<00:02:54.970> it's<00:02:55.360> it's<00:02:55.750> gonna<00:02:55.870> be<00:02:56.019> pretty

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
to each other it's it's gonna be pretty

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.540 
to each other it's it's gonna be pretty
awesome<00:02:56.410> if<00:02:56.650> that<00:02:56.800> even<00:02:57.010> happens<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.459> know

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
awesome if that even happens you know

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.100 
awesome if that even happens you know
you'll<00:02:57.910> never<00:02:58.150> run<00:02:58.480> out<00:02:58.510> of<00:02:58.630> server<00:02:58.930> space

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
you'll never run out of server space

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.809 
you'll never run out of server space
maybe<00:02:59.440> handling<00:03:00.130> servers<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.519> gonna<00:03:00.670> be<00:03:00.790> a

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:00.819 
maybe handling servers is gonna be a

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:02.340 
maybe handling servers is gonna be a
really<00:03:01.030> big<00:03:01.269> deal<00:03:01.420> because<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.720> have<00:03:02.019> to<00:03:02.170> like

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
really big deal because you have to like

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.380 
really big deal because you have to like
protect<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.160> lot<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:03.519> stuff<00:03:03.760> that's<00:03:03.970> not<00:03:04.180> going

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
protect a lot of stuff that's not going

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.030 
protect a lot of stuff that's not going
to<00:03:04.450> get<00:03:04.630> grief<00:03:04.959> but<00:03:05.140> who<00:03:05.290> knows<00:03:05.530> there's<00:03:05.890> gonna

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
to get grief but who knows there's gonna

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.440 
to get grief but who knows there's gonna
be<00:03:06.220> software's<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:06.790> are<00:03:06.910> gonna<00:03:07.150> be<00:03:07.239> fixing

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
be software's that are gonna be fixing

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.880 
be software's that are gonna be fixing
there's<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:07.900> much<00:03:08.019> possibilities<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.769> this

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
there's so much possibilities of this

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.110 
there's so much possibilities of this
and<00:03:09.069> if<00:03:09.130> something<00:03:09.519> like<00:03:09.610> this<00:03:09.670> actually

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
and if something like this actually

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.910 
and if something like this actually
happens<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.630> is<00:03:10.810> going<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.140> mean<00:03:11.260> so<00:03:11.530> much<00:03:11.560> and

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
happens it is going to mean so much and

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.229 
happens it is going to mean so much and
people<00:03:12.130> are<00:03:12.220> gonna<00:03:12.310> be<00:03:12.400> so<00:03:12.640> interested<00:03:13.120> in

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
people are gonna be so interested in

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.660 
people are gonna be so interested in
possibly<00:03:13.600> getting<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.620> other<00:03:14.739> game<00:03:15.010> if<00:03:15.370> that

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
possibly getting the other game if that

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.370
