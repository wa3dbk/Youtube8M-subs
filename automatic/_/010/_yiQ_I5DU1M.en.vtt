00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
there but if it's sitting there back and

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.300 
there but if it's sitting there back and
I<00:03:28.780> have<00:03:29.050> that<00:03:29.230> experience<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:30.010> veterinary

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
I have that experience of veterinary

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.949 
I have that experience of veterinary
practice<00:03:30.730> and<00:03:31.030> where<00:03:31.239> we<00:03:31.420> knew<00:03:31.600> there<00:03:31.840> was<00:03:31.930> a

practice and where we knew there was a
dog<00:03:32.200> that<00:03:32.230> came<00:03:32.590> in<00:03:32.770> joking<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.760> we<00:03:33.880> couldn't

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
dog that came in joking and we couldn't

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.000 
dog that came in joking and we couldn't
get<00:03:34.390> that<00:03:34.570> ball<00:03:34.840> out<00:03:34.870> by<00:03:35.260> you<00:03:35.530> know<00:03:35.620> doing<00:03:35.920> a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
get that ball out by you know doing a

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.850 
get that ball out by you know doing a
finger<00:03:36.340> sweep<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:37.660> next<00:03:37.989> thing<00:03:38.140> you<00:03:38.230> weren't

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
finger sweep the next thing you weren't

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.620 
finger sweep the next thing you weren't
you're<00:03:39.430> trying<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.820> do<00:03:39.970> is<00:03:40.150> like<00:03:40.330> what's

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
you're trying to do is like what's

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.120 
you're trying to do is like what's
another<00:03:40.930> way<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.290> getting<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.680> out<00:03:41.769> is<00:03:41.950> by

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
another way of getting it out is by

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.509 
another way of getting it out is by
doing<00:03:42.190> a<00:03:42.700> procedure<00:03:43.630> called<00:03:44.140> the<00:03:44.290> Heimlich<00:03:44.860> go

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
doing a procedure called the Heimlich go

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.030 
doing a procedure called the Heimlich go
boy<00:03:45.670> Jessie<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:46.360> what<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.110> Heimlich<00:03:47.440> is<00:03:47.709> is

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
boy Jessie and what the Heimlich is is

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.130 
boy Jessie and what the Heimlich is is
that<00:03:48.519> we're<00:03:48.700> putting<00:03:48.910> force<00:03:49.360> on<00:03:49.690> your<00:03:49.900> pets

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
that we're putting force on your pets

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.900 
that we're putting force on your pets
diaphragm<00:03:50.739> or<00:03:51.010> putting<00:03:51.190> force<00:03:51.489> on<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.700> dogs

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
diaphragm or putting force on the dogs

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.740 
diaphragm or putting force on the dogs
on<00:03:52.180> them<00:03:52.860> yes<00:03:53.860> we<00:03:54.070> are

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
on them yes we are

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.910 
on them yes we are
Jessie<00:03:55.750> we're<00:03:56.230> putting<00:03:56.440> force<00:03:56.680> in<00:03:56.830> his

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
Jessie we're putting force in his

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.500 
Jessie we're putting force in his
diaphragm<00:03:57.220> which<00:03:57.640> putting<00:03:57.940> force<00:03:58.239> in<00:03:58.420> the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
diaphragm which putting force in the

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.690 
diaphragm which putting force in the
back<00:03:58.660> of<00:03:58.840> his<00:03:58.930> throat<00:03:59.230> with<00:03:59.830> helping<00:04:00.190> expel

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
back of his throat with helping expel

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.060 
back of his throat with helping expel
whatever<00:04:01.030> in<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.390> back<00:04:01.570> of<00:04:01.750> his<00:04:01.870> throat<00:04:02.070> so

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:03.070 
whatever in the back of his throat so

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.229 
whatever in the back of his throat so
the<00:04:03.190> easiest<00:04:03.820> way<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.150> do<00:04:04.390> it<00:04:04.570> in<00:04:05.350> our<00:04:05.440> pets<00:04:05.769> is

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
the easiest way to do it in our pets is

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:09.060 
the easiest way to do it in our pets is
by<00:04:07.239> using<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.930> force<00:04:08.140> of<00:04:08.290> gravity<00:04:08.709> with<00:04:08.860> them

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
by using the force of gravity with them

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.500 
by using the force of gravity with them
so<00:04:09.340> we're<00:04:09.459> trying<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.670> put<00:04:09.820> force<00:04:10.120> in<00:04:10.300> the<00:04:10.360> back

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
so we're trying to put force in the back

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.630 
so we're trying to put force in the back
of<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.720> diaphragm<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.739> office<00:04:12.100> just<00:04:12.340> under<00:04:12.610> a

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
of the diaphragm and office just under a

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.260 
of the diaphragm and office just under a
rib<00:04:12.970> cage<00:04:13.000> as<00:04:13.570> it<00:04:13.900> is<00:04:13.989> in<00:04:14.170> our<00:04:14.290> dogs<00:04:15.090> we<00:04:16.090> want<00:04:16.210> to

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:16.270 
rib cage as it is in our dogs we want to

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.729 
rib cage as it is in our dogs we want to
do<00:04:16.390> that<00:04:16.539> by<00:04:16.720> putting<00:04:16.900> them<00:04:17.080> upside<00:04:17.350> down<00:04:17.380> I'm

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
do that by putting them upside down I'm

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.320 
do that by putting them upside down I'm
going<00:04:17.890> to<00:04:17.950> try<00:04:18.190> here<00:04:18.460> in<00:04:18.520> Jessie<00:04:18.970> see<00:04:19.150> how<00:04:19.239> it

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
going to try here in Jessie see how it

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.319 
going to try here in Jessie see how it
worked<00:04:19.570> we<00:04:19.810> might<00:04:19.960> have<00:04:20.080> to

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
worked we might have to

ribcage I'm going to put five sharp

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.279 
ribcage I'm going to put five sharp
thrusts<00:04:44.569> one<00:04:45.020> two<00:04:45.560> three<00:04:46.219> four<00:04:46.759> five<00:04:47.389> I'm

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289

thrusts one two three four five I'm
clear<00:04:49.039> amount<00:04:49.280> of<00:04:49.370> force<00:04:49.669> and<00:04:50.020> then<00:04:51.020> I've<00:04:51.560> also

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
clear amount of force and then I've also

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.369 
clear amount of force and then I've also
hung<00:04:52.159> him<00:04:52.310> upside<00:04:52.460> down<00:04:52.699> with<00:04:53.120> gravity<00:04:53.599> then

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:54.379 
hung him upside down with gravity then

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:55.990 
hung him upside down with gravity then
I'm<00:04:54.469> going<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.680> check<00:04:54.919> his<00:04:55.099> mouth<00:04:55.310> you<00:04:55.729> know<00:04:55.819> is

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
lot of force to then get additional

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.879

force on his diaphragm which then can

00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:08.559 
force on his diaphragm which then can
potentially<00:06:07.339> expel<00:06:07.729> whatever's<00:06:08.180> in<00:06:08.300> the<00:06:08.389> back

potentially expel whatever's in the back
of<00:06:08.750> his<00:06:08.870> throat<00:06:09.050> so<00:06:09.919> that<00:06:10.069> is<00:06:10.250> the<00:06:10.400> principle

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
of his throat so that is the principle

inward upward motion going to pull in
towards<00:06:29.569> yourself<00:06:30.080> but<00:06:30.349> also<00:06:30.440> push<00:06:30.860> up<00:06:31.069> just
