 by umberto eco 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:30.029
 pico say more is a man of only one romance called the rose 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:34.969
 and this true mind, no other rich novel has been able to fascinate 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.609
 so much building these cream puffs a weave that combines suspense culture 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.090
 but together with baudolino surely the cemetery of prague campo. well done e 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.920
 packaged 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.310
 Complex integer moves on three narrative planes 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.380
 ciaoo narrator who pretends to have found the diary in which they alternate 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.420
 hands of the abbot from the small edit simone simonini 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.060
 this weaving 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.239
 reconnects with the main events 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.320

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.570
 in Paris 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.620
 the character the best merge 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.810
 is that of simone simonini 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.859
 that for 7 perhaps the abbot will not discover this voter in the small one 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.950
 but most of all 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.340
 what most central contacts this book 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.340
 and the ability to build a cult plot 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.060
 which shows us what cedifarme generation 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.820
 so put fakes 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.790
 that really made history tremendously 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.830

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.240
 to the creation of an enemy 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.530
 the Jews 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.240

 justin that many others have built with open documents 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.869
 I say it shows as a fassardi profession simone simonini the only one 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.350
 character 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.780
 dimension, all the others are novels, they are really characters

 which reader struggled to remember 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:34.069
 It is true that Fineco shows us a very useful synoptic table in reality 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:35.639

 how to read the plot like the creation of micco 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:01.979
 but above all it shows us the mystery 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.319
 of western democracy 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.809
