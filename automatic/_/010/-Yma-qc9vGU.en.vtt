00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
now well you see the big difference was

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.620 
now well you see the big difference was
in<00:03:40.489> the<00:03:40.519> old<00:03:40.760> days<00:03:40.910> we<00:03:41.180> had<00:03:41.209> a<00:03:41.390> lot<00:03:41.599> more

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
in the old days we had a lot more

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.660

cinders<00:03:42.230> on<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.500> track<00:03:42.709> and<00:03:43.099> therefore<00:03:43.579> it

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
cinders on the track and therefore it

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.490 
cinders on the track and therefore it
used<00:03:43.849> to<00:03:43.940> make<00:03:44.090> it<00:03:44.239> much<00:03:44.390> more<00:03:44.690> rugged<00:03:45.019> shall<00:03:45.410> I

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
used to make it much more rugged shall I

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.589 
used to make it much more rugged shall I
say<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:46.250> you<00:03:46.400> would<00:03:46.579> go<00:03:46.760> around<00:03:46.910> throwing<00:03:47.420> a

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599
