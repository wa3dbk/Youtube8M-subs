think you're definitely with the
information<00:02:00.710> that<00:02:01.010> you've<00:02:01.310> put<00:02:01.520> together<00:02:02.140> I

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
information that you've put together I

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.920 
information that you've put together I
know<00:02:03.500> as<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:04.070> break<00:02:04.550> this<00:02:04.850> down<00:02:05.120> in<00:02:05.360> a<00:02:05.450> factual

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
know as you break this down in a factual

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.300 
know as you break this down in a factual
way<00:02:06.140> we're<00:02:06.290> going<00:02:06.380> to<00:02:06.440> go<00:02:06.620> first<00:02:06.860> into<00:02:07.160> the

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
way we're going to go first into the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.259 
way we're going to go first into the
understanding<00:02:07.580> of<00:02:08.200> currency<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:11.060> really

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
understanding of currency and to really

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.619 
understanding of currency and to really
understand<00:02:12.019> cycles<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.760> really<00:02:14.239> that's

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
understand cycles that really that's

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.940 
understand cycles that really that's
what<00:02:15.019> history<00:02:15.500> is<00:02:15.530> about

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
what history is about

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.940 
what history is about
is<00:02:16.099> understanding<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:16.760> cycles<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.950> currency

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
is understanding the cycles of currency

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.979 
is understanding the cycles of currency
and<00:02:19.250> then<00:02:19.489> knowing<00:02:19.790> how<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.000> act<00:02:20.269> on<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.540> and

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
and then knowing how to act on that and

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.160 
and then knowing how to act on that and
so<00:02:21.590> I'd<00:02:21.680> like<00:02:21.709> if<00:02:22.129> you<00:02:22.340> could<00:02:22.730> so<00:02:23.360> that<00:02:23.569> people

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
so I'd like if you could so that people

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.259 
so I'd like if you could so that people
can<00:02:24.379> help<00:02:24.620> take<00:02:24.950> context<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.879> everything

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
can help take context of everything

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.290 
can help take context of everything
that's<00:02:26.450> happening<00:02:26.989> we've<00:02:27.200> got<00:02:28.090> boomers<00:02:29.090> have

projecting<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.000> think<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:50.510> government<00:02:50.900> tends

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
projecting I think the government tends

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.750 
projecting I think the government tends
to<00:02:51.260> have<00:02:51.380> at<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.530> lower<00:02:51.709> stat<00:02:52.099> just<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.489> kind<00:02:52.700> of

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
to have at a lower stat just to kind of

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.660 
to have at a lower stat just to kind of
hide<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.569> reality<00:02:54.140> of<00:02:54.170> things<00:02:54.470> so<00:02:54.860> but<00:02:55.489> to

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
hide the reality of things so but to

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.430 
hide the reality of things so but to
really<00:02:55.880> delve<00:02:56.239> into<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.930> history<00:02:57.170> of

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
really delve into the history of

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.229 
really delve into the history of
currency<00:02:58.069> I<00:02:58.099> think<00:02:58.400> both<00:02:58.640> of<00:02:58.670> us<00:02:58.940> being

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
currency I think both of us being

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.870 
currency I think both of us being
students<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.019> history<00:03:00.220> when<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.340> understand

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
students of history when you understand

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.580 
students of history when you understand
history<00:03:02.060> you<00:03:02.599> can<00:03:02.780> understand<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.349> future

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
history you can understand the future

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.430 
history you can understand the future
and<00:03:03.950> in<00:03:04.099> that<00:03:04.250> way<00:03:04.459> better<00:03:04.700> take<00:03:05.110> actions<00:03:06.110> that

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
and in that way better take actions that

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.830 
and in that way better take actions that
are<00:03:07.040> going<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.340> help<00:03:07.610> bring<00:03:08.420> about<00:03:08.480> the
