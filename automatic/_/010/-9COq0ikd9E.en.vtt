00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
so I would also recommend that you use a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.970 
so I would also recommend that you use a
paddle<00:00:52.530> brush<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.920> detangle<00:00:53.539> to<00:00:54.739> remove<00:00:55.739> any

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
paddle brush to detangle to remove any

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.950 
paddle brush to detangle to remove any
hair<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.120> know<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.300> really<00:00:57.660> need<00:00:57.780> to

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
hair that you know you really need to

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.810 
hair that you know you really need to
that<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.680> shed<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> couple<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.399> hundred<00:00:59.670> here's

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
that you shed a couple of hundred here's

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.580 
that you shed a couple of hundred here's
a<00:00:59.940> day<00:01:00.120> when<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.359> have<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> lot<00:01:00.690> of<00:01:00.719> hair<00:01:00.989> you

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
a day when you have a lot of hair you

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.020 
a day when you have a lot of hair you
really<00:01:01.949> need<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> go<00:01:02.309> through<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.550> process<00:01:02.730> of

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
really need to go through the process of

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.980 
really need to go through the process of
brushing<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.539> when<00:01:03.690> you're<00:01:03.809> detangling<00:01:05.990> so

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
brushing it when you're detangling so

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.270 
brushing it when you're detangling so
next<00:01:07.200> we're<00:01:07.290> going<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.439> use<00:01:07.500> wrap<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.010> roll<00:01:08.130> in

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
next we're going to use wrap and roll in

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.440 
next we're going to use wrap and roll in
her<00:01:08.369> hair<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.790> reason<00:01:09.060> we're<00:01:09.180> gonna<00:01:09.270> use

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
her hair and the reason we're gonna use

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.060 
her hair and the reason we're gonna use
rapid<00:01:09.810> roll<00:01:09.990> is<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.470> she<00:01:10.710> has<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.830> lot<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
rapid roll is because she has a lot of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.030 
rapid roll is because she has a lot of
hair<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.450> rapid<00:01:13.290> roll<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.590> great<00:01:13.830> because

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
hair and so rapid roll is great because

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.890 
hair and so rapid roll is great because
it<00:01:14.189> dries<00:01:14.430> really<00:01:14.549> clean<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.330> smooth<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.840> it

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
it dries really clean and smooth and it

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.350 
it dries really clean and smooth and it
totally<00:01:16.229> seals<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.619> cuticle<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.280> it'll<00:01:18.000> give

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
totally seals the cuticle and it'll give

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.160 
totally seals the cuticle and it'll give
her<00:01:18.720> time<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.799> apply<00:01:20.570> curl<00:01:21.570> defining<00:01:21.659> cream

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
her time to apply curl defining cream

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.990 
her time to apply curl defining cream
without<00:01:22.860> her<00:01:23.009> hair<00:01:23.189> drying<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:23.790> she

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
without her hair drying out so she

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.539 
without her hair drying out so she
doesn't<00:01:24.299> have<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.509> worry<00:01:24.780> about<00:01:25.549> reapplying

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
doesn't have to worry about reapplying

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.760 
doesn't have to worry about reapplying
or<00:01:27.210> rewetting<00:01:27.570> or<00:01:27.900> respring<00:01:28.290> her<00:01:28.470> here<00:01:28.680> with

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
or rewetting or respring her here with

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.609 
or rewetting or respring her here with
leave-in<00:01:28.979> conditioner<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.350> see<00:01:31.470> that

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
leave-in conditioner so you can see that

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.080 
leave-in conditioner so you can see that
the<00:01:31.710> rapid<00:01:32.009> roll<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.280> separating<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> curl

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the rapid roll is separating the curl

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.510 
the rapid roll is separating the curl
and<00:01:33.710> it's<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:34.890> going<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.130> smooth<00:01:35.400> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
and it's just going to smooth the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.440 
and it's just going to smooth the
cuticle<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.710> then<00:01:37.710> once<00:01:38.579> she's<00:01:38.909> applied<00:01:39.240> that

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
cuticle and then once she's applied that

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.390 
cuticle and then once she's applied that
to<00:01:39.659> her<00:01:39.810> entire<00:01:40.380> head<00:01:40.650> what<00:01:41.100> we're<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.369> to

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
to her entire head what we're going to

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.069 
to her entire head what we're going to
do<00:01:41.549> is<00:01:41.700> go<00:01:41.939> right<00:01:42.270> over<00:01:42.299> that<00:01:42.600> with<00:01:42.869> curl

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
do is go right over that with curl

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.200 
do is go right over that with curl
defining<00:01:43.170> cream<00:01:43.649> rapid<00:01:44.579> roll<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.820> great<00:01:45.119> you

so<00:01:53.620> now<00:01:53.770> once<00:01:53.980> she's<00:01:54.040> worked<00:01:54.400> that<00:01:54.580> through

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
so now once she's worked that through

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.490 
so now once she's worked that through
you<00:01:55.120> could<00:01:55.270> see<00:01:55.450> that<00:01:55.630> it<00:01:55.780> sort<00:01:55.990> of<00:01:56.050> separates

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
you could see that it sort of separates

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.200 
you could see that it sort of separates
her<00:01:56.620> curls<00:01:57.010> and<00:01:57.280> it'll<00:01:57.790> keep<00:01:57.910> her<00:01:58.060> hair

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
hydrated and then the next product we're

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.560 
hydrated and then the next product we're
gonna<00:02:01.930> use<00:02:02.140> is<00:02:02.320> curl<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.620> find<00:02:02.830> a<00:02:02.890> cream<00:02:03.570> so

gonna use is curl to find a cream so

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.630 
gonna use is curl to find a cream so
she's<00:02:05.080> gonna<00:02:05.230> use<00:02:05.500> quite<00:02:05.950> a<00:02:05.980> few<00:02:06.220> pumps<00:02:06.430> of

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
she's gonna use quite a few pumps of

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.460 
she's gonna use quite a few pumps of
that<00:02:06.820> and<00:02:07.090> she's<00:02:07.330> gonna<00:02:07.450> pretty<00:02:07.780> much<00:02:07.990> work<00:02:08.290> it

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
that and she's gonna pretty much work it

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.980 
that and she's gonna pretty much work it
through<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.950> exact<00:02:09.430> same<00:02:09.550> way<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.210> she

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:10.990 
through the exact same way that she

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.440 
through the exact same way that she
worked<00:02:11.200> the<00:02:11.320> wrap<00:02:11.500> and<00:02:11.680> roll<00:02:11.770> through<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:16.330> the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
shrink and it stays smooth and it

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.910 
shrink and it stays smooth and it
defines<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.620> curl<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:31.410> this<00:02:32.410> is<00:02:32.530> on<00:02:32.650> Julie
