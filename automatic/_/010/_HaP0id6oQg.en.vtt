I was reading people's stories about it

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.319 
I was reading people's stories about it
like<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.219> personally<00:00:59.280> know<00:00:59.910> that<00:00:59.940> it's<00:01:00.210> work

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
like I personally know that it's work

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.240 
like I personally know that it's work
this<00:01:00.510> worked<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.899> me<00:01:00.989> before<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.949> I<00:01:01.980> was<00:01:02.100> just

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
this worked for me before but I was just

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.290 
this worked for me before but I was just
reading<00:01:02.370> what<00:01:02.579> other<00:01:02.609> people<00:01:02.969> had<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> say

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
reading what other people had to say

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.020 
reading what other people had to say
about<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.439> definitely<00:01:05.030> really

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
about it but I'm definitely really

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.670 
about it but I'm definitely really
intrigued<00:01:06.479> by<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.689> idea<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:07.140> sticking<00:01:07.439> with

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
intrigued by the idea of sticking with

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.390 
intrigued by the idea of sticking with
it<00:01:07.830> through<00:01:08.010> my<00:01:08.159> entire<00:01:08.460> protective<00:01:09.060> month

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
it through my entire protective month

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.399 
it through my entire protective month
will<00:01:11.400> protect<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:11.790> styling<00:01:12.270> months<00:01:12.659> because

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
will protect with styling months because

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.140 
will protect with styling months because
you<00:01:13.439> can't<00:01:14.070> see<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:14.490> hair<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.820> doesn't<00:01:15.030> matter

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
if it's greasy you can't smell it

already put castor oil in my hair so I

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.289 
already put castor oil in my hair so I

with this grease put it all at one time

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.490 
with this grease put it all at one time
and<00:01:57.030> probably<00:01:57.509> I'm<00:01:57.840> gonna<00:01:57.990> start<00:01:58.259> wearing<00:01:58.409> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
and probably I'm gonna start wearing a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.600 
and probably I'm gonna start wearing a
shower<00:01:58.740> cap<00:01:59.070> because<00:01:59.670> I'd<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.299> noticed<00:02:00.600> that

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
shower cap because I'd have noticed that

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.969 
shower cap because I'd have noticed that
the<00:02:02.610> cornrows<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.500> underneath

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the cornrows that I have in underneath

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:05.810 
the cornrows that I have in underneath
this

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
this

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.859 
this
that<00:02:06.480> they<00:02:07.020> do<00:02:07.080> get<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.130> little<00:02:08.369> bit<00:02:08.820> dry<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.479> my

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
that they do get a little bit dry and my

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.050 
that they do get a little bit dry and my
hair<00:02:10.140> naturally<00:02:10.890> does<00:02:11.100> get<00:02:11.370> dry<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:11.880> that's

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
hair naturally does get dry so that's

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.320 
hair naturally does get dry so that's
not<00:02:12.150> really<00:02:12.300> surprising<00:02:12.680> but<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:14.330> guess

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
not really surprising but I guess

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.420 
not really surprising but I guess
without<00:02:15.720> me<00:02:15.990> constantly<00:02:16.740> going<00:02:16.950> through<00:02:17.040> and

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
without me constantly going through and

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.860 
without me constantly going through and
putting<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.820> stuff<00:02:18.030> on<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.450> would<00:02:18.630> every
