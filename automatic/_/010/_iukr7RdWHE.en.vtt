on<00:00:47.850> we're<00:00:48.180> going<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.360> keep<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> tail<00:00:48.930> on

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
on we're going to keep the tail on

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.319 
on we're going to keep the tail on
that's<00:00:50.039> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.309> add<00:00:50.430> loads<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.940> flavor<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
that's going to add loads of flavor to

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.600 
that's going to add loads of flavor to
the<00:00:51.629> sauce<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.620> I'm<00:00:52.860> just<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.219> prep<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the sauce so I'm just going to prep the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.010 
the sauce so I'm just going to prep the
sauce<00:00:53.820> really<00:00:54.149> quickly<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.840> really

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
sauce really quickly and it's a really

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.319 
sauce really quickly and it's a really
simple<00:00:55.440> sauce<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.489> idea<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.000> you're<00:00:57.149> using

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
simple sauce so the idea is you're using

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.150 
simple sauce so the idea is you're using
the<00:00:57.570> heat<00:00:57.780> in<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.079> pan<00:00:58.260> really<00:00:58.739> simple

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the heat in the pan really simple

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.650 
the heat in the pan really simple
ingredients<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.789> letting<00:01:00.059> all<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> flavors

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
ingredients and letting all the flavors

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.510 
ingredients and letting all the flavors
come<00:01:00.809> through<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.219> start<00:01:02.430> with
