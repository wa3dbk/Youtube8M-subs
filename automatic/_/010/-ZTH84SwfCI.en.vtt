00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.670
 phone call 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:05.270
 I remember a student there 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.090
 university student and told me she is studying 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.570

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:19.550
 of the examination before the commission yes 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:22.810
 block and correct well know that a 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.940
 this problem is very common indeed 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.790
 public speaking causes anxiety and 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.570
 stress in so many people but it is 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.850
 including remember that the day of 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:40.399
 discussion of my thesis we can not 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.530
 not even present later ho 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:46.600
 learned the techniques that I have 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.660
 so still very precious today 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.270
 we'll talk about how to relax before a 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.690
 speech 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:00.500
 first of all I want to clarify if it should 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.220
 make a speech for non-school work 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.789
 let anxiety hurt you 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:11.330
 learn to relax prepare well 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:14.720
 first point as you told me that 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.660
 he studies his exam well 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:22.250
 she must know her speech well 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.209
 its highlights I practice 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.330
 every night for a week before 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.760
 great event face up to the 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.950
 mirror to see its expressions 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.069
 facial 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.840
 do not forget to practice before 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.200
 friends and family 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.730
 his speech to get used to talking 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.069
 in front of others 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.280
 and more importantly require 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:55.850
 feedback them so as to improve 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:58.940
 and to be able to correct the advice if for 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.610
 case must present a speech in 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.310
 general not an exam because of the exam 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.590
 rightly one cannot look but for 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.920
 regarding a speech one 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.040
 presentation to register precisely a 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.360
 small fund that is sure to 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.480
 pages are in order 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.830
 alternatively you can make 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.040
 a scheme of what will speak to them is safe 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.750
 that the print is large in bold in 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.750
 so that you can easily see 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.569
 I will see will be more calm than left 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.620
 knowing that you have the essential points of 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:43.180
 facing the technical uses of 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:49.250
 visualization to help you calm down 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:52.329
 relax now closes his eyes 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:57.430
 imagine yourself giving a speech 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:04:01.459
 confident images of the public 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.269
 listen to the applause effect in this 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:07.160
 operation 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:10.579
 I relax my muscles every night 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.370
 to alleviate tension, start 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:16.880
 contracting some muscles like those 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:21.739
 of the fist keep the position for 10 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:25.720
 seconds and then releases contino by contracting 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.720
 and relaxing the other muscles 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:33.320
 the important thing is that you practice them 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:37.110
 deep breathing inhale 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.360
 place your hand over the nose 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.510
 stomach to make sure she is 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:48.900
 breathing through the diaphragm e 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:52.100
 spire through the mouth push out 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:57.990
 air and contract the stomach muscles 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:01.140
 this method allows the more you enter 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:06.990
 in the body of the helps to stay longer 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:09.440
 calm hand outstretched pink I make many 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.060

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.300
 academic and beyond 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.000

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:23.960

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:29.180
