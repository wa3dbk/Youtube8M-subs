00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello to all here for this new 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.290
 video of this boom it's on two channels 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.929
 trash like in this sexual video 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.590
 be told to my story I'm going in 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.130
 made to demonstrate a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.420
 fight between Carthaginian Greek early I 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.119
 have always wondered what it is 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.300
 spartan on the best is what he 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.210
 y to meyer phalangists in the game and 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.560
 I was uncomfortably surprised 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.579
 Spartans was going to shine in the movie 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.020
 300 these are actually at raped in the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.040
 video you 'll see actually it's a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.780
 part I did there is a 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.450
 dysfunction 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.129
 I was a little ashamed to put it in 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.719
 line by myself said here it is 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.149
 partial it's impossible it's not 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.329
 possible that he would violate as much and in 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:54.000
 did I actually wanted before going forward 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.250
 to launch the video the time I rule 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:04.140
 of the first phalanx even though few 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:05.640
 time okay then setting up 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.120
 setting up this ream can be a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.980
 little time so there the fiji in front 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.490
 I put only one phalanx 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.800
 spartan in front of brest the bust the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.590
 purpose of the game here it was only 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.100
 to know if but Carthaginian went beat 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100
 the Greeks 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.970
 we can see him giving up the challenge challenge 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.640
 at the beginning I was trying to revise by three 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.730
 I have a little bit uncomfortable little 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.730
 time 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.159
 so as I say 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.520
 what I know 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.440
 m 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.950
 so these phalanges I'm going to measurements 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.890
 and finally from him you'll see more is going 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.030
 to be very very simple so but you have a 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.460
 green thumb if you agree with 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.900
 me that the 309 hot centers and 300 and 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.210
 that the Spartan ja will remain 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.800
 always the best in the game fart 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.509
 to many is a fighter for this 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:05.380
 project so here I am going to move a little 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.630
 because it is the ja overthrew m 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.660
 the game may start 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.700
 at jaffa river 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.680
 behind this high school the losses 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.599
 that is to say the substitutes no 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.890
 potlatch he dies in front of them they go 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.890
 take the place at 6.8 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.360
 so here I lifted the kits for him 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.880
 can cost the party started the 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.690
 charter in the boroughs r you to be 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.690
 the first on the hill 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:40.090
 in front what we have to we have 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.090
 not a recipe 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.019
 Excellency 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.940
 match game 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.810
 formerly clearly the iceberg does this to 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.730
 what you do not want they have small 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.680
 hair a little bit I'm trying to imitate this 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.440
 something like that there is the bigger boat 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.820
 in fact either they will be operational 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.190
 in January they impaled me in fact 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:11.310
 it'll go 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.840
 adds the plagne adds here there is 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.630
 so that they have their privacy if not 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.270
 everyone at the epic jobs there you 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.060
 go see with the world cats in terms 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.350
 of settings I put exactly the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.500
 same table settings 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.050
 I have everything watch evolve for both 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.490
 islands unfortunately as a witness 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.490
 partial possible 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:41.160
 the 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.160
 indeed 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:54.110
 and there I am precisely 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.650
 wrong finally thain 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.260
 I 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.860
 for if if if if you want to take 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.270
 the pine track 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.270
 broadcast there is a 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.010
 my face 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.380
 because that's all 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:40.710
 kautzmann enemy in order to do evil 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.710
 class 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.590
 and see you soon 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.610
 his story killed no one 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.420
 this fight and 430 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.720
 Gascon meal tour then in terms of this 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.069
 morning 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.819
 in the phalanx 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:03.939
 80 95 and 80 cases in that in the 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:06.979
 Phalanx of the Greeks 

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:10.069
 I was it was very very very 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.839
 surprised to see that in fact the Greeks 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:15.739
 was literally purple is 

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:17.659
 spartan especially here if you think 

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:19.059
 like me with the Spartans are the 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:22.879
 best and many 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:23.929
 she binds to it are made violate so if 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:25.789
 you are even if you like to talk 

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:27.439
 video if you say you alone and gallas them 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.179
 Spartans who are raped it's 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:31.610
 completely wrong the statistics have 

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:32.869
 been changed and well no no good no good 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.749
 then I have no proof of what I say 

00:05:32.869 --> 00:05:37.729
 but but I thoroughly put all 

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:39.800
 Spartan statistics and has 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.659
 had such good players with space at 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.399
 that I did several parts where I 

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:45.469
 wanted everyone but there they are 

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:48.409
 made tam purple here so for 

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:51.879
 me the video is over and I tell you to 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.879
 next jewelry
