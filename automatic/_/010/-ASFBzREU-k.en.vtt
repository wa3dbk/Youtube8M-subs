00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
hi everyone today I want to create a

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.379 
hi everyone today I want to create a
look<00:00:01.829> that's<00:00:01.979> been<00:00:02.159> inspired<00:00:02.610> by<00:00:02.879> the

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
look that's been inspired by the

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.010 
look that's been inspired by the
Vivienne<00:00:03.990> Westwood<00:00:04.470> red<00:00:05.040> label<00:00:05.490> catwalk<00:00:06.020> and

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
Vivienne Westwood red label catwalk and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.440 
Vivienne Westwood red label catwalk and
which<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.290> actually<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.680> 2015<00:00:08.670> spring<00:00:09.090> summer

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
which is actually the 2015 spring summer

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.080 
which is actually the 2015 spring summer
catwalk<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:10.620> this<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.040> little<00:00:11.280> bit<00:00:11.519> ahead<00:00:11.730> of

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
catwalk so this is a little bit ahead of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.539

different for each girl and the one that
I<00:00:29.820> liked<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.029> best<00:00:30.179> was<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.900> side<00:00:31.380> swept<00:00:31.769> hair

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040

so<00:00:46.379> I'm<00:00:46.829> going<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.219> be<00:00:47.309> abducting<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> look<00:00:47.969> a

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
so I'm going to be abducting the look a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.029 
so I'm going to be abducting the look a
little<00:00:48.510> bit<00:00:48.660> just<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.530> slightly

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
little bit just to make it slightly

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.939 
little bit just to make it slightly
easier<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.969> create<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.750> also<00:00:52.559> slightly

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
easier to create and also slightly

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.439 
easier to create and also slightly
easier<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.520> wear<00:00:53.730> because<00:00:53.940> it's<00:00:54.149> quite<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
easier to wear because it's quite a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.619 
easier to wear because it's quite a
full-on<00:00:54.960> look<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.770> let's<00:00:55.949> get<00:00:56.070> started<00:00:56.489> now<00:00:56.760> to

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
full-on look so let's get started now to

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.270 
full-on look so let's get started now to
begin<00:00:57.809> with<00:00:58.109> I<00:00:58.260> need<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.620> create<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.010> side

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
begin with I need to create the side

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.920 
begin with I need to create the side
suite<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.090> all<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> hair<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.750> one<00:01:00.870> side

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
suite to take all the hair to one side

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.110 
suite to take all the hair to one side
and<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:02.010> need<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> be<00:01:02.579> able<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> stay<00:01:03.090> in

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
and I need that to be able to stay in

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.929 
and I need that to be able to stay in
place<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:04.290> I'm<00:01:04.589> prepping<00:01:04.860> my<00:01:05.070> hair<00:01:05.309> using<00:01:05.670> Toni

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939

&amp; Guy volume plumping mousse and I'm
taking<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:09.990> through<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.439> lengths<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.950> all

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
taking that through the lengths and all

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.219 
taking that through the lengths and all
the<00:01:11.159> way<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.520> ends<00:01:11.869> also<00:01:12.869> creates<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the way to the ends also creates a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.109 
the way to the ends also creates a
little<00:01:13.350> bit<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.590> texture<00:01:13.950> as<00:01:14.640> well<00:01:14.700> as<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
little bit of texture as well as the

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:24.170 
little bit of texture as well as the
hold<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:21.890> then<00:01:22.890> just<00:01:23.070> combing<00:01:23.340> or<00:01:23.759> brushing

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180

the<00:01:24.270> hair<00:01:24.450> over<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:26.210> drying<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.479> mousse<00:01:27.750> in

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
the hair over and drying that mousse in

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.030 
the hair over and drying that mousse in
and<00:01:30.810> now<00:01:30.960> we've<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.229> all<00:01:31.380> dry<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.799> side

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
and now we've got all dry to the side

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.609 
and now we've got all dry to the side
I'm<00:01:32.310> going<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> add<00:01:32.729> some<00:01:33.000> extra<00:01:33.619> smoothness

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
I'm going to add some extra smoothness

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.319 
I'm going to add some extra smoothness
to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.920> hair<00:01:35.159> don't<00:01:35.490> want<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:35.970> frizzy

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
to the hair don't want it to be frizzy

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.210 
to the hair don't want it to be frizzy
or<00:01:36.450> dry<00:01:36.750> looking<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> ends<00:01:37.500> I'm<00:01:37.619> using<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
or dry looking at the ends I'm using the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.609 
or dry looking at the ends I'm using the
cool<00:01:38.430> defining<00:01:38.970> cream<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.509> that's<00:01:40.020> also<00:01:40.350> from

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
cool defining cream and that's also from

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.060 
cool defining cream and that's also from
Toni<00:01:40.860> &amp;<00:01:41.070> Guy<00:01:43.040> just<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.130> small<00:01:44.369> amount<00:01:46.070> it's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
Toni &amp; Guy just a small amount it's

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.990 
Toni &amp; Guy just a small amount it's
spreading<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.700> through<00:01:48.090> I<00:01:49.759> find<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:50.850> it's

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
spreading that through I find that it's

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.929 
spreading that through I find that it's
a<00:01:51.090> little<00:01:51.299> bit<00:01:51.390> easier<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:52.340> roll<00:01:53.340> it<00:01:53.520> up<00:01:53.670> into

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
a little bit easier to roll it up into

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.389 
a little bit easier to roll it up into
the<00:01:54.149> kind<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.509> reverse<00:01:54.930> chignon<00:01:55.470> if<00:01:56.130> there

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
the kind of reverse chignon if there

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.300 
the kind of reverse chignon if there
were<00:01:56.460> no<00:01:56.610> flyaway<00:01:57.180> bits<00:01:57.860> and<00:01:58.860> now<00:01:59.040> for<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
were no flyaway bits and now for the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490 
were no flyaway bits and now for the
tricky<00:01:59.520> bit<00:01:59.729> which<00:01:59.939> is<00:02:00.079> forming<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.170> actual

quiff I'm just going to concentrate on
the<00:02:04.110> front<00:02:04.619> bit<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.570> really<00:02:06.570> if<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.530> don't

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
the whole way back across the head then

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.370 
the whole way back across the head then
you<00:02:12.660> could<00:02:12.930> just

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
you could just

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.770 
you could just
leave<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.800> down<00:02:14.070> or<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:15.000> could<00:02:15.210> tie<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.480> back

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
leave it down or you could tie it back

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.490 
leave it down or you could tie it back
or<00:02:16.110> kind<00:02:17.100> of<00:02:17.220> sweep<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.180> round<00:02:18.450> into<00:02:18.960> some<00:02:19.200> kind

focus<00:02:22.650> on<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:22.980> front<00:02:23.220> start<00:02:23.610> with<00:02:23.790> just<00:02:24.510> going

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.760 

brushing<00:02:34.410> it<00:02:34.530> very<00:02:34.740> slightly<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:36.630> then<00:02:36.900> I'm

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
brushing it very slightly and then I'm

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.030 
brushing it very slightly and then I'm
just<00:02:37.830> very<00:02:38.310> very<00:02:38.610> loosely<00:02:39.740> folding<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:40.830> hair

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
just very very loosely folding the hair

just very very loosely folding the hair
back<00:02:41.250> on<00:02:41.430> itself<00:02:42.020> winding<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.110> around<00:02:43.140> my

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330
