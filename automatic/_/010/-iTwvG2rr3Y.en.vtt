for weapons of light if you have extra
tighten<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:40.920> that<00:04:41.160> would<00:04:41.310> be<00:04:41.340> perfect<00:04:41.610> but

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940

if<00:04:42.270> you<00:04:42.750> only<00:04:42.960> have<00:04:43.110> one<00:04:43.320> Titan<00:04:43.680> I<00:04:43.770> recommended

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
if you only have one Titan I recommended

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.670 
if you only have one Titan I recommended
to<00:04:44.790> hold<00:04:45.540> off<00:04:45.690> on<00:04:45.720> your<00:04:45.960> weapons<00:04:46.260> alight<00:04:46.530> and

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
to hold off on your weapons alight and

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.000 
to hold off on your weapons alight and
use<00:04:46.860> it<00:04:47.010> on<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.190> ship<00:04:47.430> phase<00:04:47.900> but<00:04:48.900> i<00:04:49.200> think<00:04:49.650> the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
use it on the ship phase but i think the

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.950 
use it on the ship phase but i think the
the<00:04:50.040> damage<00:04:50.730> on<00:04:50.850> my<00:04:50.970> party<00:04:51.300> here<00:04:51.480> is<00:04:51.570> actually

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
the damage on my party here is actually

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.450 
the damage on my party here is actually
really<00:04:52.140> good<00:04:52.260> so<00:04:52.970> we<00:04:53.970> don't<00:04:54.150> actually<00:04:55.460> need

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
really good so we don't actually need

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.770 
really good so we don't actually need
weapons<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.970> light<00:04:57.150> on<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.360> show<00:04:57.540> face

weapons the light on the show face

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.590 
weapons the light on the show face
because<00:04:58.200> i<00:04:58.410> think<00:04:58.740> i<00:04:59.190> think<00:04:59.520> gala<00:05:00.000> horn<00:05:00.240> users

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
because i think i think gala horn users

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600 
because i think i think gala horn users
are<00:05:00.810> like<00:05:00.960> i<00:05:01.230> have<00:05:01.620> a<00:05:01.650> couple<00:05:01.860> Callahan's<00:05:02.400> on
