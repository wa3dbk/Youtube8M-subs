 large-scale advertising campaign 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.859
 the goal was to clearly show the world that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.079
 new call of duty will be profitable 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.640

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:27.809
 spoken by michael country and glen scofield 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:30.300
 he in all and drew and put them together then 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:33.420
 enough for some full- bodied talmud 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.609
 of up to 20 warfare was supposed to change 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.280
 the series and bring back its former glory and glory 

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:39.420
 after a very bad voice and his 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.539
 cut should serve 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.640
 the exoskeleton and the image of the soldier of the future that 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:48.679
 did you hear the cameras in the end we 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.679
 tell a video review of the playground.ru 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.670
 inspired or raisin and edged 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.800
 the future setting could hardly have left 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.659
 anyone indifferent in a single game 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.370
 not so distant future where 

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.409
 slowly came to power large 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.290
 war corporation is felt very 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.070
 naturally there is no irrepressible madness 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.220
 black ops 2 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.409
 how are they boring in phase gauss in spirit 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.810
 advanced warfare is the closest 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.180
 to the original modern warfare serious 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.799
 and dramatic at the same time gaming panoramas 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.460
 shows burning megacities 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.680
 of the future 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.290
 on the battlefield catch the eye walking 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.509
 tanks and soldiers flaunt in exoskeletons 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.399
 varying degrees futuristic sti 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.509
 developers are not shy yes

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.380
 which of large-caliber guns 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.869
 literally looks like zeon defense from 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.590
 cars or dashing speed chase 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.090
 freeway 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.759
 when heroes jump from one 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.600
 car on the other and crush rivals 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.250
 with their powerful costumes 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.590
 when charming comes on the scene 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.140
 charismatic and as if sticking in 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.240
 next cinema image kevin spacey 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.510
 for the plot and read follow open 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.800
 mouth yes it was a great move invite 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.500
 one of his best actors 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.390
 generations for a role in the video game in his 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.369
 sincere emotions you believe without blinking 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.260
 the eye of his motivation seems 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.880
 natural and reasoned 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.860
 advanced warfare 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.940
 noticeably prettier from the presence 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.980
 Hollywood star 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.170
 and the developers themselves have worked hard 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.050
 order to make the plot truly 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.090
 An interesting and exciting game does not give 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.220
 get bored throwing from one 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.200
 beautiful location in another vector 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.880
 the narrative is constantly changing 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.190
 direction shows a thriving 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.890
 future world brought by war 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.390
 the destruction of the refugee camp 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.300
 dilapidated city and dominates 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.550
 all of this atlas is changeable 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:43.620
 the 20 warfare universe is perceived 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:46.410
 very lively however they are jonathan iron 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.900
 he is the same gameplay advanced warfare 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.660
 Significantly different from all that was in 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.730
 a series of earlier giant jumps furious 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.769
 side jerks amazing power 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.440
 exoskeleton which is to the fullest 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.450
 use scripted scenes updated 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.530
 arsenal and diverse abilities 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.730
 make the passage exciting and vivid 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.769
 cinematic in moments that 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.900
 There have always been a chip series in advanced 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.090
 warfare is very closely intertwined with gameplay 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.980
 and do not annoy their stubbornness 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.140
 here everything happens quickly and 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.890
 lightning like a soldier jerk 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.959
 exoskeleton 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.820
 but also scripted scenes with their entertainment 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.100
 stand out against the background 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.350
 games of the last years single 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.450
 campaign managed sledgehammer to glory 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.420
 she doesn't cheat don't give false hopes 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.340
 and gradually gaining momentum without forgetting 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.250
 occasionally pester throughout 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.620
 the beauty of scripting scenes is possible for you 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.459
 disappoints the final but here everyone decides 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.620
 advanced multiplayer 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.989
 warfare has also changed 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.360
 mechanics different type trivia changed 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.880
 equipment systems we described in detail 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.549
 countless news on the game but really 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.260
 only the gameplay is important with the advent of the series 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.660
 exoskeleton multiplayer acquired 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.020
 completely new pace if matches 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.730
 ira 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.680
 there were still transient events 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.360
 developed at lightning speed and situations 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.370
 managed to change several times in 10 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.760
 seconds of the game then now it all seems 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.830
 grandfather's fuss advanced warfare here 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.110
 where mechanics gained real speed 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.150
 players are jumping in different directions deputy 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.000
 heaven and stubbornly refused to be 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.170
 sight longer than a split second 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.280
 the verticality of the level did not seem at all 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.290
 marketing ploy 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.060
 after low approaches 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.070
 perceived as finely adjusted 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.770
 tactical arenas where moving along 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.790
 height occurs significantly more often than 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.980
 changing ground positions 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.810
 a variety of make new models of weapons 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.150
 new technical gadgets 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.610
 ability frankly pleased 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.620
 network character customization is for you 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.790
 Of course days for elder scrolls yes and 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.870
 most players prefer 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.880
 choose your gideon 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.520
 but improvement makes a tangible 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.920
 a variety of it all however secondary on 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.720
 the background of much changed gameplay for 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.550
 those who are not immediately able to adapt to 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.350
 but u pace games and supporters 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.720
 classic call of duty in store 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.340
 multiplayer mode without exoskeleton not 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.950
 last role on multiplayer quality 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.290
 affect and level small vertical and 

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.960
 very well balanced and it is no longer 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:12.000
 senseless anthill gauss special 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.130
 mustache regime. the world turned out to be a cooperative on 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.910
 survival that is sure to find 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.010
 my fans 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.260
 and in the next dil se return old 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.510
 there are no good zombies 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.100
 attention exoskeletons new mechanics the 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.350
 multiplayer advanced warfare 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:29.580
 perceived as a hodgepodge of the best 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:31.230
 damn the series is very hard however forgive 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:34.110
 developers old call of duty engine 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:36.780
 which is already an unimaginable number of years 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.910
 it remains the schedule of course made 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.370
 fantastic jerk compared so much 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.169
 same goust undemocratic and systemic 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.240
 requirements, however, are due to all 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:47.760
 those third-party technologies that 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.950
 weighed the game here and brand new 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.480
 facial animation and improved dynamic 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.700
 lighting and more 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.710
 old engine like everything else out there give 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.560
 unnatural plastic reflection 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.570
 who can walk on person characters 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.220
 turning them into physics dummies while doing 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.200
 how was the cardboard remained 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.760
 interaction with the environment froze on 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.190
 level of the beginning of the two thousandth 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.470
 all major damage is scripted and 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.110
 spelled out in the plot and small places 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.100
 I'm after a tangible effect starting 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.500
 dive into technical details 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:20.180
 you understand that nothing radically new 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.200
 developers failed to do 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.450
 this revolution is still not 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.120
 happened rather advanced warfare 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:29.220
 became a neat and cautious evolution 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.800
 brought together the best moments 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:34.200
 games of the series probably strike the world of games 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.030
 very afraid to make a mistake and therefore not 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.400
 They began to dictate its form Nikolov people 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.060
 each and every one in multiplayer as we have already 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.640
 mentioned 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.600
 you can reset the exoskeletons and return to 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.700
 familiar mechanics 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.330
 time-tested zombies will sit 

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:49.470
 advanced warfare nearest dlc 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.420
 really developers cleared up in 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.470
 single player campaign for the first time in 

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.050
 last few years 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:58.010
 carried away with the head as to all this in 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:00.420
 end up with the motto advanced warfare 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:03.150
 its quality lucia is neat or 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.790
 shona perseverance and annoying bad 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.010
 that shadowing the world really feared 

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:10.560
 it's good to risk that they are nothing 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:13.760
 not ruined thanks for attention and up 

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.760
 meeting on the playground.ru
