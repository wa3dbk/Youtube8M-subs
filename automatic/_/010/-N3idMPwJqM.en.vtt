open my mouth as white as I could and I

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.289 
open my mouth as white as I could and I
did<00:01:38.659> and<00:01:39.680> he's<00:01:40.680> like<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.100> can't<00:01:41.490> open<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.060> any

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
did and he's like you can't open it any

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.649 
did and he's like you can't open it any
wider<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.259> I'm<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.220> try<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.360> tried

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
wider and I'm like I can try and I tried

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.410 
wider and I'm like I can try and I tried
again<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:47.450> he's<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.689> okay<00:01:49.259> well<00:01:49.790> he<00:01:50.790> said

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
again and he's like okay well he said

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.380 
again and he's like okay well he said
the<00:01:51.689> reason<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:52.259> do<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.860> is<00:01:53.070> because<00:01:53.610> you

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
the reason we do that is because you

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.109 
the reason we do that is because you
need<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.049> be<00:01:55.170> able<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.439> open<00:01:55.710> your<00:01:55.799> mouth<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
need to be able to open your mouth to a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.170

certain<00:01:57.360> extent<00:01:58.040> to<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.520> able<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:01.399> get<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.969> to

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
certain extent to be able to get like to

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.560 
certain extent to be able to get like to
be<00:02:03.299> able<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.630> intubate<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.380> during<00:02:04.799> surgery

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
be able to intubate you during surgery

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.059 
be able to intubate you during surgery
they<00:02:06.570> just<00:02:06.780> do<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.140> as<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> precautionary

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
they just do that as a precautionary

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.199 
they just do that as a precautionary
thing<00:02:08.190> with<00:02:08.550> most<00:02:08.759> surgeries<00:02:09.979> and<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.849> he<00:02:11.970> said

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
thing with most surgeries and so he said

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.790 
thing with most surgeries and so he said
with<00:02:12.450> that<00:02:12.480> said

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
with that said

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.300 
with that said
it's<00:02:14.750> risky<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:16.220> put<00:02:17.220> me<00:02:17.430> under<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.300> then<00:02:19.310> try

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
it's risky to put me under and then try

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.130 
it's risky to put me under and then try
to<00:02:20.340> intubate<00:02:20.880> me<00:02:21.270> when<00:02:21.540> they're<00:02:21.840> not<00:02:22.110> a

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
to intubate me when they're not a

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.800 
to intubate me when they're not a
hundred<00:02:22.320> percent<00:02:22.620> sure<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.700> they<00:02:24.510> can

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
hundred percent sure that they can

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:32.150 
hundred percent sure that they can
intubate<00:02:25.260> me<00:02:26.000> um<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.580> he<00:02:30.180> said<00:02:30.480> that<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:31.160> most

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
intubate me um so he said that I most

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.020 
intubate me um so he said that I most
likely<00:02:32.790> will<00:02:33.420> have<00:02:33.720> to<00:02:34.020> be<00:02:34.200> awake<00:02:34.830> while<00:02:35.760> they

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
likely will have to be awake while they

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.910 
likely will have to be awake while they
intubate<00:02:36.660> me<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.940> freaks<00:02:38.940> me<00:02:39.090> out<00:02:39.920> he

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
intubate me and that freaks me out he

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.830 
intubate me and that freaks me out he

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
and I won't really notice it or feel it

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.920 
and I won't really notice it or feel it
but<00:02:56.880> I<00:02:57.050> it<00:02:58.050> still<00:02:58.440> scares<00:02:58.650> me<00:02:59.130> to<00:03:00.030> think<00:03:00.390> about

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
but I it still scares me to think about

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.040 
but I it still scares me to think about
a<00:03:00.960> tube<00:03:01.320> going<00:03:01.710> down<00:03:01.860> my<00:03:02.040> throat<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.610> I<00:03:03.090> know

a tube going down my throat and I know

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.960 
a tube going down my throat and I know
that<00:03:04.320> when<00:03:04.440> I<00:03:04.470> went<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.920> speech<00:03:05.190> therapist

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
that when I went to the speech therapist

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.790 
that when I went to the speech therapist
um<00:03:07.580> they<00:03:08.580> tried<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.180> test<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.870> look<00:03:10.530> at<00:03:10.680> my

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
um they tried to do a test to look at my

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.280 
um they tried to do a test to look at my
vocal<00:03:11.220> cords<00:03:11.640> which<00:03:11.910> they<00:03:12.540> had<00:03:12.660> to<00:03:12.810> put<00:03:12.990> like<00:03:13.140> a

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
vocal cords which they had to put like a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.820 
vocal cords which they had to put like a
like<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:14.600> metal<00:03:15.600> tool<00:03:15.870> down<00:03:16.290> there<00:03:16.560> with<00:03:16.800> a

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
like a metal tool down there with a

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.970 
like a metal tool down there with a
camera<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.640> they<00:03:18.600> could<00:03:18.840> barely<00:03:19.230> do<00:03:19.470> that<00:03:19.680> and

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
camera and they could barely do that and

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.920 
camera and they could barely do that and
it<00:03:20.070> did<00:03:20.250> not<00:03:20.370> matter<00:03:20.550> how<00:03:20.820> much<00:03:20.970> numbing<00:03:21.510> agent

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
it did not matter how much numbing agent

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.770 
it did not matter how much numbing agent
they<00:03:22.080> put<00:03:22.290> on<00:03:22.410> my<00:03:22.560> throat<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.220> was<00:03:23.880> gagging<00:03:24.209> I

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
they put on my throat I was gagging I

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.400 
they put on my throat I was gagging I
have<00:03:25.020> a<00:03:25.050> really<00:03:25.320> bad<00:03:25.530> gag<00:03:25.860> reflex<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:26.720> so<00:03:27.720> they

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
have a really bad gag reflex and so they

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.160 
have a really bad gag reflex and so they
could<00:03:28.650> barely<00:03:28.920> do<00:03:29.070> that<00:03:29.370> test<00:03:29.700> so<00:03:30.420> I'm<00:03:30.660> really

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
could barely do that test so I'm really

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.110 
could barely do that test so I'm really
really<00:03:31.500> nervous<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.520> just<00:03:32.760> need<00:03:32.940> your
