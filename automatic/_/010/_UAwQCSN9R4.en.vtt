both changes to speed II the pitch one

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.359 
both changes to speed II the pitch one
changes<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.380> pitches<00:01:37.740> well<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
changes the the pitches well and the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:47.530 
changes the the pitches well and the
time<00:01:38.579> one<00:01:38.880> doesn't<00:01:39.390> reach<00:01:43.520> completely<00:01:46.520> the

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
time one doesn't reach completely the

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:55.319 
time one doesn't reach completely the
BPM<00:01:48.540> Condor<00:01:49.200> moves<00:01:50.270> along<00:01:51.270> with<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.889 

so<00:01:56.329> we<00:01:56.540> need<00:01:56.750> in<00:01:56.899> a<00:01:57.170> different<00:01:57.680> file<00:01:58.420> bag<00:01:59.420> so

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
so we need in a different file bag so

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.240 
so we need in a different file bag so
just<00:01:59.930> click<00:02:00.530> on<00:02:00.770> top

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
just click on top

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:32.320 
just click on top
file<00:02:04.420> file<00:02:05.420> select<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.439> time<00:02:30.640> why<00:02:31.640> correct

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
file file select the time why correct

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.850 
file file select the time why correct
so<00:02:32.720> a<00:02:34.150> better<00:02:35.150> algorithm<00:02:35.630> to<00:02:36.110> calculate<00:02:36.470> the

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
so a better algorithm to calculate the

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.330 
so a better algorithm to calculate the
bpms<00:02:37.670> so<00:02:38.450> select<00:02:39.019> this<00:02:40.010> icon<00:02:40.280> here<00:02:40.910> select<00:02:41.420> BPM

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
bpms so select this icon here select BPM

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.570 
bpms so select this icon here select BPM
select<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.519> item<00:02:43.790> select<00:02:44.420> BPM<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.709> what<00:02:46.370> we

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
select this item select BPM so what we

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.320 
select this item select BPM so what we
do<00:02:46.760> is<00:02:47.060> offline<00:02:47.690> calculation<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.920> BPM<00:02:49.370> the

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
do is offline calculation of the BPM the

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.160 
do is offline calculation of the BPM the
beats<00:02:50.569> per<00:02:50.900> minute<00:02:51.260> in<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:51.530> file<00:02:51.739> so<00:02:53.170> offline

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
beats per minute in the file so offline

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:05.940 
beats per minute in the file so offline
calculating<00:02:54.980> runs<00:02:55.330> for<00:02:56.330> first<00:02:56.750> file

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.050 

for<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:06.970> second<00:03:07.300> file<00:03:08.370> it<00:03:09.370> starts

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
for the second file it starts

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:34.589 
for the second file it starts
immediately

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.449 

so<00:03:35.170> we<00:03:35.409> have<00:03:35.620> two<00:03:36.129> different<00:03:36.609> BPM<00:03:37.329> values<00:03:37.749> here

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
so we have two different BPM values here

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.819 
so we have two different BPM values here
128<00:03:40.530> 133<00:03:41.530> if<00:03:42.400> we<00:03:42.549> load<00:03:42.730> up<00:03:42.760> both<00:03:43.389> by

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
128 133 if we load up both by

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.300 
128 133 if we load up both by
double-clicking<00:03:44.829> here<00:03:45.549> so<00:03:46.030> it's<00:03:46.650> loads<00:03:47.650> new

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
double-clicking here so it's loads new

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.770 
double-clicking here so it's loads new
and<00:03:48.870> here<00:03:50.459> double<00:03:51.459> click<00:03:51.760> it<00:03:51.969> loads<00:03:52.209> new<00:03:52.480> so

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
and here double click it loads new so

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.629 
and here double click it loads new so
and<00:03:52.930> we<00:03:53.200> see<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:55.060> values<00:03:55.420> are<00:03:55.719> changed<00:03:56.260> so

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
and we see the values are changed so

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.729 
and we see the values are changed so
another<00:03:57.639> important<00:03:58.209> thing<00:03:58.389> what<00:03:59.379> you<00:03:59.530> might

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
another important thing what you might

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.390 
another important thing what you might
have<00:03:59.980> realized<00:04:00.189> is<00:04:01.500> this<00:04:02.500> file<00:04:02.859> was<00:04:03.430> quite

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
have realized is this file was quite

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.869 
have realized is this file was quite
silent<00:04:06.400> and<00:04:06.879> this<00:04:07.480> file<00:04:07.870> was<00:04:08.200> quite<00:04:08.560> loud<00:04:08.879> so

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:09.879 
silent and this file was quite loud so

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:11.869 
silent and this file was quite loud so
the<00:04:10.299> important<00:04:10.750> thing<00:04:10.780> is<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.290> normalization

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
the important thing is the normalization

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:15.119 
the important thing is the normalization
what<00:04:12.879> we<00:04:13.060> have<00:04:13.239> to<00:04:13.419> do<00:04:13.599> is<00:04:13.870> either<00:04:14.500> we<00:04:14.829> have<00:04:14.980> to

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
what we have to do is either we have to

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:19.860 
what we have to do is either we have to
do<00:04:15.310> it<00:04:15.519> on<00:04:16.289> by<00:04:17.289> hand<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:17.949> means<00:04:18.699> change<00:04:19.570> in

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
do it on by hand that means change in

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.439 
do it on by hand that means change in
volume<00:04:20.470> and<00:04:20.739> so<00:04:21.519> on<00:04:21.900> or<00:04:22.900> we<00:04:23.650> do<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:23.889> in<00:04:24.190> advance

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
volume and so on or we do it in advance

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.659 
volume and so on or we do it in advance
so<00:04:25.449> that<00:04:25.479> means<00:04:25.870> we<00:04:26.340> calculate<00:04:27.340> a

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:27.669 
so that means we calculate a

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:32.760 
so that means we calculate a
normalization<00:04:28.660> value<00:04:29.560> over<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.280> file<00:04:31.770> the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
normalization value over the file the

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.339 
normalization value over the file the
normalization<00:04:33.539> algorithm<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.900> good<00:04:38.110> thing

00:04:38.339 --> 00:04:38.349 
normalization algorithm the good thing

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.560 
normalization algorithm the good thing
is<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.830> normalization<00:04:39.370> algorithm<00:04:40.180> doesn't

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
is the normalization algorithm doesn't

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.689 
is the normalization algorithm doesn't
change<00:04:40.750> anything<00:04:41.169> to<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.710> file<00:04:41.949> adjust<00:04:42.460> if

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
change anything to the file adjust if

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:49.620 
change anything to the file adjust if
you<00:04:43.180> click<00:04:44.020> here<00:04:44.349> and<00:04:44.500> click<00:04:44.530> here<00:04:48.630> just

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
you click here and click here just

00:04:49.630 --> 00:05:08.610 
you click here and click here just
changes<00:04:50.169> the<00:04:50.440> the<00:04:51.250> gain<00:04:51.460> values<00:04:54.210> so

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:16.089 

both<00:05:10.719> run<00:05:11.719> equally<00:05:12.370> we<00:05:13.370> just<00:05:13.669> change<00:05:14.860> use<00:05:15.860> the

00:05:16.089 --> 00:05:16.099 
both run equally we just change use the

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:40.950 
both run equally we just change use the
scroll<00:05:16.430> wheel<00:05:17.680> on<00:05:18.680> your<00:05:18.740> mouse<00:05:18.949> to<00:05:19.520> find<00:05:20.509> you

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.430 

so<00:05:41.960> we<00:05:42.680> are<00:05:42.800> not<00:05:42.949> prepared
