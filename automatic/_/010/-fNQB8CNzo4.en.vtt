00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.119 
quite choppy so I think both vimeo and
youtube<00:02:19.670> HD<00:02:20.269> is<00:02:20.629> going<00:02:20.930> to<00:02:21.019> be<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.170> no<00:02:21.470> let's

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
youtube HD is going to be a no let's

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.680 
youtube HD is going to be a no let's
just<00:02:22.280> look<00:02:22.370> at<00:02:22.489> standard<00:02:22.910> definition<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.540> this

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
just look at standard definition so this

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.849 
just look at standard definition so this
is<00:02:23.930> another<00:02:24.799> one<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.040> our<00:02:25.190> videos<00:02:26.379> this<00:02:27.379> is<00:02:27.680> the

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
is another one of our videos this is the

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:43.589 
is another one of our videos this is the
standard<00:02:28.220> def<00:02:28.579> version<00:02:29.060> on<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.239> youtube<00:02:29.840> site

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.610 

so<00:02:44.599> you<00:02:44.630> can<00:02:44.810> see<00:02:44.900> that's<00:02:45.079> quite<00:02:45.260> good<00:02:45.440> it

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
so you can see that's quite good it

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.430 
so you can see that's quite good it
struggles<00:02:46.310> with<00:02:46.549> full<00:02:47.480> frame<00:02:47.780> motion<00:02:48.230> and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
struggles with full frame motion and

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.229 
struggles with full frame motion and
stuff<00:02:48.919> is<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.069> little<00:02:49.220> bit<00:02:49.489> but<00:02:49.910> otherwise

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
stuff is a little bit but otherwise

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.940 
stuff is a little bit but otherwise
that's<00:02:50.630> fairly<00:02:51.139> viewable<00:02:51.680> I've<00:02:51.769> watched

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
that's fairly viewable I've watched

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.530 
that's fairly viewable I've watched

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
quite a few YouTube videos I'd say

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.170 
quite a few YouTube videos I'd say
standard<00:02:54.079> def<00:02:54.260> is<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.739> way<00:02:54.859> to<00:02:54.919> go<00:02:55.160> just<00:02:56.090> for

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
standard def is the way to go just for

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:57.490 
standard def is the way to go just for

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
again that's actually slightly jerkier

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.740 
again that's actually slightly jerkier
than<00:03:25.010> youtube<00:03:25.730> but<00:03:25.849> again<00:03:26.090> still<00:03:26.389> fairly

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
than youtube but again still fairly

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.500 
than youtube but again still fairly
viewable<00:03:27.169> so<00:03:27.500> overall<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.700> response<00:03:29.239> to

viewable so overall in a response to

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.969 
viewable so overall in a response to
people's<00:03:30.139> questions<00:03:30.849> i'd<00:03:31.849> say<00:03:32.239> that<00:03:32.569> the

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:32.979 
people's questions i'd say that the

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.439 
people's questions i'd say that the
nokia<00:03:33.979> booklet<00:03:34.100> 3g<00:03:34.430> is<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:34.970> little<00:03:35.359> bit

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:35.449 
nokia booklet 3g is a little bit

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.520 
nokia booklet 3g is a little bit
underpowered<00:03:35.660> in<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.079> old<00:03:36.199> process

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
underpowered in the old process

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.440 
underpowered in the old process
development<00:03:36.889> it's<00:03:37.100> also<00:03:37.220> only<00:03:37.370> got<00:03:37.609> one<00:03:37.850> gig

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
development it's also only got one gig

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.990 
development it's also only got one gig
which<00:03:38.660> isn't<00:03:38.780> upgradeable<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:40.099> probably<00:03:40.730> no

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
which isn't upgradeable so probably no

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.170 
which isn't upgradeable so probably no

later just one last thing before I go as

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.420 
later just one last thing before I go as
well<00:03:50.540> I<00:03:50.750> know<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.530> should<00:03:51.709> look<00:03:51.920> down<00:03:52.250> the

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
well I know you should look down the

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.949 
well I know you should look down the
thing<00:03:52.670> you<00:03:53.060> see<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.300> little<00:03:53.420> blue<00:03:53.599> flashing

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
thing you see the little blue flashing

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.190 
thing you see the little blue flashing
light<00:03:54.110> there<00:03:54.349> that<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.370> the<00:03:55.610> Wi-Fi<00:03:56.239> light<00:03:56.540> now

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
light there that is the Wi-Fi light now

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.530 
light there that is the Wi-Fi light now
earlier<00:03:57.709> I<00:03:57.769> thought<00:03:58.040> that<00:03:58.310> was<00:03:58.459> just<00:03:58.540> flashing

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
earlier I thought that was just flashing

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.150 
earlier I thought that was just flashing
because<00:03:59.989> we<00:04:00.080> were<00:04:00.140> just<00:04:00.290> downloading<00:04:00.709> data<00:04:00.860> so

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
because we were just downloading data so

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.530 
because we were just downloading data so
I've<00:04:01.250> been<00:04:01.340> pre<00:04:01.580> caching<00:04:02.000> all<00:04:02.120> those<00:04:02.360> movies

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
I've been pre caching all those movies

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.479 
I've been pre caching all those movies
but<00:04:03.260> it's<00:04:03.500> still<00:04:03.769> going<00:04:03.980> I've<00:04:04.220> checked

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
but it's still going I've checked

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:05.440 
but it's still going I've checked
there's<00:04:04.760> no<00:04:04.849> apps<00:04:05.090> that<00:04:05.269> should<00:04:05.390> be

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
there's no apps that should be

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.850 
there's no apps that should be
downloading<00:04:05.900> data<00:04:06.019> and<00:04:06.349> I've<00:04:06.440> checked<00:04:06.739> all

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
downloading data and I've checked all

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.500 
downloading data and I've checked all
the<00:04:06.920> background<00:04:07.400> processes<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.060> updates<00:04:08.360> as

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
the background processes and updates as

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.660 
the background processes and updates as
well<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:08.900> they're<00:04:09.860> all<00:04:10.010> turned<00:04:10.250> off<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:10.640> i

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
well and they're all turned off so i

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.610 
well and they're all turned off so i
think<00:04:10.940> that<00:04:11.150> blue<00:04:11.390> flashing<00:04:11.750> light<00:04:11.900> means<00:04:11.930> i'm

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
think that blue flashing light means i'm

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.920 
think that blue flashing light means i'm
