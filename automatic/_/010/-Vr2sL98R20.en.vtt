the<00:00:53.789> back<00:00:53.940> as<00:00:54.180> well<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.719> am<00:00:55.199> not<00:00:55.710> seeing<00:00:56.039> me

ridiculous<00:01:06.960> because<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.380> really<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.770> only<00:01:08.189> one

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
ridiculous because it really is only one

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.410

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.010 
exactly know where my angle is on this
camera<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.360> I'm<00:01:15.450> trying<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.810> get<00:01:15.930> everything

inside there is a very interesting kind
of<00:01:27.720> plunger<00:01:28.170> system<00:01:28.560> sort<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.040> we're<00:01:29.189> used

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
of plunger system sort that we're used

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.090 
of plunger system sort that we're used
to<00:01:29.549> back<00:01:30.329> here<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.720> have<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.110> traditional<00:01:31.350> and

to back here we have a traditional and
looks<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.850> free-floating<00:01:33.770> plunger

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
looks like a free-floating plunger

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.190 
looks like a free-floating plunger
system<00:01:35.640> which<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.030> really<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.630> cool<00:01:36.990> I

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
system which is really really cool I

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.810 
system which is really really cool I
like<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.680> breech<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:37.920> built-in<00:01:38.400> it'll

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
like that the breech is built-in it'll

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.390 
like that the breech is built-in it'll
lend<00:01:38.970> itself<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.509> modification<00:01:40.409> very<00:01:41.130> very

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
lend itself to modification very very

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.789 
lend itself to modification very very
well<00:01:41.670> I'm<00:01:42.210> going<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.540> start<00:01:42.840> trying<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.530> take

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
well I'm going to start trying to take

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.560 
well I'm going to start trying to take
this<00:01:43.979> off<00:01:44.189> that's<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:44.909> simple<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.479> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
this off that's just as simple as it is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.410 
this off that's just as simple as it is
it's<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.020> snap-on<00:01:46.560> barrel<00:01:47.100> it<00:01:47.520> looks<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.119> it's

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
it's a snap-on barrel it looks like it's

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.719 
it's a snap-on barrel it looks like it's
tight<00:01:48.720> enough<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.350> will<00:01:49.560> induce<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
tight enough that it will induce a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.630 
tight enough that it will induce a
barrel<00:01:51.119> drag<00:01:51.390> here<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> whole<00:01:53.159> lot<00:01:53.189> though

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
barrel drag here not a whole lot though

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.850 
barrel drag here not a whole lot though
it's<00:01:53.820> not<00:01:54.000> bad<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.229> purely<00:01:55.649> cosmetic

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
it's not bad and it's a purely cosmetic

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.880 
it's not bad and it's a purely cosmetic
attack<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.820> let's<00:01:56.969> go<00:01:57.090> ahead

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
attack so let's go ahead

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.390 
attack so let's go ahead
and<00:01:58.010> let's<00:01:58.280> chamber<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.210> dirt<00:01:59.590> that<00:02:00.590> simple<00:02:01.159> and

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
and let's chamber a dirt that simple and

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.190 
and let's chamber a dirt that simple and
then<00:02:01.520> we'll<00:02:01.700> prime<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.810> fire<00:02:04.540> so<00:02:05.540> ranges<00:02:06.080> are

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
then we'll prime and fire so ranges are

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.469 
then we'll prime and fire so ranges are
actually<00:02:06.590> quite<00:02:06.830> poor<00:02:06.860> which<00:02:07.820> is<00:02:07.850> a<00:02:08.240> little

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
actually quite poor which is a little

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.540 
actually quite poor which is a little
bit<00:02:08.569> upsetting<00:02:08.990> but<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.890> blaster<00:02:10.310> as<00:02:10.520> a

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
bit upsetting but the blaster as a

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.050 
bit upsetting but the blaster as a
concept<00:02:11.180> is<00:02:11.360> interesting<00:02:12.050> I'm<00:02:12.530> going<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:13.060> what

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
concept is interesting I'm going to what

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.060 
concept is interesting I'm going to what
is<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:14.390> this<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.959> button<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.500> assume<00:02:15.830> that

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
is this this is the button I assume that

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.400 
is this this is the button I assume that
releases<00:02:16.610> this<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.120> it<00:02:17.270> does<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:18.170> this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
releases this and it does so this

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.690 
releases this and it does so this
connects<00:02:19.100> in<00:02:19.280> like<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:21.340> very<00:02:22.340> interesting

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
connects in like this very interesting

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.020 
connects in like this very interesting
stock<00:02:23.480> itself<00:02:23.900> not<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.980> most<00:02:25.400> comfortable

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
stock itself not the most comfortable

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.110 
stock itself not the most comfortable
but<00:02:26.270> it's<00:02:26.510> not<00:02:26.750> bad<00:02:27.020> it's<00:02:27.440> it's<00:02:27.920> very

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
but it's not bad it's it's very

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.670 
but it's not bad it's it's very
interesting<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.720> I'm<00:02:29.900> assuming<00:02:30.050> where

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
interesting this is I'm assuming where

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.270 
interesting this is I'm assuming where
our<00:02:31.280> blaster<00:02:31.910> will<00:02:32.090> go<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:32.660> so<00:02:33.620> if<00:02:33.800> we<00:02:33.980> want<00:02:34.190> to

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
our blaster will go in so if we want to

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.380 
our blaster will go in so if we want to
we<00:02:34.700> slide<00:02:35.600> in<00:02:35.959> like<00:02:35.989> this<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.950> then<00:02:37.610> oh<00:02:38.000> man

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
we slide in like this and then oh man

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.910 
we slide in like this and then oh man
it's<00:02:38.660> got<00:02:38.870> two<00:02:39.110> connection<00:02:39.530> points<00:02:39.560> so

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
it's got two connection points so

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.650 
it's got two connection points so
there's<00:02:40.100> one<00:02:40.340> here<00:02:40.940> in<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.120> back<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.570> then

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
there's one here in the back and then

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.080 
there's one here in the back and then
one<00:02:41.900> here<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:42.470> front<00:02:42.800> so<00:02:43.370> you<00:02:43.760> can't

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
one here in the front so you can't

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.570 
one here in the front so you can't
actually<00:02:44.360> chamber<00:02:45.050> this<00:02:45.200> wrong<00:02:45.530> because<00:02:46.250> it

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
actually chamber this wrong because it

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.940 
actually chamber this wrong because it
will<00:02:46.790> connect<00:02:47.750> in<00:02:47.900> like<00:02:48.140> that<00:02:48.350> and<00:02:48.590> it's

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
will connect in like that and it's

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.380 
will connect in like that and it's
actually<00:02:49.340> pretty<00:02:49.550> cool<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:50.000> belt<00:02:50.209> loop

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
actually pretty cool the belt loop

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.490 
actually pretty cool the belt loop
attachment<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.019> nice

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
attachment is nice

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.500 
attachment is nice

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
looks like we have access to our plunger

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.630 
looks like we have access to our plunger

they're<00:03:07.910> not<00:03:08.060> claiming<00:03:08.480> ranges<00:03:08.900> because<00:03:09.019> this

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
they're not claiming ranges because this

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.100 
they're not claiming ranges because this
is<00:03:09.380> more<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.739> a<00:03:09.799> jolt<00:03:10.100> than<00:03:10.670> a<00:03:11.120> actual<00:03:11.930> in

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110

reminds<00:03:17.900> me<00:03:17.959> a<00:03:18.290> lot<00:03:18.799> of<00:03:18.860> a<00:03:19.220> lock<00:03:19.459> and<00:03:19.640> load<00:03:19.850> I

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
reminds me a lot of a lock and load I

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.520 
reminds me a lot of a lock and load I
like<00:03:20.239> that<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.480> lot<00:03:20.750> I<00:03:20.870> think<00:03:21.110> that<00:03:21.230> it's<00:03:21.350> very

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
like that a lot I think that it's very

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.699 
like that a lot I think that it's very
cool<00:03:21.950> and<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:23.390> ranges<00:03:23.720> are<00:03:23.870> not<00:03:24.019> improving<00:03:24.440> at

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
cool and the ranges are not improving at

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.520 
cool and the ranges are not improving at
all<00:03:24.860> but<00:03:25.190> still<00:03:26.180> a<00:03:26.329> very<00:03:26.420> interesting<00:03:27.260> concept

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
all but still a very interesting concept

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.740 
all but still a very interesting concept
very<00:03:28.040> cool<00:03:28.400> blaster<00:03:28.910> looking<00:03:29.510> down<00:03:29.660> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
very cool blaster looking down the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.000 
very cool blaster looking down the
barrel<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:30.049> can<00:03:30.290> see<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.590> no<00:03:30.680> matter<00:03:30.799> how

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
barrel you can see that no matter how

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.940 
barrel you can see that no matter how
you<00:03:31.070> chamber<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:32.120> does<00:03:32.390> wind<00:03:32.720> up<00:03:33.049> there<00:03:33.650> at

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
you chamber it it does wind up there at

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.430 
you chamber it it does wind up there at
the<00:03:33.980> front<00:03:34.400> and<00:03:34.700> it'll<00:03:35.540> let<00:03:35.720> you<00:03:35.750> reprime

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
the front and it'll let you reprime

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.020 
the front and it'll let you reprime
that's<00:03:36.860> interesting<00:03:37.459> but<00:03:37.549> it<00:03:37.670> doesn't<00:03:37.700> have<00:03:38.000> a

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
that's interesting but it doesn't have a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.150 
that's interesting but it doesn't have a
lock<00:03:38.269> for<00:03:38.510> that<00:03:38.570> all<00:03:39.260> in<00:03:39.440> all<00:03:39.500> I<00:03:39.739> like<00:03:39.769> this

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
system is very cool

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.140

your<00:04:11.780> breasts<00:04:12.050> by<00:04:12.290> any<00:04:12.500> means<00:04:12.740> that's<00:04:13.040> insane

your breasts by any means that's insane

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.030 
your breasts by any means that's insane
and<00:04:13.910> we're<00:04:14.630> lead<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:15.110> not<00:04:15.319> only<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.560> dangerous

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
and we're lead to not only a dangerous

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.420 
and we're lead to not only a dangerous
blaster<00:04:16.579> but<00:04:16.850> it<00:04:17.420> would<00:04:17.570> also<00:04:17.780> just<00:04:18.500> not<00:04:19.100> work

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
blaster but it would also just not work

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.180 
blaster but it would also just not work
very<00:04:19.459> very<00:04:20.060> nice<00:04:20.269> but<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.440> think<00:04:21.890> that<00:04:22.040> it's

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
very very nice but I think that it's

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.760 
very very nice but I think that it's
really<00:04:22.370> cool<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:23.210> like<00:04:23.720> it<00:04:23.750> I'm<00:04:24.110> going<00:04:24.350> to<00:04:24.560> go

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
really cool I like it I'm going to go

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.000 
really cool I like it I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.340> get<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.700> draculina<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.830> show<00:04:27.830> it

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
ahead and get the draculina to show it

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.760 
ahead and get the draculina to show it
in<00:04:28.280> its<00:04:28.810> final<00:04:29.810> form<00:04:30.050> where<00:04:30.350> it's<00:04:30.470> Polster

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
in its final form where it's Polster

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.530 
in its final form where it's Polster
just<00:04:31.640> because<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:31.910> think<00:04:32.030> that'll<00:04:32.510> be

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
just because I think that'll be

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.360 
just because I think that'll be
interesting<00:04:33.200> is<00:04:33.320> a<00:04:33.350> final<00:04:33.800> segment<00:04:34.160> for<00:04:34.280> this

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
interesting is a final segment for this

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.760 
interesting is a final segment for this
video<00:04:34.640> to<00:04:34.730> see<00:04:35.000> it<00:04:35.180> in<00:04:35.390> a<00:04:35.780> full<00:04:35.990> stirred<00:04:36.260> form<00:04:36.620> I

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
video to see it in a full stirred form I

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.620 
video to see it in a full stirred form I
think<00:04:36.800> that'll<00:04:37.340> be<00:04:37.370> cool<00:04:37.640> this<00:04:38.060> is<00:04:38.270> the<00:04:38.390> most

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
think that'll be cool this is the most

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.350 
think that'll be cool this is the most
compact<00:04:39.290> version<00:04:39.890> of<00:04:39.980> it<00:04:40.190> and<00:04:40.400> I<00:04:40.940> feel<00:04:40.970> like<00:04:41.330> a

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
compact version of it and I feel like a

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.790 
compact version of it and I feel like a
lot<00:04:41.540> of<00:04:41.690> people<00:04:41.930> will<00:04:42.020> lose<00:04:42.230> this<00:04:42.440> barrel

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
lot of people will lose this barrel

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.200 
lot of people will lose this barrel
attachment<00:04:43.130> so<00:04:43.520> it's<00:04:43.669> nice<00:04:43.850> that<00:04:43.880> they've

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210

think that it's really really cool and I
think<00:04:53.150> that<00:04:53.419> it<00:04:53.510> does<00:04:53.690> what<00:04:53.870> it's<00:04:53.990> supposed<00:04:54.050> to

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
the draculina decided not to wear a belt

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.659 
the draculina decided not to wear a belt
today<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:17.780> I<00:05:17.810> needed<00:05:18.440> Ian<00:05:18.710> instead<00:05:19.130> you<00:05:19.520> can

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669

today so I needed Ian instead you can
see<00:05:19.850> this<00:05:19.970> is<00:05:20.150> what<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.360> sharp<00:05:20.690> fire<00:05:20.870> looks

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:21.169 
see this is what the sharp fire looks

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:23.170 
see this is what the sharp fire looks
like<00:05:21.380> as<00:05:21.560> its<00:05:21.860> holstered<00:05:22.310> it's<00:05:22.520> super<00:05:22.910> easy<00:05:22.940> to

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
like as its holstered it's super easy to

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.940 
like as its holstered it's super easy to
draw<00:05:23.479> because<00:05:23.690> it<00:05:23.930> comes<00:05:24.140> off<00:05:24.350> pretty<00:05:24.650> easily

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
draw because it comes off pretty easily

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.770 
draw because it comes off pretty easily
I<00:05:25.370> don't<00:05:25.790> know<00:05:25.850> if<00:05:25.940> it's<00:05:26.060> so<00:05:26.270> easy<00:05:26.479> that<00:05:26.600> it

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
I don't know if it's so easy that it

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.350 
I don't know if it's so easy that it
would<00:05:26.870> fall<00:05:27.080> off<00:05:27.110> but<00:05:27.650> it<00:05:28.250> also<00:05:28.580> has<00:05:29.060> built-in

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
would fall off but it also has built-in

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.330 
would fall off but it also has built-in
dart<00:05:29.930> storage<00:05:30.380> which<00:05:30.620> you<00:05:30.770> can<00:05:30.919> see<00:05:31.100> pretty

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340 
dart storage which you can see pretty

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.790 
dart storage which you can see pretty
clearly<00:05:31.460> on<00:05:31.940> the<00:05:32.180> holster<00:05:32.600> holes<00:05:33.169> I<00:05:33.470> want<00:05:33.710> to

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
clearly on the holster holes I want to

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.610 
clearly on the holster holes I want to
say<00:05:33.950> six<00:05:34.310> darts<00:05:34.790> but<00:05:35.210> it's<00:05:35.930> not<00:05:36.440> that

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
say six darts but it's not that

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:38.680 
say six darts but it's not that
complicated<00:05:36.979> to<00:05:37.250> use<00:05:37.430> I<00:05:37.460> did<00:05:37.760> not<00:05:37.940> give<00:05:38.210> Ian<00:05:38.479> a

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
complicated to use I did not give Ian a

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:41.620 
complicated to use I did not give Ian a
preview<00:05:39.110> for<00:05:39.890> it<00:05:40.070> and<00:05:40.370> firing<00:05:41.030> is<00:05:41.210> a<00:05:41.240> breeze

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630 
preview for it and firing is a breeze

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.200 
preview for it and firing is a breeze
I'm<00:05:42.290> pretty<00:05:42.680> sure<00:05:42.890> that<00:05:43.400> it<00:05:43.669> shouldn't<00:05:43.940> be<00:05:44.030> too

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
I'm pretty sure that it shouldn't be too

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.150 
I'm pretty sure that it shouldn't be too
terribly<00:05:44.570> difficult<00:05:44.780> to<00:05:45.140> remove<00:05:45.440> the<00:05:45.710> holster

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
terribly difficult to remove the holster

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.500 
terribly difficult to remove the holster
and<00:05:46.370> then<00:05:47.440> reassemble<00:05:48.440> the<00:05:48.590> blaster<00:05:49.510> other

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:50.510 
and then reassemble the blaster other

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.790 
and then reassemble the blaster other
way<00:05:50.690> it's<00:05:50.990> upside-down

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
way it's upside-down

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.520 
way it's upside-down
there<00:05:52.789> we<00:05:52.880> go<00:05:53.270> and<00:05:53.479> then<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.960> front<00:05:54.260> barrel

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
there we go and then the front barrel

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.700 
there we go and then the front barrel
comes<00:05:54.770> out<00:05:55.330> and<00:05:56.330> that's<00:05:56.960> really<00:05:57.169> all<00:05:57.500> there<00:05:57.650> is

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
comes out and that's really all there is

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.610 
comes out and that's really all there is
to<00:05:58.039> it<00:05:58.190> it's<00:05:58.370> a<00:05:58.520> semi<00:05:59.150> modular<00:05:59.690> blaster<00:06:00.200> that

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
to it it's a semi modular blaster that

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.740 
to it it's a semi modular blaster that
dart<00:06:00.890> storage<00:06:01.280> is<00:06:01.430> not<00:06:01.700> necessarily<00:06:02.510> the<00:06:02.630> best

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:02.750 
dart storage is not necessarily the best

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.360 
dart storage is not necessarily the best
because<00:06:03.050> no<00:06:03.169> matter<00:06:03.350> which<00:06:03.590> way<00:06:03.770> you<00:06:03.830> fold<00:06:04.190> it

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
because no matter which way you fold it

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.629 
because no matter which way you fold it
the<00:06:04.460> darts<00:06:04.700> hanging<00:06:05.060> off<00:06:05.180> the

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
the darts hanging off the

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.969 
the darts hanging off the
and<00:06:06.030> they<00:06:06.270> will<00:06:06.449> fall<00:06:06.749> out<00:06:06.780> pretty<00:06:07.289> easily<00:06:07.530> but

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
and they will fall out pretty easily but

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:10.820 
and they will fall out pretty easily but
it's<00:06:08.430> definitely<00:06:08.639> a<00:06:08.999> cool<00:06:09.389> blaster<00:06:09.990> and<00:06:10.229> at

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
it's definitely a cool blaster and at

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.980 
it's definitely a cool blaster and at
the<00:06:11.039> price<00:06:11.280> it's<00:06:11.669> certainly<00:06:12.270> worth<00:06:12.479> tinkering

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
the price it's certainly worth tinkering

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.689 
the price it's certainly worth tinkering
with<00:06:13.020> and<00:06:13.409> picking<00:06:13.800> up<00:06:13.949> I<00:06:14.129> think<00:06:14.460> that<00:06:14.580> it's

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 
with and picking up I think that it's

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:16.249 
with and picking up I think that it's
neat<00:06:14.909> and<00:06:15.150> like<00:06:15.509> I<00:06:15.629> said<00:06:15.810> it's<00:06:15.960> just<00:06:16.020> an

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
neat and like I said it's just an

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:18.140 
neat and like I said it's just an
excellent<00:06:16.740> candidate<00:06:17.069> for<00:06:17.129> mods<00:06:17.460> and<00:06:17.759> has<00:06:18.120> a

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
excellent candidate for mods and has a

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.659 
excellent candidate for mods and has a
very<00:06:18.419> lock<00:06:18.719> and<00:06:18.930> load<00:06:19.110> esque<00:06:19.379> shell<00:06:19.830> when<00:06:20.430> it

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
very lock and load esque shell when it

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.309 
very lock and load esque shell when it
has<00:06:20.849> none<00:06:21.090> of<00:06:21.120> its<00:06:21.330> attachments<00:06:21.599> on<00:06:22.020> it<00:06:22.169> so

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
has none of its attachments on it so

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.439 
has none of its attachments on it so
even<00:06:22.680> as<00:06:22.770> a<00:06:22.800> standalone<00:06:23.099> single-shot<00:06:23.969> pistol

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
even as a standalone single-shot pistol

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.029 
even as a standalone single-shot pistol
I<00:06:24.599> think<00:06:25.020> that<00:06:25.139> it's<00:06:25.289> cool<00:06:25.529> this<00:06:25.770> we're

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 
I think that it's cool this we're

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:28.129 
I think that it's cool this we're
checking<00:06:26.340> out<00:06:26.610> as<00:06:26.849> always<00:06:27.479> guys<00:06:27.689> thanks<00:06:28.080> for

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
checking out as always guys thanks for

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.860 
checking out as always guys thanks for
watching<00:06:28.229> if<00:06:28.800> you<00:06:29.189> liked<00:06:29.610> this<00:06:29.879> new<00:06:30.240> style<00:06:30.659> of

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870 
watching if you liked this new style of

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.869 
watching if you liked this new style of
footage<00:06:31.169> I<00:06:31.349> am<00:06:31.529> going<00:06:31.800> to<00:06:31.889> buy<00:06:32.039> a<00:06:32.340> head<00:06:32.610> mount

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:32.879 
footage I am going to buy a head mount

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.480 
footage I am going to buy a head mount
for<00:06:33.150> the<00:06:33.210> GoPro<00:06:33.689> but<00:06:34.409> I<00:06:34.650> think<00:06:34.949> that<00:06:35.129> it's<00:06:35.279> much

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
for the GoPro but I think that it's much

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:37.999 
for the GoPro but I think that it's much
higher<00:06:35.849> quality<00:06:36.240> footage<00:06:36.960> and<00:06:37.229> if<00:06:37.680> you<00:06:37.800> liked

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:38.009 
higher quality footage and if you liked

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:39.260 
higher quality footage and if you liked
it<00:06:38.129> please<00:06:38.310> let<00:06:38.580> me<00:06:38.699> know<00:06:38.849> because<00:06:39.029> I

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
it please let me know because I

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.179 
it please let me know because I
obviously<00:06:39.509> still<00:06:40.169> have<00:06:40.319> the<00:06:40.500> video<00:06:40.590> goggles

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:41.189 
obviously still have the video goggles

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:42.980 
obviously still have the video goggles
and<00:06:41.430> I<00:06:41.610> like<00:06:41.789> filming<00:06:42.150> with<00:06:42.270> both<00:06:42.449> of<00:06:42.629> them<00:06:42.779> so

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:42.990 
and I like filming with both of them so

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.629 
and I like filming with both of them so
it's<00:06:43.169> time<00:06:43.439> to<00:06:43.650> weigh<00:06:43.860> in<00:06:43.889> what<00:06:44.310> do<00:06:44.370> you<00:06:44.460> want

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
it's time to weigh in what do you want

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.659 
it's time to weigh in what do you want
on<00:06:44.789> your<00:06:44.819> nerf<00:06:45.240> channel
