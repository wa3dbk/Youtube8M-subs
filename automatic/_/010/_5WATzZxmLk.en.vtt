00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
is Honda moving from the Russian league

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.020 
is Honda moving from the Russian league
over<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.100> Milan<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.640> actually<00:01:41.880> one<00:01:42.000> of

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
over to Milan this is actually one of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.670 
over to Milan this is actually one of
the<00:01:42.119> better<00:01:42.180> transfers<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.140> window<00:01:43.530> and

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the better transfers in this window and

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.859 
the better transfers in this window and
I<00:01:44.430> think<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> fantastic

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
I think it's going to be a fantastic

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.270 
I think it's going to be a fantastic
player<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.320> them<00:01:46.409> one<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> very

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
player for them one that is a very

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.980 
player for them one that is a very
strong<00:01:47.579> player<00:01:47.790> but<00:01:47.970> gets<00:01:48.149> really<00:01:48.570> underused

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
strong player but gets really underused

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.359 
strong player but gets really underused
because<00:01:49.320> he<00:01:49.470> obviously<00:01:49.500> plays<00:01:50.070> out<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
because he obviously plays out the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.980 
because he obviously plays out the
Russian<00:01:50.610> league<00:01:50.759> Russian<00:01:51.360> league<00:01:51.509> isn't<00:01:51.720> as

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
Russian league Russian league isn't as

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.990 
Russian league Russian league isn't as
strong<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.680> sweaty<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.189> used<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.579> so

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
strong and as sweaty as it used to be so

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.789 
strong and as sweaty as it used to be so
he's<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.840> imagine<00:01:55.049> going<00:01:55.470> into<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
he's one that I can imagine going into a

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.850 
he's one that I can imagine going into a
lot<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.610> teams<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:58.049> we<00:01:58.140> go<00:01:58.170> next<00:01:58.560> up<00:01:58.770> we

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
have Matt each obviously moving from

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.679 
have Matt each obviously moving from
benfica<00:02:01.170> over<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.860> Chelsea<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.520> his<00:02:03.390> stats

BPL obviously as BPL card will still be

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.530 
BPL obviously as BPL card will still be
floating<00:02:30.130> around<00:02:30.190> probably<00:02:30.940> will<00:02:31.090> go<00:02:31.240> up<00:02:31.390> in

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
floating around probably will go up in

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.970 
floating around probably will go up in
price<00:02:31.570> and<00:02:31.750> not<00:02:31.960> going<00:02:32.200> to<00:02:32.320> make<00:02:32.410> any<00:02:32.470> sort<00:02:32.890> of

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
price and not going to make any sort of

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.920 
price and not going to make any sort of

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
generalizations on what people's prices

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.450 
generalizations on what people's prices
are<00:02:35.050> going<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.230> go<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.440> because<00:02:35.950> honestly<00:02:36.400> I

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
are going to go to because honestly I

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.220 
are going to go to because honestly I
don't<00:02:36.550> know<00:02:36.820> there<00:02:37.330> are<00:02:37.450> absolutely<00:02:37.870> loads<00:02:38.080> of

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
don't know there are absolutely loads of

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.960 
don't know there are absolutely loads of
him<00:02:38.350> on<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.560> market<00:02:38.890> is<00:02:38.980> Chelsea<00:02:39.400> card<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:39.820> his

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
him on the market is Chelsea card so his

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.150 
him on the market is Chelsea card so his
price<00:02:40.210> may<00:02:40.420> go<00:02:40.570> up<00:02:40.690> a<00:02:40.780> little<00:02:40.960> bit<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:41.770> I<00:02:41.890> can't

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
price may go up a little bit but I can't

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.550 
price may go up a little bit but I can't
imagine<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.610> going<00:02:42.850> up<00:02:43.030> all<00:02:43.240> that<00:02:43.540> much<00:02:43.840> next

actually gone to a team in the j-league
called<00:05:37.320> Cerezo<00:05:37.920> Osaka<00:05:38.240> so<00:05:39.240> he's<00:05:39.480> not<00:05:39.630> in<00:05:39.690> the

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
called Cerezo Osaka so he's not in the

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.180
