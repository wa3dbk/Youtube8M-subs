00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:14.040
 axis fate brain an addiction 

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:15.780
 trivial among these 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.060
 the two brains surely that 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.810
 as nutritional as the brain for 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.890
 running needs some molecules 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:28.950
 it's called the neurotransmitter it derives 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.439
 from so-called essential amino acids ie 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.960
 that we get only from the demolition 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.890
 of proteins in the heavy diet here 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.470
 head that always supplies cursors to the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.190
 brain and if the intestine and supplies them 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.960
 adequately and to his brain 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.160
 it works badly because it is not well 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:53.130
 stocked we see for example that a 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.280
 essential amino acid tryptophan that 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:02.550
 the brain turns serotonin and 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.890
 honeydew one to the bacterial flora of the 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.409
 bunker to demolish by nature 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.590
 skatole and a thorny internecine name 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.020
 the sites from these demolition processes 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.860
 in the other hand we get from the diet 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.440
 histamine is demolished entering the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.790
 brain is used as 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.270
 neurotransmitter other wine at dinner 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.190
 important tyrosine we receive from 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.830
 definition of diet proteins 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.159
 that enters the brain turns into 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.680
 dopamine and noradrenaline channel and one 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.630
 intestinal flora this biotica decamps 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.570
 the overly tiramine that this 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.690
 it even goes to compete with the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.460
 tyrosine to enter the brain 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:50.320
 and since all these amino acids 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.750
 they enter from the same front door 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.570
 the page that Italy will depend on 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.740
 relationship then the diction of one me 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.500
 favored the capture of the brain of the 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.860
 his competitor 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.890
 so we see that if we reduce the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.200
 fano finger and then invited her 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.600
 torino in the brain and this me 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.600
 they cause anxious sat of this 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.020
 reduction evening advantage the tyrosine that 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.620
 between the brain and going to 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.840
 to produce his generation of turin 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.970
 to become more agile shelters 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.220
 strong therefore this is the answer of the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.080
 let it be a positive response to an agent 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.300
 is associated in case of danger 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.569
 anxiety allows me to face up to 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:45.290
 better 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:47.629
 the situation but there are other studies that 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.030
 show how this connection is 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:53.659
 so complex if fully its 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.480
 animal show that after three days 

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:58.159
 the membrane collapses from the head injury 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.769
 intestinal 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:03.469
 we have high official damage 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.409
 structure permeability ie double 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:08.930
 layer co pd of the membrane destinal 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.919
 it has collapsed 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.919
 there is physical damage 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.510
 other studies show that quantity 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:20.689
 lucera that forms in the stomach to 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.669
 alcohol for people often nod serves 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.590
 animal studies 

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:27.019
 depends in a dose dependent manner on 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.230
 amount of agent delighted geno tinetto 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.189
 directly into the animal's brain 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:38.480
 these more electric people give you one 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:41.469
 epileptic dose dependent activities 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.329
 greater dose greater epileptic seizures 

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:47.509
 higher amount of stomach ulcers 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:49.879
 for the same amount of alcohol ingested 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:55.310
 here of which it is highlighted as 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:59.150
 damage to the brain produces damage 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.409
 of the gastro intestinal system 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.310
 clearly our brains 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:06.829
 communicate with each other to direct and 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.310
 this beautiful study demonstrates 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:14.509
 infact that inflaming the intestine 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:16.699
 animal servants with vegetable oil that 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:20.299
 the kroton linden we have in this case 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:23.349
 that the animal at a lower threshold 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:26.180
 mosaic is subjected to the same model 

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:28.370
 experimental of epilepsy produces the 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.400
 greater amount of crisis then 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.880
 produce an intestinal inflammation 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.880
 lower yourself 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.770
 it then goes to the brain introduces a 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:41.330
 damage to the intestinal gas system as well 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:44.080
 as a damage to the final gas system 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.490
 that a brain damage has repercussions 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.540
 evident how important it is to succeed in 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.100
 to understand 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.970
 these mechanisms of these links 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:55.910
 of this dialogue between our ours 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:59.120
 organs that allows us to go to 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.870
 to understand the functioning of ours 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.260
 body 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:07.040
 not at all the systems physics 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.320
 complex teaches us that such systems there 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.420
 relationship between the parties generates 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.820
 new properties that are not understandable 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.910
 thus studying the individual parts there 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:22.000
 they are new properties that can 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:22.000
 open new horizons in medicine
