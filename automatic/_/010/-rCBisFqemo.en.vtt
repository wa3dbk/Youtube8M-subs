00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello in this video I give you 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.290
 tips for nurturing their 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.300
 sick dogs the first thing on her 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.040
 you should pay attention to that after 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.759
 any case for liver and maybe there 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 it should be digestible most of the time 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.000
 protein a protein from the protein in the evening 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.830
 feed recommended in part, but it can 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.990
 also his definite cases that the 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.779
 Veterinarian distributes exactly the opposite 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.090
 So high-protein sforza that should be on 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.420
 clarified each case before feeding 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.210
 Another possibility is also 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.340
 the natrue and phosphate battery lining 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.710
 this should definitely be the case 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.530
 controlled feed and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.539
 if the nato phosphate laundry is too high 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.309
 are 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.680
 Such should be on diet for 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.809
 you can change that with the dog 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.399
 veterinarian or if that is too expensive 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.960
 You can also do that at a zoofachhandel 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.070
 order that it is usually cheaper 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.609
 you have to pay attention in any case 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:07.100
 that there is a lot of drinking here is great 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.540
 important and you came in addition 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.580
 give food supplement to the animal 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.979
 that 's as dripping or as a small one 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.810
 treats 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:20.600
 There are, for example, substitutes such as 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:24.030
 vitamin b fish or omega 3 fatty acids 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.820
 they are also very good and quite 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.920
 important is dry food one should 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.759
 do not suspect that it is very bad 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.470
 and who prefers to mix feed himself 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.920
 Of course, I would like to do that too 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.869
 a small recipe would be there for example 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.150
 by cooking rice or potatoes 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.810
 a bit raw same age 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.689
 to cut 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.060
 that mixes and the whole thing when you are 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.800
 Still wants to go with cooked vegetables and 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.840
 or one 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.110
 stir and you should 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.050
 note that you do not use eggs 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.330
 that you did not use spices and that 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.330
 days whole then spread throughout the day
