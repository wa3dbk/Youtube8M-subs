00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:20.090
 today he is a very enthusiastic engineer of 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:20.090
 the engineering 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:30.890
 and things one of the projects makes 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.440
 a long time is a company a 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.989
 entrepreneurship where does developing 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.350
 video games is great to develop games 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.860
 for mobile devices true for 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.860
 ipad 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.830
 the name because the name is Thursday and 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.610
 it was taken but in fact nothing falls 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:58.160
 wrong the idea of ​​the game was born in January 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.140
 2012 if we made you one in the ying yang 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.570
 of 2012 and where we are 48 hours and 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.640
 was born the idea of ​​making a game where 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.560
 travel the click from one side to the other the 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.840
 ok screen were squares that did not 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.090
 it was nothing difficult about the program and from there 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.270
 was evolving that version I tried it 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.520
 on my ipad 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.740
 and as touching this square 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.050
 besides much more fun and from there 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.630
 it was in the free times with my with 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.640
 my three partners we did several tests and 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.679
 after several months in our 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.170
 free time we had to fine-tune it 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:31.490
 at the end it's in the market and I have the 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.290
 pleasant surprise that right now was the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.130
 number one 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.750
 and just that it's a picture where the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.720
 payment applications in the app store 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.540
 they were on obverse 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.850
 in the store of itunes de peru en light 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.190
 on ipad in Latin America we are in the 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.860
 top ten from several countries and we're 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.880
 pointing so that this Monday and this of 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.670
 world 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.170
 and how much time then lasted since 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.740
 it was devised 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:05.100
 the game until they could put it to 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.100
 the sale 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.330
 in fact the idea was born in January 2012 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.670
 as I told them but there it was and we stopped 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.890
 until in September when we started 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.709
 When we start the company, we take it back 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.360
 of a few and just in the middle of this 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.450
 year we said in this game we have to 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:26.350
 launch the one at a time because there is 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.390
 well and we did several iterations is the 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.010
 long process has been between March of 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.540
 until now and it's been the ends of 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.670
 week that we had free time we have 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.610
 made a lot of levels of designs and 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.470
 we did like 20 visual redesigns the 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.510
 music we also take back the sounds 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.620
 there are a lot of aspects that do not 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.420
 they take into account when a 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.489
 development of games and that took us all 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.620
 that time has not been that we've been 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.100
 24 hours in the game but it has been 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:54.300
 several weeks that we have sacrificed 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:57.060
 and tell me suddenly many boys 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:03.020
 now you can see the experience you 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:05.430
 and also be in all my band 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.290
 point of view what things do you recommend 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.200
 what things have to do that have 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.569
 to study what they have to think about and 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.219
 so study 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.989
 do not necessarily have to go to the 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:17.549
 university to develop games of 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.040
 made everyone has made games 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.780
 video games and if you have fun with such 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.700
 see why a fun game is already 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.620
 has ideas and what is and in fact if 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.450
 see our game our good 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.760
 minimalist the interface are just 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.209
 squares and they are numbers but they are very 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.980
 well designed and what we 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.099
 we focus on our company es engine 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.719
 design or the fact of why I put 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.250
 frogger that has horrible graphics on 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:43.169
 pixels is still still fun 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.790
 then we concentrate on him in the 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.129
 cut because the games are fun 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.159
 beyond the graphics then number 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.530
 one my recommendation is that they start 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.939
 do it ok it does not matter no matter what 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.189
 have simple knowledge of how to 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:58.079
 can see a quick tutorial on how 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.000
 use programs like game maker 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:02.699
 euroconstruct or if they are a little more 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.120
 advanced and unity and that start 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.709
 do what 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.540
 born prototypes games normally 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.980
 they are going to leave but they see everything 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.500
 it involves doing it 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.629
 I do not know anything about programming 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.400
 zombies I got to those who know 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.259
 just know what mechanical thing 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.849
 they work what things do not and my biggest 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.620
 recommendation is that they start doing it 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.080
 It's the one 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.810
 the only way to be good games is 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:27.270
 starting to make new games and it was 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.180
 complicated to do he was complicated 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.790
 let's say think about the game concept 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.160
 you have now it was varying in 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.720
 the time from the beginning and he had 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.580
 in clear of how it was going to be the mechanics 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.310
 how would it work 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.629
 in fact in 2012 it was one of my 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.449
 partners who came up with the idea when 

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:46.949
 I said in the opening talk and 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:48.360
 experiment with new types of controls 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:49.620
 and I told them how much to save so 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.629
 can quickly move the mouse of the 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.550
 screen from one side to the other and as 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:56.340
 just that idea and created two squares 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.050
 and that is very easy to program knows if 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.300
 you click on a square that is wins 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.819
 make the game but if you put that with a 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.460
 timer of how fast you can tap 

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:06.979
 on the screen 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.620
 that was from the beginning you want is to play 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:13.940
 that's a game that challenges your limit of 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:15.590
 your skill to move and touch squares 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.750
 on a screen is his simple mind 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.969
 but it is extremely challenging that you 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.439
 presents is extremely fun 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:25.909
 what is the objective that you have 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:27.979
 now with this game you have a goal 

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:30.349
 defined or are simply looking at 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:32.589
 where do they take them and what happens 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:35.239
 good we have right now we want 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:38.419
 promote or the easiest thing is a game 

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:40.900
 made in Peru which is very fun and 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.570
 which is number one right now 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.180
 we plan to hope to be in the 'top ten' 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.040
 in Latin America on Monday in theory 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.340
 we are launching worldwide 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.960
 then to see how far we say there 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.580
 in fact now the initial version only 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.620
 It has 48 levels but like in 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.840
 rivers are we have quite plans 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.840
 to expand bible or unevenness 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:07.689
 and that in itself see as far as we can 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:12.909
 do get with this version later and 

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:14.589
 from there we see that they are not only two levels 

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:16.360
 and in fact we have several others 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:18.400
 prototypes that we are still by 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:27.400
 fine tune but we can also throw them in 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:29.289
 some months some projects and 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.860
 done we have made more than 20 prototypes 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:35.020
 of games that are there are missing at the end 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.839
 several things but as I said the only 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.460
 good way to start doing good 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:41.050
 games and tuning up is doing 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.990
 prototypes that may not work but 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.430
 it's because they do not work and what safinas 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.490
 until the best so you have it 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.139
 soon final final filled many 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:54.689
 thank you for your time I know you're a 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.689
 little cured and won the news 

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:03.360
 I am going to 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.950
 here they will find the link to the 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.800
 store at least the absurdity of Peru 

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:13.370
 so you can download it I hope that 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.370
 we develop 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.610
 linkin studies 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:30.100
 Thank you 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:30.100
 thank you thank you
