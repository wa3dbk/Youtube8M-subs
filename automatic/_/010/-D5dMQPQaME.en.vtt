00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.280
 Y 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.469
 welcome to all jazz unboxing my 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.960
 name rubÃ©n and I come to present you 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.189
 frisbee ras a game for the category 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.509
 the game of the week 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.490
 good as you can see is a category 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.590
 new that I just founded in jazz 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.989
 unboxing that I think is quite adequate 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.520
 a category that is going to be which of the 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:29.919
 week obviously as his own name 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.259
 indicates then every week I go to 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.020
 bring a game that I like that I 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.520
 call attention that I find curious not 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.440
 I want to bring the usual games to 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.079
 the famous ones of always and all the 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.570
 French as they come out like ni for speed 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.250
 I do not rule out that someday even 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.900
 I can do some analysis of these 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.300
 games because simply because I 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.740
 look like I do not know who wants to highlight something 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.630
 about those games and so on then yes 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.040
 he may do it but as a general rule 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.810
 is what I want to do is bring games 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.910
 that is more likely that you do not know 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.470
 so they know new games with the 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.450
 I can play with your classmates 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.700
 our friends a holiday games 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.040
 entertaining is worth how good that is not 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.689
 you know and that can be useful today in 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.880
 concrete I come to present a frisbee 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.380
 rush and this game is not only played 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.700
 with your android phone or with 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.940
 your tablet but also 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.950
 you will need 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.290
 computer on your computer 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.940
 your home pc imagine that you are 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.670
 some day with colleagues you are one 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.650
 meeting with several friends and good not 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.270
 you have a wii to put it so to speak 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.850
 not what is typical that can be done 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.410
 play games like the bus also from 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.940
 playstation or games so they are very 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.830
 entertained to play with colleagues 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.610
 Well, this game can be taken from a 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.280
 I just need a PC 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.320
 and some telephones all connected to the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.300
 same network that that nowadays because it 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.130
 does very often and using the game 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.410
 frisbee rush 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.360
 as you can see what nothing else to enter 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.150
 to the game what a direction tells you 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.010
 of a web and below, then a code a 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.660
 code simply to connect what 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.520
 what you have to do is turn on the pc 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.080
 you put members of the screen to 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.729
 all those who want to play you can 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.170
 play up to three people at a time and 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.820
 nothing nothing you just have to 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.860
 install the game directly on 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.570
 your android phone each in the 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.399
 yours because let's say your phone 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.190
 will be the command once you have it 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.560
 Of course, free of charge 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.570
 nothing and you enter the attack and the 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.760
 web page then simply among all 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.810
 you can connect all the players that 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.180
 I want to tell you that you can play 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.489
 up to three people at a time and take one 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.860
 game to a game that is very similar 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:29.260
 the style of play that the wii has 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.760
 simply because you have to throw I 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.520
 seen many games of the wii or the 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.200
 wii that are similar as one that are 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.000
 like ninjas that advancing stars 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.250
 Well I'm like it's worth but they're 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.230
 frisbee are new discs that you go 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.780
 throwing you and you have to kill 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.640
 some monsters and in short 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.860
 and the one with the most gas points, you win in 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.660
 order is a game that can be very silly 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.980
 but at the same time it can be very fun if 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.780
 play with some colleagues while you take 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.670
 a few reeds the truth so nothing to 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.380
 below I leave you with a video for 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.060
 that you see how a small one plays 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.610
 example of the game and well I hope that you 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.470
 like good once we're here 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.660
 we are already in the computer we have 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.160
 obviously already the application opened in 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.020
 our android devices with the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.400
 that we are going to play increase our 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.170
 browser in this case to enter 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.880
 mozilla firefox because although they are 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.680
 uses the google chrome I've had 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.120
 some problems to put it there but 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.950
 well other times yes I got 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.420
 use it so well maybe it's that 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.310
 you see if you have problems or 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.750
 simply use in your browser 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.170
 We go directly to the web of 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.670
 ciudad.com and a mixture sedano to the web 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.650
 simply because we will have to do 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:35.840
 click full 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.370
 and that sometimes you can not ask for a 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.740
 add-on install a plug-in 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.990
 installed without problems because it is a 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.940
 plugin that may be necessary for 40 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.640
 villages so in case you see that 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:55.400
 does not work or is it asking permission to 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:57.739
 be a plugin to install we are 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.080
 working well we have to see when 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.580
 I will come up with play in this case will take 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.950
 one hour you already know that you are several 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.080
 people installing each one in their 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.450
 good android phone to be able to play 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.290
 two or three people open in this case 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:16.260
 we are going to give it to some and in arcade mode 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.260
 I open my game and the phone here 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.300
 and it was to try 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:33.960
 and good to aim is very simple 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.349
 we have to release the disc simply 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.030
 as well as you can see you can throw if 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:41.129
 the phone is flatter by the 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.659
 practically straight line walls yes 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.099
 you want to point down because you have 

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:45.599
 that tilt the phone came down with the 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.490
 accelerometer you can see how I just 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.050
 give any of the norias and the norias 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.580
 they allow us to stop the time or 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.870
 rather to slow down the time to 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.060
 that is slower and says easier 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.639
 you can hit the monsters worth 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.710
 also I could point so much towards 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.690
 down as well as up without tilting the 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.460
 phone up already you can see how 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.500
 the disks come up and towards 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.629
 down above you already know that and you go 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.310
 pointing out another way to shoot is 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:09.690
 doing this gesture can continue to do 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.270
 this gesture you can see that also the 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.250
 discs are fired although I see a 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.870
 little more complicated to aim like this already 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.969
 I say that good that can be done is 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:19.500
 how to play the wii and practically but 

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:21.629
 it's more complicated I see easier 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.360
 doing so will be releasing the discs 

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:27.000
 and you are pointing to the different 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.600
 monsters and others and good the truth is 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.960
 that the game is entertaining I can sure 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:35.330
 One day they are at home that is with 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.980
 friends and is playing and well no 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.840
 you have nothing for example a winter 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.940
 had to play this game the truth 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.320
 is that very entertaining and now safe 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.120
 that will make you spend very good times 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.860
 and nothing with this has been the game of this 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.510
 week you know that from now 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.310
 I will try the whole week to bring a 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.140
 I play like this in this style that is cool 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.910
 that is fun that is different and 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:54.170
 that is not always the same the truth is 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.760
 that I'm surprised that this game does not 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:58.580
 know people because despite doing 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.900
 something that good is nothing super either 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.000
 special but it is something new 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.560
 something that is not usually seen in android and 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.690
 good to use the phone as well as 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.210
 command and such and play with the computer I 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.620
 it seems like something practical fun and that 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.940
 well I tell you that if you do not have a 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.110
 console at a given moment with about 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.900
 colleagues always at someone's house 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.550
 you have a pc, a laptop and a phone 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:18.050
 with android that is always at hand 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.600
 so well then you can take a 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.520
 game and have a good time and I tell you 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.020
 this category I'm going to try all 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.960
 the weeks then put a game like this 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.310
 fun I hope you like it to be 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.260
 of utility and that especially to be 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.610
