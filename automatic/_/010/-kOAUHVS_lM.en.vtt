00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hi people even from the negative pronoun blog and 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 today I'll talk about some sites 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.200
 cool for you learned to turbine your 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.200
 English 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.560
 first of all you are in perceiving 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.670
 that this site they do not have the teaching 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.010
 linear 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.619
 then it is not the mold of a course of 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.530
 English for example is more to give 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.210
 ruan in your english to you turbinaria 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.390
 in a different way for you 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.640
 learn different things and before 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.379
 anything like that to you define 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.510
 exactly what you need to be 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.180
 legend without understanding why you are 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.370
 learning English without stopping and realize 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.769
 which led to learning English if 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.199
 Are you going to take a proficiency test? 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.470
 if you want to learn to travel if 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.650
 You'll learn just by learning. 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.269
 This can happen, it 's normal and I finally 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.820
 You'll have to identify the reason. 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.129
 for you in English and then you will 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.680
 finding other ways other sites 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.059
 other engineering so to speak 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.250
 you learn English 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.640
 I'll let some websites are five 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.640
 sites for you to learn and each one 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.619
 It has its peculiarity so I'm going to talk 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.939
 a little bit of the site I will say because I 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.320
 think cool and finally there are no way to 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.329
 if you learn English 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.939
 I already made another video or leaving 

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.039
 here is this 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.659
 the first site I speak the live moka 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.240
 which is a site that has a methodology 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.960
 may not look like it but it has a 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.289
 methodology and methodology of 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.679
 and is not the coolest part of this site 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:45.369
 What moves me the most delicious this site 

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:47.500
 that you can deal with other people and 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.079
 there is no such possibility of 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.450
 make a change in what happens to you 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.399
 Teach Portuguese if you know well. 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.140
 Portuguese you learn another 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.829
 Language then is not only in English you 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.109
 Can you learn German Spanish English? 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:05.499
 finally you can learn several things is 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.479
 practically a barter is this is the part 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:11.800
 cool because you'll deal with 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.630
 people who are native speakers and you 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.370
 will be able to learn things they use 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.370
 daily then it will not be that 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.380
 as I said in the other video of a 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.350
 English you do not use will you 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.440
 to perceive with 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.330
 I think they are using email as talking 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.820
 with someone like being between the 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.770
 sky in pine will have many things 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.350
 cool things you can learn 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.330
 there is the possibility of paying this 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.430
 But I do not think I'm the best. 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.070
 thing I do not think is a requirement 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.860
 because the cooler part is free 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.190
 You change like I said you do these things. 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.950
 dog with this learning exchange in her 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.230
 if you teach one thing learned another and it's the 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.120
 really cool part of the site 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.310
 the other site that I think is very cool I 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.810
 i disappointed dalton which is a dictionary 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.730
 online 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.620
 only when many people start to 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.920
 learn english has that is that 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.020
 need to translate the words you 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.890
 You do not need to translate the word you have. 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.880
 understand the context then what I 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.190
 directs what I say to my students 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.120
 usually with the permit holder in 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.890
 English English 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.500
 and this site is an English dictionary 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.530
 because you end up understanding the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:24.170
 meaning certain word would you 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.390
 ends up learning other words and beyond 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.730
 addition to websites and an entire dictionary 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.700
 day has a new word you never 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.130
 imagined that there would be 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.040
 articles about words you can 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.870
 to use as a machuca chuchu is to 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.540
 difference between them 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.460
 or something I know you never 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.990
 imagined they could use they make a 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.330
 very cool article 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.270
 is there an app I always use 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.700
 every day at 8 o'clock tomorrow appears there 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.890
 I always read the day's lecture and it's a 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.960
 The way you have a different contact 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.400
 With the language you end up learning from 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.310
 another way 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.290
 I think the other site is pretty cool and so 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.290
 Do you speak English? 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.050
 intermediary is a site that will bring 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.570
 many benefits that is a bbc site 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.900
 which is a part of the Haitians said in 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:17.450
 truth that is love or snack that is a 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.270
 site that has several articles every day has 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.730
 a new article and have several sessions 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.840
 that you learn from what you know 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.180
 need to learn something 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.419
 knows before the tire another they have 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.470
 texts have videos is not a way of 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:36.680
 always in very good English is English 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:40.630
 not American English but they give a 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.610
 very cool support so there are tips 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.340
 there is this part of this session that you 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.430
 learn English and website tips 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.440
 very good especially if you 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.150
 is at intermediate level 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.340
 if you do not have a boat you do not have 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.020
 problem you accessed searched to 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.900
 research what you want by holding 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.840
 seriously there is no problem but she 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:06.590
 it's more pro- intermediate 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:08.840
 internet and low intermediate does not know 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.630
 nothing too advanced but it is not 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.490
 nothing so basic so the site one 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.070
 A little different that I saw is the sock. 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.360
 moral that he uses a technique of 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.610
 memorization 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.600
 then there are pre-ready courses of 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.460
 specific words of sentence texts 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.340
 finally you can create your own 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.340
 course so it's a different way 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.150
 to learn you end up memorizing your 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.830
 way 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:36.560
 if you can really create your own 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.190
 own course you will adapt some 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.960
 things for you it seems different it seems 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.450
 Strange but once you access the 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.110
 website you will understand much better by 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.990
 talking is a technique that I imagine 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.600
 not everyone will be able to learn well 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.210
 finally there are methodologies and 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.790
 methodologies like I told you more 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.560
 it's a cool site so depending on the 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.350
 thing depending on what you want 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.960
 learning will be worth it 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.910
 it's worth you to enter and access and 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.600
 last and not least she speaks 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.460
 from my favorite site that the link stream 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.620
 twitter attai the actor had she talked to 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.380
 what about it in the video comments 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:21.080
 I spoke earlier about tips in English 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.060
 and this is the site with the very use the use 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.320
 much to me as to my 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.660
 students so you practice the rating 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.490
 of cp art with your trash there you part 

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.560
 with your item because I know I read the 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:38.060
 letter that I could adapt something there 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:39.979
 and hear and finally the site is kind of a 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.349
 itu's format 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.430
 you look for the video you look for music 

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:46.529
 that you want 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:48.629
 and you access there are four thousand 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:52.649
 if I do not mistake intermediate middleman 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:54.929
 and advanced and expert something you and 

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:56.669
 you go choose your level and you 

00:06:54.929 --> 00:06:59.939
 will you listen to music you have to complete 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:02.249
 with the words of the song then it is 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.949
 fun you end up learning from a 

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:06.929
 form a very cool way like 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.459
 I say is not a methodology that all 

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:10.609
 world will love that everyone will 

00:07:08.459 --> 00:07:13.799
 fall in love but it's a way of you 

00:07:10.609 --> 00:07:16.229
 to learn and which are the sites that 

00:07:13.799 --> 00:07:19.679
 you usually accelerate what you guys 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:22.349
 Do you learn English everyday? 

00:07:19.679 --> 00:07:24.389
 usually access from January.com which is 

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:27.209
 a cool site I said to 

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:29.849
 You now and this is the marketing I 

00:07:27.209 --> 00:07:32.789
 I always go in because music lives people 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:35.609
 there is no other way to describe 

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:37.229
 music then it 's these people I hope 

00:07:35.609 --> 00:07:38.879
 did you like the video do not 

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:42.029
 forget to sign up for one channel 

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:46.339
 and following the social networks until the 

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:46.339
 next video a kiss and bye
