00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
should cut it that right underneath a

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.749 
should cut it that right underneath a
little<00:00:29.939> bit<00:00:30.029> under<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.390> soil<00:00:31.759> where

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
okay so I cut the other celery and I

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.250 
okay so I cut the other celery and I
found<00:02:27.350> something<00:02:27.650> kind<00:02:27.950> of<00:02:28.010> interesting<00:02:28.700> I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
found something kind of interesting I

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.940 
found something kind of interesting I
thought<00:02:30.260> it<00:02:30.410> was<00:02:30.560> just<00:02:30.860> one<00:02:32.470> bunch<00:02:33.470> of<00:02:33.650> celery

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
thought it was just one bunch of celery

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.720 
thought it was just one bunch of celery
but<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.400> looks<00:02:34.550> like<00:02:34.700> there<00:02:34.880> were<00:02:34.940> two<00:02:36.730> real

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
but it looks like there were two real

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.010 
but it looks like there were two real
close<00:02:38.000> together<00:02:38.420> so<00:02:40.690> here's<00:02:41.690> what<00:02:41.900> the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
close together so here's what the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.360 
close together so here's what the
summary<00:02:42.350> looks<00:02:42.560> like

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
summary looks like

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.140 
summary looks like
there's<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.180> first<00:02:45.390> one<00:02:45.569> right<00:02:46.170> here<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:47.150> was

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
there's the first one right here I was

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.369 
there's the first one right here I was
wrapped<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.920> brown<00:02:49.920> paper<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:51.379> then

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
wrapped in the brown paper and then

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.699 
wrapped in the brown paper and then
here's<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.739> one<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:53.010> just<00:02:53.099> picked<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.530> it<00:02:55.530> was

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
here's the one I just picked and it was

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.130 
here's the one I just picked and it was
two<00:02:55.950> of<00:02:55.980> them<00:02:57.140> got<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.200> smaller<00:02:58.650> one<00:03:00.140> that

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
two of them got a smaller one that

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:13.009 
two of them got a smaller one that
perfect<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:11.340> let's<00:03:11.610> just<00:03:12.090> right<00:03:12.569> up<00:03:12.720> against

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
perfect and let's just right up against

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.580 
perfect and let's just right up against
this<00:03:13.290> one<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:15.090> one's<00:03:15.390> really<00:03:15.810> good<00:03:16.080> too

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
this one this one's really good too

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.830 
this one this one's really good too
so<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:17.670> doesn't<00:03:17.940> matter<00:03:18.060> whether<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.480> people

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
so it doesn't matter whether you people

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.420 
so it doesn't matter whether you people
use<00:03:18.989> paper<00:03:19.260> bag<00:03:19.530> or<00:03:19.890> newspaper<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:21.420> blanching

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
use paper bag or newspaper the blanching

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.309 
use paper bag or newspaper the blanching
and<00:03:23.430> I<00:03:23.489> think<00:03:23.730> just<00:03:24.329> these<00:03:24.510> two<00:03:24.810> celery<00:03:25.260> is

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
and I think just these two celery is

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.100 
and I think just these two celery is
going<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.590> enough<00:03:25.860> right<00:03:26.099> now<00:03:26.989> and<00:03:27.989> I'm

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
going to be enough right now and I'm

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.400 
going to be enough right now and I'm
going<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.319> wash<00:03:28.500> them<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.900> eat<00:03:30.900> some<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.290> it
