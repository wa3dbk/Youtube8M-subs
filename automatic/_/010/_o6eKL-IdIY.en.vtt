easily<00:00:59.740> absorbed<00:01:00.220> by<00:01:00.250> our<00:01:00.340> bodies<00:01:00.730> so<00:01:01.240> that's

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
easily absorbed by our bodies so that's

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.060

garden try a window box and if that
doesn't<00:02:27.689> work<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.230> use<00:02:28.709> dried<00:02:28.950> oregano<00:02:29.220> it's

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
doesn't work just use dried oregano it's

doesn't work just use dried oregano it's
very<00:02:29.909> tasty

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
very tasty

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:38.240 
very tasty
now<00:02:31.409> a<00:02:31.769> few<00:02:32.159> grinds<00:02:32.659> of<00:02:33.659> black<00:02:34.470> pepper<00:02:37.069> just<00:02:38.069> a

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
now a few grinds of black pepper just a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.420 
now a few grinds of black pepper just a
little<00:02:38.700> salt<00:02:39.329> to<00:02:39.420> help<00:02:39.540> dehydrate<00:02:40.430> the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
little salt to help dehydrate the

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.059 
little salt to help dehydrate the
tomatoes<00:02:42.060> boost<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.049> flavors<00:02:43.439> just<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.769> little

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
tomatoes boost the flavors just a little

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.690 
tomatoes boost the flavors just a little
and<00:02:44.659> finally<00:02:45.659> four<00:02:46.530> tray<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.950> size<00:02:47.190> I<00:02:47.220> use

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
and finally four tray the size I use

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.619 
and finally four tray the size I use
about<00:02:48.569> three<00:02:49.440> three<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.549> four<00:02:50.790> tablespoons<00:02:51.060> of

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
about three three to four tablespoons of

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.309 
about three three to four tablespoons of
olive<00:02:51.840> oil<00:02:52.109> but<00:02:52.950> I<00:02:53.099> drizzle<00:02:53.549> lightly<00:02:54.049> over<00:02:55.049> the

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
olive oil but I drizzle lightly over the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:05.400 
olive oil but I drizzle lightly over the
tomatoes

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.300 

now<00:03:06.040> I<00:03:06.070> guess<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.520> cream<00:03:07.020> shake<00:03:08.070> make<00:03:09.070> sure

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
now I guess the cream shake make sure

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.690 
now I guess the cream shake make sure
everything<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:09.820> nicely<00:03:10.090> combined<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.700> then

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
everything is nicely combined and then

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.830 
everything is nicely combined and then
off<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:13.000> goes<00:03:13.120> in<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.450> oven<00:03:15.000> for<00:03:16.000> depending

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
off it goes in the oven for depending

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.990 
off it goes in the oven for depending
how<00:03:17.080> what<00:03:17.500> temperature<00:03:17.890> you<00:03:18.010> set<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.340> at<00:03:18.490> for

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
how what temperature you set it at for

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.780 
how what temperature you set it at for
about<00:03:19.180> two<00:03:19.480> or<00:03:19.510> three<00:03:19.810> hours<00:03:20.250> now<00:03:21.250> we'll<00:03:21.610> fly

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
about two or three hours now we'll fly

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.780 
about two or three hours now we'll fly
this<00:03:21.850> in<00:03:22.150> the<00:03:22.240> preheated<00:03:22.570> oven<00:03:22.870> preheated<00:03:23.830> 220

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
this in the preheated oven preheated 220

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.700 
this in the preheated oven preheated 220
Celsius<00:03:25.690> or<00:03:26.250> 250,000<00:03:27.250> ight<00:03:27.430> and<00:03:31.620> when<00:03:32.620> you

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
Celsius or 250,000 ight and when you

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.580 
Celsius or 250,000 ight and when you
close<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:32.980> Jam<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.120> door<00:03:34.150> slightly<00:03:34.780> open<00:03:35.020> with

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
close it Jam the door slightly open with

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.520 
close it Jam the door slightly open with
something<00:03:35.800> like<00:03:36.040> a<00:03:36.070> cork<00:03:36.490> or<00:03:36.670> a<00:03:36.730> cooking<00:03:37.060> spoon

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
something like a cork or a cooking spoon

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.470 
something like a cork or a cooking spoon
so<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.920> moisture<00:03:39.790> from<00:03:39.910> the<00:03:40.000> tomatoes

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
so that the moisture from the tomatoes

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.600 
so that the moisture from the tomatoes
can<00:03:40.720> evaporate<00:03:40.900> leave<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.010> in<00:03:42.130> there<00:03:42.280> for<00:03:42.310> two

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
can evaporate leave it in there for two

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.190 
can evaporate leave it in there for two
to<00:03:42.640> three<00:03:42.820> hours<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.480> keep<00:03:43.660> checking<00:03:43.840> to<00:03:44.080> make

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
to three hours to keep checking to make

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.960 
to three hours to keep checking to make
sure<00:03:44.350> that<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:44.950> tomatoes<00:03:45.400> it's<00:03:45.580> hydrating

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
sure that the tomatoes it's hydrating

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.480 
sure that the tomatoes it's hydrating
nicely<00:03:46.540> and<00:03:46.750> basically<00:03:47.560> just<00:03:47.920> dehydrate<00:03:48.400> them

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
nicely and basically just dehydrate them

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.820 
nicely and basically just dehydrate them
to<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.730> point<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.060> you'd<00:03:49.210> like<00:03:49.360> you<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.690> be

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
to the point that you'd like you to be

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:58.740 
to the point that you'd like you to be
my<00:03:50.830> first<00:03:50.950> mantas<00:03:51.370> finish<00:03:51.730> roasting<00:03:57.750> they

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
my first mantas finish roasting they

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.450 
my first mantas finish roasting they
shrivel<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.200> about<00:03:59.500> a<00:03:59.530> third<00:03:59.890> of<00:04:00.070> their<00:04:00.220> size

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
shrivel to about a third of their size

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.020 
shrivel to about a third of their size
that<00:04:00.880> they've<00:04:01.030> tripled<00:04:01.570> in<00:04:01.900> flavor<00:04:02.910> once<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
that they've tripled in flavor once the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.640 
that they've tripled in flavor once the
tomatoes<00:04:04.180> have<00:04:04.540> cooled<00:04:04.900> for<00:04:05.140> a<00:04:05.170> few<00:04:05.350> minutes

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
tomatoes have cooled for a few minutes

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.560 
tomatoes have cooled for a few minutes
you<00:04:06.190> can<00:04:06.220> start<00:04:06.430> transferring<00:04:07.000> them<00:04:07.210> into<00:04:07.300> it

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:07.570 
you can start transferring them into it

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.350 
you can start transferring them into it
an<00:04:07.780> empty<00:04:08.410> jam<00:04:08.680> jar<00:04:09.070> make<00:04:09.610> sure<00:04:09.820> it's<00:04:10.000> well

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
an empty jam jar make sure it's well
