some<00:03:22.770> reason<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.130> project<00:03:23.520> called<00:03:23.730> for<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.910> 6

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
some reason the project called for a 6

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.990 
some reason the project called for a 6
by<00:03:24.390> 4<00:03:24.450> by<00:03:24.930> 2<00:03:24.990> project<00:03:25.830> box<00:03:26.070> but<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.760> seemed

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
by 4 by 2 project box but this seemed

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.210 
by 4 by 2 project box but this seemed
kind<00:03:27.240> of<00:03:27.330> large<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:27.960> I<00:03:27.990> located<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.560> smaller<00:03:28.920> box

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
kind of large so I located a smaller box

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.520 
kind of large so I located a smaller box
that<00:03:29.550> fit<00:03:29.910> better<00:03:30.180> for<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.480> project<00:03:30.990> now

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
that fit better for this project now

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.080 
that fit better for this project now
