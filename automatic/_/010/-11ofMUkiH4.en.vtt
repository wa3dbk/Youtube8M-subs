00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you let go of the tension wrench it'll

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.260 
you let go of the tension wrench it'll
click<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:14.340> will<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.700> same<00:01:14.880> thing

the cuts of the key if you will and

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.310 
the cuts of the key if you will and
let's<00:02:22.070> see<00:02:22.220> if<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.370> can<00:02:22.550> demonstrate<00:02:22.670> this<00:02:23.320> if

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
let's see if I can demonstrate this if

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.840 
let's see if I can demonstrate this if
you<00:02:24.410> look<00:02:24.620> here<00:02:24.890> you'll<00:02:25.070> see<00:02:25.310> how<00:02:25.550> there's<00:02:25.760> a

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
you look here you'll see how there's a

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.340 
you look here you'll see how there's a
spacing<00:02:26.920> between<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.220> end<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:29.080> these<00:02:30.080> each

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
spacing between the end and these each

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.980 
spacing between the end and these each
of<00:02:30.380> these<00:02:30.530> rods<00:02:30.890> here<00:02:31.250> it's<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.150> little<00:02:32.480> spacing

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
of these rods here it's a little spacing

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.260 
of these rods here it's a little spacing

key so when you lock that down these

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.650 
key so when you lock that down these
