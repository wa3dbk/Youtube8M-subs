00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:09.420 

I<00:00:03.600> got<00:00:04.600> the<00:00:04.979> crankshaft<00:00:05.979> out<00:00:06.550> my<00:00:06.970> 4.3<00:00:08.430> that's

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.430 
I got the crankshaft out my 4.3 that's

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:17.370 
I got the crankshaft out my 4.3 that's
the<00:00:09.820> timing<00:00:10.570> chain<00:00:10.600> there<00:00:12.449> I<00:00:15.480> would<00:00:16.480> initially

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
the timing chain there I would initially

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.720 
the timing chain there I would initially
was<00:00:17.529> just<00:00:17.710> gonna<00:00:18.390> do<00:00:19.390> bearings<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:23.730> piston

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
was just gonna do bearings and piston

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:32.819 
was just gonna do bearings and piston
rings<00:00:24.970> but<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:26.560> crankshaft<00:00:29.609> its<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:32.439> needs<00:00:32.650> to

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
rings but the crankshaft its it needs to

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.410 
rings but the crankshaft its it needs to
be<00:00:32.980> turned<00:00:33.540> these<00:00:34.540> bearings<00:00:35.230> are<00:00:36.420> really

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
be turned these bearings are really

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.760 
be turned these bearings are really
chewed<00:00:37.750> up<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:42.090> I'm<00:00:43.090> gonna<00:00:43.360> put<00:00:43.690> I'm<00:00:44.500> gonna

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
chewed up and I'm gonna put I'm gonna

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.350 
chewed up and I'm gonna put I'm gonna
have<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.190> crankshaft<00:00:45.580> turned<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.910> piston

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 
have the crankshaft turned the piston

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.650 
have the crankshaft turned the piston
rings<00:00:49.600> really<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:52.030> didn't<00:00:52.270> look<00:00:52.330> too<00:00:52.600> bad

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.210 

you<00:00:58.660> know<00:00:58.870> but<00:00:59.380> I'm<00:00:59.620> gonna<00:00:59.740> go<00:00:59.800> ahead<00:00:59.920> and<00:01:00.070> do

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
you know but I'm gonna go ahead and do

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.070 
you know but I'm gonna go ahead and do
rings<00:01:00.490> anyway<00:01:00.850> since<00:01:01.210> I<00:01:01.300> got<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.570> motor<00:01:01.750> tore

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.080 
rings anyway since I got the motor tore

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.779 
rings anyway since I got the motor tore
apart<00:01:03.449> here's<00:01:04.449> a<00:01:04.509> look<00:01:04.720> at<00:01:04.869> a<00:01:04.930> v6<00:01:05.969> 4.3

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:08.789 
apart here's a look at a v6 4.3

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:11.599 
apart here's a look at a v6 4.3
crankshaft<00:01:09.789> I'm<00:01:10.359> gonna<00:01:10.719> have<00:01:10.929> it<00:01:11.079> turned

00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:11.609 
crankshaft I'm gonna have it turned

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:17.880 
crankshaft I'm gonna have it turned
that's<00:01:12.609> nice<00:01:12.939> and<00:01:13.240> smooth<00:01:14.579> that<00:01:15.579> rod

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
that's nice and smooth that rod

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.740 
that's nice and smooth that rod
these<00:01:18.490> rod<00:01:18.820> bearings<00:01:19.360> here<00:01:19.720> this<00:01:20.650> one's<00:01:20.890> rough

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
these rod bearings here this one's rough

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.040 
these rod bearings here this one's rough
can<00:01:22.750> feel<00:01:23.080> it

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
can feel it

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:28.980 
can feel it
that<00:01:26.050> one's<00:01:26.260> rough<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:28.180> one's<00:01:28.390> rough<00:01:28.690> that

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
that one's rough that one's rough that

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.640 
that one's rough that one's rough that
one's<00:01:29.200> rough

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
one's rough

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.300 
one's rough
that<00:01:29.800> one's<00:01:29.979> smooth<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:32.409> one's<00:01:32.710> smooth<00:01:33.010> that

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
that one's smooth that one's smooth that

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.469 
that one's smooth that one's smooth that
one's<00:01:33.520> really<00:01:34.450> gone<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:36.550> that<00:01:36.729> main<00:01:36.970> bearing

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
one's really gone and that main bearing

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.219 
one's really gone and that main bearing
there<00:01:37.750> is<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:38.410> smooth<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:43.600> can<00:01:43.780> see<00:01:44.020> these

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
there is is smooth but you can see these

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.100 
there is is smooth but you can see these
main<00:01:44.530> bearings<00:01:45.100> there<00:01:45.369> just<00:01:45.780> look<00:01:46.780> at<00:01:46.900> that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
main bearings there just look at that

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:54.930 
main bearings there just look at that
it's<00:01:47.380> it's<00:01:48.159> been<00:01:48.400> actually<00:01:49.210> split<00:01:49.630> into<00:01:53.940> the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
it's it's been actually split into the

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.469 
it's it's been actually split into the
bearing<00:01:55.390> is<00:01:55.539> just<00:01:56.970> really<00:01:57.970> I<00:01:58.000> could<00:01:58.240> probably

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
bearing is just really I could probably

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.710 
bearing is just really I could probably
break<00:01:58.810> that<00:01:59.080> into<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.680> with<00:01:59.800> my<00:02:00.509> fingers<00:02:02.580> so<00:02:03.720> it

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
break that into it with my fingers so it

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.999 
break that into it with my fingers so it
scratched<00:02:05.259> the<00:02:06.929> crankshaft<00:02:07.929> so<00:02:08.649> I'm<00:02:08.830> gonna

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
scratched the crankshaft so I'm gonna

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.050 
scratched the crankshaft so I'm gonna
have<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.459> have<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.330> turned<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:10.959> think<00:02:11.230> it's

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
have to have that turned I think it's

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.880 
have to have that turned I think it's
hopefully<00:02:13.060> gonna<00:02:13.300> cost<00:02:13.510> me<00:02:13.750> about<00:02:13.780> no<00:02:14.650> more

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
hopefully gonna cost me about no more

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.670 
hopefully gonna cost me about no more
than<00:02:15.160> 75<00:02:16.150> or<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> hundred<00:02:16.720> dollars<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.320> may<00:02:17.530> even

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
than 75 or a hundred dollars I may even

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.070 
than 75 or a hundred dollars I may even
try<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.130> see<00:02:18.670> if<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.880> can<00:02:19.060> trade<00:02:19.360> one<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.900> these

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
try to see if I can trade one of these

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.759 
try to see if I can trade one of these
in<00:02:20.580> just<00:02:21.580> buy<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:22.049> refurbished<00:02:23.049> one<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.440> maybe

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
in just buy a refurbished one and maybe

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.060 
in just buy a refurbished one and maybe
get<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.040> core<00:02:24.310> charge<00:02:24.610> on<00:02:24.850> this
