00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
all once we put the mixture in the pan

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.300 
all once we put the mixture in the pan
we've<00:04:11.970> just<00:04:12.150> left<00:04:12.330> it<00:04:12.629> to<00:04:12.959> settle<00:04:13.680> see<00:04:14.250> all

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
we've just left it to settle see all

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.490 
we've just left it to settle see all
these<00:04:14.400> old<00:04:14.549> bubbles<00:04:14.940> coming<00:04:15.209> up<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:16.290> what

these old bubbles coming up and what
we're<00:04:16.650> looking<00:04:16.739> for<00:04:16.919> is<00:04:17.310> when<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.579> shake<00:04:17.850> it

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
we're looking for is when you shake it

we're looking for is when you shake it
you<00:04:18.389> can<00:04:18.570> see<00:04:18.750> most<00:04:19.109> of<00:04:19.380> that<00:04:20.269> liquid<00:04:21.269> has<00:04:21.299> now

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
you can see most of that liquid has now

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:27.650 
you can see most of that liquid has now
set<00:04:22.109> so<00:04:23.419> just<00:04:24.419> need<00:04:24.600> a<00:04:24.930> little<00:04:26.360> moment<00:04:27.360> longer

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
set so just need a little moment longer

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.439 
set so just need a little moment longer
what<00:04:28.199> should<00:04:28.350> happen<00:04:28.500> is<00:04:29.030> once<00:04:30.030> um<00:04:30.210> it's<00:04:30.389> just

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
what should happen is once um it's just

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.510 
what should happen is once um it's just
set<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.199> you're<00:04:31.320> gonna<00:04:31.410> shake<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:31.889> pan<00:04:32.130> and

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
set and you're gonna shake the pan and

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.580 
set and you're gonna shake the pan and
then<00:04:32.699> it<00:04:33.180> will<00:04:33.300> begin<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.720> lift<00:04:33.990> off<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.350> base

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
then it will begin to lift off the base

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.560 
then it will begin to lift off the base
of<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:34.800> pan<00:04:34.979> very<00:04:35.820> like<00:04:36.240> when<00:04:36.389> you're<00:04:36.510> making

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
of the pan very like when you're making

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.180 
of the pan very like when you're making
a<00:04:36.780> pancake<00:04:38.210> actually<00:04:39.210> if<00:04:39.300> you<00:04:39.510> want<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.199> one

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:08.659 
just run my spatula are the edge there
and<00:05:02.610> see<00:05:02.850> we<00:05:03.000> can<00:05:03.150> just<00:05:03.180> start<00:05:06.260> okay<00:05:07.490> there<00:05:08.490> we

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
and see we can just start okay there we

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:08.839 
and see we can just start okay there we
go

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:08.849 
go

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.500 
go
see<00:05:09.270> that's<00:05:09.570> what<00:05:09.690> should<00:05:09.810> happen<00:05:11.030> and<00:05:12.030> let's

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
see that's what should happen and let's

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.600 
see that's what should happen and let's
see<00:05:12.660> whether<00:05:12.810> I<00:05:12.930> can<00:05:13.200> flip<00:05:13.889> this<00:05:14.039> over<00:05:14.250> first

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
see whether I can flip this over first

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.330 
see whether I can flip this over first
time<00:05:17.479> perfect<00:05:18.479> I<00:05:19.020> see<00:05:19.320> the<00:05:19.410> base<00:05:19.560> really<00:05:20.099> does

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
time perfect I see the base really does

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.120 
time perfect I see the base really does
start<00:05:20.700> to<00:05:20.789> look<00:05:20.880> like<00:05:21.000> an<00:05:21.210> American<00:05:21.300> pancake

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130
