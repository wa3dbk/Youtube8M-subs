Goleta California and I'd like to speak
to<00:00:06.299> you<00:00:06.569> about<00:00:06.720> growing<00:00:07.170> herbs<00:00:07.620> from<00:00:07.919> seeds

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
to you about growing herbs from seeds

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.950 
to you about growing herbs from seeds
indoors<00:00:09.830> growing<00:00:10.830> herbs<00:00:11.099> from<00:00:11.250> seeds<00:00:11.580> indoors

indoors growing herbs from seeds indoors

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.560 
indoors growing herbs from seeds indoors
is<00:00:12.960> just<00:00:13.410> like<00:00:13.670> growing<00:00:14.670> or<00:00:15.059> propagating

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
is just like growing or propagating

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.040 
is just like growing or propagating
seeds<00:00:16.170> of<00:00:16.590> any<00:00:16.830> other<00:00:17.039> varietal<00:00:17.730> sort<00:00:18.060> in<00:00:18.330> that

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
seeds of any other varietal sort in that

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.779 
seeds of any other varietal sort in that
there's<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.890> certain<00:00:20.340> temperature

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
there's a certain temperature

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.359 
there's a certain temperature
requirement<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.869> needed<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.560> most<00:00:23.039> herb

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
requirement that is needed and most herb

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.540 
requirement that is needed and most herb
seeds<00:00:23.789> are<00:00:24.800> germinating<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
seeds are germinating in the in a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.269 
seeds are germinating in the in a
temperature<00:00:27.269> range<00:00:27.480> from<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.140> upper<00:00:28.170> 60s<00:00:28.920> to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
temperature range from the upper 60s to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.669 
temperature range from the upper 60s to
low<00:00:29.670> 80s

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
low 80s

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.170 
low 80s
and<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.099> day<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.430> night<00:00:32.520> temperature

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
and that is day and night temperature

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.680 
and that is day and night temperature
ranges<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.739> seed<00:00:34.980> germination<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.850> herbs

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
ranges and the seed germination of herbs

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.069 
ranges and the seed germination of herbs
can<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.440> little<00:00:37.710> slower<00:00:38.129> than<00:00:39.079> other

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
can be a little slower than other

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.240 
can be a little slower than other
vegetables<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.070> keep<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:41.940> mind<00:00:42.090> when

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
vegetables so keep that in mind when

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.160 
vegetables so keep that in mind when
looking<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.820> if<00:00:45.120> your<00:00:45.300> seeds<00:00:45.539> are<00:00:45.719> indeed

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
looking to see if your seeds are indeed

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.590 
looking to see if your seeds are indeed
viable<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:47.579> with<00:00:47.730> herbs<00:00:47.969> as<00:00:48.120> I<00:00:48.210> said<00:00:48.450> is

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
viable the thing with herbs as I said is

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.060 
viable the thing with herbs as I said is
that<00:00:48.750> they're<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> little<00:00:49.079> slower<00:00:49.500> than<00:00:49.800> other

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
that they're a little slower than other

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.360 
that they're a little slower than other
vegetables<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:50.940> you<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.780> may<00:00:51.960> need<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.590> be

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
vegetables so you you may need to be

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.959 
vegetables so you you may need to be
patient

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
patient

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.510 
patient
with<00:00:54.539> with<00:00:54.989> Europe<00:00:55.410> seeds<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:55.980> far<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.340> their

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
with with Europe seeds as far as their

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
with with Europe seeds as far as their
germination<00:00:56.940> rate<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.629> we're<00:00:58.109> talking<00:00:58.289> about

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
germination rate and we're talking about

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
germination rate and we're talking about
three<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.039> four<00:00:59.219> weeks<00:00:59.430> sometimes<00:00:59.760> for<00:01:00.239> them

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
three to four weeks sometimes for them

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.070 
three to four weeks sometimes for them
to<00:01:00.480> germinate<00:01:00.949> plants<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.420> cilantro<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
to germinate plants like cilantro and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.200 
to germinate plants like cilantro and
basil<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:05.040> germinate<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.460> little<00:01:05.760> bit<00:01:05.939> quicker

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
basil can germinate a little bit quicker

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.870 
basil can germinate a little bit quicker
but<00:01:06.600> certainly<00:01:07.409> seeds<00:01:07.770> like<00:01:08.040> thyme<00:01:08.369> and

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
but certainly seeds like thyme and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.649 
but certainly seeds like thyme and
oregano<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:10.110> sage<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.340> example<00:01:11.850> will<00:01:12.420> take<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
oregano and sage for example will take a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.600 
oregano and sage for example will take a
little<00:01:12.900> bit<00:01:13.049> more<00:01:13.110> time<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.770> germinate<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
little bit more time to germinate the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.010 
little bit more time to germinate the
thing<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.939> consider<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.750> want<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
thing that consider is that you want to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.460 
thing that consider is that you want to
find<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.380> place<00:01:16.530> where<00:01:16.979> you're<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.490> have

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
find a place where you're going to have

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.080 
find a place where you're going to have
temperatures<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:19.979> consistently<00:01:20.820> in

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
temperatures that are consistently in

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.499 
temperatures that are consistently in
the<00:01:21.150> upper<00:01:22.080> 60s<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.860> low<00:01:23.340> 80s<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the upper 60s to the low 80s and that

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.260 
the upper 60s to the low 80s and that
would<00:01:24.659> be<00:01:24.780> maybe<00:01:24.990> your<00:01:25.140> laundry<00:01:25.770> room<00:01:26.270> where

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
would be maybe your laundry room where

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.630 
would be maybe your laundry room where
you<00:01:27.420> have<00:01:27.659> your<00:01:27.869> water<00:01:28.170> heater<00:01:28.530> located<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
you have your water heater located and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.999 
you have your water heater located and
generally<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.390> on<00:01:30.960> top<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.409> your<00:01:31.530> water<00:01:31.710> heater

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
generally it on top of your water heater

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.179 
generally it on top of your water heater
is<00:01:32.130> sometimes<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.939> very<00:01:33.240> good<00:01:33.540> place<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.560> keep

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
is sometimes a very good place to keep

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.830 
is sometimes a very good place to keep
your<00:01:35.579> seeds<00:01:36.380> when<00:01:37.380> you're<00:01:37.500> germinating<00:01:38.159> them

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
your seeds when you're germinating them

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.179 
your seeds when you're germinating them
once<00:01:39.840> your<00:01:40.020> seeds<00:01:40.229> have<00:01:40.380> germinated<00:01:40.409> you're

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
once your seeds have germinated you're

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.920 
once your seeds have germinated you're
gonna<00:01:41.280> want<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> allow<00:01:41.939> for<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> plans<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.840> get

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
gonna want to allow for the plans to get

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.399 
gonna want to allow for the plans to get
