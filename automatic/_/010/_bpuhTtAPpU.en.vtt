00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello everyone, today I am going to show you how to make homemade XO conpoy sauce.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'd like to keep it in my fridge all the time. It's basic, versatile, and flavorful.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The main ingredient is conpoy, that is dried scallop. And we also need dried shrimp, and ham. You'd better use Jinhua ham here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
For a detailed recipe, please refer to the description down below, or go to my blog.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Start with adding a tbs. of cooking wine in dried scallop and dried shrimp. Cover with enough water to submerge the other ingredients.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Soak for at least 1 hour until both are tender and softened.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now prepare the other ingredients. Dice onion.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If you use red onion here, it will add more flavors.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Dice garlic cloves.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Normally I'd like to use a garlic press to do the job. But here I suggest dice with a blade. Since we are going to deep fry the ingredients later, dicing the ingredients will keep them in roughly the same size, so that they won’t get burnt.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Now drain the softened ingredients. You can save the water as a broth for later.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Put dried scallop and Jinhua Ham in a steam pot. Steam over high heat for 15 minutes.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Chop up the softened shrimp.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Allow the steamed conpoy to cool down a bit. Wait until they are not too hot, tear them into thin strips.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Steaming process makes conpoy tender, so you can easily tear them apart. Make them into thin strips like this.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Don’t choose large dried scallops in a XO sauce, small ones are just fine.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Now do some prep with the ham. Trim off the fat part and skin.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
You can save them in other dishes, because we only need the lean part for this sauce.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Cut the lean part into very thin slices, and then chop them up.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Keep them almost the same size as those chopped dried shrimp.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We are done preping. Let's turn on the burner.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:46.000
In a frying pan, pour 500ml of vegetable oil. Heat the oil until it is half way to a boiling point, where you can see small bubbles rising around if you stick in a chopstick.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And then turn down the heat to medium, drop dried scallop strips to deep fry in the pan.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It takes about 5 minutes.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Wait until they become lightly golden, add chopped dried shrimps in.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Followed by chopped ham. Adding your ingredients in this order depends on the water content in each of them.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Fry for 3-5 more minutes until all the water in these three ingredients come out and they become golden with a little burnt.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:52.000
If you are concerned about the temperature and time to cook these ingredients, you can fry them one by one separately.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
In this way you will end up with ingredients that are evenly cooked.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now in another pan, start working at the same time.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Get the three ingredients out of the pan when they are almost ready.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Right now we can see that there are a lot of white and thick foam, which means the water are all coming out of our ingredients.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Transfer them into another pan, and do not turn off the heat of this one, and keep the heat on low to medium.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Wait until it's warm enough, add in diced onion. Fry for 5 minutes until lightly golden.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
As our onions is frying, let's take a look at this pot.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
They are our cooked ingredients, conpoy, ham and dried shrimp.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Season them.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
First, add in 4 tbs. Of cooking wine, 2 tbs. Of soy sauce.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Five tbs. of oyster sauce and a tbs. of sugar.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Pour the broth in it as well.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Slow cook them over low heat.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Let's get back to our onions.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Add the garlic in until onions are golden.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Again, if you are not sure about the temperature, you can fry them separately.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
After garlic goes in, cook for 7-8 more minutes until they are both golden brown.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Garlic can easily get burned, so pay a close attention.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Now they are almost there, transfer the dried scallops, ham and dried shrimp back in the hot pan, and turn off the heat immediately.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Add in some chili flakes.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Adjust to your liking.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Add some black pepper, and mix them in when they are still warm. Now the XO sauce is done.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Allow it to cool down a little bit, and then transfer it in a jar.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I have cleaned this jar beforehand.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Slowly get the sauce in the jar, and left about 1 cm from the cap.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The amount of oil in my recipe can cover all the ingredients in this jar. If you are short of oil, you can heat up some and then pour them in the jar.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Make sure you seal all the ingredients under a layer of oil, so that you can keep the sauce for longer.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Wipe the jar, and then seal and store.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Don’t serve the sauce right away, leave it at room temperature for 3-5 days until all the flavors blend and incorporate with each other.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
After a couple of days you will see that the sauce smells much better, and you can use it anyway you like.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:24.000
XO sauce is very versatile. The simplest way to cook is to fry rice with a tbs. of the sauce, and it will light up the whole dish.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Anyway, you can serve it with all kinds of dishes. It's a very basic and useful sauce.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I truly suggest everybody give it a try. Hope you like it, and thanks for watching.
