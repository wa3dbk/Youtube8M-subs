so<00:00:00.510> these<00:00:00.690> are<00:00:00.930> the<00:00:00.989> two<00:00:01.199> tabs<00:00:01.469> you<00:00:01.860> need<00:00:02.010> to

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
so these are the two tabs you need to

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.090 
so these are the two tabs you need to
bend<00:00:02.419> this<00:00:03.419> one<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.080> one<00:00:04.140> so<00:00:04.740> I<00:00:04.770> bent

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
bend this one and this one so I bent

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:05.960 
bend this one and this one so I bent
this<00:00:05.279> one<00:00:05.460> already

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
this one already

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.500 
this one already
as<00:00:06.089> you<00:00:06.270> can<00:00:06.420> see<00:00:07.429> Bend<00:00:08.429> there<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.240> now<00:00:09.420> I'm

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
as you can see Bend there and now I'm

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:19.710 
as you can see Bend there and now I'm
going<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> bend<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.920> second<00:00:11.340> tab<00:00:16.160> right<00:00:17.160> you

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.610 

three<00:00:20.289> tricky<00:00:21.039> to<00:00:21.250> get<00:00:21.429> this

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:26.620 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.800 

a<00:00:26.770> little<00:00:27.460> bit<00:00:27.550> at<00:00:27.640> a<00:00:27.670> time<00:00:27.700> try<00:00:28.270> to<00:00:28.300> be<00:00:28.420> careful

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
a little bit at a time try to be careful

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.790 
a little bit at a time try to be careful
and<00:00:28.930> not<00:00:28.990> to<00:00:29.200> damage<00:00:29.380> the<00:00:30.210> rubber<00:00:31.620> there<00:00:32.620> I'm

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
and not to damage the rubber there I'm

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.170 
and not to damage the rubber there I'm
not<00:00:32.950> sure<00:00:33.130> what<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.400> functionality<00:00:34.060> of<00:00:34.090> that

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
not sure what the functionality of that

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:40.080 
not sure what the functionality of that
is<00:00:34.480> but<00:00:38.130> if<00:00:39.130> you<00:00:39.310> get<00:00:39.520> those<00:00:39.730> tabs

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
is but if you get those tabs

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.220 
is but if you get those tabs
straightened<00:00:40.660> out

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.480 

and<00:00:45.470> then<00:00:45.890> this<00:00:46.130> is<00:00:47.090> where<00:00:48.880> the<00:00:51.220> nozzle<00:00:52.220> gets

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
and then this is where the nozzle gets

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.590 
and then this is where the nozzle gets
removed<00:00:54.700> sounds<00:00:55.700> like<00:00:55.850> if<00:00:56.000> I<00:00:56.150> could<00:00:56.300> pry<00:00:56.540> in

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
removed sounds like if I could pry in

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.240 
removed sounds like if I could pry in
here<00:00:56.900> a<00:00:56.930> little<00:00:57.020> bit<00:00:57.260> I<00:00:59.800> need<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.890> pull<00:01:01.100> right

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
here a little bit I need to pull right

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.590 
here a little bit I need to pull right
out

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.260 

and<00:01:06.600> then<00:01:06.810> pull<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.409> out<00:01:07.729> there's<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.850> spring<00:01:09.150> in

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
and then pull it out there's a spring in

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.760 
and then pull it out there's a spring in
there<00:01:09.420> make<00:01:09.630> sure<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.930> spring<00:01:10.260> stays<00:01:10.590> in

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
there make sure the spring stays in

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
there make sure the spring stays in
there<00:01:11.180> and<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.690> is<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:14.119> rubber<00:01:15.119> grommet

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
there and this is the rubber grommet

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.770 
there and this is the rubber grommet
that<00:01:15.750> needs<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.229> be<00:01:16.260> replaced<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:18.450> I'll<00:01:18.540> go

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that needs to be replaced so I'll go

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.010 
that needs to be replaced so I'll go
ahead<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:19.140> replace<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.130> pull<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.820> old<00:01:21.750> one

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
ahead and replace this pull this old one

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.160 
ahead and replace this pull this old one
out<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:23.610> finds<00:01:23.940> Rivera<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:24.540> not<00:01:24.690> too<00:01:24.930> worried

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
out it finds Rivera I'm not too worried

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.800 
out it finds Rivera I'm not too worried
about<00:01:25.229> damaging<00:01:25.590> this<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.450> because<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.600> have

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
about damaging this one because I have

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:41.440 
about damaging this one because I have
replacements

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.890 

is<00:01:41.990> in<00:01:42.200> there<00:01:42.350> pretty<00:01:42.619> good
