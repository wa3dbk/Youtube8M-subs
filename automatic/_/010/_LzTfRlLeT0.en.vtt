00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.480
 is it folks welcome 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.420
 I'm from here, says the game designer of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.730
 play the art work online work and I'll talk 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.730
 a little bit for you guys than this game 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.620
 who is part of the team with the role 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.870
 them and I also want to show 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.410
 how does the creation of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.250
 characters what is theft art the organ 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.340
 goes basically a two -piece 11-mm 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.260
 rpg all set in the fantasy world 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.329
 from harry potter so if you've read the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.469
 books and movies you probably already 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.570
 knows all automatic game detail 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.960
 Ok, let's go to the next team. 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.309
 game creation looks like it was like 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.409
 you 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.999
 None of us have a Harvard degree in 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.399
 online game creation 

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:11.340
 so we can consider the game here 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.759
 it's a rocket made by fans 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.029
 I'll cite one of the names of some 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.889
 people who have already helped the project 

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:21.420
 by the way it is in development 

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:24.179
 since 2010 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.990
 so you are the name of the 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.889
 and I hope you do not forget 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.189
 from anyone 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:34.799
 well we have the nazim that he is the founder and 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.999
 programmer of the game and created 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.939
 systems 

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:41.539
 we have the caÃ­que he is map he creates 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.060
 the maps and mazes of the game for you 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:49.109
 is on the team since 2010 also has the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.719
 dark more than I am I believe and created 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:54.959
 some common game features some 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:58.529
 movable status walls also have a 

00:01:54.959 --> 00:02:00.630
 You sure touched and lucas aquino that 

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:04.409
 They are writers and create new quests. 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.409
 always has guilherme igot that is the 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.329
 our video editor has lucas rb 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:12.000
 that the program is also currently 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.460
 is developing a language in thesis 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.670
 more 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.940
 take it to the game and not to mention those 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.860
 that give us ideas and criticisms 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.010
 always constructive 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.070
 So we thank everyone there. 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.900
 It's good to know that the game is ready 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:31.420
 game is under development 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.090
 It is an online game, it takes time and as I said 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.870
 This fans folks are not getting paid 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.150
 for that 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.940
 It is therefore that most of us work 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.800
 Do you have a wife and daughter to take care of? 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.700
 no this is a lie 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:50.100
 but finally the delay has a reason 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.620
 People are taking time, but it's getting good. 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.660
 Okay, I'll ask you as often as 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.970
 be patient 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:02.730
 Good, now, let's get right to the point. 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.730
 is the character creation screen 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.270
 this one here is the starting screen of the game 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.890
 certain she will still suffer some 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.660
 changes 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.640
 for now it's a little simple 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.800
 but let's get straight to what's interesting to play 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.150
 Good, I'll create a new account here. 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.950
 show you 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.720
 remembering that this part that also goes 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.280
 undergo changes mainly with 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.770
 relation to e-mail 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.570
 So when you went to create an account, 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.890
 In the game you will have to put a 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.720
 valid email 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.910
 it goes straight to the database 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.630
 where you will be able to access your 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.190
 character from the control panel 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.140
 within the site 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.340
 so let's do the following do not create 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.340
 a test account 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.970
 here you can dial to remember if 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.010
 you do not have a computer 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:04:00.660
 shared and then you register 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.660
 effect now let's create the character 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.570
 here you are seeing firsthand the 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.760
 as is the character creation screen 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.070
 you can see that the length 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:18.180
 maximum of 15 characters 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:21.579
 so I can not write alek wek fan 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.419
 of a limit to it so 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.360
 It puts you here one of the team is more that 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.319
 You can choose the girl sex or 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.300
 boy 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:34.409
 I personally like to choose a 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.409
 male character 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:44.680
 here you choose the right hair color 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.840
 here you choose the attributes for the 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.379
 game for now I will not give any 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.439
 I would like to point out to you how this 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:56.379
 distribution of points and in what 

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:58.270
 influence I'll leave it for the next video 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:01.509
 To talk a little about it. 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:07.210
 the most important here the skin color 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:08.319
 You can choose the type of hair 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.900
 initial 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:19.120
 are five different hairs you can 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:21.340
 choose to be the one to look at you too 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.129
 can make the change 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.759
 the character becomes more like the 

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:26.759
 what do you want 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:39.580
 so I'll choose if right here hair 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:40.449
 red blonde hair if it were a 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.650
 girl 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:48.490
 would look like this man like that 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:54.789
 and then you finally confirm it once 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:58.000
 that your character was created you already 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:06:00.580
 It's in the game, so this is it. 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.969
 An initial sentence, I'll let it speak. 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.190
 a little later for now 

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:08.650
 I just wanted to show you that the 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:10.830
 character was created successfully I am 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.569
 no game 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:16.860
 then that's it 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:16.860
 until the next staff
