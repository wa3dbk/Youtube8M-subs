00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
then I got to make some inner fender

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.250 
then I got to make some inner fender
wells<00:00:57.300> for<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:58.559> got<00:00:58.770> a<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:01.050> bigger

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
wells for this we got a the bigger

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.930 
wells for this we got a the bigger
fenders<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:01.920> helped<00:01:02.160> us<00:01:02.250> a<00:01:02.399> lot<00:01:02.430> with<00:01:02.609> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
fenders they helped us a lot with the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.420 
fenders they helped us a lot with the
tire<00:01:03.329> clearance<00:01:03.660> right<00:01:04.049> here<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.010> if<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.189> turn

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
tire clearance right here so if you turn

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.880 
tire clearance right here so if you turn
and<00:01:05.700> hit<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> big<00:01:06.210> bump<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.600> whatever

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
and hit like a big bump or whatever

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.550 
and hit like a big bump or whatever
anyways<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.130> then<00:01:08.780> got<00:01:09.780> bigger<00:01:09.960> mirrors<00:01:10.350> for

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
anyways and then got bigger mirrors for

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.840 
anyways and then got bigger mirrors for
it<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> see<00:01:10.950> around<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.250> fenders<00:01:13.700> other<00:01:14.700> than

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
it to see around the fenders other than

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.310 
it to see around the fenders other than
that<00:01:14.970> all<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.330> stuff<00:01:15.540> pretty<00:01:15.750> much<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.110> same

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that all this stuff pretty much the same

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.820 
that all this stuff pretty much the same
we<00:01:17.220> switch<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.640> up<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.970> little<00:01:18.119> bit

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
we switch this up a little bit

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.550 
we switch this up a little bit
reverse<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.610> ones<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.970> were<00:01:21.090> flipped<00:01:21.560> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
reverse the ones that were flipped and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.660 
reverse the ones that were flipped and
then<00:01:22.650> when<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.920> outside<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.310> truck<00:01:23.460> gets

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
then when the outside of the truck gets

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.440 
then when the outside of the truck gets
rewrapped

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
rewrapped

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.130 
rewrapped
all<00:01:24.900> right<00:01:25.049> finalize<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.770> stuff<00:01:27.150> I'll<00:01:28.020> get

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
all right finalize that stuff I'll get

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.649 
all right finalize that stuff I'll get
those<00:01:28.320> right<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.680> same<00:01:28.860> way<00:01:29.270> they<00:01:30.270> put<00:01:30.509> some

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
those right the same way they put some

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990 
those right the same way they put some
plexi<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:31.470> just<00:01:32.189> hold<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.549> batteries<00:01:32.850> in

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
plexi in here just hold the batteries in

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.800 
plexi in here just hold the batteries in
place<00:01:35.000> and<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.150> we<00:01:36.450> were<00:01:36.540> down<00:01:36.689> at

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
place and then we were down at

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.039 
place and then we were down at

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
that's a good sign I think also painted

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:47.660 
that's a good sign I think also painted
