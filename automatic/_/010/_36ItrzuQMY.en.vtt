00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
one does not have that it has this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.920 
one does not have that it has this
magnet<00:01:04.890> right<00:01:05.070> here<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.640> this<00:01:06.030> line<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
magnet right here and this line that you

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.960 
magnet right here and this line that you
see<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> middle<00:01:07.710> here<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.549> just<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
see in the middle here it's just the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.270 
see in the middle here it's just the
direction<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.750> design<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.740> if<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:11.070> want

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
direction of the design so if you want

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.719 
direction of the design so if you want
the<00:01:11.610> though<00:01:11.939> if<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:13.020> like<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> wavy

the though if you want like a wavy

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.240 
the though if you want like a wavy
design<00:01:14.729> like<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.659> right<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.290> then<00:01:16.920> you're

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
design like this right here then you're

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.090 
design like this right here then you're
going<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.430> use<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.909> side<00:01:18.150> right<00:01:18.450> there<00:01:19.409> but

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
going to use this side right there but

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.320 
going to use this side right there but
then<00:01:20.220> if<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.460> want<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.850> straight<00:01:21.090> up-and-down

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
design you're going to put this side

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.420 
design you're going to put this side
right<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.259> up<00:01:25.979> against<00:01:26.280> your

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
on this wheel right here and the designs

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
on this wheel right here and the designs
look<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.200> different<00:01:37.740> because<00:01:37.950> i<00:01:38.549> try<00:01:38.820> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
look a little different because i try to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.969 
look a little different because i try to
position<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.600> nail<00:01:39.780> polish<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.350> different

position the nail polish in different

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.850 
position the nail polish in different
positions<00:01:41.299> to<00:01:42.299> see<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.990> variety<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.710> you

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
positions to see the variety that you

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.480 
positions to see the variety that you
actually<00:01:44.070> get<00:01:44.579> with<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.060> designs<00:01:45.799> so<00:01:46.799> some<00:01:47.369> of

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
actually get with the designs so some of

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.510 
actually get with the designs so some of
them<00:01:47.610> worked<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:48.119> like<00:01:48.450> these<00:01:49.079> here<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.829> then

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
them worked out like these here and then

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.070 
them worked out like these here and then
some<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.950> not<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.189> much

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080
