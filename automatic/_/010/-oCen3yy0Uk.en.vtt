you want to do is click Launch a Cydia

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.270 
you want to do is click Launch a Cydia
now<00:01:14.220> what<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.580> um<00:01:14.880> website<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
now what this um website is is it's a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.200 
now what this um website is is it's a
website<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:18.530> different<00:01:19.530> lists<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.210> loops

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
website with different lists of loops

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.780 
website with different lists of loops
and<00:01:21.390> beats<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:22.369> think<00:01:23.369> that's<00:01:23.549> what<00:01:23.670> they

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and beats I think that's what they

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.380 
and beats I think that's what they
called<00:01:24.000> loops<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:25.200> can<00:01:26.180> double<00:01:27.180> click<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
called loops you can double click to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.280 
called loops you can double click to
prove<00:01:27.930> your<00:01:28.140> loop<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.960> drag

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
prove your loop and all you do is drag

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.890 
prove your loop and all you do is drag
it<00:01:34.320> into<00:01:34.590> here<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.549> different<00:01:35.880> channels<00:01:35.909> now

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
it into here on different channels now

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.289 
it into here on different channels now
these<00:01:37.200> channels<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.670> two<00:01:39.000> beads

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
these channels you can have two beads

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.880 
these channels you can have two beads
going<00:01:39.540> at<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.780> same<00:01:39.930> time<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.439> different

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
going at the same time on different

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.399 
going at the same time on different
channels<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.630> they'll<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.780> overlapping<00:01:43.200> each

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
channels and they'll be overlapping each

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.590 
channels and they'll be overlapping each
other<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:44.579> you<00:01:44.729> only<00:01:44.880> had<00:01:45.060> one<00:01:45.090> channel

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
other but if you only had one channel

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.420 
other but if you only had one channel
you<00:01:45.689> couldn't<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.409> beats<00:01:46.710> overlapping<00:01:47.189> each

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
you couldn't have beats overlapping each

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.109 
you couldn't have beats overlapping each
other<00:01:47.630> for<00:01:48.630> example<00:01:49.579> pretend<00:01:50.579> these<00:01:50.729> all

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
other for example pretend these all

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.670 
other for example pretend these all
these<00:01:51.360> channels<00:01:51.630> here<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.140> there<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.500> you

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
these channels here not there and you

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.780 
these channels here not there and you
only<00:01:52.829> have<00:01:53.040> channel<00:01:53.340> 1

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.900 

and<00:01:57.650> as<00:01:58.650> you<00:01:58.830> can<00:01:58.950> see<00:01:59.010> the<00:01:59.370> beats<00:01:59.580> don't

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
and as you can see the beats don't

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.610 
and as you can see the beats don't
overlap<00:02:00.420> each<00:02:00.540> other<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:00.930> go<00:02:01.080> one<00:02:01.290> after

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
overlap each other they go one after

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.980 
overlap each other they go one after
another<00:02:01.820> but<00:02:02.820> with<00:02:02.970> these<00:02:03.090> channels<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.840> can

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
another but with these channels you can

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.540 
another but with these channels you can
make<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.290> beats<00:02:04.530> overlap<00:02:04.980> each<00:02:05.160> other<00:02:05.370> at

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
make the beats overlap each other at

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:15.020 
make the beats overlap each other at
different<00:02:05.880> times<00:02:06.470> this<00:02:07.470> is<00:02:07.680> an<00:02:07.800> example<00:02:14.030> yeah

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
different times this is an example yeah

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.910 
different times this is an example yeah
as<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.510> can<00:02:15.540> see<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.020> bit<00:02:16.170> started

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
as you can see the bit started

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.580 
as you can see the bit started
overlapping<00:02:17.340> each<00:02:17.550> other<00:02:19.100> anyway<00:02:20.100> um<00:02:21.590> these

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
overlapping each other anyway um these

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.770 
overlapping each other anyway um these
are<00:02:22.800> lists<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.250> some<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.000> them<00:02:24.240> are<00:02:24.360> premium

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
are lists here some of them are premium

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.450 
are lists here some of them are premium
where<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.290> have<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.560> sign<00:02:25.740> up<00:02:25.770> and<00:02:26.040> pay<00:02:26.190> for<00:02:26.400> um
