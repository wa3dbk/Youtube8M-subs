00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.120
 then we get like that a few 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.700
 barbitas is because it is not ruling out 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.760
 explained now 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:01:02.940

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:06.420

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.150

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.900
 that combines everything everything will combine very 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.810
 well then for daughters three know 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.400
 eyebrows are the most a very indicator 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.100
 delicate that has to be seen very well 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.100
 to combine or phosphorescent orange 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:28.150
 If you want you can spend little pay 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.930
 so if you want and delete all 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.630
 imperfections of dark circles all that 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.880
 now we will get a little bit of this 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.390
 module this I bought it here in the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.480
 dime store 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.820
 it cost me 350 and this one gets like this 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:50.570
 and you can put it in analysis for 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.570
 erase the moquitos because we have now 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.930
 we can also put it in the reader yes 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.830
 yes 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.780
 I hope you do not get too hung up 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.210
 just do not go to spend the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.240
 line is defined as not going over the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.240
 stripe 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.180
 here it would be very delicate 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.860
 After this we turn to look the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:18.210
 hairstyle 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.210
 I bought these flip flops 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.700
 I recommend it 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:37.880
 They cost me as 300 pesos are the 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.880
 shadows of brands like nike 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:48.380
 and just like an Indian going down a 0 8 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.380
 because we are going to cut their tomatoes 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.560
 now the next step 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.740
 you have to brush well as my 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:03.510
 Chinese hair is very beautiful very well 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.510
 hairstyle then I have to leave 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:16.569
 these things 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.959
 for the lips we have to put on a 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:23.709
 deep red as the forest or jungle will 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:27.519
 red the good does not matter country of the 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:30.519
 corners but put a lipstick like that if 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:35.160
 very nice that does not happen to you in the line 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:35.160
 so to get more like that cool is like this 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.860
 Well that's it
