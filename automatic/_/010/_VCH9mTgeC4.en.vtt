00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.200
How are you guys doing? everything's good?

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.039
We have gathered here in such pleasant place.

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:11.279
In the middle of the street.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:14.899
When speaking of magic many people believe that the first tricks you learn. 

00:00:14.899 --> 00:00:16.419
Are stupid, after you become a professional.

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:22.809
For me it's the opposite. For me those are the best in my repertoire.

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:27.169
You guys wanna see it? It's free, right!

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:32.270
So you guys can see.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.830
What's your name?

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.900
Brayan. You're going to help me, okay?

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.880

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.840

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.750
Here I have a deck of cards.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.060
I want you to see that every single card is different.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.670
I won't show you one by one, but you get the idea.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.320
I need you to choose one you like.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.450
Take one out.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.700
Take a look a it and show it to the camera.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.930

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.070
Done? Okay, I'm going to pass cards like this, just say stop when you want.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.350
When you want...

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.390
There? Put it there.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.990
Please don't forget it.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.650
The card really is lost in the pack. I don't do nothing.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.650
Because there's nothing to do.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.940
the card is simply lost.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.620

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.140
Being honest is impossible for me to know your card. 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.990
I don't even know where it is. Imagine, you know the identity, I don't even know that.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.450
It's in the pack of cards. But where? Right?

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.860
I created a method. Well, the magicians have designed a method.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.660
To find out where's the card.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.800
Let's see if it works...

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.580
Is using fire.

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.210
I have to mark your card.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.770
It looks something like this.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.240
Just by doing that.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.600
The fire falls on top of the pack

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.950
The fire dissolves.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.510
And burns one card.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.400
But no literally.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.319
You know...

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.149
When something gets burned

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:14.539
It changes color.

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.239

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.349
But, this card could be any card.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.689
The cool part would be that this was exactly the card you chose.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:27.979
What was your card?

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:29.319
Two of Clubs.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.650
And this is exactly the Two of Clubs.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.790
But.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.539
This card does not work anymore. Because is a different color.

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:43.500
Gonna try this with you. What's your name?

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.139
Ryan. I'm going to pass the cards like this, just say stop when you want.

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:51.229
Before they run out...

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:55.169
Okay, that's going to be your card.

00:02:55.169 --> 00:03:00.189
Good?

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:07.189
This time will be different. I'm gonna turn your card invisible. Done, now is invisible.

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:14.039
I know you guys don't believe me so I'll show it to you all.

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:18.110
I can see it. The Two of Hearts.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.640
The cool part is when you put it on top of another card.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.530
And you simply snap.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.510
In one card there is no space for two.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.029
So it just changes into yours.

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:29.989

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.439

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:35.359

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:36.539

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:38.919
Shake it. Blow on it.

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.869
You blow on it!

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:47.559
Blow.

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:48.629

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:49.789

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:54.619
This guy is a monster. He's making fun of the system.

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:57.100
Let me call my dad and my mom.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.700
Now this is the moment when you go home, lie on your bed, look up and think about your life. 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.700

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:11.729
