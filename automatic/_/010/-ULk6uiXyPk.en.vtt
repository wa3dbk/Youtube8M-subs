00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:07.509
 I am posting Gunpla production video . 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:11.530
 Master grade 100s version 2.0 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:18.720
 Parts of parts both feet of the waist or that the upper half of the body of the par-to- 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.720
 As parts of the body part were finished , I would like to combine all of this 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:27.380
 Finally, it is only the main part, but the assembly is completed, so let me combine here 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:33.050
 I would like 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.010
 So it 's a stable part here , but it was thin and broken, so I'm going to remove it for now 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.870
 I will 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:44.329
 Then the red part of this arm was pointed out also in this comment 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:46.430
 At the time of the arm's policy, I forgot this, so now I'm putting on the right 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.280
 It is the seal of this side after 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:54.860
 Here and after the fleet 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:01:01.250
 It is this seal It's pasted here a little so I'm sticking this sticker too 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.880
 Well , I think it is a part of the eastern wind so I think I will combine all 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.520
 It is from Hanshin 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.520
 I think that it is important soaked the cost foot 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.310
 Hundred now sad like this of the formula 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:34.810
 It's cool with thinner Well Yappashi long 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:38.200
 I feel like I saw from this side I like this feeling too 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.010
 Still sharp of the exterior is clear 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.080
 It is this part or something well exposed 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.390
 It's cool- 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.860
 Have Toka to intends diagonally 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.390
 It is cool I like this view- 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.330
 Then finally this 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:01.140
 I think I am Hanshin and thanks union expansion 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.140
 I think this is the moment are dying have made Gundam 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.190
 The 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.740
 It's cool 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.740
 The rest is also stable 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.590
 Hundred-type main assembly completed 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.710
 Hmm 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.670
 2nd place 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.190
 Well when I this feeling 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.870
 Yellow exterior 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.769
 This feeling 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.769
 I be really 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.319
 Pretty much this 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.800
 Overall proportions too 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.110
 It feels slim- 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.180
 Assault type 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.650
 Hundred types of features can also be seen from now on 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.710
 The back is not yet attached with a backpack, so I feel like it's a bit sluggish 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.690
 But 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.210
 Because the 100s is a quite distinctive form of backpack 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.160
 It is fun- 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:14.030
 After all this range of movement range is wide and seems to be able to take various poses 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:18.830
 is not it 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.370
 By the way, it is also a candidate Mr. You rotate smoothly 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.000
 So that's the top and bottom, right? 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.900
 It is also your Fe 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.819
 I am really amazing it is true 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:34.969
 Recent gun plastic is really great 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:36.360
 Also its a little strange movement of but pose is it this Gundam is is not good to this right beside 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:41.100
 Other also 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:45.350
 Your hands and feet are here, so it will rise to the horizon 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:51.140
 I This is a good more and more significant variations of I pose 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:56.400
 So even if this leg joint and this judo are high , even if you open your legs in various shapes 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:59.710
 Will firmly tighten your eyes slowly and you will be independent 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.030
 This one is really that one 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.960
 It has become a mechanism for fact properly even though is amazing also because Gundam move 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.960
 It is'm good to say 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:52.139
 It is the next in was successfully completed body portion assembly that the 

00:04:45.339 --> 00:04:52.139
 I think this backpack I want to go into the production of a backpack to come behind
