00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
hi today I'm just going to give you a

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.710 
hi today I'm just going to give you a
quick<00:00:01.949> rundown<00:00:02.190> of<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.730> maromi<00:00:03.240> four<00:00:03.480> point

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
quick rundown of the maromi four point

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.920 
quick rundown of the maromi four point
star<00:00:04.020> filter<00:00:04.549> it's<00:00:05.549> a<00:00:05.700> very<00:00:06.029> very<00:00:06.390> very<00:00:06.690> nice

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
star filter it's a very very very nice

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.790 
star filter it's a very very very nice
filter<00:00:07.589> which<00:00:07.859> I've<00:00:08.040> just<00:00:08.250> got<00:00:08.460> today<00:00:09.320> it's<00:00:10.320> 62

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
filter which I've just got today it's 62

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.259 
filter which I've just got today it's 62
millimeters<00:00:11.460> in<00:00:11.580> diameter<00:00:11.790> which<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:14.269 
millimeters in diameter which is the

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.210 
millimeters in diameter which is the
diameter<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.780> my<00:00:15.960> hyper<00:00:16.230> prime<00:00:16.560> lens<00:00:16.830> which<00:00:17.190> is

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
diameter of my hyper prime lens which is

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.580 
diameter of my hyper prime lens which is
my<00:00:17.670> F<00:00:18.060> naught<00:00:18.300> point<00:00:18.449> 9<00:00:18.690> 5<00:00:18.960> because<00:00:19.199> I'm<00:00:19.320> hoping

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
my F naught point 9 5 because I'm hoping

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.910 
my F naught point 9 5 because I'm hoping
to<00:00:19.770> use<00:00:19.920> this<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:21.320> strictly<00:00:22.320> night<00:00:22.619> shooting

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
to use this as strictly night shooting

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.340 
to use this as strictly night shooting
so<00:00:23.580> it<00:00:23.670> picks<00:00:23.850> up<00:00:24.000> all<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.390> star<00:00:24.689> points<00:00:25.140> in

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
so it picks up all of the star points in

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.609 
so it picks up all of the star points in
say<00:00:25.920> streetlights<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> sort<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.090> thing<00:00:27.619> it's

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
say streetlights that sort of thing it's

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.339 
say streetlights that sort of thing it's
got<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:29.340> nice<00:00:30.150> reflection<00:00:30.510> coating<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.320> it

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
got a nice reflection coating on it

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.630 
got a nice reflection coating on it
which<00:00:31.679> will<00:00:32.009> minimize<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.759> flare<00:00:33.120> ghost<00:00:33.390> and

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
which will minimize the flare ghost and

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.209 
which will minimize the flare ghost and
yeah<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.780> really<00:00:37.020> nice<00:00:37.290> piece<00:00:38.160> of

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
yeah it's a really really nice piece of

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.510 
yeah it's a really really nice piece of
kit<00:00:38.690> it<00:00:39.690> also<00:00:39.930> has<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.559> little<00:00:40.950> ring<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
kit it also has this little ring on the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.610 
kit it also has this little ring on the
outside<00:00:41.940> not<00:00:42.210> unlike<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> polarizing<00:00:43.200> filter

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
outside not unlike a polarizing filter

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.250 
outside not unlike a polarizing filter
where<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.280> can<00:00:44.520> literally<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.629> turn<00:00:46.110> it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
where you can literally just turn it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.529 
where you can literally just turn it
round<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:47.100> adjust<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.820> direction<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
round to adjust the direction of the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.600 
round to adjust the direction of the
flare<00:00:48.809> which<00:00:49.379> i<00:00:49.530> think<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.890> absolutely

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
flare which i think is absolutely

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.369 
flare which i think is absolutely
brilliant<00:00:50.960> anyway<00:00:51.960> onto<00:00:53.690> demonstration<00:00:54.690> I'm

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
brilliant anyway onto demonstration I'm

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.260 
brilliant anyway onto demonstration I'm

the<00:01:10.500> highest<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.240> I<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.810> need<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> focus<00:01:13.729> to

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
the highest and I just need to focus to

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.480 
the highest and I just need to focus to
get<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.479> clarity<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.590> shot<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.280> is

just some footage of some Christmas

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.230 
just some footage of some Christmas
lights<00:01:20.340> which<00:01:20.610> I've<00:01:20.820> got<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:23.700> show<00:01:23.970> just

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
lights which I've got and to show just

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.039 
lights which I've got and to show just
how<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.720> works<00:01:25.080> when<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.920> change<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.790> focus<00:01:27.689> on

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
how it works when I change the focus on

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.249 
how it works when I change the focus on
the<00:01:28.229> image<00:01:28.970> it's<00:01:29.970> beautiful<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:30.930> how<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
the image it's beautiful just how the

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.960 
the image it's beautiful just how the
light<00:01:31.650> sort<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.070> splits<00:01:32.520> off<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
light sort of splits off in the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.760 
light sort of splits off in the
background<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.659> foreground<00:01:33.689> as<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.500> change

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
background and foreground as I change

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.240 
background and foreground as I change
the<00:01:34.860> focus<00:01:39.259> and<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.890> one<00:01:41.040> which

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
the focus and this is the one which

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
the focus and this is the one which
we've<00:01:41.490> all<00:01:41.640> been<00:01:41.820> waiting<00:01:42.299> for<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.750> night

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
we've all been waiting for the night

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.319 
we've all been waiting for the night
shot<00:01:43.350> which<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.829> being<00:01:44.640> shot<00:01:44.790> about<00:01:45.090> 10

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
shot which is being shot about 10

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.359 
shot which is being shot about 10
o'clock<00:01:45.540> at<00:01:45.780> night<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.860> still<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
o'clock at night you can still see a

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.370 
o'clock at night you can still see a
little<00:01:47.549> bit<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.000> light<00:01:48.210> out<00:01:48.509> there<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:49.140> this

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
little bit of light out there and this

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.200 
little bit of light out there and this
is<00:01:49.439> done<00:01:49.860> with<00:01:50.070> an<00:01:50.460> f-stop<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.000> not<00:01:51.619> 0.95<00:01:53.210> which

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
is done with an f-stop of not 0.95 which

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.069 
is done with an f-stop of not 0.95 which
is<00:01:54.479> why<00:01:54.950> it's<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.729> bright<00:01:57.060> compared<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.960> lot

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
is why it's so bright compared to a lot

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.310 
is why it's so bright compared to a lot
of<00:01:58.170> other<00:01:58.350> lenses<00:01:59.210> the<00:02:00.210> sky<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.630> not<00:02:00.960> actually

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
of other lenses the sky is not actually

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.889 
of other lenses the sky is not actually
as<00:02:01.409> bright<00:02:01.680> as<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.979> appears<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.700> just<00:02:03.570> sort<00:02:03.840> of

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
as bright as it appears and just sort of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.889 
as bright as it appears and just sort of
scanning<00:02:04.409> around<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.460> show<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:05.759> what<00:02:06.750> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
scanning around just to show you what it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.660 
scanning around just to show you what it
looks<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.350> when<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.710> use<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:08.129> lens<00:02:08.399> at

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
looks like when you use this lens at
