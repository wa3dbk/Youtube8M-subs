pretty<00:00:56.460> low<00:00:56.670> calorie<00:00:57.030> for<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.540> is<00:00:57.690> great

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
tasting and really hits that spot to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.090 
tasting and really hits that spot to
allow<00:01:00.720> you<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.900> get<00:01:01.140> over<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.530> craving<00:01:01.830> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
allow you to get over that craving and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.400 
allow you to get over that craving and
move<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.360> diet<00:01:03.630> let's<00:01:04.080> have<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.229> look

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
move on with your diet let's have a look

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.680 
move on with your diet let's have a look
at<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.649> ingredients<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.180> basically<00:01:06.570> just

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
at the ingredients so basically just

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.260 
at the ingredients so basically just
three<00:01:07.200> items<00:01:07.649> here<00:01:07.800> we've<00:01:08.009> got<00:01:08.270> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
three items here we've got the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.060 
three items here we've got the
carbohydrates<00:01:09.930> rice<00:01:10.440> cakes<00:01:10.770> these<00:01:11.009> are

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
carbohydrates rice cakes these are

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.680 
carbohydrates rice cakes these are
gluten-free<00:01:11.550> so<00:01:11.970> at<00:01:12.090> least<00:01:12.180> we<00:01:12.360> don't<00:01:12.509> have<00:01:12.570> to

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:12.690 
gluten-free so at least we don't have to

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.570 
gluten-free so at least we don't have to
feel<00:01:12.869> too<00:01:13.110> guilty<00:01:13.259> about<00:01:13.530> overloading<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
feel too guilty about overloading on the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.300 
feel too guilty about overloading on the
carbs<00:01:14.940> plus<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:16.170> rice<00:01:16.710> cakes<00:01:17.009> we're<00:01:17.190> only

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
carbs plus for rice cakes we're only

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.609 
carbs plus for rice cakes we're only
looking<00:01:17.490> at<00:01:17.910> 30<00:01:18.300> grams<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.750> carbohydrates<00:01:19.440> so

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
looking at 30 grams of carbohydrates so

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.490 
looking at 30 grams of carbohydrates so
it's<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.830> too<00:01:20.009> bad<00:01:20.190> at<00:01:20.430> all<00:01:20.960> we<00:01:21.960> got<00:01:22.110> some<00:01:22.289> nut
