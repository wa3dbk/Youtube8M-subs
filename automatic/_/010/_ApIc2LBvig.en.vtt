00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 good my trajectory I think she 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.550
 It started in my mother's belly. 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.080
 so one thing that I see inside the 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.679
 her belly already thinking maybe 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.490
 space occupying space of that my mother 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.080
 I left work very early, I left work 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.590
 so I started working on the first 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.260
 I graduated from college and started doing 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.140
 and has always been creating products always 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.180
 creating in people's behavior 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.990
 and then I sang with this story 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.099
 capacity and was working well and there 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.559
 I stopped more 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.520
 I already did many scenarios for parades 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.120
 fashion 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.059
 I used to do a lot of stores and buy brands. 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.829
 right national brands to Brazil the people 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.570
 with many franchises 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.850
 there are many restaurants and there 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.829
 who made me a person so I think 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.480
 thought is here talking to this 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.059
 public giant, right? 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.399
 It's the television I went to do a program 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.170
 of transformation of houses but I went 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.449
 make a television program thinking 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.949
 exactly what I thought I would include 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.290
 human being bring the references 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.360
 Brazilians may exist 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.430
 differentiated has worked 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.350
 very successful and trying to bring 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.439
 very simple elements for daily life 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.200
 of these people bringing the essential 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.600
 bringing comfort to dignity and thus 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.090
 that I think of the design people imagine 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.729
 that the design is just a product believed 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.829
 who leaves with relationships to draw new 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.240
 relations with the new world around 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.610
 product that we create in our 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.280
 office a reference to culture 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.740
 to the Brazilian people 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.659
 traditional knowledge but bringing 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.460
 always a contemporary footprint is that the 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.799
 our look that the world that we live 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.390
 today is the people here from the office we 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.659
 we were very happy with the invitation from 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.240
 It's okay to create this 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.710
 important thermal bag is not 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.619
 simply a thermal bag for 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.560
 several senses for various reasons 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.689
 first by what it achieves 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.969
 public that reaches the amount of 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.230
 people we reach by communicating 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.600
 communicating by a 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.660
 large amount of people what is the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.540
 our country is not a bit of the textures 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.670
 It's a really cool challenge. 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.010
 important for us, I'm very 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.050
 happy to know that many people in this 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.720
 Brazil will leave is a piece of ours 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.210
 thought of this thought of this Brazil 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.240
 how innovation is a company like the sound 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.620
 have website design think of innovation think 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.870
 that the way of the world there is not 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.510
 if you want to see the bag and the bag is 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.270
 this bag we talk design 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:39.090
 essential because we 're talking about 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.800
 texture pattern are several several 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.480
 Looks do not think the cool thing is each 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.910
 look to understand who wants 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.620
 despite our understanding here 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.620
 people can understand that as the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.200
 plots texture loom nÃ© that 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.330
 made by the women in their 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.490
 is with the threads with the works of yarn ne 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.010
 that handy thing is weaving the 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.900
 your story that cadence of your life 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.540
 thinking about your life that touches 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.730
 house in the interior or even in the 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.540
 big city anyway any corner that 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.120
 tc is to build a nelma one 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.770
 memory thinking construction 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.020
 so I think it 's a bit of that 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.390
 represents our stamp these 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.670
 memories that look these people 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:24.209
 are in these thoughts people are 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.500
 have made of td being their tissues 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.940
 finally 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:31.080
 so this is what we thought 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.000
 for the sound bag is a bit of itself 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.440
 these fragments of what are our that 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.860
 It's our Brazil. 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.590
 this great network in this great 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.980
 the story of this story of the 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.980
 our country
