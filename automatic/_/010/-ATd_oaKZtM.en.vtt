00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
hi everybody this is gary fong and had a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.720 
hi everybody this is gary fong and had a
question<00:00:16.109> what<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.279> difference<00:00:17.640> between

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
question what is the difference between

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.210 
question what is the difference between
the<00:00:18.300> lightsphere<00:00:18.630> collapsible<00:00:19.010> versus<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
the lightsphere collapsible versus the

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.660 
the lightsphere collapsible versus the
light<00:00:20.430> sphere<00:00:20.609> universal<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:22.670> most

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
light sphere universal and most

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.519 
light sphere universal and most
particularly<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.480> cloud<00:00:24.720> which<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.140> half<00:00:25.320> pad

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
particularly the cloud which is half pad

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.800 
particularly the cloud which is half pad
so<00:00:25.710> I'll<00:00:25.830> explain<00:00:26.099> really<00:00:26.519> quickly<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.660> this

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
so I'll explain really quickly in this

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.990 
so I'll explain really quickly in this
video<00:00:28.109> what<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> differences<00:00:28.949> are<00:00:29.130> first<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
video what the differences are first of

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.849 
video what the differences are first of
all<00:00:30.119> this<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> third<00:00:30.900> generation<00:00:30.929> light

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
all this is the third generation light

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.340 
all this is the third generation light
sphere<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.610> lights<00:00:32.820> are<00:00:33.030> universal<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.079> the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
sphere the lights are universal and the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.410 
sphere the lights are universal and the
lights<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.680> universal<00:00:35.430> has<00:00:35.640> our<00:00:35.820> unique<00:00:36.210> and

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
lights are universal has our unique and

patented the strap and band approach for

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.479 
patented the strap and band approach for
the<00:00:41.790> mounting<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.800> here<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
the mounting and you can see on here the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.190 
the mounting and you can see on here the
basically<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.180> way<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.420> works<00:00:45.450> there's<00:00:46.020> no

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
basically the way it works there's no

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.350 
basically the way it works there's no
velcro<00:00:46.800> actually<00:00:47.250> on<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.670> unit<00:00:47.969> there's<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
velcro actually on the unit there's a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.229 
velcro actually on the unit there's a
band<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.870> then<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.559> strap<00:00:49.829> goes<00:00:49.860> around<00:00:50.239> and

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
band and then the strap goes around and

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.270 
band and then the strap goes around and
when<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.690> pull<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.079> like<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.800> becomes

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
when you pull on it like this it becomes

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.830 
when you pull on it like this it becomes
very<00:00:53.969> very<00:00:54.270> tight

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
very very tight

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.020 
very very tight
in<00:00:54.989> fact<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.469> so<00:00:55.649> tight<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.219> I<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.910> hold

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
in fact it's so tight that I can hold

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.670 
in fact it's so tight that I can hold
the<00:00:57.149> camera<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.260> it's<00:00:58.500> not

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
the camera up like this and it's not

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.950 
the camera up like this and it's not
gonna<00:00:58.829> fall<00:00:59.070> off<00:00:59.280> so<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.390> that's<00:01:00.570> not<00:01:00.809> gonna

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
gonna fall off so if that's not gonna

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.540 
gonna fall off so if that's not gonna
fall<00:01:01.260> off<00:01:01.469> then<00:01:01.739> it's<00:01:01.890> certainly<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.399> gonna

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
fall off then it's certainly not gonna

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.670 
fall off then it's certainly not gonna
fall<00:01:02.820> off<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.180> use<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.780> was<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
fall off in use and this was in the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.140 
fall off in use and this was in the
third<00:01:04.890> generation<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> big

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
third generation this was a big

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.179 
third generation this was a big
innovation<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:06.960> had<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.470> diffuser<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
innovation that we had a diffuser that

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.660 
innovation that we had a diffuser that
would<00:01:08.490> not<00:01:08.670> fall<00:01:08.909> off<00:01:09.380> the<00:01:10.460> lights<00:01:11.460> are

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
would not fall off the lights are

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.539 
would not fall off the lights are
collapsible<00:01:12.210> has<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.439> white<00:01:14.400> die<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:16.130> so<00:01:17.130> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
collapsible has a white die and so you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.190 
collapsible has a white die and so you
can<00:01:17.700> kind<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.450> right<00:01:18.630> here<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.110> you

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
can kind of see right here that you

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.289 
can kind of see right here that you
can't<00:01:19.439> see<00:01:19.650> my<00:01:19.799> fingers<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:21.090> put<00:01:21.240> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
can't see my fingers to it we put the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.300 
can't see my fingers to it we put the
white<00:01:21.540> dye<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.020> because<00:01:22.380> what<00:01:22.560> happens<00:01:22.920> on

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
white dye in because what happens on

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.300 
white dye in because what happens on
that<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.540> automn<00:01:25.409> actually

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
that is that the automn actually

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.670 
that is that the automn actually
disperses<00:01:26.909> light<00:01:27.119> around<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.140> bit<00:01:28.380> more

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
disperses light around a little bit more

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.580 
disperses light around a little bit more
simply<00:01:29.670> because<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.180> diet<00:01:30.390> so<00:01:31.350> White's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
simply because of the diet so White's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.880 
simply because of the diet so White's
your<00:01:31.860> universal<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.640> dome<00:01:32.850> fits<00:01:33.810> with<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
your universal the dome fits with the

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.030 
your universal the dome fits with the
cup<00:01:35.400> on<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.670> inside<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:37.770> nice

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
cup on the inside and so it's it's nice

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.420 
cup on the inside and so it's it's nice
because<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:39.600> compact<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.530> it<00:01:41.130> kind<00:01:41.369> of

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
because it is compact and it kind of

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.060 
because it is compact and it kind of
stays<00:01:41.670> out<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.060> way<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.960> gives<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.829> a

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
stays out of the way and gives you a

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.609 
stays out of the way and gives you a
very<00:01:44.520> very<00:01:44.759> nice<00:01:45.060> light<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:46.380> when<00:01:46.500> you're

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
very very nice light for when you're

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.340 
very very nice light for when you're
shooting<00:01:46.770> forwards<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:48.329> gives<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.990> basically

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
shooting forwards it gives you basically

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.740 
shooting forwards it gives you basically
this<00:01:49.590> very<00:01:49.890> flat<00:01:50.369> ball<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:51.119> because<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
this very flat ball but because of the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.469 
this very flat ball but because of the
fact<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.409> inverted<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
fact that it's inverted and this is the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.690 
fact that it's inverted and this is the
actual<00:01:55.140> center<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> dome<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.130> closer<00:01:56.430> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
actual center of the dome is closer to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.370 
actual center of the dome is closer to
the<00:01:56.820> flash<00:01:57.090> there<00:01:57.719> becomes<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.140> little<00:01:58.259> bit

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the flash there becomes a little bit

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.260 
the flash there becomes a little bit
more<00:01:58.500> of<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.829> hot<00:01:59.009> spot<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.579> center<00:01:59.939> where

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
more of a hot spot in the center where

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.700 
more of a hot spot in the center where
the<00:02:00.299> lights<00:02:00.509> were<00:02:00.689> collapsible<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.530> can

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
the lights were collapsible you can

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.889 
the lights were collapsible you can
mount<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.159> dome<00:02:02.369> either<00:02:02.700> straight<00:02:03.689> up<00:02:03.719> or

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
mount the dome either straight up or

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.709 
mount the dome either straight up or
down<00:02:04.200> both<00:02:05.159> ways<00:02:05.399> when<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.060> advantage<00:02:06.540> to

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
down both ways when the advantage to

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.919 
down both ways when the advantage to
having<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:08.069> this<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.720> can

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
having it up like this is that you can

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.440 
having it up like this is that you can
have<00:02:10.110> basically<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.860> larger<00:02:11.310> diffuser<00:02:11.670> see<00:02:12.150> the

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
have basically a larger diffuser see the

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.979 
have basically a larger diffuser see the
sighs<00:02:12.959> and<00:02:13.379> so<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:15.030> basically<00:02:15.209> becomes<00:02:15.780> a

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
sighs and so it it basically becomes a

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.960 
sighs and so it it basically becomes a
larger<00:02:16.319> ball<00:02:16.610> secondly<00:02:17.610> when<00:02:17.849> you're

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
larger ball secondly when you're

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.780 
larger ball secondly when you're
shooting<00:02:18.090> fill<00:02:18.480> flash<00:02:18.660> out<00:02:19.019> doors<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.440> say

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
shooting fill flash out doors that say

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.610 
shooting fill flash out doors that say
distances<00:02:20.790> greater<00:02:21.120> than<00:02:21.360> eight<00:02:21.510> feet<00:02:21.810> when

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
distances greater than eight feet when

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.729 
distances greater than eight feet when
you<00:02:22.709> aim<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.010> forward<00:02:23.489> you<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.290> more<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.319> a

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
you aim it forward you have more of a

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.190 
you aim it forward you have more of a
white<00:02:26.160> ball<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:26.760> when<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.090> happens<00:02:27.510> you've

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
white ball and when that happens you've

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.470 
white ball and when that happens you've
got<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.470> softer<00:02:29.010> light<00:02:29.190> simply<00:02:29.670> because<00:02:30.030> it's

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
got a softer light simply because it's

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.330 
got a softer light simply because it's
further<00:02:30.780> away<00:02:31.080> from<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.410> flash<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.069> fills

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
further away from the flash and it fills

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.699 
further away from the flash and it fills
the<00:02:32.519> bowl<00:02:32.730> much<00:02:33.450> more<00:02:33.720> evenly<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.319> clearer

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
the bowl much more evenly a clearer

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.830 
the bowl much more evenly a clearer
material<00:02:35.190> now<00:02:35.400> from<00:02:35.790> there<00:02:36.030> it<00:02:36.239> may<00:02:36.510> look<00:02:36.690> like

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
material now from there it may look like

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.600 
material now from there it may look like
it's<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.140> frosted<00:02:37.620> white<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:38.099> it's<00:02:38.250> not<00:02:38.400> that's

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
it's a frosted white but it's not that's

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.330 
it's a frosted white but it's not that's
actually<00:02:39.000> kind<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.299> the<00:02:40.019> effect<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.860> what

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
actually kind of the effect of what

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.070 
actually kind of the effect of what
we've<00:02:41.519> done<00:02:41.730> here<00:02:42.060> now<00:02:42.209> what<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:42.480> did<00:02:42.720> was<00:02:42.930> I

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
we've done here now what I did was I

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.830 
we've done here now what I did was I
invented<00:02:43.620> these<00:02:44.129> armed<00:02:44.599> horizontal<00:02:45.599> rings

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
invented these armed horizontal rings

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.000 
invented these armed horizontal rings
and<00:02:46.140> what<00:02:46.260> happens<00:02:46.560> with<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.769> horizontal

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
and what happens with the horizontal

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.370 
and what happens with the horizontal
rings<00:02:47.459> is<00:02:47.910> they're<00:02:48.150> like<00:02:48.299> neon<00:02:48.720> tubes<00:02:49.110> when

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
rings is they're like neon tubes when

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.440 
rings is they're like neon tubes when
the<00:02:49.470> light<00:02:49.650> comes<00:02:49.890> up<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.370> goes<00:02:50.880> into<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
the light comes up and goes into the

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.750 
the light comes up and goes into the
bowl<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:52.200> basically<00:02:52.650> picks<00:02:52.980> up<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.340> light<00:02:53.489> on

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
bowl it basically picks up the light on

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.430 
bowl it basically picks up the light on
the<00:02:53.849> bottom<00:02:54.120> side<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.630> ridges<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.170> lights

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
the bottom side of the ridges and lights

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.289 
the bottom side of the ridges and lights
the<00:02:55.530> whole<00:02:55.650> thing<00:02:55.950> up<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.370> lights<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:56.970> up<00:02:57.030> very

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
the whole thing up and lights it up very

00:02:57.299 --> 00:02:59.360 
the whole thing up and lights it up very
evenly<00:02:57.630> but<00:02:58.140> what's<00:02:58.349> nice<00:02:58.500> about<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:59.010> is<00:02:59.160> that

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
evenly but what's nice about it is that

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.850 
evenly but what's nice about it is that
it's<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.760> clear<00:03:00.030> material<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:01.049> that<00:03:01.319> it<00:03:01.590> does

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
it's a clear material so that it does

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.000 
it's a clear material so that it does
not<00:03:01.910> take<00:03:02.910> any<00:03:03.120> energy<00:03:03.840> away<00:03:04.200> from<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.769> flash

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
not take any energy away from the flash

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.220 
not take any energy away from the flash
and<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:06.480> absence<00:03:06.930> of<00:03:07.110> dye<00:03:07.319> is<00:03:07.650> very<00:03:07.950> very<00:03:09.230> good

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
and the absence of dye is very very good

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.740 
and the absence of dye is very very good
in<00:03:10.799> fact<00:03:11.130> any<00:03:11.430> other<00:03:11.610> diffuser<00:03:12.209> that's<00:03:12.569> out

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
in fact any other diffuser that's out

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.900 
in fact any other diffuser that's out
there<00:03:12.930> including<00:03:13.410> our<00:03:13.560> prior<00:03:14.040> models<00:03:14.579> had<00:03:14.880> a

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
there including our prior models had a

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.940 
there including our prior models had a
white<00:03:15.209> dye<00:03:15.420> in<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.530> fact<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.799> we

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
white dye in it and the fact that we

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.949 
white dye in it and the fact that we
were<00:03:17.040> able<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.280> do<00:03:17.519> this<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.090> make<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.450> clear

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
were able to do this and make it clear

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.610 
were able to do this and make it clear
but<00:03:19.230> still<00:03:19.560> soft<00:03:19.889> and<00:03:20.450> by<00:03:21.450> softness<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.139> we<00:03:22.290> you

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
but still soft and by softness is we you

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.080 
but still soft and by softness is we you
know<00:03:22.739> we<00:03:22.889> want<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.130> have<00:03:23.310> the<00:03:23.459> lights<00:03:23.670> spread

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
know we want to have the lights spread

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.390 
know we want to have the lights spread
completely<00:03:24.750> around<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.170> bowl<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:26.040> we<00:03:26.280> were

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
completely around the bowl that we were

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.520 
completely around the bowl that we were
able<00:03:26.639> to<00:03:26.670> do<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:28.170> lightsphere

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
able to do that the lightsphere

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.990 
able to do that the lightsphere
collapsible<00:03:29.150> obviously<00:03:30.150> is<00:03:30.750> collapsible<00:03:32.000> and

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
collapsible obviously is collapsible and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000 
collapsible obviously is collapsible and
that's<00:03:33.780> one<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.170> key<00:03:34.319> features<00:03:34.739> is<00:03:34.980> that

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
that's one of the key features is that

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.180 
that's one of the key features is that
it<00:03:35.549> was<00:03:35.970> it<00:03:36.180> was<00:03:36.299> widely<00:03:36.569> asked<00:03:37.109> for<00:03:37.319> a<00:03:37.560> tamper

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
it was it was widely asked for a tamper

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.520 
it was it was widely asked for a tamper
collapsible<00:03:38.790> but<00:03:39.569> it<00:03:39.690> mounts<00:03:40.049> very<00:03:40.260> easily

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
collapsible but it mounts very easily

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.629 
collapsible but it mounts very easily
this<00:03:41.190> is<00:03:41.250> a<00:03:41.430> nikon<00:03:42.030> sb-910<00:03:43.250> there<00:03:44.250> is<00:03:44.400> out

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
this is a nikon sb-910 there is out

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.940 
this is a nikon sb-910 there is out
there<00:03:44.670> maybe<00:03:45.480> what<00:03:46.170> might<00:03:46.319> be<00:03:46.470> close<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.829> was

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
there maybe what might be close to was

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.210 
there maybe what might be close to was
the<00:03:47.100> canon<00:03:47.489> 600<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:49.350> mount<00:03:49.560> it<00:03:49.739> I<00:03:49.859> just<00:03:50.100> go

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
the canon 600 and to mount it I just go

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.250 
the canon 600 and to mount it I just go
like<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:51.359> I<00:03:51.389> push<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:51.810> on<00:03:51.930> you<00:03:52.079> notice

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
like that so I push it on you notice

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.020 
like that so I push it on you notice
that<00:03:52.470> put<00:03:52.620> it<00:03:52.680> on<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:52.889> 45<00:03:53.280> degree<00:03:53.400> angle<00:03:53.880> and

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
that put it on a 45 degree angle and
