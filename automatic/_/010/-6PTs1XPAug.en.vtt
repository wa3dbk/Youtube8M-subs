for<00:00:37.339> me<00:00:37.400> the<00:00:37.730> most<00:00:37.910> important<00:00:38.420> thing<00:00:38.480> when

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
for me the most important thing when

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.860 
for me the most important thing when
we're<00:00:39.230> looking<00:00:39.530> at<00:00:40.270> teaching<00:00:41.270> people<00:00:41.450> to<00:00:41.660> ride

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
we're looking at teaching people to ride

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.990 
we're looking at teaching people to ride
is<00:00:42.110> the<00:00:42.320> absorption<00:00:42.770> of<00:00:42.829> the<00:00:42.980> movement<00:00:43.430> from

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
is the absorption of the movement from

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.490 
is the absorption of the movement from
the<00:00:44.180> absorption<00:00:44.450> the<00:00:44.809> movement<00:00:45.230> comes

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
the absorption the movement comes

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.590 
the absorption the movement comes
balance<00:00:46.039> and<00:00:46.250> from<00:00:46.489> balance<00:00:46.760> comes<00:00:47.059> position

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
balance and from balance comes position

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.080 
balance and from balance comes position
but<00:00:48.289> if<00:00:48.590> the<00:00:48.950> saddle<00:00:49.160> is<00:00:49.309> pulling<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.730> rider

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
but if the saddle is pulling the rider

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.540 
but if the saddle is pulling the rider
out<00:00:50.210> of<00:00:50.450> balance<00:00:50.719> all<00:00:50.899> of<00:00:51.050> the<00:00:51.170> time<00:00:51.550> neither

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
out of balance all of the time neither

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.010 
out of balance all of the time neither
position<00:00:53.030> nor<00:00:53.180> balance<00:00:53.510> are<00:00:53.660> going<00:00:53.809> to<00:00:53.899> be

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
position nor balance are going to be

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.580 
position nor balance are going to be
possible

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
possible

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.340 
possible
so<00:00:55.129> if<00:00:55.520> only<00:00:55.969> Sadler's<00:00:56.360> would<00:00:56.570> realize<00:00:56.960> what

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
so if only Sadler's would realize what

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.750 
so if only Sadler's would realize what
they're<00:00:57.530> actually<00:00:57.649> doing<00:00:57.860> to<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.309> rider<00:00:58.520> and

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
they're actually doing to the rider and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.040 
they're actually doing to the rider and
so<00:00:58.940> many<00:00:59.149> riders<00:00:59.359> you'll<00:00:59.690> hear<00:00:59.899> the

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
so many riders you'll hear the

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.510 
so many riders you'll hear the
instructors<00:01:00.590> saying<00:01:00.829> to<00:01:00.949> them<00:01:01.070> lower<00:01:01.280> leg

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
instructors saying to them lower leg

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.939 
instructors saying to them lower leg
back<00:01:01.760> lower<00:01:02.180> leg<00:01:02.420> back<00:01:02.690> when<00:01:03.379> in<00:01:03.530> fact<00:01:03.739> it's

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:03.949 
back lower leg back when in fact it's

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:05.170 
back lower leg back when in fact it's
the<00:01:04.039> saddle<00:01:04.369> that's<00:01:04.550> pulling<00:01:04.729> the<00:01:04.879> rider<00:01:05.059> out

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
the saddle that's pulling the rider out

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.870 
the saddle that's pulling the rider out
of<00:01:05.420> balance<00:01:05.750> and<00:01:05.960> if<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.920> rider<00:01:07.130> is<00:01:07.550> not<00:01:07.850> a

up-and-down movement of the horses back

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.670 
up-and-down movement of the horses back
because<00:04:23.060> if<00:04:23.419> not<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.870> rider<00:04:24.050> will<00:04:24.229> bounce<00:04:24.409> in

the saddle and by flexing the lower back
in<00:04:28.070> exactly<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.729> same<00:04:28.940> way<00:04:29.150> as<00:04:29.300> we<00:04:29.479> do<00:04:29.630> when<00:04:29.870> we

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
in exactly the same way as we do when we

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.680 
in exactly the same way as we do when we

it<00:04:33.829> means<00:04:34.099> that<00:04:34.339> the<00:04:34.549> movement<00:04:35.299> of<00:04:35.419> the<00:04:35.539> horse

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:35.689 
it means that the movement of the horse

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:38.709 
it means that the movement of the horse
is<00:04:36.399> absorbed<00:04:37.399> that<00:04:37.579> the<00:04:37.729> riders<00:04:38.089> seat<00:04:38.299> remains

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:10.249 
there again it's much easier once we

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:11.979 
there again it's much easier once we
start<00:05:10.519> the<00:05:10.609> machines<00:05:10.939> but<00:05:11.479> it's<00:05:11.599> easier<00:05:11.929> to

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:11.989 
start the machines but it's easier to

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:14.679 
start the machines but it's easier to
just<00:05:12.649> describe<00:05:13.099> it<00:05:13.249> at<00:05:13.849> the<00:05:14.029> halt<00:05:14.209> before<00:05:14.569> we

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:14.689 
just describe it at the halt before we

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:18.699 
just describe it at the halt before we
start<00:05:14.959> the<00:05:15.169> simulator<00:05:15.799> so<00:05:16.729> it's<00:05:17.089> one<00:05:17.629> two<00:05:18.229> one

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:18.709 
start the simulator so it's one two one

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:21.969 
start the simulator so it's one two one
two<00:05:18.949> one<00:05:19.519> two<00:05:20.359> and<00:05:20.569> that<00:05:21.109> is<00:05:21.169> in<00:05:21.529> actual<00:05:21.859> fact

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
two one two and that is in actual fact

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.919 
two one two and that is in actual fact
the<00:05:22.189> same<00:05:22.429> movement<00:05:22.909> that<00:05:22.969> you<00:05:23.089> make<00:05:23.119> when

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:23.929 
the same movement that you make when

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:26.619 
the same movement that you make when
you're<00:05:24.109> running<00:05:24.319> on<00:05:24.619> foot<00:05:24.979> and<00:05:25.249> the<00:05:26.209> faster

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:26.629 
you're running on foot and the faster

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:28.899 
you're running on foot and the faster
you<00:05:26.719> run<00:05:26.929> the<00:05:27.409> longer<00:05:28.099> the<00:05:28.219> strides<00:05:28.519> you<00:05:28.669> take

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
you run the longer the strides you take

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.119 
you run the longer the strides you take
the<00:05:29.119> more<00:05:29.299> your<00:05:29.449> back<00:05:29.629> will<00:05:29.869> flex<00:05:29.899> in<00:05:30.409> very

00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:31.129 
the more your back will flex in very

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:32.589 
the more your back will flex in very
much<00:05:31.339> the<00:05:31.609> same<00:05:31.819> as<00:05:32.029> if<00:05:32.179> we're<00:05:32.359> trying<00:05:32.389> to

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
much the same as if we're trying to

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:34.299 
much the same as if we're trying to
absorb<00:05:32.719> the<00:05:33.049> movement<00:05:33.379> in<00:05:33.469> extended<00:05:33.979> trot<00:05:34.159> on

00:05:34.299 --> 00:05:34.309 
absorb the movement in extended trot on

00:05:34.309 --> 00:05:36.429 
absorb the movement in extended trot on
a<00:05:34.339> horse<00:05:34.639> or<00:05:35.359> if<00:05:35.689> you<00:05:35.809> were<00:05:35.929> running<00:05:36.229> on<00:05:36.319> the

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:36.439 
a horse or if you were running on the

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.049 
a horse or if you were running on the
spot<00:05:36.709> it<00:05:36.949> would<00:05:37.069> make<00:05:37.219> a<00:05:37.249> very<00:05:37.339> small<00:05:37.610> movement

00:05:38.049 --> 00:05:38.059 
spot it would make a very small movement

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.439 
spot it would make a very small movement
very<00:05:39.049> much<00:05:39.349> like<00:05:39.649> we<00:05:40.339> would<00:05:40.519> be<00:05:40.669> making<00:05:40.849> if<00:05:41.269> we

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
very much like we would be making if we

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:43.359 
very much like we would be making if we
were<00:05:41.569> riding<00:05:42.139> a<00:05:42.199> horse<00:05:42.319> in<00:05:42.619> Piaf<00:05:42.889> which<00:05:43.189> is<00:05:43.339> a

were riding a horse in Piaf which is a
trot<00:05:43.699> on<00:05:43.819> the<00:05:44.029> spot<00:05:44.319> so<00:05:45.319> the<00:05:45.799> amount<00:05:46.369> of

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:46.549 
trot on the spot so the amount of

00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:49.079 
trot on the spot so the amount of
deflection<00:05:46.879> that<00:05:47.809> the<00:05:47.929> back<00:05:48.139> has<00:05:48.409> to<00:05:48.559> make<00:05:48.769> is

deflection that the back has to make is

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:51.579 
deflection that the back has to make is
dictated<00:05:50.089> entirely<00:05:50.509> by<00:05:50.779> amount<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.349> amount

the place the lower legs start to flat

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.929 
the place the lower legs start to flat
because<00:06:14.989> what<00:06:15.679> happens<00:06:16.159> is<00:06:16.339> as<00:06:16.609> I<00:06:16.729> push

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:16.939

because what happens is as I push
Laura's<00:06:17.359> back<00:06:17.539> in<00:06:17.809> a<00:06:18.229> seat<00:06:18.829> bone<00:06:19.009> slide

00:06:19.269 --> 00:06:19.279 
Laura's back in a seat bone slide

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.979 
Laura's back in a seat bone slide
forward<00:06:19.639> together<00:06:19.759> as<00:06:20.179> I<00:06:20.359> pull<00:06:20.569> it<00:06:20.659> back<00:06:20.689> out

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:20.989 
forward together as I pull it back out

00:06:20.989 --> 00:06:23.319 
forward together as I pull it back out
again<00:06:21.079> a<00:06:21.709> seat<00:06:22.309> bones<00:06:22.519> slide<00:06:22.789> back<00:06:23.059> together

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:23.329 
again a seat bones slide back together

00:06:23.329 --> 00:06:25.719 
again a seat bones slide back together
and<00:06:23.809> so<00:06:24.349> the<00:06:24.469> knees<00:06:24.709> drop<00:06:24.949> down<00:06:25.249> as<00:06:25.429> the<00:06:25.549> seat

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
and so the knees drop down as the seat

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:27.399 
and so the knees drop down as the seat
bones<00:06:25.939> slide<00:06:26.179> forward<00:06:26.659> and<00:06:26.809> the<00:06:27.019> knees<00:06:27.199> come

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:27.409 
bones slide forward and the knees come

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:29.189 
bones slide forward and the knees come
up<00:06:27.439> again<00:06:27.799> as<00:06:28.009> the<00:06:28.189> seat<00:06:28.369> bones<00:06:28.549> slide<00:06:28.819> back

00:06:29.189 --> 00:06:29.199 
up again as the seat bones slide back

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.359 
up again as the seat bones slide back
consequently<00:06:30.199> the<00:06:30.379> lower<00:06:30.529> leg<00:06:30.739> flaps<00:06:31.069> like

00:06:31.359 --> 00:06:31.369 
consequently the lower leg flaps like

00:06:31.369 --> 00:06:33.189 
consequently the lower leg flaps like
that<00:06:31.699> and<00:06:31.939> the<00:06:32.299> movement<00:06:32.689> starts<00:06:32.959> to<00:06:33.079> be

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 
that and the movement starts to be

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.689 
that and the movement starts to be
absorbed<00:06:33.589> here<00:06:33.859> through<00:06:34.129> the<00:06:34.279> neck<00:06:34.459> and<00:06:34.639> the

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 
absorbed here through the neck and the

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:36.549 
absorbed here through the neck and the
shoulders<00:06:35.179> consequently<00:06:36.169> you<00:06:36.259> get<00:06:36.439> this

00:06:36.549 --> 00:06:36.559 
shoulders consequently you get this

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:39.609 
shoulders consequently you get this
horrible<00:06:36.919> nodding<00:06:37.339> head<00:06:38.079> that<00:06:39.079> happens<00:06:39.439> often

00:06:39.609 --> 00:06:39.619 
horrible nodding head that happens often

00:06:39.619 --> 00:06:41.949 
horrible nodding head that happens often
in<00:06:39.859> dressage<00:06:40.069> riders<00:06:40.729> and<00:06:40.939> the<00:06:41.539> whole<00:06:41.749> body

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:41.959 
in dressage riders and the whole body

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:44.469 
in dressage riders and the whole body
seems<00:06:42.319> to<00:06:42.439> be<00:06:42.589> moving<00:06:42.739> so<00:06:43.069> much<00:06:43.279> more<00:06:43.610> now<00:06:44.239> if<00:06:44.360> I

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
seems to be moving so much more now if I

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.299 
seems to be moving so much more now if I
just<00:06:44.539> stabilize<00:06:45.199> her<00:06:45.379> position<00:06:45.829> again<00:06:46.069> there

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:46.309 
just stabilize her position again there

00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.719 
just stabilize her position again there
and

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
and

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:49.029 
and
Aska<00:06:47.240> to<00:06:47.360> move<00:06:47.509> the<00:06:47.689> seat<00:06:47.930> bones<00:06:48.139> unilaterally

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 
Aska to move the seat bones unilaterally
