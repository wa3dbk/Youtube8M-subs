00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.000
 no greeting to all of you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.889
 small series of tutorials without being 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.470
 necessarily didactic neither left arm 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.820
 just so he imputes to him alone 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.010
 is rather who want to work all 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.750
 the figures of strict burqa August 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.300
 we will start to the series with 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.359
 cladding exercises takes advantage for 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.230
 the structure part is released static 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.670
 I'm still in force and at the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.009
 dynamic and we will not end up 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.660
 households in this sense of the moment of strict 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.840
 with the garage 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.620
 thank you to 2 8 first boards of this 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.809
 static cladding work with the most 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.760
 simplistic boards in position on 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.680
 the forearms the arms position of 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.940
 the width of the shoulders the feet of the 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.920
 width of the hips and there we are 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.050
 quietly waiting for the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.079
 horse dealer of ice or 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:01.020
 sweet drinks all to become fat 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:03.149
 and not done second progression 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.850
 possible with this time hands 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.770
 position at the edge of the belt 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.740
 shoulder scapular and one keeps 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.840
 always straight in the right body 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.950
 with a time that spoke 30 seconds 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.950
 two minutes 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.630
 the third position of boards will see 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.549
 the thin ahead and well beyond the 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.130
 shoulder line and the same challenge 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.360
 it's having the time of mattel the most 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.280
 long possible and finally to finish 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.720
 this first series of boards in 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.189
 look for the hands as far as possible 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:37.020
 to bring the bust closer to the ground as much 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.759
 the work of abdominal sheathing is 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.570
 important as much lumbar 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.450
 it is just as 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.149
 little work at the Roman chain this 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.520
 device we will come block the heels 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.560
 correctly we go down the bust the most 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.350
 down as possible and we go back up by being in 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.840
 perfect straightness and we maintain the 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.430
 body for a time ranging from 30 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.590
 seconds to two minutes 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.840
 other possibility by going for a 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.149
 extreme amplitude the departure and 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.099
 the highest possible arrival with 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.050
 open arms on the sides 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:11.970
 in the continuity of work started 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.700
 for the lumbar we will work here 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.370
 on the soil in floral water with a 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.239
 first position that will see us 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.370
 put your hands on your stomach under the 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.720
 chin in support and we come up the 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.450
 top of the bust taking care to have 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.890
 the contracted ischios as well as the 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.930
 gluteus and thereby lumbar 1 to 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.760
 also put the arms expected in 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.480
 jesus christ version and the caravan 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.700
 also passes a possibility of 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.230
 work the lower body with the 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.480
 lifting and contraction of limbs 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.760
 inferior people are tight to me 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.360
 attached is tense and we will keep on 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.190
 a job from 10 to 60 seconds 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.040
 and finally to create a species of 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.170
 dynamism in this contraction work 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.600
 lumbar and upper bust a 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.569
 simultaneous movement of elevation from the top 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.769
 and lower body for a series of 12 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:12.900
 at 15 rehearsal and we're venturing out of 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:14.519
 sheathing with all audi then the hollow 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.440
 body is a movement that conjugate 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.370
 two ways in static or in 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.720
 dynamic 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.549
 the idea is to have a v like lift 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.560
 victory and we will work so 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.470
 static by having the arms extended the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.709
 people tense for a time ranging from 45 to 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.560
 90 seconds also a version 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.359
 dynamic in quarter time the body with 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.810
 the palm of your hand coming to touch the top 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.810
 Shins 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.040
 during the series I like the sheathing and I 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.640
 prove 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.040
 here is the dragon flag exercise popularized 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.010
 by the little dragon aka mister love 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.079
 bruce lee with a position that 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.030
 require the use of a good dish 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.860
 come lock your hands behind the 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.370
 head trial has contacted the belt 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.860
 abdominal 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.069
 the departure is done in field of al foot 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.200
 tip and we go down we go down the most 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.230
 low possible so as to put in 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.239
 tension all the body the lift facts 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.920
 are the legs flexed and either the 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:19.709
 legs stretched and we start again for a 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:22.199
 fabulous new rehearsal of cladding 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.460
 active with case guys if that's all 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:26.130
 the world knows who is called the legacy 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.590
 wise an evolving exercise to achieve 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.330
 to get the front you the edges of the 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.820
 next way lock hands 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.430
 on the lift pull bar a 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.960
 only body block up we think 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.669
 to have your arms locked at 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.199
 departure and return of the pursuing corps 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:44.880
 so fabulous adventures 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.080
 discoveries of cladding with this time 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.599
 it betrayed on the obliques we go 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.210
 work on the parade with their six 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:52.139
 called wipers exercise meant to 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.940
 come to work hobbits 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:55.800
 priority on the lateral sides to 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.599
 right and left in simple version and 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.120
 version much harder we will get 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.030
 in the depth of lateral descent 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.020
 the demonstration right away I 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.630
 locks hands on the bar 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.370
 pull I'm riding here right angle and I 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.180
 will work in wipers at 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.280
 left and right version a little bit more 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.650
 hard with a much lower descent 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.130
 deep on each side to the left and to 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.840
 right 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.660
 opening the bassa well and having 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.660
 always obliques and abdominals 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.660
 Locked 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:28.529
 let's get into the 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.699
 abyssal depths of cladding with 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.499
 dynamic moment 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:34.110
 to do this we will use a 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:36.749
 indispensable accessory the rings the 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.879
 famous lord of the rings the lord 

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:41.539
 rings to work the cladding 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.539
 assets 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.039
 the body is placed in her legs 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:48.629
 tanned cairo we're going to 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:50.429
 water taking care to always have 

00:05:48.629 --> 00:05:53.639
 the palms of hands turned towards you 

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:56.490
 to make it a little more exercise we will 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:58.559
 proceed with adding a pea to the 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.369
 expiry date still in the process of 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:03.509
 validity is positioned the alter between 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:05.939
 ankles 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.339
 the positioning of the hands is 

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:11.159
 identical to the previous exercise 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:13.830
 the legs montalet cairo and between 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.909
 operates up a moment from china 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.749
 up in version 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.749
 she quotes 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.610
 the opposite of cladding work with 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.970
 my asset with balance on the head 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:33.550
 lark the tender and a small 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.620
 towel so as not to make too much bobo 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:39.160
 the head is an essential accessory 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.080
 the wall a climb to balance with 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.000
 hands position in triangle on 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.520
 spring out the legs and quietly one 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.980
 going stretched legs go down for the 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.830
 easiest part at this level there the 

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.300
 middle part a little lower and finally 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.490
 for the advanced part help 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.980
 we are going to seek the cairo level 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:01.830
 of the pelvis of the legs and the return against 

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.830
 the wall we finish the work 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.440
 rental of these by led allows for 

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.630
 work statically in a 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.940
 first time the dual site movement 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.070
 positioned people not the stones with 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.710
 a longest lasting posture 

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:22.120
 possible second movement a lot 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.640
 more friends than the departure is done and 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.850
 jean becker and we go up the legs in 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.560
 bus direction what is called the v6 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.240
 last exercise that still use 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.720
 pallets and that require 

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:36.760
 starting composition the identical that 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.230
 the two previous ones namely the legs 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:41.110
 tanned and we come to work in 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.230
 horizontal sweeps to the left and to 

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:43.230
 right 

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:51.880
 that's it for klan it was my series of 

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:54.490
 sheath reinforcement and strong mental 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:58.500
 on a background of old and especially 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.500
 especially nairobi
