00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.569
 Yup 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.950
 hi then i have this is one of mine 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.650
 video of which 10 in gold the video of 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.230
 channel presentation 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.020
 in this video I wanted to specify well 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.390
 the difference between orange corrector e 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.390
 peach-colored concealer 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.160
 but before launching the purchase 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.980
 of one or the other we understand well 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.950
 instead which one is really the color 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.250
 of our glasses then how to do a 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:42.940
 to establish what color they are ours 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.610
 dark circles there is a very simple method 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.700
 all you need is a mirror 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:50.760
 put yourself in natural light but not below 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:54.010
 the direct rays of the sun that can 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.100
 distort the color of the glasses e 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.780
 just look at yours carefully 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.260
 eye contour 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.299
 if the glasses are blue then he wants 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.090
 say that the most suitable corrector a 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.430
 covering them will be the orange one 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.030
 so you will want to buy a 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.450
 orange checker usually who 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.590
 suffers from ok and blue has a skin of 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.189
 medium color 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.139
 if instead your eyes are colored 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.030
 Violet 

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:28.179
 means that the most suitable concealer a 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.649
 covering them will be the yellow corrector 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:36.480
 instead the people just suffering 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:39.450
 often there are purple circles 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.440
 people who have a lot of skin 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.660
 clear 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.000
 or have skin around the eyes 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:49.620
 very thin eye contour that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.780
 then let's say let's say the 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.890
 microcirculation all the capillaries that 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:59.760
 exactly what to do under the eye 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:04.350
 for, however, when the dark circles are a 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.720
 perfect mix between blue and purple then in 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.660
 in this case we come to the rescue 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.030
 peach-colored concealer because the 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.550
 corrector peach color 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.320
 if you think about it, it's nothing but a mixture 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:22.980
 perfect between yellow and orange that I am 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.050
 just the two colors they cover 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.810
 just as we have seen the dark circles 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:32.460
 both blue and purple so if you are too 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.800
 among those girls who just don't 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.980
 manage to establish the color of the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.180
 own dark circles is likely yours 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:46.140
 dark circles will be of a color we say 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.180
 halfway between blue and purple, but 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.190
 okay with this concluded story of 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.120
 to have given you a hand and see you at 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.120
