miss<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.519> boat<00:00:36.699> when<00:00:37.329> it<00:00:37.359> comes<00:00:37.629> to<00:00:37.780> negatives

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
miss the boat when it comes to negatives

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.549 
miss the boat when it comes to negatives
so<00:00:38.729> if<00:00:39.729> you<00:00:39.999> think<00:00:40.030> that<00:00:40.809> you<00:00:40.899> just<00:00:40.929> need<00:00:41.260> to<00:00:41.440> do

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
so if you think that you just need to do

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.770 
so if you think that you just need to do
cardio<00:00:41.829> and<00:00:42.219> eat<00:00:42.429> right<00:00:42.460> to<00:00:43.089> melt<00:00:43.269> belly<00:00:43.510> fat

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
cardio and eat right to melt belly fat

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.119 
cardio and eat right to melt belly fat
and<00:00:44.050> you<00:00:44.140> just<00:00:44.289> leave<00:00:44.469> weight<00:00:44.679> training<00:00:45.039> out

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
and you just leave weight training out

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:46.770 
and you just leave weight training out
of<00:00:45.219> the<00:00:45.280> equation<00:00:45.519> you're<00:00:46.120> also<00:00:46.300> sadly

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
of the equation you're also sadly

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.270 
of the equation you're also sadly
mistaken<00:00:47.079> remember<00:00:47.769> if<00:00:47.859> all<00:00:48.010> you<00:00:48.159> do<00:00:48.249> is

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
mistaken remember if all you do is

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.279

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
cardio and eat right you have a pair or

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.139 
cardio and eat right you have a pair or
an<00:00:50.649> apple<00:00:50.800> shaped<00:00:51.129> body<00:00:51.339> you're<00:00:51.909> just<00:00:52.030> going

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
an apple shaped body you're just going

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.399 
an apple shaped body you're just going
to<00:00:52.210> shrink<00:00:52.479> down<00:00:52.690> you're<00:00:52.989> going<00:00:53.079> to<00:00:53.139> become<00:00:53.379> a

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
to shrink down you're going to become a

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.649 
to shrink down you're going to become a
smaller<00:00:53.769> pear<00:00:54.069> apple<00:00:54.579> you<00:00:54.699> have<00:00:54.969> to<00:00:55.149> tone<00:00:55.420> and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
smaller pear apple you have to tone and

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.930 
smaller pear apple you have to tone and
sculpt<00:00:56.440> what's<00:00:56.889> underneath<00:00:57.249> so<00:00:57.670> that<00:00:57.699> when

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
sculpt what's underneath so that when

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.119 
sculpt what's underneath so that when
you<00:00:58.030> do<00:00:58.299> burn<00:00:58.539> off<00:00:58.809> belly<00:00:58.839> fat<00:00:59.499> and<00:00:59.739> you<00:00:59.920> get

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
you do burn off belly fat and you get

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.819 
you do burn off belly fat and you get
lean<00:01:00.339> in<00:01:00.519> tone<00:01:00.819> you<00:01:01.359> have<00:01:01.690> some<00:01:02.350> shapely

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
lean in tone you have some shapely

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.799 
lean in tone you have some shapely
muscle<00:01:03.159> and<00:01:03.280> some<00:01:03.399> sexy<00:01:03.760> curves<00:01:03.999> to<00:01:04.269> show<00:01:04.510> for

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
muscle and some sexy curves to show for

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.300 
muscle and some sexy curves to show for
it<00:01:04.930> so<00:01:05.080> don't<00:01:05.110> underestimate<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:06.009> power<00:01:06.189> of

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
it so don't underestimate the power of

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.679 
it so don't underestimate the power of
weight<00:01:06.610> training<00:01:06.759> first<00:01:07.119> of<00:01:07.240> all<00:01:07.299> second<00:01:07.630> of

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:07.689 
weight training first of all second of

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.410 
weight training first of all second of
all<00:01:07.869> lifting<00:01:08.770> weights<00:01:09.009> doesn't<00:01:09.909> produce<00:01:10.090> the

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
all lifting weights doesn't produce the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.620 
all lifting weights doesn't produce the
result<00:01:10.810> lifting<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:11.950> lowering<00:01:12.280> weights<00:01:13.060> does

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
result lifting and lowering weights does

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.200 
result lifting and lowering weights does
in<00:01:13.960> fact<00:01:14.020> research<00:01:14.799> shows<00:01:14.829> the<00:01:15.490> eccentric<00:01:16.030> or

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
in fact research shows the eccentric or

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.450 
in fact research shows the eccentric or
the<00:01:16.299> negative<00:01:16.509> portion<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.289> the<00:01:17.439> movement<00:01:17.829> can

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
the negative portion of the movement can

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.249 
the negative portion of the movement can
actually<00:01:18.969> stimulate<00:01:19.180> twice<00:01:19.689> as<00:01:19.869> much<00:01:19.990> muscle

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
actually stimulate twice as much muscle

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.499 
actually stimulate twice as much muscle
fiber<00:01:20.649> than<00:01:20.979> the<00:01:21.070> lifting<00:01:21.399> portion<00:01:21.789> so<00:01:22.000> if<00:01:22.240> you

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
fiber than the lifting portion so if you

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.389 
fiber than the lifting portion so if you
just<00:01:22.689> lift<00:01:23.020> away<00:01:23.170> and<00:01:23.500> then<00:01:23.740> just<00:01:23.920> let<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.130> down

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
just lift away and then just let it down

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:27.029 
just lift away and then just let it down
without<00:01:24.899> putting<00:01:25.899> some<00:01:26.170> emphasis<00:01:26.770> on<00:01:26.979> the

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
without putting some emphasis on the

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.800 
without putting some emphasis on the
negative<00:01:27.640> or<00:01:27.789> lowering<00:01:28.119> portion<00:01:28.570> of<00:01:28.719> the

negative or lowering portion of the

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.300 
negative or lowering portion of the
movement<00:01:29.200> no<00:01:29.259> matter<00:01:29.439> what<00:01:29.710> exercise<00:01:30.130> you're

first of all when you do a curl the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.410 
first of all when you do a curl the

the<00:01:44.049> elbows<00:01:44.350> are<00:01:44.469> the<00:01:44.560> point<00:01:44.740> of<00:01:44.829> rotation<00:01:44.979> and

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
the elbows are the point of rotation and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.219 
the elbows are the point of rotation and
you<00:01:45.909> want<00:01:46.149> to<00:01:46.210> stay<00:01:46.329> stick<00:01:46.600> stiff<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.109> your

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
side when you do a curl it's almost like

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:53.340 
side when you do a curl it's almost like
you<00:01:50.649> have<00:01:50.920> a<00:01:50.950> string<00:01:51.509> attached<00:01:52.509> from<00:01:52.749> here<00:01:53.109> to

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
you have a string attached from here to

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.169 
you have a string attached from here to
here<00:01:53.649> and<00:01:53.890> you're<00:01:54.039> winding<00:01:54.340> it<00:01:54.640> up<00:01:54.789> so<00:01:55.060> don't

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
here and you're winding it up so don't

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.639 
here and you're winding it up so don't
let<00:01:55.329> those<00:01:55.450> elbows<00:01:55.810> drift<00:01:56.200> that's<00:01:56.380> going<00:01:56.499> to

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
let those elbows drift that's going to

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.440 
let those elbows drift that's going to
bring<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.890> front<00:01:57.100> delt<00:01:57.310> you<00:01:57.880> take<00:01:58.149> stress<00:01:58.420> off

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
bring the front delt you take stress off

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.230 
bring the front delt you take stress off
the<00:01:59.200> bicep<00:01:59.649> so<00:02:00.159> you<00:02:00.249> might<00:02:00.460> have<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.729> lower<00:02:01.090> the

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
the bicep so you might have to lower the

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.849 
the bicep so you might have to lower the
weight<00:02:01.479> a<00:02:01.509> little<00:02:01.689> bit<00:02:01.960> when<00:02:02.439> you<00:02:02.590> do<00:02:02.710> this

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
weight a little bit when you do this

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.620 
weight a little bit when you do this
right<00:02:03.159> but<00:02:03.789> you're<00:02:03.880> going<00:02:04.030> to<00:02:04.090> stimulate<00:02:04.299> more

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
right but you're going to stimulate more

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.120 
right but you're going to stimulate more
muscle<00:02:04.990> fiber<00:02:05.170> it's<00:02:05.319> not<00:02:05.469> about<00:02:05.619> how<00:02:05.799> much<00:02:05.950> you

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
muscle fiber it's not about how much you

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.100 
muscle fiber it's not about how much you
can<00:02:06.249> lift<00:02:06.460> now<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.700> key<00:02:06.999> here<00:02:07.030> is<00:02:07.479> not<00:02:07.899> just

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
can lift now the key here is not just

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.750 
can lift now the key here is not just
lifting<00:02:08.259> again<00:02:08.560> it's<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.979> lowering<00:02:09.250> portion

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.760 
lifting again it's the lowering portion

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.640 
lifting again it's the lowering portion
so<00:02:09.970> when<00:02:10.479> we<00:02:10.630> lift<00:02:10.870> we<00:02:11.020> want<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.260> lift<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.500> about

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
so when we lift we want to lift to about

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.010 
so when we lift we want to lift to about
a<00:02:11.680> count<00:02:11.890> of<00:02:11.980> 1<00:02:12.160> so<00:02:12.370> exhale<00:02:12.940> one<00:02:13.210> then<00:02:13.840> we<00:02:13.900> want

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
a count of 1 so exhale one then we want

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.580 
a count of 1 so exhale one then we want
to<00:02:14.080> let<00:02:14.290> it

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
to let it

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.710 
to let it
one<00:02:14.950> two<00:02:15.580> three<00:02:16.360> four<00:02:17.080> exhale<00:02:17.920> one<00:02:18.400> one<00:02:19.120> two

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
one two three four exhale one one two

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.320 
one two three four exhale one one two
three<00:02:20.530> four<00:02:21.190> exhale<00:02:22.090> one<00:02:22.480> inhale<00:02:23.470> one<00:02:24.010> two

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
three four exhale one inhale one two

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.839 
three four exhale one inhale one two
three<00:02:25.330> four<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.590> negative<00:02:27.190> portion<00:02:27.459> of<00:02:27.730> the

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
three four that negative portion of the

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.580 
three four that negative portion of the
movement<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.450> what's<00:02:29.110> going<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.319> stimulate
