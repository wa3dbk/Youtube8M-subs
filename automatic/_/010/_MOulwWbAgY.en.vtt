00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.690
 new mobile operating system from 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.490
 apple ios 7 beta 1 it is intended 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.120
 By the way, you need to say that the first beta 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.210
 works though with rare glitches but 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.610

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.930
 I managed to put an apple 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.180

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.559
 times and recommend putting it for
