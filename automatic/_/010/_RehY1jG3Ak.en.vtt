00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:08.740
 and I would not be anything if they are not my 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.740
 I have a great team 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.720
 that's how the player does not 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.310
 they are being slowly and I think it 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.340
 the truth is very good that helped us 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.340
 much 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.150
 that is 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.110
 It's true that I really like that 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.970
 people love me like that 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.650
 we are trying to reproduce all the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:38.720
 support that they give us inside the court and 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.720
 I think it was very good 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.820
 happy pleased enjoying each 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.820
 moment 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.830
 and the truth that 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.240
 acs controls trainer also prepares 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.240
 this ticket 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.190
 but you have no right to 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.260
 throw things to someone who is 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.500
 inside the court not then we have 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.420
 than to respect a little bit more we have to 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.190
 learn to do it because then we are going 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.580
 to punish the stadium and I think that 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.580
 nobody wants 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.539
 yes clear clear the pension for 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.539
 railroad and also plays by answering 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.510
 quiet the best very smart very 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.710
 good and that is practically not us 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.990
 he came to the arch and that talks about work 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.640
 what all my colleagues did 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.640
 we deservedly won this match 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.490
 the team is taking good shape 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.490
 let's hope to continue in that line 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.440
 and well the undefeated is not something that 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.240
 obsession you have to keep enjoying 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.800
 especially that the team shows up with 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.550
 attitude and disposition toward 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.550
 effort like today 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.210
 I understand that surely 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.770
 have thrown things off too 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.270
 it seems that we have to save the 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.250
 composure because we can run the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.080
 risk of a veto and that by completing us 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.640
 It suits our region it seems to me that 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.330
 you have to support the team to 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.330
 you have to respect 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.680
 that live compassion that supports us because 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.000
 He supported us quite well but he tried 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.660
 to keep sanity so as not to fall 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.940
 kinds of methods and signal things 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.090
 is my friend I send him a hug and from 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.470
 suddenly he is of strong temperament with 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.980
 people of strong temperament sometimes not 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.980
 you can control 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.860
 I have that they would not like what if 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.600
 in details 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.050
 that we are lucky to have it from 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.050
 our side 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.420
 because he is the goal player of our 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.849
 team but beyond the goal is a 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.379
 sacrifice player a power that we 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:52.680
 it helps a lot and that we are definitely going 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:56.420
 give us points gives us confidence and 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.420
 it gives us many things as a team 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.290
 It is a consequence of work 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.660
 we are living this that is happening 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.280
 with the team is because we worked 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.860
 pretty good in the preseason because 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.900
 if that's what I want it to be but 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.770
 each one of us and we take it to 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.770
 out on the court 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.570
 I do not want the final truth 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.810
 I would need to be in your shoes to 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.760
 know what happened what is 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.740
 reprehensible is that the hobby gets 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.830
 with a human being beyond that of 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.240
 entry or rival I think there are ways to 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.480
 support the team and that's not a way 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.480
 correct 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.800
 and with this I do not know 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.489
 you also have to thank the support I think 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.080
 that the team and the team effort 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.610
 he deserves a hobby like this one 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.890
 they deserve that people come and I went to 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.319
 team and be with us today that are 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.819
 good also will undoubtedly come some 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.880
 bad if we want people to be with 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:06.880
 we 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.120
 if we knew about the key people of tigers 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.829
 we also know about the key people of 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.410
 we have to leave that space 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.200
 they need and well I think today 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.700
 shared round where it was left to 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.930
 tiger was the ball but I think that 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.930
 we were more forceful 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.210
 yes yes at times the team had that 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.610
 aggression to recover the ball and 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.320
 he had that calm to have it then it is 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.669
 a round match where the result is 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.169
 It is reflecting what was really inside 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.169
 the court that
