there's<00:00:00.900> many<00:00:01.110> different<00:00:01.199> filters<00:00:01.770> that<00:00:01.979> you

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
there's many different filters that you

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.519 
there's many different filters that you
can<00:00:02.370> simply<00:00:02.700> screw<00:00:03.120> on<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:04.200> end<00:00:04.380> of<00:00:04.500> your

lens to create some really interesting
effects<00:00:06.589> the<00:00:07.589> most<00:00:07.770> basic<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.250> all<00:00:08.340> filters<00:00:08.790> is

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
effects the most basic of all filters is

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.440 
effects the most basic of all filters is
a<00:00:09.030> standard<00:00:09.540> UV<00:00:09.990> filter<00:00:10.349> as<00:00:10.530> you<00:00:11.010> see<00:00:11.190> here<00:00:11.460> UV

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
a standard UV filter as you see here UV

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.419 
a standard UV filter as you see here UV
filter<00:00:12.809> screws<00:00:13.440> right<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.250> edge<00:00:14.400> of

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
filter screws right on to the edge of

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.039 
filter screws right on to the edge of
the<00:00:14.549> camera<00:00:14.910> like<00:00:15.089> any<00:00:15.330> other<00:00:15.509> filter<00:00:15.900> would

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
the camera like any other filter would

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.560 
the camera like any other filter would
the<00:00:17.010> difference<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.490> UV<00:00:17.789> filter<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.390> some

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
the difference of the UV filter and some

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.810 
the difference of the UV filter and some
other<00:00:18.720> filters<00:00:19.109> is<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.800> UV<00:00:19.980> filter<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.550> just

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
other filters is the UV filter is just

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.750 
other filters is the UV filter is just
clear<00:00:21.119> glass<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.500> main<00:00:22.980> purpose<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.640> it

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
clear glass and the main purpose of it

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.330 
clear glass and the main purpose of it
is<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.939> protect<00:00:24.630> your<00:00:24.810> lens<00:00:25.050> from<00:00:25.500> being

like that so if you're buying a camera

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.600 
like that so if you're buying a camera
and<00:00:31.500> some<00:00:31.619> lenses<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.099> first<00:00:32.279> thing<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.520> need

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
and some lenses the first thing you need

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.850 
and some lenses the first thing you need
to<00:00:32.669> get<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.149> UV<00:00:33.540> filter<00:00:33.570> there<00:00:34.530> are<00:00:34.680> some

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
to get is a UV filter there are some

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.700 
to get is a UV filter there are some
other<00:00:35.040> filters<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.700> open<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.390> some

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
other filters that open you up to some

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.180 
other filters that open you up to some
creative<00:00:38.180> techniques<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:40.020> those<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.410> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
creative techniques one of those is a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.440 
creative techniques one of those is a
blur<00:00:41.840> filter<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.020> blur<00:00:43.440> filter<00:00:43.890> has<00:00:44.340> has<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.239> set

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
blur filter a blur filter has has it set

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.020 
blur filter a blur filter has has it set
so<00:00:45.480> there's<00:00:45.930> only<00:00:46.079> one<00:00:46.410> small<00:00:47.100> portion<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
so there's only one small portion of the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.670 
so there's only one small portion of the
filter<00:00:48.390> that's<00:00:48.840> going<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.110> allow<00:00:49.200> everything

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
filter that's going to allow everything

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.380 
filter that's going to allow everything
to<00:00:49.860> come<00:00:50.129> through<00:00:50.370> crisp<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:50.850> clear<00:00:51.239> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
to come through crisp and clear and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.689 
to come through crisp and clear and
everything<00:00:52.079> else<00:00:52.260> it's<00:00:52.800> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> put<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> sort

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
everything else it's going to put a sort

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.819 
everything else it's going to put a sort
of<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.910> blur<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:55.260> can<00:00:55.440> create<00:00:55.559> some

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
of a blur on it this can create some

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.500 
of a blur on it this can create some
neat<00:00:55.980> effects<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.910> you've<00:00:57.059> got<00:00:57.270> like<00:00:57.449> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
neat effects if you've got like a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.299 
neat effects if you've got like a
picture<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.260> person<00:00:58.440> standing<00:00:58.890> in<00:00:59.190> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
picture of a person standing in the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.950 
picture of a person standing in the
middle<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.730> garden<00:00:59.940> maybe<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.750> can<00:01:00.809> have

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
middle of a garden maybe you can have

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.990 
middle of a garden maybe you can have
the<00:01:01.079> person<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.559> focus<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.100> everything

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
the person in focus and everything

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.359 
the person in focus and everything
around<00:01:03.210> them<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.780> blurry<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:05.100> can<00:01:05.280> just

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
around them all blurry and it can just

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.030 
around them all blurry and it can just
really<00:01:05.610> make<00:01:05.820> certain<00:01:06.180> things<00:01:06.390> stand<00:01:06.689> out

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
really make certain things stand out

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.800 
really make certain things stand out
another<00:01:08.040> type<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.340> filter<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.240> create<00:01:09.479> effects

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
another type of filter to create effects

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.380 
another type of filter to create effects
is<00:01:09.990> called<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.260> starburst<00:01:10.830> filter<00:01:11.310> these<00:01:12.119> come

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
is called a starburst filter these come

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.630 
is called a starburst filter these come
in<00:01:12.420> like<00:01:12.750> four<00:01:13.049> point<00:01:13.350> five<00:01:13.680> point<00:01:13.740> six<00:01:14.340> point

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
in like four point five point six point

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
in like four point five point six point
and<00:01:14.880> what<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.630> does<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.530> you're<00:01:16.650> taking<00:01:16.799> a

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and what this does is if you're taking a

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.429 
and what this does is if you're taking a
picture<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.670> single<00:01:18.060> light<00:01:18.240> source<00:01:18.439> it'll

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
picture of a single light source it'll

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.460 
picture of a single light source it'll
turn<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.890> into<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.150> star<00:01:21.479> shape<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.020> like<00:01:22.439> a

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
turn it into like a star shape so like a

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.560 
turn it into like a star shape so like a
four<00:01:22.740> point<00:01:23.040> one<00:01:23.100> instead<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.150> showing<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
four point one instead of just showing a

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.899 
four point one instead of just showing a
single<00:01:24.990> glowing<00:01:25.409> light<00:01:25.619> up<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> distance

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
single glowing light up in the distance

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.359 
single glowing light up in the distance
you'll<00:01:27.150> see<00:01:27.390> four<00:01:28.049> major<00:01:28.439> points<00:01:28.920> coming<00:01:29.159> off

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
you'll see four major points coming off

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.429 
you'll see four major points coming off
of<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.670> these<00:01:30.509> are<00:01:30.659> used<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.930> lot<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
of it these are used a lot in the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.310 
of it these are used a lot in the
filming<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.509> sporting<00:01:33.509> events<00:01:33.869> you'll<00:01:34.049> notice

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
filming of sporting events you'll notice

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.749 
filming of sporting events you'll notice
when<00:01:34.409> they<00:01:34.530> show<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.920> lights<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.310> night<00:01:35.490> that

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
when they show the lights at night that

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.760 
when they show the lights at night that
they're<00:01:36.180> making<00:01:36.540> these<00:01:36.810> nice<00:01:37.079> lines<00:01:37.409> coming

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
they're making these nice lines coming

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.350 
they're making these nice lines coming
out<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.950> lights<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:38.520> that's<00:01:38.970> created

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
out of lights and that's that's created

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.039 
out of lights and that's that's created
from<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.570> starburst<00:01:39.960> filter<00:01:40.670> another<00:01:41.670> filter

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
from a starburst filter another filter

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.719 
from a starburst filter another filter
it's<00:01:43.049> commonly<00:01:43.439> used<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.399> much<00:01:44.549> for

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
it's commonly used not so much for

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.340 
it's commonly used not so much for
effects<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:45.600> getting<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.930> stronger

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
effects but just for getting a stronger

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.920 
effects but just for getting a stronger
exposure<00:01:46.880> there's<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.970> polarizing<00:01:48.600> filter

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
exposure there's a polarizing filter

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.609 
exposure there's a polarizing filter
these<00:01:49.890> look<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.520> blue<00:01:50.880> in<00:01:51.270> hue<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.990> what

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
these look a little blue in hue and what

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.740 
these look a little blue in hue and what
they<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.220> they'll<00:01:53.430> help<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.939> sky<00:01:54.329> and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
they do is they'll help the sky and

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.749 
they do is they'll help the sky and
water<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.320> things<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.680> nature<00:01:55.799> show<00:01:56.610> up

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
water and things of that nature show up

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.420 
water and things of that nature show up
with<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> little<00:01:57.689> bit<00:01:57.899> more<00:01:58.140> color<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.829> them<00:01:59.189> and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
with a little bit more color to them and

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.100 
with a little bit more color to them and
you'll<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.759> get<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.000> richer<00:02:00.270> stronger<00:02:00.659> image

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
you'll just get a richer stronger image

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.440 
you'll just get a richer stronger image
so<00:02:01.680> there's<00:02:02.369> certain<00:02:02.700> name<00:02:02.820> there's<00:02:03.149> certain

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
so there's certain name there's certain

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.120 
so there's certain name there's certain
filters<00:02:03.630> like<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.170> UV<00:02:04.409> filter<00:02:04.799> they're

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
filters like the UV filter they're

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.679 
filters like the UV filter they're
basically<00:02:05.280> there<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.759> protect<00:02:06.030> your<00:02:06.329> camera

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
basically there to protect your camera

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.990 
basically there to protect your camera
and<00:02:06.840> then<00:02:07.259> there's<00:02:07.469> other<00:02:08.039> ones<00:02:08.310> like<00:02:08.819> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
and then there's other ones like the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.609 
and then there's other ones like the
polarizing<00:02:09.629> filter<00:02:09.959> they're<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.440> help

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
polarizing filter they're going to help

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.500 
polarizing filter they're going to help
you<00:02:10.739> get<00:02:10.890> better<00:02:11.099> exposures<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:11.910> then

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
you get better exposures and then

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
you get better exposures and then
there's<00:02:12.720> some

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
there's some

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.710 
there's some
filters<00:02:14.250> are<00:02:14.400> going<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.610> create<00:02:15.240> some<00:02:15.390> effects

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
filters are going to create some effects

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.959 
filters are going to create some effects
like<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> starburst<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:17.360> blur<00:02:18.360> filters
