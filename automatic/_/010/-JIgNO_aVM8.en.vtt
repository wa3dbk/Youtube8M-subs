hi<00:00:01.589> Here<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:01.860> am<00:00:01.949> at<00:00:02.129> the<00:00:02.220> shop<00:00:02.399> floor<00:00:02.610> you're

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hi Here I am at the shop floor you're

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.949 
hi Here I am at the shop floor you're
probably<00:00:02.970> wondering<00:00:03.330> what<00:00:03.419> I'm<00:00:03.540> doing<00:00:03.570> but

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
probably wondering what I'm doing but

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:06.110 
probably wondering what I'm doing but
here<00:00:04.140> we've<00:00:04.290> got<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.620> new<00:00:04.740> tip<00:00:05.040> mag<00:00:05.279> showing

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
here we've got the new tip mag showing

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.760 
here we've got the new tip mag showing
the<00:00:06.210> magnetism<00:00:06.750> that's<00:00:07.109> transferred<00:00:07.680> from

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
the magnetism that's transferred from

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.320 
the magnetism that's transferred from
the<00:00:07.919> tip<00:00:08.130> down<00:00:08.370> here<00:00:08.639> and<00:00:08.760> we're<00:00:08.849> picking<00:00:09.030> up<00:00:09.210> a

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
the tip down here and we're picking up a

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.240 
the tip down here and we're picking up a
three-quarter<00:00:09.990> inch<00:00:10.139> pocket<00:00:10.410> chisel<00:00:10.920> kind<00:00:11.130> of

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
three-quarter inch pocket chisel kind of

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.370 
three-quarter inch pocket chisel kind of
unheard<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.730> but<00:00:12.240> that's<00:00:12.509> how<00:00:12.750> powerful<00:00:13.320> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
unheard of but that's how powerful the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.589 
unheard of but that's how powerful the
new<00:00:13.500> tip<00:00:13.740> magnet<00:00:14.130> is<00:00:14.250> if<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.490> notice<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.360> not

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
new tip magnet is if you notice it's not

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.230 
new tip magnet is if you notice it's not
even<00:00:15.870> touching<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:17.039> actual<00:00:17.490> metal<00:00:17.760> it's<00:00:18.060> just

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
even touching the actual metal it's just

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.970 
even touching the actual metal it's just
transferring<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.990> magnetism<00:00:19.470> all<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:19.920> way

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
transferring that magnetism all the way

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.470 
transferring that magnetism all the way
through<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.250> tip<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.880> let<00:00:21.029> me<00:00:21.119> show<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.359> how

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
through the tip so let me show you how

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.450 
through the tip so let me show you how
this<00:00:21.630> all<00:00:21.840> works<00:00:22.050> okay<00:00:22.800> when<00:00:23.039> you<00:00:23.130> get<00:00:23.279> your

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
this all works okay when you get your

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.099 
this all works okay when you get your
tip<00:00:23.670> mag<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.060> comes<00:00:24.269> in<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.480> little<00:00:24.689> package

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.900 
tip mag it comes in a little package
just<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.560> this<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.310> you're<00:00:26.430> gonna<00:00:26.519> take<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
just like this so you're gonna take it

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.580 
just like this so you're gonna take it
out<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.240> now<00:00:27.420> we're<00:00:27.539> gonna<00:00:27.630> put<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.050> on<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
out and now we're gonna put it on to a

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.740 
out and now we're gonna put it on to a
square<00:00:28.949> drive<00:00:29.160> tip<00:00:29.519> or<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> Philips<00:00:30.570> bit

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
square drive tip or a Philips bit

do is there's small little retaining

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.729 
do is there's small little retaining
ring<00:00:35.579> right<00:00:35.880> here<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.540> nylon<00:00:37.079> holding<00:00:37.620> those

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
ring right here of nylon holding those

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.610 
ring right here of nylon holding those
crescent<00:00:38.280> shaped<00:00:38.520> magnets<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:39.600> now<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
crescent shaped magnets in there now the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.580 
crescent shaped magnets in there now the
tough<00:00:40.920> thing<00:00:41.190> about<00:00:41.280> this<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.510> is

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
tough thing about this is this is

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.920 
tough thing about this is this is
opposing<00:00:43.590> negative<00:00:44.399> positive<00:00:44.670> magnetism<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
opposing negative positive magnetism and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.600 
opposing negative positive magnetism and
what<00:00:46.440> happens<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.010> if<00:00:47.129> you're<00:00:47.250> not<00:00:47.370> careful

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
what happens is if you're not careful

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520 
what happens is if you're not careful
when<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.969> install<00:00:48.360> it<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> first<00:00:48.840> time<00:00:49.079> you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
when you install it the first time you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.290 
when you install it the first time you
can<00:00:49.710> knock<00:00:49.950> these<00:00:50.190> magnets<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.789> here<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.180> when

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
can knock these magnets out here so when

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.479 
can knock these magnets out here so when
you<00:00:51.390> put<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:52.530> push<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.949> over<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.250> tip

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
you put it on you push it over the tip

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.760 
you put it on you push it over the tip
just<00:00:53.699> like<00:00:53.820> that<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.449> very<00:00:54.539> very<00:00:55.140> tight<00:00:55.500> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
just like that it's very very tight you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.439 
just like that it's very very tight you
want<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.250> hold<00:00:56.399> your<00:00:56.520> fingernail<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.300> you're

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
want to hold your fingernail so you're

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.630 
want to hold your fingernail so you're
applying<00:00:57.690> pressure<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.410> magnet<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.100> just

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
applying pressure to the magnet and just

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.060 
applying pressure to the magnet and just
slide<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.180> over<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.420> top<00:01:00.539> if<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.230> don't<00:01:01.530> you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
slide it over the top if you don't you
can<00:01:02.250> knock<00:01:02.460> these<00:01:02.699> out<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.329> I'm<00:01:03.510> gonna<00:01:03.660> show

on a screwdriver I take the nylon
housing<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.710> put<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.040> over<00:01:32.130> just<00:01:32.460> like<00:01:32.579> this

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
housing and put it over just like this

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.630 
housing and put it over just like this
and<00:01:33.180> keep<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.170> magnet<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.369> little

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
and keep that magnet out just a little

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.330 
and keep that magnet out just a little
bit<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.000> then<00:01:36.689> OOP<00:01:36.960> these<00:01:37.530> things<00:01:37.799> are<00:01:37.979> really

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
bit and then OOP these things are really

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.940 
bit and then OOP these things are really
powerful<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.750> then<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.350> put<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> over<00:01:40.829> like

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
powerful and then you put it over like

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.990 
powerful and then you put it over like
this<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.030> bring<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.450> into<00:01:42.689> there

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
this and you bring it into there

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.090 
this and you bring it into there
it's<00:01:44.150> a<00:01:44.210> little<00:01:44.510> tricky<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.530> then<00:01:45.650> you<00:01:45.770> force

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
it's a little tricky and then you force

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.490 
it's a little tricky and then you force
both<00:01:46.370> magnets<00:01:46.970> in<00:01:47.150> so<00:01:47.420> they're<00:01:47.570> opposing<00:01:48.080> one

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
both magnets in so they're opposing one

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.710 
both magnets in so they're opposing one
another<00:01:48.530> now<00:01:49.490> there<00:01:49.820> it's<00:01:50.000> back<00:01:50.210> in<00:01:50.480> and

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
another now there it's back in and

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.960 
another now there it's back in and
what's<00:01:51.140> happening<00:01:51.650> is<00:01:51.860> these<00:01:52.310> magnets<00:01:52.880> are

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
what's happening is these magnets are

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.390 
what's happening is these magnets are
actually<00:01:53.420> pushing<00:01:53.990> away<00:01:54.620> from<00:01:55.040> each<00:01:55.160> other

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
actually pushing away from each other

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.090 
actually pushing away from each other
and<00:01:55.640> that's<00:01:55.850> what<00:01:56.180> causes<00:01:56.450> all<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.530> magnetism

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
and that's what causes all the magnetism

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.010 
and that's what causes all the magnetism
that<00:01:58.430> we're<00:01:58.580> desiring<00:01:59.120> so<00:01:59.480> this<00:01:59.690> is<00:01:59.840> how<00:01:59.960> you

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
that we're desiring so this is how you

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.890 
that we're desiring so this is how you
fix<00:02:00.380> it<00:02:00.620> if<00:02:00.830> you<00:02:00.950> knock<00:02:01.130> it<00:02:01.160> out<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:02.600> you've<00:02:02.750> got

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
fix it if you knock it out so you've got

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.260 
fix it if you knock it out so you've got
your<00:02:03.050> tip<00:02:03.290> mag<00:02:03.530> on<00:02:03.800> your<00:02:04.130> two-inch<00:02:04.550> square

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
your tip mag on your two-inch square

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.210 
your tip mag on your two-inch square
drive<00:02:05.510> bit<00:02:05.780> and<00:02:05.990> you<00:02:06.470> put<00:02:06.620> it<00:02:06.710> in<00:02:06.830> your<00:02:06.860> taper

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
drive bit and you put it in your taper

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.410 
drive bit and you put it in your taper
lock<00:02:07.490> of<00:02:07.670> course<00:02:07.880> we're<00:02:08.000> gonna<00:02:08.090> go<00:02:08.240> over<00:02:08.390> that

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
lock of course we're gonna go over that

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.190 
lock of course we're gonna go over that
in<00:02:08.540> just<00:02:08.810> a<00:02:08.899> minute

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
and you lock that in place okay so

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.630 
and you lock that in place okay so
that's<00:02:11.780> on<00:02:11.990> there<00:02:12.230> now<00:02:12.500> when<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.250> put<00:02:13.490> your

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
screws on you don't even have to have

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.400 
screws on you don't even have to have
the<00:02:15.800> tip<00:02:16.340> mag<00:02:16.610> up<00:02:16.910> close<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:17.930> screw<00:02:18.170> it's

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
the tip mag up close to the screw it's

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.980 
the tip mag up close to the screw it's
still<00:02:18.800> super<00:02:19.760> super<00:02:20.120> powerful<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.690> can<00:02:20.810> lose

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
still super super powerful you can lose

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.380 
still super super powerful you can lose
look<00:02:21.200> that's<00:02:21.470> unheard<00:02:21.860> of<00:02:22.070> but<00:02:22.820> if<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.210> want

look that's unheard of but if you want
even<00:02:23.510> more<00:02:23.660> power<00:02:24.200> you<00:02:24.920> can<00:02:25.070> actually<00:02:25.460> slide

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
even more power you can actually slide

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.300 
even more power you can actually slide
the<00:02:26.150> tip<00:02:26.390> all<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.690> way<00:02:26.900> up<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.350> now<00:02:27.890> the

work so nicely together so a lot of

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.580 
work so nicely together so a lot of
people<00:02:37.940> like<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.270> use<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.780> one-inch<00:02:39.260> bits

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
people like to use the one-inch bits

people like to use the one-inch bits
with<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.130> tip<00:02:40.340> mag<00:02:40.550> and<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:40.850> can<00:02:40.970> do<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.270> as

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
with the tip mag and you can do that as

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.850 
with the tip mag and you can do that as
well<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.750> doesn't<00:02:42.050> look<00:02:42.200> like<00:02:42.230> you<00:02:42.500> can<00:02:42.710> but

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860 
well it doesn't look like you can but

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
let me show you what you do you want to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.970 
let me show you what you do you want to
bring<00:02:44.180> the<00:02:44.300> tip<00:02:44.510> back<00:02:44.720> all<00:02:45.320> the<00:02:45.560> way<00:02:45.590> out<00:02:45.800> to

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
bring the tip back all the way out to

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.590 
bring the tip back all the way out to
the<00:02:46.100> end<00:02:46.250> when<00:02:46.730> you're<00:02:46.880> putting<00:02:47.180> it<00:02:47.270> into<00:02:47.480> the

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
the end when you're putting it into the

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.720 
the end when you're putting it into the
taper<00:02:47.840> lock<00:02:48.110> or<00:02:48.320> your<00:02:48.440> bid<00:02:48.650> holder<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.550> make

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
taper lock or your bid holder and make

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.130 
taper lock or your bid holder and make
sure<00:02:49.850> that's<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.300> and<00:02:50.480> then<00:02:50.660> push<00:02:50.959> it<00:02:50.989> back

sure that's in and then push it back
like<00:02:51.560> this<00:02:51.770> now<00:02:52.100> just<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.090> end<00:02:53.300> is<00:02:53.690> sticking

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
like this now just the end is sticking

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.690 
like this now just the end is sticking
out<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.650> goes<00:02:54.800> on<00:02:55.040> there<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.520> works

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
out and it goes on there and it works

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.040 
out and it goes on there and it works
perfect<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.360> if<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.540> want<00:02:56.750> that<00:02:56.900> little

perfect and if you want that little
extra<00:02:57.440> power<00:02:57.650> you<00:02:58.220> can<00:02:58.400> push<00:02:58.550> it<00:02:58.700> to<00:02:58.790> the<00:02:58.850> front

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
extra power you can push it to the front

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.819 
extra power you can push it to the front
and<00:02:59.300> it<00:02:59.690> works<00:02:59.870> great

mag is actually put it on a screwdriver
this<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.489> what<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.700> was<00:03:06.790> originally<00:03:06.879> invented

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
this is what it was originally invented

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.569 
this is what it was originally invented
for<00:03:07.930> when<00:03:08.560> you're<00:03:08.680> putting<00:03:08.890> your<00:03:08.980> screws<00:03:09.340> in

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
for when you're putting your screws in

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.130 
for when you're putting your screws in
your<00:03:10.000> tip<00:03:10.239> screws<00:03:10.480> are<00:03:10.629> always<00:03:10.780> falling<00:03:10.989> off

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
your tip screws are always falling off

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.869 
your tip screws are always falling off
the<00:03:11.260> end<00:03:11.379> of<00:03:11.439> the<00:03:11.530> tip<00:03:11.739> but<00:03:12.040> this<00:03:12.189> allows<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:12.849> to

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
the end of the tip but this allows it to

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.149 
the end of the tip but this allows it to
transfer<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.659> magnetism<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:14.620> give<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.040> an

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
transfer that magnetism and give you an

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.280 
transfer that magnetism and give you an
incredibly<00:03:15.730> strong<00:03:16.090> hold<00:03:16.450> but<00:03:16.989> just<00:03:17.200> to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
incredibly strong hold but just to

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.960 
incredibly strong hold but just to
demonstrate<00:03:17.590> just<00:03:18.069> how<00:03:18.400> strong<00:03:18.790> that

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
demonstrate just how strong that

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.360 
demonstrate just how strong that
magnetism<00:03:19.420> is<00:03:19.689> look<00:03:20.230> how<00:03:20.349> that<00:03:20.470> screws<00:03:20.829> offset

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
magnetism is look how that screws offset

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.949 
magnetism is look how that screws offset
