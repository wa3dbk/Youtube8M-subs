play-doh we can use this to make some
sidewalks<00:01:03.940> in<00:01:05.290> some<00:01:06.290> blocks

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:42.270 

hey<00:01:31.790> cutter<00:01:32.090> let's<00:01:32.630> make<00:01:32.810> some<00:01:32.990> blocks<00:01:33.640> okay

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.080 

and<00:02:19.370> stack<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:20.000> right<00:02:20.330> here<00:02:21.910> let's<00:02:22.910> make

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
and stack that right here let's make

00:02:23.090 --> 00:03:07.790 
and stack that right here let's make
another<00:02:23.210> one
