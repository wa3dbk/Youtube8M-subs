00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 hello to all guys and well back on 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.270
 android mod today i want to show you one 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.030
 samsung based to say the least fantastic 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.530
 because why the Italian developer is 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.599
 nick named like me do not you just yes 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.770
 actually it's a little bit 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.630
 then I tell you that ultra 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.490
 already customizable starting from 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.160
 roma installer has a unique style e 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.960
 really good performance now not 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.550
 tell me you are not curious to see 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.349
 what makes available 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:44.550
 and then let's see it together after the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:46.110
 intro ok 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.600
 let's start with saying that the package 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.180
 zip of the rom weighs a good 2 gigabytes then 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.039
 it is quite consistent but these 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.660
 dimensions are more than justified by 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.340
 all the customizations there 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 are made available from 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.420
 immediately just flashed the zip in fact yes 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.670
 will start the roma installer which has 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.369
 really lots of voices and lets you 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.470
 choose between three kernels and in whom years or 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.659
 blood of which second and third allow 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.670
 phone charging off between three 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.520
 modem and all applications and widgets 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.650
 by samsung google or third party for 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.210
 example dropbox that usually is 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.869
 can be found in this type of 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.549
 firmware 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.830
 each of these apps if not the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.509
 we would like to be able to remove more 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.299
 we could completely transform the 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.189
 galaxy style phone s 5 on Oct 4 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.320
 with some element of lollipop for le 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.509
 system applications also come to us 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.759
 made available lots of add ons 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.650
 such as flash player modules exposed tweaks 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.600
 for audio and so on and so forth 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.119
 the features that contain the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.950
 extra fashions and a fix for the problem that 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.259
 plagues the camera of some custom 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.329
 firmware for galaxy s3 therefore like 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.140
 you will see in a moment the room works 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.210
 without problems 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.130
 I repeat the customizations are 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.560
 an infinity and this list does not make 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.299
 justice to all those present but in 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.070
 in case he had not yet convinced those 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.939
 of you who love to click to the extreme 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.770
 own device 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.079
 I tell you that within the Roma it is 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.820
 present another app that I will show you 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.429
 after that it makes available at least 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.470
 as many changes would take now 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.300
 it's just to analyze 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.950
 in detail those but let's proceed with 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.020
 order and let's start with the settings 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.760
 as you can see the style 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.190
 custom already seen from this 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.960
 screen in fact every category in which 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.970
 it is divided this menu can be 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.280
 reduced and closed on itself as if 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.050
 were a curtain at the beginning we find the 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.420
 quick options that are not nine like 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.610
 usually roms in note 4 style but 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.920
 12 then we have two sections with the 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.170
 connections and one for audio and screen 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.760
 here in addition to the classic on-screen voices 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.860
 there are torchlights for ignition 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.360
 torch off screen with one 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.580
 pressing the increase key 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.920
 volume and support pages that in 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.709
 certain circumstances will add 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.660
 card to the home led obviously serves for 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.000
 the notification icon we can modify 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.220
 the character the backgrounds and the lockscreen 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.800
 set themes that can be downloaded from 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.810
 samsung galaxy a p's enable the multi 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.760
 screen that a function I will show you 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.410
 in detail between a moment and 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.720
 customize the panel 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.240
 notifications that is in lollipop style is that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.850
 also in this case it presents many 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.650
 tools plus favorite apps allows 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.930
 to activate a mobile ball with five 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.300
 applications always at your fingertips and 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.070
 use with one hand allows to use 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.410
 some interesting features like the 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.600
 this screen reduction also that 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.610
 I will show you in a moment, changing 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.560
 category in personalization was 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.750
 added the users section while in 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.370
 there is no account and system movement 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.620
 nothing new also savings 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.540
 energy and that of the s3 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.519
 finally on applications there are some 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.730
 direct links to some apps of 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.410
 system like the os boys address book 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.950
 features features of the no 4 ce ne 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.959
 they are two 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.000
 screen reduction and multi 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.010
 window the first can be enabled 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.440
 only for certain applications such as 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:53.510
 the keyboard or the calculator or to 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.670
 the entire display can be activated with a 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.799
 double swipe or through the small 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.299
 retractable menu that you see and reduce 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.489
 the interface so that it occupies 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:03.620
 only a portion of the screen la 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:05.660
 window that appears and can be resized 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.420
 mobile and also provides the keys for 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.780
 increase and decrease the volume ei 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.340
 back home buttons and settings 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.440
 second function the multi window 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.510
 you probably all know it then 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.940
 we see it quickly with a pressure 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.730
 prolonged back soft touch button 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.650
 or through 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.080
 the tool in the dropdown menu will activate the 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.940
 sidebar with applications from 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.600
 here we could choose up to four 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.850
 simultaneously and we could each 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.710
 resize it by swapping it with 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.410
 the others put it full screen or 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.240
 close it in more you can copy one 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.370
 portion of text from a window a 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.930
 another and through the voice creates that 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.090
 you see at the bottom of the curtain is 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.220
 You can store app groups 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.330
 to be able to open them later 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.880
 most immediate way 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.010
 ok let's move to the home or touch 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.080
 wiz where with a swipe from left to 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.300
 right we can open the flipboard app 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.950
 a news aggregator based on 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.140
 our interests with a pressure 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.120
 prolonged finger in an empty area 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.860
 on the screen a menu opens instead 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.200
 which allows you to add pages and 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.640
 choose wallpapers and widgets set the 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.920
 home by choosing an effect of 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.480
 transition and to apply a theme i 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:15.480
 wallpapers are a mixture of those of 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.700
 galaxy s iii ls5 and no 4 e per 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.590
 change the interface the doc we will have to 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.450
 press on the pencil that appears above 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.980
 the driver symbol for how much 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.020
 regards the applications of 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.880
 system in addition to those of samsung e 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.400
 google we find years control that the app 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.190
 I talked about here there are so many 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.780
 additional features for the kernel 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.760
 as many tweaks and the possibility of 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.580
 clean the cache or the 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.590
 reset some functions of sp manager 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.600
 allows control and modification of 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.510
 sound in headphones in the speakers for 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.000
 Bluetooth and USB devices is present 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:50.010
 superuser and if you select it in the 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.650
 roma installer you will find enabled also 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:54.960
 the former posh framework I chose more 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.880
 two modules or colors satus brand 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.770
 also reviewed for the modification of 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.960
 color of the status bar according to 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.610
 open and hicks button actions for 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.230
 set the actions to be associated with one 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.720
 prolonged pressure or has a double 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:07.920
 fast pressing of the soft touch keys 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.810
 the camera was not 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.940
 particularly custom neither 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.040
 in appearance or in functions e 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.260
 effects and mode settings 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.790
 snap are those that we know well the 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.790
 Focus speed really is 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.110
 good as well as quality and the same 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.050
 applies to the video part 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.430
 ok there are no bugs to report therefore 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.320
 we close some applications and 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.360
 let's move on to the final considerations 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.550
 energy management and like 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.470
 that of the s5 sensation in that 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.180
 this mine always 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.890
 capacity at the end of the day I have never 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.630
 reached the four hours of the screen 

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.010
 as with the other rom but use almost 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:42.380
 always been more intense 

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:45.080
 the fluidity and incredible even below 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.300
 stress never a lag or a jamming but 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.430
 daily use at a 9 out of 10 in 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.710
 how three or four times the device is 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.120
 it is spontaneously restarted however I am 

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.130
 been three four times in two weeks 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:57.620
 so nothing to worry about 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.300
 therefore to conclude and the samsung based 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:01.220
 best I've ever tested by 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.930
 when i have this device it is a 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.190
 concentrate of customizations e 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:06.110
 all changes perfectly 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.450
 optimized so as not to result 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:10.130
 harmful but rather positive for the 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.290
 performance and in addition it has a style 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:14.420
 really special with the menu of 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:16.760
 dark curtain settings that makes the 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.500
 all the more elegant so far for samsung 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.080
 based I have always taken as a term of 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.000
 compare the s5 sensation as the 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.980
 I considered one of the best e 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.870
 will probably continue to hold that 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.000
