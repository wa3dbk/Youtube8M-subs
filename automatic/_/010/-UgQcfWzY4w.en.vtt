00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.420 
drop of glue now a lot of you guys say
well<00:05:38.810> carpet<00:05:39.139> away<00:05:39.440> you<00:05:39.949> know<00:05:40.070> when<00:05:40.280> you

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
well carpet away you know when you

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.040 
well carpet away you know when you
overlap<00:05:40.820> it<00:05:41.030> in<00:05:41.150> the<00:05:41.240> back<00:05:41.419> why<00:05:41.660> are<00:05:41.720> you<00:05:41.840> tying

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
overlap it in the back why are you tying

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.980 
overlap it in the back why are you tying
in<00:05:42.229> the<00:05:42.289> back<00:05:42.530> well<00:05:43.449> reason<00:05:44.449> why<00:05:44.539> I<00:05:44.570> do<00:05:44.690> because

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
in the back well reason why I do because

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:46.930 
in the back well reason why I do because
it's<00:05:45.139> virtually<00:05:45.500> any<00:05:45.650> way<00:05:45.830> possible<00:05:46.610> you<00:05:46.669> can

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
it's virtually any way possible you can

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.430 
it's virtually any way possible you can
get<00:05:47.030> a<00:05:47.060> double<00:05:47.300> wrap<00:05:47.599> on<00:05:47.810> there<00:05:47.990> without<00:05:48.139> doing

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
get a double wrap on there without doing

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.270 
get a double wrap on there without doing
that<00:05:48.590> so<00:05:49.310> I<00:05:49.370> just<00:05:49.610> and<00:05:49.820> then<00:05:49.909> I<00:05:50.000> tap<00:05:50.060> that<00:05:50.330> glue

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 
that so I just and then I tap that glue

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.980 
that so I just and then I tap that glue
and<00:05:52.280> then<00:05:52.370> roll<00:05:52.580> it<00:05:52.760> over<00:05:52.880> just<00:05:53.659> like<00:05:53.780> that

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
and then roll it over just like that

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.140 
and then roll it over just like that
right<00:05:54.169> here<00:05:54.349> straight<00:05:54.680> up<00:05:54.830> and<00:05:55.010> down<00:05:55.120> give<00:05:56.120> it

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 
right here straight up and down give it

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:59.969 
right here straight up and down give it
a<00:05:56.270> little<00:05:56.449> pull<00:05:56.750> down<00:05:56.780> there<00:05:57.349> watch<00:05:57.560> dry<00:05:57.919> and

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
a little pull down there watch dry and

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:02.830 
a little pull down there watch dry and
it's<00:06:00.979> going<00:06:01.099> to<00:06:01.159> come<00:06:01.370> out<00:06:01.490> real<00:06:01.699> nice<00:06:01.909> okay

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.350 
it's going to come out real nice okay
once<00:06:03.110> it<00:06:03.260> does<00:06:03.440> and<00:06:03.740> once<00:06:03.889> it<00:06:04.039> dries<00:06:04.190> I'll<00:06:05.090> show

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360
