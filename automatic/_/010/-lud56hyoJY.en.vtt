00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.979

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.789

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.259
 saved we have namely 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.210
 saved too much and then the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.159
 reduced interest rates will lower the interest rate 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.570
 lowered so that spared no more 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.890
