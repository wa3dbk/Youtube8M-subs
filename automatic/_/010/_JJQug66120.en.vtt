know all we know is that it is HD is
from<00:01:03.960> Nintendo<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:05.009> I<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.460> only<00:01:05.550> assume<00:01:05.759> that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
from Nintendo so I can only assume that

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.389 
from Nintendo so I can only assume that
it's<00:01:06.420> probably<00:01:06.840> going<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.200> be<00:01:07.289> a<00:01:07.619> kind<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.070> we

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:08.399 
it's probably going to be a kind of we

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:10.550 
it's probably going to be a kind of we
two-thirds<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.180> speaking<00:01:09.630> of<00:01:09.750> Nintendo<00:01:10.440> would

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
two-thirds of speaking of Nintendo would

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.469 
two-thirds of speaking of Nintendo would
be<00:01:10.680> foolish<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.130> not<00:01:11.340> incorporate<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> wii

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
be foolish to not incorporate the wii

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.870 
be foolish to not incorporate the wii
name<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.319> we<00:01:13.470> brand<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.069> not<00:01:14.550> have<00:01:14.759> the

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
motion control and stuff I that there

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:17.749 
motion control and stuff I that there
would<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.560> completely<00:01:17.039> foolish<00:01:17.369> not<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:17.580> do

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
would be completely foolish not to do

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.490 
would be completely foolish not to do
that<00:01:17.940> some<00:01:18.630> other<00:01:18.720> things<00:01:19.050> which<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.259> probably

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that some other things which is probably

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.570 
that some other things which is probably
going<00:01:19.709> to<00:01:19.800> have<00:01:19.920> these<00:01:20.130> are<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.369> my<00:01:20.459> thoughts

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
going to have these are just my thoughts

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.460 
going to have these are just my thoughts
I've<00:01:21.090> no<00:01:21.270> evidence<00:01:21.600> about<00:01:21.780> this<00:01:21.899> up<00:01:22.050> it's

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
I've no evidence about this up it's

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.749 
I've no evidence about this up it's
probably<00:01:22.800> still<00:01:23.039> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.369> have<00:01:23.459> a<00:01:23.520> lot<00:01:23.729> of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
probably still going to have a lot of

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.850 
probably still going to have a lot of
the<00:01:23.910> same<00:01:24.090> party<00:01:24.660> family<00:01:25.140> kind<00:01:25.440> of<00:01:25.500> gaming

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
the same party family kind of gaming

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.620 
the same party family kind of gaming
experience<00:01:26.399> on<00:01:26.550> there<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:27.209> probably<00:01:27.390> going

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
experience on there it's probably going

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.540 
experience on there it's probably going
to<00:01:27.720> have<00:01:27.840> things<00:01:28.080> like<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.800> know<00:01:28.920> improved

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
to have things like you know improved

wife are and stuff like that may be
better<00:01:31.560> friends<00:01:31.830> lists<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.429> stuff<00:01:32.520> like<00:01:32.759> that

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
better friends lists and stuff like that

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:34.639 
better friends lists and stuff like that
to<00:01:32.970> be<00:01:33.209> like<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> other<00:01:33.810> consoles<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.560> he

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
to be like the other consoles know he

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.559 
to be like the other consoles know he
could<00:01:34.770> argue<00:01:35.069> if<00:01:35.250> there's<00:01:35.700> any<00:01:35.910> system<00:01:36.420> which

00:01:36.559 --> 00:01:36.569 
could argue if there's any system which

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:37.760 
could argue if there's any system which
doesn't<00:01:36.959> need<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.319> like<00:01:37.349> the<00:01:37.649> other

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
doesn't need to be like the other

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.249 
doesn't need to be like the other
consoles<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.819> the<00:01:39.179> whatever<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.780> two<00:01:40.080> or

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
consoles it's the whatever we two or

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.199 
consoles it's the whatever we two or
something<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.709> that<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.399> in<00:01:41.550> this<00:01:41.670> case<00:01:41.940> I

00:01:42.199 --> 00:01:42.209 
something like that but in this case I

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.870 
something like that but in this case I
think<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.810> they<00:01:42.990> would<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.459> add<00:01:44.610> some

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
think that they would like to add some

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.249 
think that they would like to add some
of<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.390> would<00:01:45.660> like<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.840> see<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
of that I know I would like to see that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.240 
of that I know I would like to see that
it'll<00:01:46.590> probably<00:01:46.740> have<00:01:46.920> some<00:01:47.069> really

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
it'll probably have some really

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
it'll probably have some really
interesting<00:01:47.789> innovation<00:01:48.539> in<00:01:48.660> there<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:48.929> well

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
interesting innovation in there as well

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.779 
interesting innovation in there as well
you<00:01:49.319> know<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.590> way<00:01:49.830> at<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.009> motion<00:01:50.429> control

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789 
you know the way at the motion control

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.690 
you know the way at the motion control
the<00:01:51.239> d/s<00:01:51.539> at<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> touchscreen<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.920> 3ds<00:01:53.340> had

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the d/s at the touchscreen the 3ds had

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.690 
the d/s at the touchscreen the 3ds had
3d<00:01:54.179> with<00:01:54.420> no<00:01:54.569> glasses<00:01:54.810> stuff<00:01:55.440> like<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:56.099> is

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
3d with no glasses stuff like that it is

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.850
