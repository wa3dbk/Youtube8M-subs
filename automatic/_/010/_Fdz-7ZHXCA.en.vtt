00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.820

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.950
 error moster deleted 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.710
 that is I was pretty sad that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.950
 the one from minus 11 57 so eleven minutes 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.739
 7 50 seconds link is always below the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.870
 video description at everyone at each 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.440
 See what happened is on with it 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.660
 Storm Waffle Storm Rises with Brandt 3 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.579
 like in a house together and short 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.699
 on it dumb dies for and that is 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.350
 season has to suspend a consequence 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.600
 that's a pity, of course 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.110
 I celebrate what they all do together 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.590
 move in 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.560
 my territory and dramas and materials 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.090
 represents a perfect perfect team and 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400
 if that ever comes in, that is 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.350
 of course pretty good and that was mine 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.729
 own opinion link is below in the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.880
 again description very briefly 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.210
 watch what happens 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.229
 so much courage and much less 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.720
 ten seconds 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.390
 then it continues with slabs of kids 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.130
 one has died has with it is, unfortunately, 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.299
 nothing was seen and its consequences were 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.860
 everything is too dark 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.350
 but I can say that he does 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.640
 by a zombie died reads 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.930
 come through is not know whether he of 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.340
 comes back or knows unfortunately 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.079
 really not you just have it 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.590
 but nothing is seen through a zombie 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.600
 died 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.710
 that is, a sequence exposing four 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 You can see that from minute 345 link 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.320
 is below in the description 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.170
 then it goes on with team foxtrott and 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:02.189
 start bonuses or crimi he has in 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.009
 his very first follow privately in 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.600
 all his foreigners private 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.840
 very first diaz found 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:14.040
 that is from minute 429 to see that 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.959
 is of course something cool left and is 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.580
 We'll describe it again 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.930
 continue with sick there and that is also 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.510
 so with the last thing that happened and 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.330
 Although morbidly had your kite 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.560
 and whose name was norbert and des 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.420
 disappeared without a trace 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.120
 you do not know what happened or how 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.580
 he disappeared is the whole one sees 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.560
 from minute 11 15 is left and in the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.690
 video description so that's it with 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.299
 galaxy tab 5 I hope you have it 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.310
 please and i hope you have your ideas 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.420

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.880
 Joined together I hope it has you 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.989
 like 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.790
 If you liked this idea can 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.849
 a positive rating there and if you 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.129
 until you look straight until now 

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.769
 then you write the comments hashtag 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.329
 galaxynews and I have one like me 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.790
 please to you now so please listen completely 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.560
 I can not do exactly that 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.980
 every day everyone follows everyone 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.660
 watch 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.370
 I usually only have time from 4 o'clock 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.140
 school and I can not do it by anyone 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.480
 The result is that it is 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.639
 namely 24 youtubers all the time 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.989
 none to 24 videos that are looking 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.280
 over thousands of hours 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.540
 and I just can not do that 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.959
 really and that's why I'm going to you 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.430
 ask her comments to write something 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.030
 example is cancer 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.049
 died 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.859
 then you can write comments 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.290
 hacker of chaos is in the episode six 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.730
 died 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.079
 I hope he liked my help 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.989
 or about to hold up with me too 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.760
 always does not have to look for commands all follow 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.590
 then, of course, control the whole thing 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.519
 if that's really right and me 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.519
 Hope you liked it today 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.630
 especially good and builders
