00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.419
 hello players how are i am bring and 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.450
 I come here to show you a video is 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.980
 about combats not talking about events 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.860
 I have to show the blue dragon in 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.670
 combat as you can see it's already in three 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.140
 of gold and what I'm going to show is put it 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 in combat so they can see how good 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.390
 that such mothers I do this for 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.970
 see if you want to not take it as a reference 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.590
 to see what dragon they can upload to their 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.840
 maximum level 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.759
 as previously I had done in 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.489
 videos of the ruby dragon 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.140
 So, if you like the ruby dragon 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.109
 they saw that he has good attacks good 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.659
 life then you can upload it in this 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.890
 case is going to be now the blue dragon like this 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:45.890
 that we are going to put him in combat 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.719
 let's start 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.620
 as you can see first I put of elevation of 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.350
 mesh 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.690
 this is why 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.059
 not if it starts for example in the soles 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.680
 weak before the fire and starts a cigar 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:10.510
 so it does not make you critical then 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.510
 let's make a magma storm 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.979
 Well, I'll tell you my story 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.689
 blue dragon in what starts in October 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.350
 of the black market I did not get it from 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.960
 tavern 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.270
 then you can and I have it so high 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.909
 level so fast because I already had it 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.490
 for a long time then it was fast 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.130
 upload it from the level 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.399
 well let's make another attack not be 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.399
 the same 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.110
 good position the next hit the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.750
 legendary is going to defeat my height of 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.000
 mesh and then we can see the blue in 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.910
 action 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.050
 well here we were to select it 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.360
 as you can see these are the attacks 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.010
 that I trained him rain anxiety flood and 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.290
 magma cannon balls the nuclear hit 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.730
 Well , I had it, so we're going to 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.560
 start let's make him an acid rain 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.800
 I'm going to make an attack of each one for 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.660
 that you can see them and you decide if 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.660
 if they like it works it goes up in level 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.590
 another legendary 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.590
 let's make a sole this canyon 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.990
 now we are going to make a nuclear strike now 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.070
 what 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.070
 he has little life left 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.280
 very well that was all from the 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.060
 legendary let's play with another let's 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.060
 to put this 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.640
 or a dark cigar 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.130
 also the blue I think is weak to the 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.590
 darkness then also begins a 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.630
 pure some dragon of curious elements 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.280
 already 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.370
 it did not work 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.790
 of example was born critical already almost the 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.790
 size of 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:17.600
 to defeat me now I beat him 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.530
 now comes the other 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.530
 a pure ice 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.849
 I will be able to do great damage just a few 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.849
 ninja stars 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.480
 very good next until he 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.480
 defeated 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.600
 very well now it 's time that between the 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.960
 blue again 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.960
 we put it then the magma flood 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.519
 very well pure knows that my 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.519
 opponents have no imagination 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:02.900
 they always have the cigars are legendary 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.900
 As you can see , I became a critic 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.080
 let's see if I can win it before 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.080
 that he wins me 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.540
 good you get off of 10 thousand will start 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.810
 reached to win let's see how much I 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.810
 low 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.240
 Then I get angry 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.660
 so that they see that sometimes later the 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.480
 Unique are better than cigars 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.860
 the only thing that people choose cigars 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.740
 it's because she in her three stars 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.130
 they have more than 24,000 lives 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.140
 so then since you for life or power 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.510
 they're going to win but we're asking 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.280
 strategy 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.260
 very good a dark other 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.660
 look at him he does know game when a single 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.800
 fossil one of the first unique ones that 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:52.060
 he left 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.060
 not only in the flames 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:00.430
 I came to your leech attack that goes to 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.430
 be again a critic 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.969
 I can not win, we're going to throw him 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:08.470
 another flamethrower 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:13.650
 and here you can go fossil 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.650
 look and take for the legendary troubles 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.190
 very well it was bound now we are going to 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:22.760
 choose the good blue let's give a 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.760
 Acid rain 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.970
 good to see we'll find me down 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.970
 lifetime 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.070
 let's make the flood 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.070
 and if with this the broken dow 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.890
 do not defeat him 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.820
 let's see now let's go to school 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.820
 this canyon 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:56.250
 I worked 9000 nothing was another legendary 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.070
 good legends because legendary the 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.729
 green these are legends in general 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.729
 to an acid rain 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.360
 9000 is it did not reach me from rupert and so 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.610
 water comes a nuclear blow to the most 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.610
 weak 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:24.390
 very well he was already defeated 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:30.360
 well this was the battles with the 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:32.130
 blue already if they liked it if they already like it 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.740
 they can level up since they saw their 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:36.979
 attacks its weaknesses 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:41.400
 the counter that is strong and against that 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:43.800
 what are its advantages and disadvantages and 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.930
 Well, I hope you liked it and
