 I dealt with every increment of view of the server hosting frigo site 

00:00:10.149 --> 00:00:12.589
 so this is one of the best servers 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.199
 initial and free losses 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:16.730

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.540
 click continue 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.540
 sc presents a screen with the synthesis 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.540
 information is from dow jones 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.820
 if it goes to the end 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:04.729
 or inep 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.060
 the next minute 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.060
 mentioned in the register 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.530
 if you will look for a message signed by is the philosophical tale 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.440
 the message sent 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.900
 by the philosopher 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.190

 You will find morgan from a seated 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.970
 so taught me that this yes you will use 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.750
 another section server control panel 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.960
 and taught that this is what you will insert into the tv program

 the cable tnt send all the files of your saite direct to the server 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.700
 even in this case of amanda defect

 more press 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.600
 rc eight companies the content management system 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.080
 so if you want to make a new one 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.800
 a dynamic website I recommend that lord press 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.140
 you click here 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.320
 I do the fighter press 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.140
 then you choose the location you want 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.730
 Sao Paulo 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.050
 with the fall in 2010 with your computer 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.170
 he will visit the abstention points and 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.710
 then it becomes necessary then use unzip this file in a folder 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.939
 will you be able to send these files directly from the server 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.389
 submitted to the final customer 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:16.480
 but who did well 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.019
 it goes away 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.040
 only in my case that opposed the s 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.169
 during this period 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:24.349
 pilot more accustomed to working with this program 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.419
 so I'll insert taxes promoted on the sites 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:29.589
 the patches 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:31.159
 user 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:34.259
 The fan passed me. 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:37.319
 and thus the via park to 20 1% to 20 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.039
 and click the first option 

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:41.999
 but how is the direct server? 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:44.709
 this program will connect the server 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.930
 here adds two bars to the left and to the right in the 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.229
 left 

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:55.649
 all files on the computer are displayed do not know if you are looking for 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:58.789
 for the folder the two companies have contracts to unload 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.879
 and you will drag 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:03.879
 all files here from left to right 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.759
 as soon as all the files by thrash could get from dr 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.829
 to the server 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.309
 then percent of the control panel of the cold site 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:20.439
 the address is https two points // cpc cold spot dry the special compartment 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.479
 what matters is gatwick 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:23.729
 in between 

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:28.189
 with username / password I remember Portuguese honor that pituca logar 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.959
 then display the control panel 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.399
 good if anyone has many doubts about losing control of the 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:36.759
 rejoicing 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:41.709
 ly channel on youtube that would be given inhabited by a turbulent period with 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:44.479
 barral your shepherd wafer videos 

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.799
 this youtube channel you can 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.709
 is to remedy many of your doubts 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.099
 so there are several video lessons 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.099
 important will create a database a bank 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.779
 here the server 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:00.159
 can work 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.799
 the ubiquitous 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:04.889
 click on database 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.729
 then we will fill in the information here 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:10.089
 to create a man with our database 

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:12.529
 I even invented a password. 

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:14.199
 I'll show you left 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.340
 then he already does 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.180
 generate this base 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.320
 he creates this database so it's important that we record this 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.150
 information 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.050
 We'll use it. 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.050
 none of the word press files 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.960
 after 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.259
 send all files backwards percent 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:37.830
 we're going to have to deal with one of them called civil protection. 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.870
 then you are looking for sergipe emdagro fiction with renowned it is the one paid by 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.340
 with the index only given having a child 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.689
 the cooperative 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:48.919
 open with a notepad 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.850
 what we will insert the information that people 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.860
 created a new server crash and sergipe 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.520
 any right to place 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.270
 the future the name of the back bank I believe the server provided us 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:05.199
 to be again because of your presence 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.009
 what we invented faceplate 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.309
 we will put the following training 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:13.599
 but that he four points took his contract 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:16.219
 if you are not without training here 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.569
 in this fourth free fado 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.569
 the impression is going to be able to connect to the database 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.680
 that way the program or sites will not work right 

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:31.150
 again we access the external aid program 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.230
 and in the day that meeting is dear mother with the son 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.729
 because we just edited 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.330
 and erases or dates with fiction 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.199
 this year the entity 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.199
 one done that we will already have access 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.279
 the administrative panel of the organ is in its administrative panel 

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:51.339
 in spain what we will achieve 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:53.259
 think about this information 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:56.599
 and post content on the site 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:59.680
 some people are asking me how to create a domain 

00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:01.159
 Perfect 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.509
 what they can use this great staff is tops to complicated 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:09.469
 is one of those methods, we could 

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.919
 there are some domains without paying anything for it 

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:14.869
 he explains that there is a third option 

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:17.869
 already registered 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:20.749
 and I chose here 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:23.800
 one of the domains that he provides us with 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.460
 in multiple domains since in my case sql centipede cofeci 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.999
 to register 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:32.849
 I put food 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:35.849
 I have to come in to pass.
