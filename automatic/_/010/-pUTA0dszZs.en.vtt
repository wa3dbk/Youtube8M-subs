12 gauge half-inch a little thick on
this<00:00:27.449> wall<00:00:27.630> gauge<00:00:29.150> they're<00:00:30.150> easy<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.990> use<00:00:31.140> just

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
this wall gauge they're easy to use just

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.630 
this wall gauge they're easy to use just
with<00:00:31.740> your<00:00:31.859> fingers<00:00:32.870> there<00:00:33.870> is<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> an<00:00:35.070> oval

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
with your fingers there is a an oval

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.229 
with your fingers there is a an oval
shaped<00:00:35.940> pin<00:00:37.309> just<00:00:38.309> go<00:00:38.550> too<00:00:38.610> close<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
shaped pin just go too close to the

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.770 
shaped pin just go too close to the
camera<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:40.260> an<00:00:40.379> oval<00:00:40.649> shaped<00:00:40.920> hole<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.780> they

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
camera and an oval shaped hole and they

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.930 
camera and an oval shaped hole and they
just<00:00:43.399> some<00:00:44.399> map<00:00:45.079> together<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.700> can<00:00:47.820> also

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
just some map together and you can also

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.709 
just some map together and you can also
just<00:00:48.239> twist<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.260> they<00:00:49.320> come<00:00:49.469> apart<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.719> this

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
just twist and they come apart so this

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.569 
just twist and they come apart so this
reusability<00:00:52.440> allows<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> use<00:00:53.219> them<00:00:53.430> as<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
reusability allows you to use them as a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.340 
reusability allows you to use them as a
as<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.090> clasp<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.750> can<00:00:54.780> put<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> row<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.289> them

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
as a clasp you can put a row of them

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.020 
as a clasp you can put a row of them
down<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.739> down<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.129> front<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.579> shirt<00:00:56.820> key

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
down the down the front of a shirt key

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.200 
down the down the front of a shirt key
to<00:00:57.719> make<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:59.070> make<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.219> vest<00:01:01.730> you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.969> of

to make a to make a vest you can of

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.899 
to make a to make a vest you can of
course<00:01:03.270> take<00:01:03.449> them<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.899> planes<00:01:04.140> since<00:01:04.530> there's

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
course take them on planes since there's

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
course take them on planes since there's
no<00:01:05.909> tools<00:01:06.240> required<00:01:09.020> both<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.799> polycarbonate

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
no tools required both the polycarbonate

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.429 
no tools required both the polycarbonate
and<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.880> Delrin<00:01:12.240> are<00:01:12.450> very<00:01:12.900> very<00:01:13.110> strong

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
and the Delrin are very very strong

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.280 
and the Delrin are very very strong
plastics<00:01:14.270> and<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.420> course<00:01:15.659> with<00:01:15.810> this<00:01:15.960> sort<00:01:16.229> of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
plastics and of course with this sort of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.440 
plastics and of course with this sort of
translucent<00:01:16.890> polycarbonate<00:01:17.580> gives<00:01:18.270> you

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
translucent polycarbonate gives you

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.530 
translucent polycarbonate gives you
interesting<00:01:19.460> possibilities<00:01:20.460> of<00:01:20.820> curtains

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
interesting possibilities of curtains

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
interesting possibilities of curtains
with<00:01:21.780> lights<00:01:22.170> behind<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.799> will<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.700> diffuse

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
with lights behind it will to diffuse

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.300 
with lights behind it will to diffuse
the<00:01:24.360> light<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.860> and<00:01:25.860> give<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.189> very

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
the light and and give a very

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.920 
the light and and give a very
interesting<00:01:26.430> effect

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.110 

and<00:01:31.080> these<00:01:31.500> large<00:01:31.950> rings<00:01:32.310> go<00:01:32.610> together<00:01:32.790> pretty

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
and these large rings go together pretty

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.250 
and these large rings go together pretty
fast<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.800> wouldn't<00:01:35.190> be<00:01:35.280> unreasonable<00:01:35.400> to

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
fast it's it wouldn't be unreasonable to

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:56.420 
fast it's it wouldn't be unreasonable to
whip<00:01:37.260> up<00:01:37.410> a<00:01:37.530> shirt<00:01:37.800> in<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.330> in<00:01:39.330> a<00:01:39.480> day

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.640 

you<00:01:57.150> can<00:01:57.300> also<00:01:57.480> use<00:01:57.780> glues<00:01:58.530> too<00:01:59.340> I<00:02:00.590> guess

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
you can also use glues too I guess

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.080 
you can also use glues too I guess
effectively<00:02:02.400> weld<00:02:02.790> your<00:02:03.000> rings<00:02:03.240> closed<00:02:05.090> we

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
effectively weld your rings closed we

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.279 
effectively weld your rings closed we
won't<00:02:06.300> be<00:02:06.450> offering<00:02:06.810> them<00:02:07.020> but<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:08.700> can<00:02:08.880> get

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
won't be offering them but you can get

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.260 
won't be offering them but you can get
special<00:02:10.289> especially<00:02:10.920> for<00:02:11.520> polycarbonate

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
special especially for polycarbonate

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.570 
special especially for polycarbonate
that<00:02:12.540> basically<00:02:13.260> used<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.860> polycarbonate

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
that basically used the polycarbonate

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.480 
that basically used the polycarbonate
together<00:02:15.470> or<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.770> can<00:02:16.800> just<00:02:17.040> use<00:02:17.160> like<00:02:17.459> a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
together or you can just use like a

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.880 
together or you can just use like a
regular<00:02:17.700> superglue<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.570> it<00:02:18.690> works<00:02:18.900> pretty

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
regular superglue and it works pretty

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:28.530 
regular superglue and it works pretty
good

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.080 

so<00:02:29.439> far<00:02:29.680> I've<00:02:29.769> tried<00:02:29.980> Krazy<00:02:30.340> Glue<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.849> gorilla

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
so far I've tried Krazy Glue and gorilla

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.660 
so far I've tried Krazy Glue and gorilla
glue<00:02:31.409> neither<00:02:32.409> one<00:02:32.620> of<00:02:32.650> them<00:02:32.799> has<00:02:32.950> fused<00:02:33.430> the

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
glue neither one of them has fused the

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.990 
glue neither one of them has fused the
Rings<00:02:33.849> but<00:02:34.060> they<00:02:34.209> worked<00:02:35.400> they<00:02:36.400> worked

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
Rings but they worked they worked

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.940 
Rings but they worked they worked
reasonably<00:02:37.480> well

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.160 

and<00:02:41.950> the<00:02:42.280> stuff<00:02:42.520> also<00:02:42.970> weighs<00:02:43.210> pretty<00:02:43.990> much

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
and the stuff also weighs pretty much

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.500 
and the stuff also weighs pretty much
nothing
