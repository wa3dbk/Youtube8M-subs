down the valley and you'll see it just

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.470 
down the valley and you'll see it just
coming<00:00:40.950> up<00:00:41.040> at<00:00:41.190> like<00:00:41.310> 30<00:00:41.640> or<00:00:41.730> 40<00:00:42.000> miles<00:00:42.150> an<00:00:42.360> hour

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.760 
all the way up into the sky and then it
will<00:00:44.430> obscure<00:00:44.760> everything<00:00:45.240> so<00:00:45.570> pretty<00:00:46.470> cool

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.180 
are at the top of the Albert mountain by
far<00:01:53.180> the<00:01:53.360> best<00:01:53.600> view<00:01:53.900> that<00:01:54.680> we've<00:01:54.800> had<00:01:54.950> the

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
far the best view that we've had the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.670 
far the best view that we've had the
entire<00:01:55.490> trip<00:01:55.790> the<00:01:56.660> Sun<00:01:56.900> cleared<00:01:57.200> off<00:01:57.380> are<00:01:57.650> the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
entire trip the Sun cleared off are the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.999 
entire trip the Sun cleared off are the
clouds<00:01:58.100> cleared<00:01:58.430> away<00:01:58.630> sun's<00:01:59.630> out<00:01:59.840> I<00:02:00.170> think

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
clouds cleared away sun's out I think

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.640 
clouds cleared away sun's out I think
I'm<00:02:01.430> not<00:02:01.610> positive<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.930> mountain<00:02:03.259> nisi

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
I'm not positive the mountain nisi

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.770 
I'm not positive the mountain nisi
sticking<00:02:03.979> up<00:02:04.100> in<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.250> back<00:02:04.460> I<00:02:04.759> think<00:02:05.630> that's

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
sticking up in the back I think that's

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.999 
sticking up in the back I think that's
standing<00:02:06.170> Indian<00:02:06.500> which<00:02:06.650> we<00:02:06.770> came<00:02:06.979> over

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
standing Indian which we came over

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.520 
standing Indian which we came over
yesterday<00:02:07.430> and<00:02:08.090> didn't<00:02:08.899> have<00:02:09.020> any<00:02:09.200> view

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
yesterday and didn't have any view

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.680 
yesterday and didn't have any view
between<00:02:09.950> here<00:02:10.340> and<00:02:10.459> there<00:02:10.610> he<00:02:11.360> could<00:02:11.600> be

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
between here and there he could be

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.970 
between here and there he could be
farther<00:02:11.930> back<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.410> way<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:12.620> that's<00:02:12.740> the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
farther back that way but that's the

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.520 
farther back that way but that's the
biggest<00:02:13.190> one<00:02:13.310> that<00:02:13.459> I<00:02:13.640> see<00:02:14.020> way<00:02:15.020> off<00:02:15.320> in<00:02:15.500> the

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
biggest one that I see way off in the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.500 
biggest one that I see way off in the
distance<00:02:15.670> you<00:02:16.670> may<00:02:16.790> be<00:02:16.850> able<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.150> see<00:02:17.270> some<00:02:17.480> of

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
distance you may be able to see some of

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.760 
distance you may be able to see some of
the<00:02:17.690> Georgia<00:02:17.990> Mountains<00:02:18.170> that<00:02:18.500> we<00:02:18.620> did
