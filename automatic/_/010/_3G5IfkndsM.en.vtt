going until someone

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.040 
going until someone
and<00:01:28.750> I<00:01:29.170> think<00:01:29.260> it'd<00:01:29.470> just<00:01:29.560> be<00:01:29.860> a<00:01:29.890> fun<00:01:31.050> trivia

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
and I think it'd just be a fun trivia

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.230 
and I think it'd just be a fun trivia
based<00:01:34.710> contest<00:01:35.710> so<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.550> first<00:01:36.760> question<00:01:36.850> is

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
based contest so the first question is

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.680 
based contest so the first question is
you<00:01:37.450> know<00:01:37.479> what<00:01:38.380> is<00:01:38.650> my<00:01:39.220> all-time<00:01:39.690> favorite

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
you know what is my all-time favorite

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.080 
you know what is my all-time favorite
Jordan<00:01:41.140> and<00:01:41.350> you<00:01:42.190> could<00:01:42.369> probably<00:01:42.640> go<00:01:42.909> back

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
Jordan and you could probably go back

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.120 
Jordan and you could probably go back
and<00:01:43.390> look<00:01:43.479> at<00:01:43.630> some<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.869> my<00:01:44.020> past<00:01:44.320> videos<00:01:44.530> to

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
and look at some of my past videos to

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.400 
and look at some of my past videos to
find<00:01:45.400> out<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:45.759> know<00:01:45.790> what<00:01:46.270> exactly<00:01:46.780> it<00:01:46.869> is<00:01:46.960> but

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
find out you know what exactly it is but

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.160 
find out you know what exactly it is but
I<00:01:47.440> think<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.070> year<00:01:48.400> at<00:01:48.490> released<00:01:48.910> in<00:01:49.240> addition

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
I think the year at released in addition

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.140 
I think the year at released in addition
to<00:01:50.530> you<00:01:50.619> know<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:50.890> color<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.520> what<00:01:51.759> not<00:01:51.970> and
