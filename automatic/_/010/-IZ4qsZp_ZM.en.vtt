00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.220
 people who think that doing 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.979
 classical music can be safely 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.440

 make money to be successful and 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.770
 rich and respected for this immediately 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.440
 need those financial sector and not think 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.400
 about anything in music as in any

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:45.580
 making money with music and 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.250
 enough money I repeat it never 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.110

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.240
 sleep till born in denmark seventy fifth 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.340
 year began his musical biography 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.530
 unoriginal but only in the sense that 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.540
 the violin appeared in his hands in the distant 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.460
 childhood unlike most children 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.170
 nikolai hasn't parted with music like this 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.550
 often after the initial 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.860
 education he finished danish 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.659
 Royal Academy of Music Award at 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.729
 an international competition helped them 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.560
 become a student at the Vienna Conservatory 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.299
 and then her juilliard school in 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:18.510
 new york but warmest memories 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:21.190
 still about your first hair violin 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.500
 I got the first violin at seven 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.860
 years she was rented in a musical 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.470
 school where i entered my own 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.750
 first violin appeared 9 years old her 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.690
 the parents solemnly handed it was 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.310
 I don't remember the details at home but it was very 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.290
 joyful day in my life 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.890
 then I was very encouraged that I 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.060
 now have your own violin 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.770
 Now the violinist plays a unique 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.390
 the instrument is a violin antonio 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.940
 early eighteenth century sudivari 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.099
 so high talent young maestro 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.440
 appreciated the Danish royal theater exactly 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:55.959
 he entrusted the greatest masterpiece to sniper 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.270
 violin maker with priceless violin 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.709
 men almost never parted but not 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.980
 because it fears for its fate 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.230
 the basement is actually the main violin 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.900
 always and I'm not scared for two reasons 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.120
 firstly not many people are aware 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.250
 the cost of this tool its price 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.110
 not published anywhere but secondly 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.690
 the violin is not just a piece of wood for me 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.550
 she is a kind of animated objects friend 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.739
 you can even say lover 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.989
 the violin is like a man with whom I never 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.790
 not parting and when we are together I 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.340
 I am confident that nothing is 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.140
 happen music played by sniper and 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.090
 sudivari circled almost the whole world 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.060
 considerable share of recognition for young talent 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.410
 expressed and one-sixth of the family in 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.180
 Russian musician is not the first time 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.489
 Russian public for me is one of the most 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.890
 loved her feature by the way about it 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.800
 I am often asked that 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.540
 they are very educated people they donâ€™t 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.670
 you will be successful only because 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.129
 I always come to prove that you 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.319
 worthy of applause needed 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.870
 bring something new to your performance 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.060
 then these people react openly 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.459
 heart and really very sincere 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.680
 only then the performer gets this 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:07.819
 famous Russian warm welcome about 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.239
 which subsequently remembers 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.239
 many years
