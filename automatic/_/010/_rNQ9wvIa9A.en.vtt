hey folks Jamie Caldwell here it was a
subscriber<00:00:02.460> on<00:00:02.610> my<00:00:02.669> Facebook<00:00:03.060> page<00:00:03.270> that<00:00:03.480> it

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
subscriber on my Facebook page that it

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.230 
subscriber on my Facebook page that it
asked<00:00:03.810> a<00:00:03.870> question<00:00:04.130> reference<00:00:05.130> becoming<00:00:06.089> a

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
asked a question reference becoming a

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.049 
asked a question reference becoming a
better<00:00:06.420> deep<00:00:06.779> structure<00:00:07.560> fisherman<00:00:08.040> what<00:00:08.970> I'd

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
better deep structure fisherman what I'd

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.089 
better deep structure fisherman what I'd
like<00:00:09.210> to<00:00:09.330> do<00:00:09.450> is<00:00:09.570> take<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.750> minute<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.260> kind<00:00:11.010> of

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
like to do is take a minute to kind of

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.259 
like to do is take a minute to kind of
talk<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.429> about<00:00:11.519> some<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.030> things

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
talk to you about some of the things

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.120 
talk to you about some of the things
that<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.540> think<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:12.870> important<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.259> me<00:00:13.440> when

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
that I think are important to me when

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.650 
that I think are important to me when
fishing<00:00:14.429> deep<00:00:14.730> structure<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.330> one<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.570> them

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
fishing deep structure and one of them

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.080 
fishing deep structure and one of them
obviously<00:00:15.839> is<00:00:16.230> your<00:00:16.350> electronics<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.910> better

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
obviously is your electronics the better

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.250 
obviously is your electronics the better
understanding<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.810> have<00:00:18.960> over<00:00:19.170> your

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
understanding you have over your

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.950 
understanding you have over your
electronics<00:00:19.890> then<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.310> easier<00:00:20.640> it<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
electronics then the easier it is to

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.870 
electronics then the easier it is to
read<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:21.990> deep<00:00:22.529> structure<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.250> then<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.609> turn

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
read the deep structure and then in turn

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.290 
read the deep structure and then in turn
fish<00:00:24.210> it<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.140> your<00:00:25.320> fishing<00:00:26.300> good

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
fish it and know what your fishing good

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.890 
fish it and know what your fishing good

rule-of-thumb
and<00:00:28.289> it<00:00:28.470> depends<00:00:28.830> on<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.949> transducer<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
and it depends on the transducer and the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.060 
and it depends on the transducer and the
frequency<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.840> general<00:00:30.869> thumb<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
frequency but just a general thumb is to

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.430 
frequency but just a general thumb is to
take<00:00:32.250> your<00:00:32.430> depth<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.000> divide<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.809> by<00:00:33.840> three

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
take your depth and divide it by three

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.530 
take your depth and divide it by three
what<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.940> that's<00:00:36.030> going<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.270> show<00:00:36.480> you

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
what that is is that's going to show you

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.970 
what that is is that's going to show you
what<00:00:36.989> you're<00:00:37.170> looking<00:00:37.500> at<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.770> your<00:00:37.800> screen

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
what you're looking at on your screen

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.459 
what you're looking at on your screen
and<00:00:38.550> right<00:00:38.790> now<00:00:38.940> we're<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.300> talking<00:00:39.510> regular

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
and right now we're just talking regular

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.770 
and right now we're just talking regular
2d<00:00:40.739> sonar<00:00:41.579> we're<00:00:41.760> not<00:00:41.879> talking<00:00:42.180> side<00:00:42.360> imaging

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
2d sonar we're not talking side imaging

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.380 
2d sonar we're not talking side imaging
just<00:00:43.200> regular<00:00:43.559> 2d<00:00:43.770> down<00:00:44.160> sonar<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.270> you

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
just regular 2d down sonar so if you

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.900 
just regular 2d down sonar so if you
take<00:00:45.570> your<00:00:45.629> depth<00:00:46.469> divided<00:00:46.950> by<00:00:47.039> three<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.640> for

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
take your depth divided by three and for

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.970 
take your depth divided by three and for
ease<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.750> purpose<00:00:49.350> we're<00:00:49.530> just<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.860> use

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
ease of purpose we're just going to use

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.459 
ease of purpose we're just going to use
21-foot<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:50.910> we're<00:00:51.059> gonna<00:00:51.660> graph<00:00:51.960> something

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
21-foot so we're gonna graph something

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.290 
21-foot so we're gonna graph something
and<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.340> twenty<00:00:53.610> one<00:00:53.640> foot<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.059> depth

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and that is in twenty one foot of depth

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
and that is in twenty one foot of depth
divide<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.260> by<00:00:55.440> three<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.100> what<00:00:56.309> you're

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
divide that by three and what you're

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.369 
divide that by three and what you're
actually<00:00:56.670> looking<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:57.329> on<00:00:57.539> your<00:00:57.780> screen<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
actually looking at on your screen is a

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.160 
actually looking at on your screen is a
seven<00:00:58.800> foot<00:00:59.010> section<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> bottom<00:01:00.059> now<00:01:00.989> why

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
seven foot section of the bottom now why

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.860 
seven foot section of the bottom now why
is<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.379> important<00:01:01.949> well<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.789> want<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.329> cover

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
is that important well you want to cover

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.260 
is that important well you want to cover
that<00:01:04.019> structure<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:05.010> detail<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.970> want<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
that structure in detail you want to

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.060 
that structure in detail you want to
make<00:01:06.390> multiple<00:01:06.840> passes<00:01:07.020> over<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.650> structure

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
make multiple passes over that structure

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.609 
make multiple passes over that structure
and<00:01:08.220> see<00:01:08.820> all<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:09.659> in<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.170> example

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
and see all of it so in this example

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.670 
and see all of it so in this example
here<00:01:11.070> we're<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> use<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> point<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.439> my

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
here we're going to use a point so if my

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.550 
here we're going to use a point so if my
boat<00:01:14.010> here<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.760> part<00:01:15.570> of<00:01:15.630> my<00:01:15.689> drawings<00:01:16.140> I'm<00:01:16.290> by

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
boat here in part of my drawings I'm by

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.270 
boat here in part of my drawings I'm by
no<00:01:17.220> means<00:01:17.460> an<00:01:17.610> artist<00:01:18.470> my<00:01:19.470> boat<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.830> sitting<00:01:20.130> in

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
no means an artist my boat is sitting in

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.280 
no means an artist my boat is sitting in
twenty<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.670> foot<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.060> water<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.659> sonar<00:01:22.140> is

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
twenty one foot of water my sonar is

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.749 
twenty one foot of water my sonar is
looking<00:01:22.590> down<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.950> what<00:01:23.100> I'm<00:01:23.189> seeing<00:01:23.490> on<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
looking down and what I'm seeing on the

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.880 
looking down and what I'm seeing on the
screen<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.180> only<00:01:24.330> seven<00:01:24.840> foot<00:01:25.200> section<00:01:25.740> of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
screen is only seven foot section of

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.070 
screen is only seven foot section of
that<00:01:26.070> bottom<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> seven<00:01:26.850> foot<00:01:27.030> width<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.049> I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
that bottom a seven foot width so when I

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.770 
that bottom a seven foot width so when I
want<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.409> graph<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.950> point<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.490> here<00:01:29.790> it

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
want to graph this point right here it

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.200 
want to graph this point right here it
becomes<00:01:31.110> important<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:32.400> as<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.790> make<00:01:33.180> my

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
becomes important because as I make my

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.330 
becomes important because as I make my
first<00:01:33.659> pass<00:01:33.930> over<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:34.619> piece<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.070> structure

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
first pass over this piece of structure

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.240 
first pass over this piece of structure
and<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.240> boat<00:01:36.450> moves<00:01:36.780> over<00:01:37.079> this<00:01:37.229> area<00:01:37.650> I'm

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
and the boat moves over this area I'm

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.149 
and the boat moves over this area I'm
only<00:01:38.520> seeing<00:01:39.710> essentially<00:01:40.710> three<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> half

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
only seeing essentially three and a half

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.910 
only seeing essentially three and a half
feet<00:01:41.340> off<00:01:41.610> either<00:01:41.970> side<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> boat<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.990> this

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
feet off either side of the boat so this

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.429 
feet off either side of the boat so this
span<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.880> seven<00:01:45.299> foot<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.750> what<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.020> just

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
span of seven foot is what I just

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.620 
span of seven foot is what I just
graphed<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.009> now<00:01:47.159> in<00:01:47.369> my<00:01:47.399> mind<00:01:47.579> I'm<00:01:48.149> drawing<00:01:48.479> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
graphed so now in my mind I'm drawing a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.920 
graphed so now in my mind I'm drawing a
mental<00:01:48.930> image<00:01:49.259> of<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.000> point<00:01:51.000> here<00:01:51.119> in<00:01:51.570> what

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
mental image of this point here in what

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.749 
mental image of this point here in what
I<00:01:51.960> just<00:01:52.049> graphed<00:01:52.560> now<00:01:52.890> I<00:01:52.920> see<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.369> starts<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
I just graphed now I see it starts to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.760 
I just graphed now I see it starts to
rise<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.299> starts<00:01:54.540> to<00:01:54.659> come<00:01:54.840> up<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.439> obviously

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
rise it starts to come up and obviously

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.030 
rise it starts to come up and obviously
you're<00:01:56.159> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> see<00:01:57.229> your<00:01:58.229> your<00:01:58.530> depth<00:01:58.829> is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you're going to see your your depth is

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.039 
you're going to see your your depth is
going<00:01:59.189> to<00:01:59.250> change<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.600> area<00:02:00.899> you're

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
going to change so the area you're

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.359 
going to change so the area you're
seeing<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.469> going<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.680> shrink<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.100> kind<00:02:02.340> of

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
seeing is going to shrink just kind of

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.039 
seeing is going to shrink just kind of
keep<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.729> mind<00:02:03.030> but<00:02:03.540> as<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.869> make

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
keep that in mind but as we make

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.810 
keep that in mind but as we make
multiple<00:02:04.530> passes<00:02:04.680> now<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.189> turn<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.520> boat

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
multiple passes now we turn the boat

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.789 
multiple passes now we turn the boat
basically<00:02:06.180> we<00:02:06.390> want<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.630> turn<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.020> boat<00:02:07.229> so

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
basically we want to turn the boat so

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.680 
basically we want to turn the boat so
that<00:02:07.979> we're<00:02:08.099> overlapping<00:02:08.729> these<00:02:09.090> areas<00:02:09.479> or

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
that we're overlapping these areas or

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.390 
that we're overlapping these areas or
just<00:02:10.050> touching<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.739> them<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.160> we're<00:02:11.310> not

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
just touching on them so we're not

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.020 
just touching on them so we're not
missing

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
missing

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.490

the the amount of bottom that I am
seeing<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.730> may<00:03:11.880> miss<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.600> now<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:13.530> know

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
seeing I may miss that and now you know

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.530 
seeing I may miss that and now you know
you<00:03:13.709> may<00:03:14.010> fish<00:03:14.340> this<00:03:14.550> point<00:03:14.850> or<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.120> may<00:03:15.360> not

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
you may fish this point or you may not

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:16.880 
you may fish this point or you may not
fish<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:15.959> point<00:03:16.170> because<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.350> didn't<00:03:16.620> see

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
fish this point because you didn't see

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.949 
fish this point because you didn't see
anything<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.579> you<00:03:18.000> know<00:03:18.030> up<00:03:18.329> in<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.600> corner

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
anything and you know up in this corner

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.090 
anything and you know up in this corner
right<00:03:19.079> here<00:03:19.290> is<00:03:19.380> where<00:03:19.500> these<00:03:19.680> fish<00:03:19.890> were

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
right here is where these fish were

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.370 
right here is where these fish were
stacked<00:03:20.400> up<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:21.720> know<00:03:21.810> basically<00:03:22.170> what

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
stacked up so you know basically what

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.440 
stacked up so you know basically what
I'm<00:03:22.560> saying<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:23.040> understand<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.329> know<00:03:24.420> a

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
I'm saying is understand you know a

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.020 
I'm saying is understand you know a
general<00:03:24.870> rule<00:03:24.989> divided<00:03:25.380> by<00:03:25.590> three<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.610> pretty

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
general rule divided by three is pretty

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.690 
general rule divided by three is pretty
basic<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.870> know<00:03:28.380> years<00:03:28.950> ago<00:03:29.190> I<00:03:29.220> used<00:03:29.310> to<00:03:29.519> keep

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
basic you know years ago I used to keep

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.330 
basic you know years ago I used to keep
a<00:03:29.790> little<00:03:30.000> cheat<00:03:30.690> sheet<00:03:30.720> on<00:03:31.110> my<00:03:31.320> on<00:03:31.680> my<00:03:31.709> console

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
a little cheat sheet on my on my console

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.460 
a little cheat sheet on my on my console
that<00:03:32.519> broke<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.880> down<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.810> just<00:03:34.110> put<00:03:34.290> some

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
that broke it down and I just put some

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.080 
that broke it down and I just put some
general<00:03:34.799> depths<00:03:35.100> on<00:03:35.250> there<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:35.700> already<00:03:35.850> have

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
general depths on there and already have

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.000 
general depths on there and already have
the<00:03:36.209> math<00:03:36.390> done<00:03:36.690> so<00:03:36.930> as<00:03:37.079> I<00:03:37.170> was<00:03:37.380> graphing<00:03:37.890> these

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
the math done so as I was graphing these

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.710 
the math done so as I was graphing these
certain<00:03:38.340> areas<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.700> could<00:03:38.850> just<00:03:39.030> look<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.420> I

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
certain areas I could just look and I

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.170 
certain areas I could just look and I
knew<00:03:39.870> how<00:03:40.049> tight<00:03:40.320> to<00:03:40.500> make<00:03:40.650> my<00:03:40.829> corners<00:03:41.400> and

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
knew how tight to make my corners and

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.060 
knew how tight to make my corners and
again<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:42.600> is<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:42.900> for<00:03:42.989> 2d<00:03:43.410> sonar<00:03:43.829> so

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
again this is just for 2d sonar so

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.220 
again this is just for 2d sonar so
continue<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.030> graph<00:03:45.570> your<00:03:45.720> areas<00:03:46.049> whether

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
continue to graph your areas whether

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.300 
continue to graph your areas whether
it's<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.470> point<00:03:46.709> where<00:03:46.920> there's<00:03:47.100> that's<00:03:47.220> a

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
it's a point where there's that's a

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.280 
it's a point where there's that's a
ledge<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.820> hump<00:03:48.150> or<00:03:48.359> roadbed<00:03:48.780> whatever<00:03:49.079> it<00:03:49.170> may

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
ledge a hump or roadbed whatever it may

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.620 
ledge a hump or roadbed whatever it may
be<00:03:49.320> make<00:03:49.799> those<00:03:50.010> s<00:03:50.220> turns<00:03:50.549> understand<00:03:51.420> what

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
be make those s turns understand what

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.170 
be make those s turns understand what
you're<00:03:51.780> seeing<00:03:52.049> look<00:03:52.799> at<00:03:53.010> everything<00:03:53.519> and<00:03:53.880> for

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
you're seeing look at everything and for

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.550 
you're seeing look at everything and for
me<00:03:54.329> you<00:03:54.690> know<00:03:54.780> usually<00:03:55.170> when<00:03:55.290> I'm<00:03:55.380> fishing

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
me you know usually when I'm fishing

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.759 
me you know usually when I'm fishing
deep<00:03:55.859> structure<00:03:56.370> I<00:03:56.549> don't<00:03:57.450> fish<00:03:57.720> unless<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.290> see

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
deep structure I don't fish unless I see

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.440 
deep structure I don't fish unless I see
the<00:03:58.799> fish<00:03:59.160> so<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.430> may<00:03:59.670> spend<00:04:00.060> 30<00:04:00.329> minutes

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
the fish so I may spend 30 minutes

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.960 
the fish so I may spend 30 minutes
graphing<00:04:01.170> something<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:01.799> then<00:04:02.370> leave<00:04:02.640> it<00:04:02.670> and

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
graphing something and then leave it and

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.150 
graphing something and then leave it and
you<00:04:03.810> know<00:04:03.930> now<00:04:04.079> I<00:04:04.109> know<00:04:04.290> what<00:04:04.680> it<00:04:04.799> looks<00:04:05.010> like

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
you know now I know what it looks like

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.009 
you know now I know what it looks like
so<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.459> can<00:04:05.670> come<00:04:05.850> back<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:06.239> it<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.450> just<00:04:06.750> either

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 
so I can come back to it and just either

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.979 
so I can come back to it and just either
fish<00:04:07.440> it<00:04:07.620> or<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:08.670> know<00:04:08.790> regrab<00:04:09.329> that<00:04:09.630> certain

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
fish it or you know regrab that certain

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.770 
fish it or you know regrab that certain
area<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.350> that<00:04:10.440> spot<00:04:10.739> on<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.190> spot<00:04:11.780> versus

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
area of that spot on the spot versus

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.270 
area of that spot on the spot versus
having<00:04:13.019> to<00:04:13.170> redo<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.620> whole<00:04:13.769> thing<00:04:13.799> but<00:04:14.130> now<00:04:14.250> I
