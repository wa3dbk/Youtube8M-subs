economically or ecologically for that
matter<00:00:30.509> and<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.079> something<00:00:31.560> has<00:00:31.860> to<00:00:32.009> give

sustainability<00:00:34.560> has<00:00:34.850> several<00:00:35.850> meanings<00:00:36.030> I'm

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
sustainability has several meanings I'm

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.150 
sustainability has several meanings I'm
sure<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.050> means<00:00:37.200> something<00:00:37.350> different<00:00:37.650> to<00:00:37.920> you

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
sure it means something different to you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.440 
sure it means something different to you
than<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.490> does<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.850> me<00:00:38.880> and<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.300> means

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
than it does to me and it means

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.060 
than it does to me and it means
something<00:00:39.660> different<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.320> other<00:00:40.620> fishermen

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
something different to other fishermen

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.410 
something different to other fishermen
as<00:00:41.310> well<00:00:42.380> for<00:00:43.380> most<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.740> my<00:00:43.800> fishing<00:00:44.250> career

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
as well for most of my fishing career

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.850 
as well for most of my fishing career

sustainability<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.330> me<00:00:48.540> is<00:00:49.410> this<00:00:49.710> fishery

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
sustainability to me is this fishery

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.300 
sustainability to me is this fishery
economically<00:00:50.970> viable<00:00:51.680> and<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.160> what

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
economically viable and that was what

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.940 
economically viable and that was what
sustainability<00:00:53.910> was<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.450> about<00:00:54.950> more

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
sustainability was all about more

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.890 
sustainability was all about more
recently<00:00:56.370> sustainability<00:00:57.300> has<00:00:57.360> taken<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900 
recently sustainability has taken on a

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.200 
recently sustainability has taken on a
different<00:00:58.380> meaning<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.100> me<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.180> our

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
different meaning to me and that is our

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.500 
different meaning to me and that is our
the<00:01:00.600> stocks<00:01:01.760> sustainable<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.000> allow<00:01:03.240> me<00:01:03.390> to

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the stocks sustainable to allow me to

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.200 
the stocks sustainable to allow me to
continue<00:01:03.930> my<00:01:04.110> fishing<00:01:04.650> career<00:01:04.830> next<00:01:05.760> year<00:01:06.060> and

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
continue my fishing career next year and

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.020 
continue my fishing career next year and
possibly<00:01:06.810> into<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.530> future<00:01:07.740> for<00:01:08.100> mize<00:01:08.340> for<00:01:08.880> my

in<00:01:16.070> my<00:01:16.310> particular<00:01:16.549> example<00:01:17.299> in<00:01:17.390> my<00:01:17.420> fishery

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
in my particular example in my fishery

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.910 
in my particular example in my fishery
which<00:01:18.350> is<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.650> halibut<00:01:19.010> fishery<00:01:19.840> primarily

which is the halibut fishery primarily

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.490 
which is the halibut fishery primarily
it<00:01:21.920> was<00:01:22.400> a<00:01:22.700> shift<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.270> attitude<00:01:23.810> when<00:01:24.110> we<00:01:24.290> had

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
it was a shift in attitude when we had

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.630 
it was a shift in attitude when we had
to<00:01:24.970> figure<00:01:25.970> out<00:01:26.180> how<00:01:26.299> to<00:01:26.360> share<00:01:26.630> this<00:01:26.869> pie<00:01:27.140> and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
to figure out how to share this pie and

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.190 
to figure out how to share this pie and
for<00:01:28.640> us<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:28.790> was<00:01:29.150> moving<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.659> a<00:01:29.690> new

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
for us that was moving to a new

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.950 
for us that was moving to a new

management tool called catch shares at
that<00:01:33.170> point<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.590> fish<00:01:33.800> had<00:01:34.040> a<00:01:34.070> value<00:01:34.550> prior<00:01:35.300> to

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
that point the fish had a value prior to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.590 
that point the fish had a value prior to
catching<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.130> as<00:01:37.130> opposed<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.880> it<00:01:38.060> only<00:01:38.270> had<00:01:38.570> a

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
catching it as opposed to it only had a

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.570 
catching it as opposed to it only had a
value<00:01:39.049> when<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.350> was<00:01:39.500> dead<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.009> in<00:01:40.130> our<00:01:40.250> boats

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
value when it was dead and in our boats

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.480 
value when it was dead and in our boats
and<00:01:40.909> on<00:01:41.780> our<00:01:41.990> way<00:01:42.170> to<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:42.619> fish<00:01:42.799> plant<00:01:42.830> to<00:01:43.280> sell

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
and on our way to the fish plant to sell

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.090 
and on our way to the fish plant to sell
the<00:01:43.610> fish<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.500> when<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:45.649> happened<00:01:46.070> we

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
the fish so when that happened we

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.880 
the fish so when that happened we
started<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:46.520> think<00:01:46.729> about<00:01:47.350> sustainability<00:01:48.350> a

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
started to think about sustainability a

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.210 
started to think about sustainability a
little<00:01:49.369> differently<00:01:49.960> not<00:01:50.960> just<00:01:51.259> economics

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
little differently not just economics

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.120 
little differently not just economics
and<00:01:52.460> am<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.720> going<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:53.960> get<00:01:54.170> more<00:01:54.500> than<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.830> next

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
and am I going to get more than the next

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.249 
and am I going to get more than the next
guy<00:01:55.190> today<00:01:55.759> and<00:01:56.030> that's<00:01:56.119> about<00:01:56.420> as<00:01:56.570> far<00:01:56.600> as<00:01:57.050> it

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
guy today and that's about as far as it

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.399 
guy today and that's about as far as it
went<00:01:57.530> now<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.220> now<00:01:58.700> it's<00:01:58.970> is<00:01:59.210> this<00:01:59.929> resource

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
went now is it now it's is this resource

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.359 
went now is it now it's is this resource
going<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:01.009> be<00:02:01.220> there<00:02:01.759> for<00:02:01.789> me<00:02:02.210> next<00:02:02.420> season<00:02:03.369> and

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
going to be there for me next season and

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.450 
going to be there for me next season and
the<00:02:04.580> season<00:02:04.610> after

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.400 

I<00:02:11.520> catchers<00:02:12.390> are<00:02:12.570> great<00:02:12.810> right<00:02:13.020> they<00:02:13.200> allow

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
I catchers are great right they allow

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.770 
I catchers are great right they allow
individual<00:02:14.100> fishermen<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.060> be<00:02:15.150> individually
