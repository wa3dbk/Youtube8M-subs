chris is right out 40 millimeters of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.350 
chris is right out 40 millimeters of
sack<00:02:38.890> so<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.010> shock<00:02:40.220> is<00:02:40.250> definitely<00:02:40.909> too<00:02:41.090> soft

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
sack so the shock is definitely too soft

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.970 
sack so the shock is definitely too soft
in<00:02:41.510> terms<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.780> springing<00:02:42.170> so<00:02:42.500> you'd<00:02:42.709> want<00:02:42.920> to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
in terms of springing so you'd want to

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.210 
in terms of springing so you'd want to
respring<00:02:43.400> the<00:02:43.610> shock<00:02:43.819> with<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.060> stiffer<00:02:44.330> spring

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
respring the shock with a stiffer spring

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.259 
respring the shock with a stiffer spring
remember<00:02:46.220> in<00:02:46.340> this<00:02:46.459> instance<00:02:46.849> when<00:02:47.030> you<00:02:47.060> get

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
remember in this instance when you get

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.259 
remember in this instance when you get
past<00:02:47.450> 35<00:02:47.870> 40<00:02:48.230> millimeters<00:02:48.739> of<00:02:48.769> sag<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:50.000> back

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
past 35 40 millimeters of sag the back

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.059 
past 35 40 millimeters of sag the back
of<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.510> bike<00:02:50.659> is<00:02:50.870> collapsing<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:51.650> causing

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
of the bike is collapsing and causing

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.610 
of the bike is collapsing and causing
the<00:02:52.159> front<00:02:52.459> to<00:02:52.700> extend<00:02:53.150> so<00:02:53.420> until<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:53.959> fix

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
the front to extend so until you fix

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.619 
the front to extend so until you fix
that<00:02:54.890> problem<00:02:55.069> you're<00:02:55.909> really<00:02:56.150> never<00:02:56.450> going

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
that problem you're really never going

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.539 
that problem you're really never going
to<00:02:56.690> truly<00:02:57.200> get<00:02:57.319> an<00:02:57.470> accurate<00:02:57.620> measurement<00:02:58.159> so

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
to truly get an accurate measurement so

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.339 
to truly get an accurate measurement so
if<00:02:59.060> you're<00:02:59.269> buying<00:02:59.450> this<00:02:59.629> bike<00:02:59.840> you're<00:03:00.200> this

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
if you're buying this bike you're this

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.069 
if you're buying this bike you're this
heavy<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:01.430> weight<00:03:01.459> of<00:03:01.790> the<00:03:01.849> bike<00:03:02.030> is<00:03:02.569> towards

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
heavy the weight of the bike is towards

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.449 
heavy the weight of the bike is towards
the<00:03:03.140> rear<00:03:03.379> of<00:03:03.409> the<00:03:03.530> bike<00:03:03.680> with<00:03:03.980> very<00:03:04.220> little

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
the rear of the bike with very little

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.009 
the rear of the bike with very little
weight<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.940> front<00:03:05.090> end<00:03:05.329> that's<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.659> huge

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
weight on the front end that's a huge

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:15.390 
weight on the front end that's a huge
safety<00:03:06.319> problem

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.630 

now<00:03:16.030> we<00:03:16.090> Chris<00:03:16.390> on<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:16.659> bike<00:03:17.430> here's<00:03:18.430> exactly

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
now we Chris on the bike here's exactly

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.789 
now we Chris on the bike here's exactly
the<00:03:19.299> same<00:03:19.510> Sagan<00:03:19.959> Steve<00:03:20.170> did<00:03:20.409> but<00:03:20.590> there's<00:03:20.739> a

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
the same Sagan Steve did but there's a

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.500 
the same Sagan Steve did but there's a
40<00:03:21.129> pound<00:03:21.310> weight<00:03:21.549> differential<00:03:22.000> because<00:03:22.390> the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
40 pound weight differential because the

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.509 
40 pound weight differential because the
back<00:03:22.689> of<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.930> bike<00:03:23.049> has<00:03:23.260> collapsed<00:03:23.590> so<00:03:24.280> until

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
back of the bike has collapsed so until

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.910 
back of the bike has collapsed so until
that's<00:03:24.790> corrected<00:03:25.540> we<00:03:26.110> can't<00:03:26.349> go<00:03:26.470> ahead<00:03:26.739> and

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
that's corrected we can't go ahead and

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.460 
that's corrected we can't go ahead and
accurately<00:03:27.489> measure<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.970> front<00:03:28.269> because<00:03:29.200> the

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
accurately measure the front because the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.860 
accurately measure the front because the
attitude<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.129> bike<00:03:30.400> is<00:03:31.239> all<00:03:31.510> chopped<00:03:31.720> it

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
attitude of the bike is all chopped it

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.399 
attitude of the bike is all chopped it
out<00:03:32.459> now<00:03:33.459> with<00:03:33.609> Lisa<00:03:33.879> round<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.090> bike<00:03:35.609> madam

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
out now with Lisa round the bike madam

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:49.760 
out now with Lisa round the bike madam
and<00:03:40.140> 140

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.400 

we've<00:03:50.340> got<00:03:50.460> 23<00:03:51.060> millimeters<00:03:51.330> of<00:03:51.630> sag<00:03:51.960> so<00:03:52.230> this

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
we've got 23 millimeters of sag so this

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.250 
we've got 23 millimeters of sag so this
spring<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.830> marginal<00:03:53.460> if<00:03:53.900> you're<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.050> this

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
spring is marginal if you're in this

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.620 
spring is marginal if you're in this
week<00:03:55.530> category<00:03:56.100> certainly<00:03:56.820> if<00:03:56.940> you're<00:03:57.090> less

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
week category certainly if you're less

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.210 
week category certainly if you're less
than<00:03:57.810> 140<00:03:58.290> pounds<00:03:58.680> you're<00:03:58.770> going<00:03:58.890> to<00:03:58.950> have<00:03:59.070> to

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
than 140 pounds you're going to have to

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:09.200 
than 140 pounds you're going to have to
re<00:03:59.370> spring<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.730> back<00:03:59.880> of<00:04:00.000> a<00:04:00.060> bike<00:04:07.250> and<00:04:08.250> in<00:04:09.120> the

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
re spring the back of a bike and in the

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:13.040 
re spring the back of a bike and in the
front<00:04:09.420> lisa<00:04:09.750> has<00:04:10.880> 20<00:04:11.880> millimeters<00:04:12.450> of<00:04:12.480> sag<00:04:12.810> so

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
front lisa has 20 millimeters of sag so

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.100 
front lisa has 20 millimeters of sag so
obviously<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:14.430> bike<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:15.240> definitely

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
obviously this bike is is definitely

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.930 
obviously this bike is is definitely
completely<00:04:16.650> mismatched<00:04:17.100> front<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.549> back<00:04:17.700> with

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
completely mismatched front to back with

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.390 
completely mismatched front to back with
springs<00:04:18.270> at<00:04:18.540> spring<00:04:18.810> rates<00:04:19.020> so<00:04:19.320> if<00:04:20.100> you're<00:04:20.310> in

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
springs at spring rates so if you're in

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.220 
springs at spring rates so if you're in
this<00:04:20.580> way<00:04:20.760> category<00:04:21.270> you've<00:04:21.450> got<00:04:21.630> to<00:04:21.720> do<00:04:21.840> some

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
this way category you've got to do some

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.560 
this way category you've got to do some
very<00:04:22.440> significant<00:04:23.220> work<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.640> front<00:04:23.880> but

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
very significant work to the front but

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.010 
very significant work to the front but
in<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.810> back<00:04:24.960> just<00:04:25.230> swap<00:04:25.440> the<00:04:25.560> spring<00:04:25.800> out
