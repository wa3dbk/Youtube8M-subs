00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
hello everybody and welcome to a review

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.180 
hello everybody and welcome to a review
on<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.529> GT<00:00:05.359> 731<00:00:06.359> gigabyte<00:00:06.890> ddr3<00:00:07.970> 64<00:00:08.970> bit<00:00:09.240> and

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:10.190 
on the GT 731 gigabyte ddr3 64 bit and

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.740 
on the GT 731 gigabyte ddr3 64 bit and
yeah<00:00:11.190> so<00:00:12.679> it<00:00:13.679> has<00:00:13.860> like<00:00:14.130> 384<00:00:15.120> cores<00:00:15.389> or<00:00:15.540> some

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
yeah so it has like 384 cores or some

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.859 
yeah so it has like 384 cores or some
and<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:17.039> processes<00:00:17.369> pretty<00:00:18.000> well<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.270> would<00:00:18.600> I

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
and it processes pretty well I would I

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.220 
and it processes pretty well I would I
would<00:00:19.230> say<00:00:19.439> better<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.220> GT<00:00:21.210> 630<00:00:21.750> did<00:00:22.020> for

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
would say better in the GT 630 did for

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.570 
would say better in the GT 630 did for
me<00:00:22.410> and<00:00:23.000> the<00:00:24.000> 610<00:00:24.510> was<00:00:25.439> pretty<00:00:25.949> horrible

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
me and the 610 was pretty horrible

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.460 
me and the 610 was pretty horrible
graphics<00:00:27.090> card<00:00:27.330> especially<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:27.960> price<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
graphics card especially for the price I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.999 
graphics card especially for the price I
think<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.949> 610<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.609> now<00:00:29.760> like<00:00:30.140> 39<00:00:31.140> bucks<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.920> I

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
think the 610 is now like 39 bucks and I

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.990 
think the 610 is now like 39 bucks and I
picked<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.790> 730<00:00:33.329> up<00:00:33.540> for<00:00:33.750> 43<00:00:34.469> bucks<00:00:34.969> which<00:00:35.969> is

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
picked the 730 up for 43 bucks which is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.500 
picked the 730 up for 43 bucks which is
pretty<00:00:36.690> good<00:00:37.010> and<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.100> think<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.430> GT<00:00:38.820> 630<00:00:39.300> was

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
pretty good and I think the GT 630 was

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.740 
pretty good and I think the GT 630 was
like<00:00:39.629> 90<00:00:39.960> bucks<00:00:40.140> which<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.559> outrageous

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
like 90 bucks which is outrageous

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.150 
like 90 bucks which is outrageous
although<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.780> went<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.290> rebates<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:43.920> stuff

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
although I went with rebates and stuff

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.389 
although I went with rebates and stuff
now<00:00:44.730> as<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.530> recorded<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.800> 34

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
now as you can see I recorded here 34

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.369 
now as you can see I recorded here 34
fps<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:48.840> sync<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.559> my<00:00:49.950> fraps<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
fps I like to sync it with my fraps and

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.139 
fps I like to sync it with my fraps and
yeah

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
yeah

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.689 
yeah
no<00:00:54.149> skips<00:00:54.480> no<00:00:54.660> lag<00:00:54.899> or<00:00:55.110> anything<00:00:55.370> and<00:00:56.370> when

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
no skips no lag or anything and when

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.920 
no skips no lag or anything and when
you're<00:00:56.850> doing<00:00:56.969> battlegrounds<00:00:57.660> you'll<00:00:57.809> get

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you're doing battlegrounds you'll get

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.840 
you're doing battlegrounds you'll get
around<00:00:58.850> 60<00:00:59.850> to<00:01:00.000> 80<00:01:00.210> fps<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.280> if<00:01:02.280> in<00:01:02.520> arena

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
around 60 to 80 fps and if in arena

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.280 
around 60 to 80 fps and if in arena
you'll<00:01:03.090> get<00:01:03.300> about<00:01:03.539> 100<00:01:04.530> 150<00:01:05.460> sometimes<00:01:06.290> FPS

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
you'll get about 100 150 sometimes FPS

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
you'll get about 100 150 sometimes FPS
even<00:01:07.650> higher<00:01:07.799> than<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.250> 170<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.540> then

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
even higher than that like 170 and then

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.910 
even higher than that like 170 and then
some<00:01:09.840> medium<00:01:10.170> graphics<00:01:10.320> I<00:01:10.710> wouldn't

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
some medium graphics I wouldn't

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.140 
some medium graphics I wouldn't
recommend<00:01:11.159> anything<00:01:11.490> really<00:01:11.790> higher<00:01:11.939> than

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
recommend anything really higher than

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940 
recommend anything really higher than
that<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.600> want<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> play<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:12.960> high<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.740> we

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.310 
that if you want to play on high and we
can't<00:01:14.220> record<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.729> not<00:01:14.840> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.020> simply

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
can't record or not you can just simply

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.670 
can't record or not you can just simply
play<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.450> yeah<00:01:18.780> I'll<00:01:18.900> be<00:01:18.990> doing<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.320> review<00:01:19.439> on

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
play and yeah I'll be doing a review on

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.580 
play and yeah I'll be doing a review on
high<00:01:20.100> of<00:01:20.340> course<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.880> haven't<00:01:21.509> even<00:01:21.630> messed

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
high of course I haven't even messed

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.870 
high of course I haven't even messed
with<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.830> grandpa<00:01:23.100> truck<00:01:23.310> really<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.700> much

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
with the grandpa truck really that much

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.060 
with the grandpa truck really that much
and<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.869> won't<00:01:24.990> dive<00:01:25.350> into<00:01:25.590> what<00:01:25.799> kind<00:01:26.009> of

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
and I won't dive into what kind of

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920 
and I won't dive into what kind of
computer<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:26.880> until<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.240> next<00:01:27.420> video<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
computer I have until the next video and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.020 
computer I have until the next video and
we're<00:01:28.049> playing<00:01:28.259> high<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
we're playing high just to see if the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.859 
we're playing high just to see if the
card<00:01:30.240> lags<00:01:30.770> and<00:01:31.770> yeah<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> that's<00:01:33.570> pretty<00:01:33.780> much

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
card lags and yeah so that's pretty much

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.060 
card lags and yeah so that's pretty much
my<00:01:34.350> review<00:01:34.860> there<00:01:35.130> is<00:01:36.740> really<00:01:37.740> nothing<00:01:37.890> else

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
my review there is really nothing else

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.710 
my review there is really nothing else
to<00:01:38.250> say<00:01:38.430> about<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.729> I'm<00:01:38.939> gonna<00:01:39.060> test<00:01:39.479> other

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
to say about it I'm gonna test other

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.539 
to say about it I'm gonna test other
games<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.170> course<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.890> thinking<00:01:41.460> about

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
games of course I'm thinking about

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.510 
games of course I'm thinking about
tested<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.350> battlefield<00:01:43.850> 4<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:45.420> hardline

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
tested on battlefield 4 or hardline

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.499 
tested on battlefield 4 or hardline
because<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:47.729> able<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.000> test<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.420> other

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
because I was able to test the other

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.160 
because I was able to test the other
cards<00:01:48.840> out<00:01:48.990> way<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.829> hardline<00:01:50.220> beta<00:01:51.170> they

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
cards out way in the hardline beta they

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.960 
cards out way in the hardline beta they
did<00:01:52.350> not<00:01:52.530> perform<00:01:52.680> like<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> 6/10<00:01:53.579> would<00:01:53.790> not

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
did not perform like the 6/10 would not

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.569 
did not perform like the 6/10 would not
be<00:01:54.119> able<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.360> play<00:01:54.540> hardline<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.170> all<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:56.040> 620

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
be able to play hardline at all the 620

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.700 
be able to play hardline at all the 620
couldn't<00:01:56.909> and<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.299> 630<00:01:57.750> could<00:01:57.990> neither<00:01:58.530> of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
couldn't and the 630 could neither of

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.980 
couldn't and the 630 could neither of
those<00:01:58.799> cards<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.280> and<00:01:59.520> I'm<00:02:00.390> hoping<00:02:00.840> this

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
those cards good and I'm hoping this

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.289 
those cards good and I'm hoping this
card<00:02:01.229> could<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.950> for<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.369> people<00:02:02.670> who<00:02:02.969> you

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
card could just for the people who you

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.600 
card could just for the people who you
know<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.600> my<00:02:03.689> super<00:02:04.140> cheap<00:02:04.460> because<00:02:05.460> I

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
know one of my super cheap because I
