so<00:00:08.920> we're<00:00:09.040> done<00:00:09.160> there's<00:00:09.370> what<00:00:09.490> we're<00:00:09.639> done

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
so we're done there's what we're done

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.130 
so we're done there's what we're done
yep<00:00:11.190> even<00:00:11.760> made<00:00:12.510> it<00:00:12.600> look<00:00:12.690> like<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.020> other

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:13.140 
yep even made it look like the other

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.820 
yep even made it look like the other
kids

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
kids

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.550 
kids
oh<00:00:14.860> pretty<00:00:15.340> that's<00:00:16.030> nice<00:00:18.750> no<00:00:19.750> thank<00:00:19.990> you<00:00:20.020> guys

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
oh pretty that's nice no thank you guys

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.609 
oh pretty that's nice no thank you guys
you're<00:00:21.100> right<00:00:21.840> cuz<00:00:22.840> half<00:00:23.020> the<00:00:23.170> noble<00:00:23.439> gases

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
you're right cuz half the noble gases

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.050 
you're right cuz half the noble gases
are<00:00:23.860> like<00:00:24.040> here<00:00:24.369> take<00:00:24.610> them<00:00:24.730> the<00:00:24.910> other<00:00:25.029> half

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
are like here take them the other half

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.580 
are like here take them the other half
signo<00:00:25.450> we<00:00:25.570> want<00:00:25.779> they<00:00:25.960> don't<00:00:26.110> take<00:00:26.290> they<00:00:26.410> just

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
signo we want they don't take they just

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.960 
signo we want they don't take they just
don't<00:00:26.740> do<00:00:26.860> anything<00:00:27.100> why<00:00:27.430> no<00:00:27.490> but<00:00:27.730> then<00:00:27.849> what

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
don't do anything why no but then what

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.190 
don't do anything why no but then what
are<00:00:28.060> these<00:00:28.150> ones<00:00:28.330> of<00:00:28.420> zero<00:00:28.599> but<00:00:28.720> these<00:00:28.840> oneself

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
are these ones of zero but these oneself

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.530 
are these ones of zero but these oneself
right<00:00:29.619> those<00:00:29.800> are<00:00:29.950> those<00:00:30.099> those<00:00:30.550> top<00:00:31.509> three

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540 
right those are those those top three

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.050 
right those are those those top three
noble<00:00:32.020> gases<00:00:32.500> are<00:00:32.800> what<00:00:33.040> we<00:00:33.130> call<00:00:33.280> unreactive

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.060 
noble gases are what we call unreactive

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.700 
noble gases are what we call unreactive
they<00:00:34.300> don't<00:00:34.450> readily<00:00:34.690> react<00:00:35.230> with<00:00:35.440> anything

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
they don't readily react with anything

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.729 
they don't readily react with anything
and<00:00:36.700> now<00:00:36.820> my<00:00:36.940> question<00:00:37.000> is<00:00:37.420> why<00:00:37.960> could<00:00:38.380> that<00:00:38.410> be

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
and now my question is why could that be

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.200 
and now my question is why could that be
so<00:00:38.980> looking<00:00:39.310> at<00:00:39.430> Keeley<00:00:39.760> and<00:00:39.790> we'll<00:00:39.970> just<00:00:40.090> take

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
so looking at Keeley and we'll just take

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.600 
so looking at Keeley and we'll just take
you<00:00:40.360> in<00:00:40.540> for<00:00:40.570> example<00:00:40.989> for<00:00:41.260> now<00:00:41.550> how<00:00:42.550> many

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:42.610 
you in for example for now how many

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:51.450 
you in for example for now how many
electrons<00:00:43.300> does<00:00:43.420> helium<00:00:43.720> have<00:00:50.160> let's<00:00:51.160> go<00:00:51.309> back

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
electrons does helium have let's go back

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.340 
electrons does helium have let's go back
to<00:00:51.579> them<00:00:51.699> I've<00:00:52.539> got<00:00:52.690> a<00:00:52.719> two<00:00:52.960> man<00:00:53.079> I've<00:00:53.170> got<00:00:53.320> a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
to them I've got a two man I've got a

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.430 
to them I've got a two man I've got a
name<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:55.149> 2<00:00:55.390> right<00:00:55.629> its<00:00:55.660> atomic<00:00:55.929> numbers<00:00:56.260> -

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
name it's 2 right its atomic numbers -

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.779 
name it's 2 right its atomic numbers -
that's<00:00:56.649> -<00:00:56.800> like<00:00:56.920> it<00:00:57.100> just<00:00:57.250> sort<00:00:57.399> of<00:00:57.489> seems<00:00:57.699> I

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
that's - like it just sort of seems I

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:58.950 
that's - like it just sort of seems I
could<00:00:57.910> have<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.090> kiss<00:00:58.329> is<00:00:58.449> sitting<00:00:58.690> in<00:00:58.780> group

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
could have a kiss is sitting in group

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.579 
could have a kiss is sitting in group
but<00:00:59.829> it<00:00:59.920> has<00:01:00.039> two<00:01:00.250> so<00:01:00.820> that<00:01:01.510> one<00:01:01.870> s<00:01:02.050> orbital<00:01:02.289> has

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
but it has two so that one s orbital has

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.190 
but it has two so that one s orbital has
how<00:01:02.769> many<00:01:02.829> electrons<00:01:03.370> in<00:01:03.550> it<00:01:03.720> -<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:07.390> sappy<00:01:07.750> it

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
how many electrons in it - it's sappy it

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.590 
how many electrons in it - it's sappy it
doesn't<00:01:08.620> it's<00:01:08.920> very<00:01:09.400> happy<00:01:09.730> to<00:01:10.030> be<00:01:10.210> sitting

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
doesn't it's very happy to be sitting

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.750 
doesn't it's very happy to be sitting
there<00:01:10.800> being<00:01:11.800> with<00:01:12.640> no<00:01:12.960> electronegativity

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
there being with no electronegativity

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.910 
there being with no electronegativity
and<00:01:15.760> not<00:01:16.600> trying<00:01:16.900> to<00:01:16.990> pull<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.290> electrons<00:01:17.710> to

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
and not trying to pull the electrons to

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.380 
and not trying to pull the electrons to
it<00:01:18.040> so<00:01:18.190> it's<00:01:18.310> a<00:01:18.370> very<00:01:18.700> stable<00:01:19.150> atom<00:01:21.390> and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
it so it's a very stable atom and

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.620 
it so it's a very stable atom and
there's<00:01:22.540> a<00:01:22.630> very<00:01:22.810> limited<00:01:22.990> amount<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:24.520> well<00:01:24.730> in

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
there's a very limited amount as well in

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:35.160 
there's a very limited amount as well in
nature<00:01:32.550> yeah<00:01:33.550> how<00:01:34.060> many<00:01:34.180> times<00:01:34.750> is<00:01:34.870> fluorine

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
nature yeah how many times is fluorine

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:44.270 
nature yeah how many times is fluorine
need<00:01:35.370> one<00:01:36.370> and<00:01:36.670> to<00:01:36.790> fill<00:01:36.940> what<00:01:37.090> horrible

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.100 

yeah<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.670> continue<00:01:45.910> to<00:01:46.180> p-orbitals<00:01:46.870> right

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
yeah to continue to p-orbitals right

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.100 
yeah to continue to p-orbitals right
yeah<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.160> it's<00:01:48.340> it<00:01:49.270> really<00:01:49.330> just<00:01:49.780> wants<00:01:50.020> to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
yeah so it's it really just wants to

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.930 
yeah so it's it really just wants to
finish<00:01:50.320> completing<00:01:50.830> those<00:01:51.010> 2p<00:01:51.400> orbitals<00:01:51.820> and

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
finish completing those 2p orbitals and

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.010 
finish completing those 2p orbitals and
it<00:01:52.060> will<00:01:52.180> be<00:01:52.300> happy<00:01:52.600> very<00:01:53.590> happy<00:01:54.930> we're<00:01:55.930> gonna

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
it will be happy very happy we're gonna

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.710 
it will be happy very happy we're gonna
get<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.230> lot<00:01:56.380> deeper<00:01:56.530> into<00:01:56.830> chemical<00:01:57.160> bonding

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.200 

let's<00:02:01.720> go<00:02:01.780> back<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:01.960> your<00:02:02.050> model<00:02:03.090> looking<00:02:04.090> at

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
let's go back to your model looking at

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.040 
let's go back to your model looking at
your<00:02:04.360> model<00:02:04.660> what's<00:02:04.870> the<00:02:05.020> general<00:02:05.170> trend<00:02:10.050> you

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
your model what's the general trend you
