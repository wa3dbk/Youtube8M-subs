00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.540
 we did what we did what we even got 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.210
 measured the measure of iso that's it yes 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.590
 that is, we have rebalanced 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.840
 lighting between the bottom power 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.820
 and especially the lighting between the light 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.730
 the main lighting in fact that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.619
 structure your lighting and then the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.020
 unclogging that will soften the shadows 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.410
 but hey it's still a little hard cd 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.689
 are lighting a little violent 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.529
 monitoring and led lights are 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.199
 are too strong 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.099
 that is to say, and these are considerations I 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.239
 a little too hard then we should 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.050
 rather spent on something else that's it 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.500
 yes, that means that I use them 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:43.410
 rather unclogging when I'm using 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.690
 the main light of the light of the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.850
 day in lighting and that the light of the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.899
 day give shadows a little marked 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.250
 good I will use posed on the device 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:59.190
 in reportage what the LEDs to illuminate 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.460
 jobs but there it is true 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.970
 that it's hard lighting is good on 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.770
 will always have rest lights if 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.290
 never if ever board such 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.170
 in a mode with trunks go to 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.760
 500 or 600 iso etc have dropped a little 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.250
 two lights that goes on but that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.960
 change nothing change nothing we go up 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.830
 the tisot so we will lose in quality 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.270
 image but the very nature of 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.970
 the lighting is always the same 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.049
 ie when you are in the sun it is 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.439
 took pictures at noon in full 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.930
 Sun 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.329
 you have very hard waves and that qd will have 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.020
 nice to do will stay hard you can change 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.439
 lighting finally not changed lighting 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.299
 change your camera settings 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.890
 the lighting is hard it is hard and so 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.200
 that with my device you killed first 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.680
 you started first by measured 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.049
 scissors that's so not them 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.659
 does one choose according to the 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.600
 power we have available we will 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.460
 serve iso to have enough 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.189
 light in fact but the iso does not change 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.220
 nothing in the lighting quality so at 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.410
 departure we adjust the main lighting 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.050
 which will give the general structure of 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.510
 the photo or video 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.750
 once we have found the right setting 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.750
 in height 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:25.049
 after we will adjust the power of this 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:31.319
 lighting there according to the lens 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:33.150
 that we then use each goal to a 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.510
 optimum setting to have the best 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.410
 optical quality my some c56 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.450
 others it's 8 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.420
 so the best is to get closer to 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.430
 more than this optimum quality of 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.290
 the objective is there for example that 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.540
 does 8 c 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.880
 yes on this good I do not have the record 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.340
 technique of this zoom but there is 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.739
 big chances that its that optimum 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.340
 or around 8hoo and so at that moment we 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.260
 put 8 and we will adjust the power of 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.350
 lighting to have enough light 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.810
 to work at 8 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.859
 and if the lighting we have is 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.639
 not powerful enough 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:14.340
 we show the iso to compensate for this 

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:17.069
 lack of light but go up or down 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.040
 aim them at the exchange and the diaphragm does 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.930
 will change nothing to the overall quality of 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.109
 the lighting say if we have a lighting 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.730
 hard it will chance 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:29.370
 after we are going to have plenty of artifices to 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.200
 try to soften it either d kalck or 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.959
 things but it will eat stands 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.579
 java license 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.680
 so if you want to leave on something 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.099
 softer to see from earlier will be 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.910
 lighting either white umbrellas either 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.480
 light box 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.019
 hello all the appointments the week 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.329
 next 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.980
 resigning changes everything is needed 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.980
 change everything asia
