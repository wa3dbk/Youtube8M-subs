here<00:00:29.669> through<00:00:29.820> suspension<00:00:30.240> won't<00:00:30.539> see<00:00:30.659> which

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
here through suspension won't see which

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.480 
here through suspension won't see which
i<00:00:30.929> suppose<00:00:31.109> will<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.589> something<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.130> punters

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.490 
i suppose will be something that punters

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.310 
i suppose will be something that punters
will<00:00:32.640> take<00:00:33.000> into<00:00:33.270> account<00:00:33.510> yes<00:00:33.960> certainly

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
will take into account yes certainly

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.590 
will take into account yes certainly
from<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.590> Tottenham<00:00:35.280> perspective<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:36.450> will

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
from a Tottenham perspective that will

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.620 
from a Tottenham perspective that will
make<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.780> huge<00:00:36.900> difference<00:00:38.390> but<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> get<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
make a huge difference but I get the

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.120 
make a huge difference but I get the
feeling<00:00:39.720> that<00:00:40.050> both<00:00:40.230> these<00:00:40.440> sides<00:00:40.710> will<00:00:40.920> still

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
feeling that both these sides will still

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.400 
feeling that both these sides will still
fancy<00:00:41.490> themselves<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.810> do<00:00:42.960> well<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.170> this

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
fancy themselves to to do well in this

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.350 
fancy themselves to to do well in this
game<00:00:43.620> both<00:00:43.830> sides<00:00:44.070> really<00:00:44.310> do<00:00:44.460> need<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.970> result

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
game both sides really do need a result

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.960 
game both sides really do need a result
was<00:00:45.480> run<00:00:45.660> after<00:00:46.050> after<00:00:46.290> seven<00:00:46.830> days<00:00:46.970> drop

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
was run after after seven days drop

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.000 
was run after after seven days drop
points<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.380> know<00:00:49.410> disappointing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
points and and you know disappointing

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.480 
points and and you know disappointing
performances<00:00:50.580> so<00:00:50.850> this<00:00:51.630> is<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.810> game<00:00:52.050> where

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:52.490 
performances so this is a game where

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.510 
performances so this is a game where
I'll<00:00:53.490> be<00:00:53.580> not<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.970> lot<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.240> lose<00:00:54.540> either<00:00:54.750> way

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
I'll be not a lot to lose either way

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.740 
I'll be not a lot to lose either way
they'll<00:00:56.520> both<00:00:56.670> think<00:00:56.880> it<00:00:57.000> really<00:00:57.240> going<00:00:57.570> for

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
they'll both think it really going for

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.600 
they'll both think it really going for
it<00:00:57.810> as<00:00:57.960> don't<00:00:58.590> think<00:00:58.830> either<00:00:58.920> these<00:00:59.370> teeth

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
it as don't think either these teeth

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.160 
it as don't think either these teeth
will<00:00:59.850> work<00:01:00.240> you<00:01:00.270> know<00:01:00.450> will<00:01:00.630> want<00:01:00.810> to<00:01:00.990> lose

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
will work you know will want to lose

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.170 
will work you know will want to lose
this<00:01:01.350> game<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.340> think<00:01:02.580> both<00:01:02.760> sides<00:01:03.030> will

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
this game but I think both sides will

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.270 
this game but I think both sides will
also<00:01:03.450> think<00:01:03.690> we've<00:01:04.439> got<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> chance<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.040> winning

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
also think we've got a chance of winning

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.399 
also think we've got a chance of winning
it<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:06.299> should<00:01:06.479> be<00:01:06.509> an<00:01:06.689> opening<00:01:06.990> camera

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it so this should be an opening camera

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.050 
it so this should be an opening camera
what<00:01:07.950> did<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.130> make<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.340> Arsenal<00:01:08.759> last<00:01:08.909> week

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
what did you make of Arsenal last week

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.609 
what did you make of Arsenal last week
Steve<00:01:09.299> because<00:01:09.509> they<00:01:09.689> dominated<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.560> game

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
Steve because they dominated that game

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.550 
Steve because they dominated that game
against<00:01:11.399> Wes<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:12.600> nail<00:01:12.840> cruising

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
against Wes you know to nail cruising

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.859 
against Wes you know to nail cruising
yeah<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.859> then<00:01:13.979> they<00:01:14.130> drop<00:01:14.460> points<00:01:14.880> well<00:01:15.539> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
yeah and then they drop points well the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.179 
yeah and then they drop points well the
problem<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.439> them<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.740> that<00:01:16.829> when<00:01:16.979> they<00:01:17.070> don't

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
problem for them is that when they don't

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.190 
problem for them is that when they don't
dominate<00:01:17.429> they<00:01:17.759> can<00:01:17.909> see<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.899> they<00:01:19.020> could

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
dominate they can see that they could

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.230 
dominate they can see that they could
they<00:01:19.350> could<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.710> they<00:01:20.609> can<00:01:20.789> they<00:01:20.969> can<00:01:20.999> go

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
they could have they can they can go

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.849 
they could have they can they can go
into<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.479> game<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.289> majority<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.710> play

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:22.859 
into a game have the majority the play

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.039 
into a game have the majority the play
for<00:01:22.920> 18<00:01:23.219> minutes<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:24.299> still<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.630> win<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.929> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
for 18 minutes it's still not win it and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.870 
for 18 minutes it's still not win it and
and<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.710> is<00:01:25.799> their<00:01:25.950> problem<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.429> we've

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
and that is their problem and we've

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.340 
and that is their problem and we've
spoken<00:01:27.149> about<00:01:27.359> them<00:01:27.749> and<00:01:27.929> we<00:01:28.020> spoke<00:01:28.200> about

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
spoken about them and we spoke about

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.169 
spoken about them and we spoke about
Liverpool<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.039> I<00:01:29.310> don't<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.700> see<00:01:29.789> a<00:01:29.969> major

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
Liverpool and I don't really see a major

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.940 
Liverpool and I don't really see a major
difference<00:01:30.359> between<00:01:30.689> last<00:01:31.079> year<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.439> the

just worry about a little bit of lack of

to keep the score in both teams as I

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.960 
to keep the score in both teams as I
said<00:02:34.050> well<00:02:34.170> fancy<00:02:34.620> themselves<00:02:35.190> in<00:02:35.610> this<00:02:35.730> game

and I think this will be an opening
cannon<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.980> be<00:02:38.070> fair<00:02:38.220> neither<00:02:38.400> will<00:02:38.700> be
