country it's annoying when you can't
access<00:00:18.000> sites<00:00:18.240> because<00:00:18.600> they're<00:00:18.750> blocked

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
however like all things in this world

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.259 
however like all things in this world
there<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.320> way<00:00:22.500> through<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:23.310> that<00:00:24.119> is

there is a way through that and that is

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.060 
there is a way through that and that is
through<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> technology<00:00:24.779> called<00:00:25.230> VPN<00:00:25.920> or

to access blocked websites and also

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.659 
to access blocked websites and also
gives<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.500> a<00:00:31.529> higher<00:00:31.859> amount<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.309> security

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
gives you a higher amount of security

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.490 
gives you a higher amount of security
than<00:00:32.880> what<00:00:33.059> you<00:00:33.149> will<00:00:33.270> find<00:00:33.450> on<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.719> free<00:00:34.110> public

to pay for later or Lemna bandwidth or
they're<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:06.960> inconvenient<00:01:07.409> however

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
they're just really inconvenient however

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.460 
they're just really inconvenient however
one<00:01:08.640> VPN<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> like<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.689> use<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.110> lot<00:01:10.320> is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
one VPN that I like to use a lot is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.380 
one VPN that I like to use a lot is
called<00:01:10.530> free<00:01:10.979> VPN<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.610> that's<00:01:11.790> because<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.270> is

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
called free VPN and that's because it is

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.570 
called free VPN and that's because it is
completely<00:01:12.659> free<00:01:13.140> no<00:01:13.619> bandwidth<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.280> it's

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
completely free no bandwidth and it's

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
completely free no bandwidth and it's
just<00:01:14.729> straightforward<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.840> let's<00:01:15.990> open<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.320> up

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
just straightforward so let's open it up

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.440 
just straightforward so let's open it up
now<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.610> need<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.850> have<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.030> rooted<00:01:18.270> android

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
now you do need to have a rooted android

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.999 
now you do need to have a rooted android
device<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:18.900> order<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.140> use<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.380> VPN<00:01:19.799> and

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
device in order to use this VPN and

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.469 
device in order to use this VPN and
that's<00:01:20.130> probably<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> only<00:01:20.759> downside<00:01:21.270> to

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that's probably the only downside to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.300 
that's probably the only downside to
this<00:01:21.630> we're<00:01:22.200> mostly<00:01:22.470> p.m.<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.920> don't<00:01:23.130> need

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
this we're mostly p.m. so you don't need

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.870 
this we're mostly p.m. so you don't need
a<00:01:23.340> rooted<00:01:23.490> android<00:01:23.670> device<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:25.670> as<00:01:26.670> soon<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:26.820> we

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
a rooted android device so as soon as we

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.490 
a rooted android device so as soon as we
open<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.240> up<00:01:27.330> its<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.810> start<00:01:27.869> us<00:01:28.200> server

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
open it up its going to start us server

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.609 
open it up its going to start us server
1<00:01:28.770> because<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.310> u.s.<00:01:29.579> arm<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.720> two<00:01:31.500> am

this<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.210> us<00:01:39.509> server<00:01:39.950> 3<00:01:40.950> down<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:43.070> let's

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
this to us server 3 down here let's

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.609 
this to us server 3 down here let's
disconnect<00:01:44.430> first<00:01:45.229> US<00:01:46.229> over<00:01:46.409> 3<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.950> on<00:01:48.619> all

disconnect first US over 3 and on all
right<00:01:49.740> any<00:01:49.829> reason<00:01:50.009> why<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.159> doing<00:01:50.369> your

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
right any reason why I'm doing your

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.580 
right any reason why I'm doing your
server<00:01:50.729> 3<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.210> because<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.990> less<00:01:52.170> traffic

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
server 3 just because it's less traffic

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.999 
server 3 just because it's less traffic
on<00:01:52.680> here

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
on here

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.920 
on here

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
so let's go back to Chrome let's go back

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.319 
so let's go back to Chrome let's go back
to<00:01:58.710> open<00:01:58.920> shows<00:01:59.040> CARICOM<00:01:59.670> which<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.060> previously

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
to open shows CARICOM which I previously

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.780 
to open shows CARICOM which I previously
blocked<00:02:00.659> in<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.020> network<00:02:03.560> and<00:02:04.560> look<00:02:05.520> at<00:02:05.640> that

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
blocked in this network and look at that

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.150 
blocked in this network and look at that
we<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.689> access<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.110> now

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.730 

now<00:02:09.520> the<00:02:09.580> speed<00:02:10.000> is<00:02:10.210> not<00:02:10.510> like<00:02:11.260> I<00:02:11.350> said<00:02:11.560> the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
now the speed is not like I said the

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.190 
now the speed is not like I said the
fastest<00:02:12.220> thing<00:02:12.370> um<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.720> are<00:02:13.750> going<00:02:14.140> to

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
fastest thing um you are going to

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.540 
fastest thing um you are going to
experience<00:02:14.590> some<00:02:14.770> slowdown<00:02:15.220> it's<00:02:15.370> not<00:02:15.460> gonna

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
experience some slowdown it's not gonna

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.950 
experience some slowdown it's not gonna
be<00:02:15.640> as<00:02:15.730> fast<00:02:16.000> what<00:02:16.210> you're<00:02:16.330> normally<00:02:16.510> used<00:02:16.870> to

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
be as fast what you're normally used to

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.900 
be as fast what you're normally used to
just<00:02:17.710> because<00:02:17.980> just<00:02:18.130> being<00:02:18.400> routed<00:02:18.610> through

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
just because just being routed through

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.720 
just because just being routed through
the<00:02:19.060> VPN<00:02:19.210> um<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.070> speed<00:02:21.280> like<00:02:21.400> I<00:02:21.430> said<00:02:21.610> it's

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
the VPN um so the speed like I said it's

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.460 
the VPN um so the speed like I said it's
not<00:02:21.820> going<00:02:21.970> to<00:02:22.030> be<00:02:22.090> as<00:02:22.660> fast<00:02:23.020> the<00:02:23.110> way<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.260> used

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
not going to be as fast the way you used

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.050 
not going to be as fast the way you used
to<00:02:23.560> actually<00:02:23.950> it<00:02:24.040> took<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.190> few<00:02:24.430> seconds<00:02:24.820> longer

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
to actually it took a few seconds longer

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.450 
to actually it took a few seconds longer
than<00:02:25.210> we<00:02:25.450> usually<00:02:25.630> take<00:02:25.840> to<00:02:25.990> load<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:27.070> website

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
than we usually take to load the website

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.090 
than we usually take to load the website
however<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.360> still<00:02:28.600> works<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:29.770> can<00:02:29.890> still

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
however it still works and you can still

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.340 
however it still works and you can still
access<00:02:30.340> pretty<00:02:31.000> much<00:02:31.120> any<00:02:31.270> other<00:02:31.720> website<00:02:32.170> so
