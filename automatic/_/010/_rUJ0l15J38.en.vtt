00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 what's up with friends near by 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.580
 Vielfahrern gaming tv here and warmly 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.099
 Welcome to a fifa 14 ultimate im 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.420
 video to the chemistry styles jammer 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.550
 dear friends we have many inquiries 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.929
 get what are chemistry styles i 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.759
 Can not understand this 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.109
 again please explain naturally do 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.699
 I have that extra video now 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.279
 made by event I have it all 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.170
 beautifully recorded for you so through 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.490
 the player gets a chemistry style 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.199
 better values ​​in certain areas 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.150
 such as headball game or 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.260
 speed and every player like 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.599
 now here for example see fair 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.219
 could have a basic camp freestyle that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.500
 is the standard chemistry style in 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.750
 Every player from the very beginning has it 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.280
 chemistry styles for attack midfield 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.899
 defense and even for the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.010
 Goalkeeper I will then soon 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.110
 I'm getting pretty 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.309
 clearly arranged which values 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.239
 which ones would be freestyle 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.160
 improve 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.289
 that means friends through chemistry 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.579
 seitz you can your player for your 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.160
 make wishes 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.809
 but respect every one 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.379
 Players can only one and come freestyle 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.789
 have 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.920
 that means you can not do it now 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.120
 three chemistry science or so on one 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.530
 giving players that would be a bit too 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.329
 stupid because so you could get one 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.240
 make perfect player and he 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.950
 weird and the players the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.570
 so have the kemmeries forever 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.310
 you appreciate freestyle buys and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.900
 The player who gave then had the for 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.430
 always and if you then one 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.840
 another purchase and then there then has 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.330
 he will not be this new one 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.070
 chemistry styles here now twice and 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.659
 Counted three times that would be natural 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.070
 Not so good because you get one 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.930
 could make perfect player 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.150
 there are now directly to the 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.040
 We catch all camps freestyles too 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.390
 directly with the attack of chemistry style 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.579
 There are friends for every category 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.619
 five different kemmeries partly here 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.210
 let's see lionel messi the first camp 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.220
 his snatch attack is his sniper 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.840
 improve chemistry style by the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.729
 dribbling and shot resisted 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.320
 second of the finisher chemistry style 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.149
 improve shot and fight 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.130
 moderately defended karsais 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.600
 Kopfbalstärke the little dwarf there yes 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.220
 then a third chemistry stylist 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 detail kemmeries part 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.579
 improve shot and pass values 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.170
 the fourth is the maxime and chemistry 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.270
 style by that even improve 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.350
 three values ​​namely the dribblings and 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.520
 the headball fought 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.259
 now come directly to 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.930
 last kemmeries part in things attack 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.340
 this is the franck cammas riester through 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.630
 the speed is improving 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.910
 shot and header game 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.319
 that means freestyle through the camps 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.220
 Messi will be even faster than it already is 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.930
 So it's fast anyway 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.970
 but through these camps is off there 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.530
 as the grenade always yes there comes too 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.210
 straight to the second category 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.890
 this is the midfield category here 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.900
 Unfortunately we still see Gareth Bale in 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.760
 Tottenham Hotspurs but that's not 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.380
 Bad that was on the events and 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.940
 the whole not yet taken over ver 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.620
 madrid yes, you can see it here too 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.630
 the first camp freestyle that is 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.460
 so is kemmer freestyle by the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.050
 improve dribbling and passwords 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.360
 at the second chamber freestyle the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.820
 architect, the passports improve here 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.710
 and the header game now for the third 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.960
 the powerhouse there are improving 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.940
 Defensive values and the passing values 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.530
 that means if now an offensive 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.060
 midfielder you like her 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.530
 want to see a little further back then 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.300
 just give these camps freestyle 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.950
 and he also works more back now 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.370
 comes to the fourth casey stoners is the 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.320
 maestro this year by the improve 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.500
 again three values ​​namely the dribbling 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.480
 and paz values and the last 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.490
 improve engine chemistry style there 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.590
 Speed ​​dribbling and pass 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.390
 values that means gary payton still 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.500
 fast old already is coming now 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.260
 We also go directly to the third category 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.700
 these are the camps since the defense 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.170
 Here we see it all but on it 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.700
 imaged and of course there are 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.100
 also five different chemistry 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.530
 styles the first is the sentinel prime 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.090
 games with the cloud improve the 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.950
 defensively and the header defended that 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.660
 course very suitable for the 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.090
 defender now, too 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.590
 directly the second chamber system 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.540
 guardian there dribbling improve 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.940
 and defensive at the third 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.560
 gladiator kemmeries are improving 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.670
 shot and the defensive values ​​that is 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.320
 now that is very good for the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.790
 full-back because the occasionally 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.380
 meadow and dani alves come to the rescue 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.180
 or marcelo that he is perfect for 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.400
 suitable now at the fourth country 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.600
 style backbone there are improving 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.830
 So three values ​​are mine 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.600
 noticed in the last two 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.030
 improve always three values namely 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.870
 the defensive values ​​pass and that 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.730
 head ball game 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.920
 this all improves on the backbone 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.570
 chemistry style at the fifth den and 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.340
 shows or watch as always 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.440
 that may speak out there improves 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.430
 defensives again and speed 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.840
 the header game 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.610
 now come directly to 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.830
 last category these are the kemmeries 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.620
 partly full for the goalkeepers see here 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.450
 but we hugo hugo loris there's 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.340
 again, of course, five chemistry styles 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:20.530
 once the wall chemistry style at the 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.519
 Diving handling and improve 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.500
 kicking values 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.419
 at the second chemistry style the shield 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.370
 improve the reflexes of the keepers 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.560
 the speed and the kicking 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.150
 Now the third is the cat 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.220
 kemmeries part there improve the 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.180
 reflex speed but me 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.620
 do not understand why the 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.729
 speed but if he out 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.889
 of course , you need it, of course 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.780
 also a certain speed who to 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.979
 is slow and then messi accommodates 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.490
 then of course you must quickly his 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.259
 keeper 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.270
 In addition, this insight comes across very well 

00:04:44.259 --> 00:04:49.030
 here the cat kemmer closes so fast 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.979
 like a cat and there it is 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.330
 on the physical chemnitz is that the 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:53.949
 Keeper always on the right spot on 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.270
 the right place is that if you are 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:57.009
 tried a long shot that he 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.960
 Of course, not so far ahead is the 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:01.120
 Keeper now be the fourth chemistry 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.490
 that's the guru it's finally gonna be 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.500
 Three values ​​are the diving handling and the 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.780
 positional steel values ​​now at 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.710
 Last this is the basic camps yes 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.900
 Here was another example 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.729
 shown that any player at any 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.039
 Goalkeeper all a basic chemicals 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:16.539
 participate against little players or the 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.979
 daughter from the beginning 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:19.840
 That's how the city ​​of Campbell sees fate 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.979
 for every player out of the water too 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.360
 from the video friends i hope so 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.190
 could explain you in detail now 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.849
 what the camps are going into 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.680
 effect 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.240
 yes that was it then I would myself 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.710
 again 1000mikes friend has me 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.000
 a lot of effort was given for everything 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.599
 you clearly and understandably 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.190
 to explain 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.349
 that was it until the next one 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:37.440
 times my dear friends skin pure and 

00:05:35.349 --> 00:05:37.440
 show
