00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.709 
we're going to use that to upgrade this
mortar<00:00:43.980> over<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> right<00:00:44.730> when

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
mortar over here on the right when

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.270 
mortar over here on the right when
you're<00:00:45.840> upgrading<00:00:45.989> your<00:00:46.350> defense<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.010> very

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
you're upgrading your defense is very

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.529 
you're upgrading your defense is very
important<00:00:47.730> to<00:00:47.760> start<00:00:48.000> with<00:00:48.180> your<00:00:48.300> splash

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
important to start with your splash

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.860 
important to start with your splash
defenses<00:00:49.140> because<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:50.430> affect<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.030> largest

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
defenses because they affect the largest

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.350 
defenses because they affect the largest
number<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.170> troops<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.760> make<00:00:54.000> sure<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.180> you

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
number of troops so make sure that you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.470 
number of troops so make sure that you
upgrade<00:00:54.570> those<00:00:54.989> first<00:00:55.559> before<00:00:56.010> anything<00:00:56.190> else

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
upgrade those first before anything else

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.729 
upgrade those first before anything else
but<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.570> never<00:00:57.750> want<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.960> upgrade<00:00:58.109> two<00:00:58.530> or

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
but you never want to upgrade two or

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.500 
but you never want to upgrade two or
three<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.100> same<00:00:59.280> time<00:00:59.489> because<00:00:59.730> then<00:01:00.359> your

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
three at the same time because then your

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.060 
three at the same time because then your
base<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.739> defense

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
base is not going to have the defense

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.920 
base is not going to have the defense
that<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> needs<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.699> protect<00:01:02.820> itself<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.840> we're

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
that it needs to protect itself so we're

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.479 
that it needs to protect itself so we're
gonna<00:01:04.019> go<00:01:04.140> ahead<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> upgrade<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.280> right

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.910 
couple of seconds once I find a base
that<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:36.000> worthy<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.360> attacking<00:01:36.799> all<00:01:37.799> right

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that is worthy of attacking all right

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.380 
that is worthy of attacking all right
guys<00:01:38.100> look<00:01:38.369> at<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.670> base<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.180> we<00:01:39.270> just

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
guys look at this base that we just

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.300 
guys look at this base that we just
found<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:40.170> ridiculous<00:01:40.829> these<00:01:41.100> are<00:01:41.250> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
found this is ridiculous these are the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.789 
found this is ridiculous these are the
kinds<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.610> bases<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.600> always<00:01:43.079> hope<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
kinds of bases that you always hope to

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.440 
kinds of bases that you always hope to
find<00:01:44.040> as<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.460> see<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.790> guy<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.030> not

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
find as you can see this guy is not

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.440 
find as you can see this guy is not
upgraded<00:01:46.020> very<00:01:46.200> well<00:01:46.409> at<00:01:46.649> all<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:48.119> looks<00:01:48.299> like

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
upgraded very well at all it looks like

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.179 
upgraded very well at all it looks like
my<00:01:48.600> screen<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.049> lagging<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.799> a<00:01:49.829> little<00:01:50.040> bit

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
my screen is lagging just a little bit

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.130 
my screen is lagging just a little bit
but<00:01:50.460> we're<00:01:51.240> definitely<00:01:51.450> going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.869> make<00:01:51.990> this

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
but we're definitely going to make this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.670 
but we're definitely going to make this
work<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:52.680> I'm<00:01:53.070> gonna<00:01:53.189> go<00:01:53.369> ahead<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.700> take<00:01:54.329> out

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680

first let C be as any clan castle troops

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.560 
first let C be as any clan castle troops
he<00:01:57.270> does<00:01:57.390> not<00:01:57.710> so<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.399> good<00:01:59.520> for<00:01:59.909> us<00:02:00.060> I'm

going to go ahead and take out this
mortar<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.659> then<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:03.930> are<00:02:04.020> slowly

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
mortar right here and then we are slowly

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.370 
mortar right here and then we are slowly
just<00:02:04.649> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.130> spread<00:02:05.640> around

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
just going to spread around

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.100 
just going to spread around
our<00:02:06.439> barbarians<00:02:07.040> across<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.000> bottom<00:02:08.209> and

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
our barbarians across the bottom and

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.330 
our barbarians across the bottom and
then<00:02:09.229> I'm<00:02:09.289> going<00:02:09.380> to<00:02:09.470> drop<00:02:09.590> down<00:02:09.770> some<00:02:10.039> Wizards

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
then I'm going to drop down some Wizards

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.100 
then I'm going to drop down some Wizards
as<00:02:10.489> well<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.759> help<00:02:10.789> with<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.150> fire<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.750> then

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
as well to help with that fire and then

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.360 
as well to help with that fire and then
we're<00:02:12.200> gonna<00:02:12.290> drop<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.500> couple<00:02:12.680> wall<00:02:12.980> breakers

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
we're gonna drop a couple wall breakers

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.360 
we're gonna drop a couple wall breakers
for<00:02:13.520> us<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.819> get<00:02:14.000> inside<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.660> base<00:02:15.069> as<00:02:16.069> you<00:02:16.250> can

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
for us to get inside the base as you can

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.280 
for us to get inside the base as you can
see<00:02:16.610> pretty<00:02:16.849> much<00:02:16.970> all<00:02:17.239> of<00:02:17.630> these<00:02:17.780> resources

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
see pretty much all of these resources

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.070 
see pretty much all of these resources
are<00:02:18.410> in<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.340> pumps<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:19.910> collectors<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.599> we

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
are in the pumps and collectors so we

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.420 
are in the pumps and collectors so we
don't<00:02:21.260> really<00:02:21.349> have<00:02:21.560> to<00:02:21.709> get<00:02:21.800> into<00:02:22.130> the<00:02:22.250> base

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
don't really have to get into the base

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.850 
don't really have to get into the base
my<00:02:23.150> whole<00:02:23.330> point<00:02:23.569> in<00:02:23.870> this<00:02:24.260> right<00:02:24.530> now<00:02:24.650> is

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
my whole point in this right now is

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.979 
my whole point in this right now is
getting<00:02:25.069> all<00:02:25.400> of<00:02:25.550> these<00:02:25.730> because<00:02:26.540> that<00:02:26.810> is<00:02:26.959> a

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
getting all of these because that is a

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.570 
getting all of these because that is a
lot<00:02:27.260> of<00:02:27.319> loot<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.650> we<00:02:27.769> don't<00:02:27.980> want<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.400> miss

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
lot of loot that we don't want to miss

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.790 
lot of loot that we don't want to miss
out<00:02:28.760> on<00:02:28.959> we're<00:02:29.959> going<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:30.140> drop<00:02:30.230> our<00:02:30.380> King<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
out on we're going to drop our King and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.000 
out on we're going to drop our King and
have<00:02:30.980> him<00:02:31.130> go<00:02:31.340> inside<00:02:31.989> because<00:02:32.989> there<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.709> a

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
have him go inside because there is a

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.830 
have him go inside because there is a
gold<00:02:34.760> storage<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.180> there<00:02:35.269> that<00:02:35.420> we<00:02:35.480> definitely

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
gold storage in there that we definitely

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.050 
gold storage in there that we definitely
want<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.110> get<00:02:36.349> to<00:02:36.590> as<00:02:37.400> you<00:02:37.550> can<00:02:37.610> see<00:02:37.760> we've<00:02:37.880> got

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
want to get to as you can see we've got

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.000 
want to get to as you can see we've got
a<00:02:38.090> majority<00:02:38.630> of<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:39.049> loot<00:02:39.230> so<00:02:39.440> far<00:02:39.709> we're<00:02:39.890> just

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
a majority of the loot so far we're just

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.520 
a majority of the loot so far we're just
going<00:02:40.130> to<00:02:40.160> keep<00:02:40.340> on<00:02:40.569> tickin<00:02:41.569> away<00:02:41.630> at<00:02:42.080> all<00:02:42.260> of

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
going to keep on tickin away at all of

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.050 
going to keep on tickin away at all of
these<00:02:43.299> collectors<00:02:44.299> and<00:02:44.750> pumps<00:02:45.910> there's<00:02:46.910> not

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
these collectors and pumps there's not

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.430 
these collectors and pumps there's not
too<00:02:47.209> much<00:02:47.330> left<00:02:47.690> as<00:02:47.930> you<00:02:48.080> can<00:02:48.140> see<00:02:48.290> we're<00:02:48.380> in

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
too much left as you can see we're in

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.990 
too much left as you can see we're in
the<00:02:48.590> middle<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:49.130> King's<00:02:49.370> running<00:02:49.670> in<00:02:49.790> there

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
the middle the King's running in there

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.240 
the middle the King's running in there
we<00:02:50.750> do<00:02:50.900> have<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.110> bunch<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.470> barbarians<00:02:51.769> left

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
we do have a bunch of barbarians left

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.850 
we do have a bunch of barbarians left
and<00:02:52.489> all<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.269> mines<00:02:53.900> and<00:02:54.110> pumps<00:02:54.440> are<00:02:54.590> done

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
and all of the mines and pumps are done

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.410 
and all of the mines and pumps are done
so<00:02:55.040> everything<00:02:55.340> else<00:02:55.489> that<00:02:55.580> is<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:55.970> there<00:02:56.239> is

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
so everything else that is in there is

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.990 
so everything else that is in there is
in<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.530> center<00:02:57.799> of<00:02:57.829> the<00:02:57.980> base<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:58.819> hopefully

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
in the center of the base so hopefully

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.460 
in the center of the base so hopefully
we<00:02:59.180> should<00:02:59.239> be<00:02:59.360> able<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.690> get<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.989> majority<00:03:00.110> of

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
we should be able to get the majority of

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.520 
we should be able to get the majority of
it<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:01.670> was<00:03:01.940> a<00:03:01.970> lucky<00:03:02.540> find<00:03:02.870> as<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.260> can<00:03:03.410> see

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
it that was a lucky find as you can see

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.289 
it that was a lucky find as you can see
this<00:03:03.680> guy's<00:03:03.890> not<00:03:04.250> been<00:03:04.489> on<00:03:04.579> his<00:03:04.730> account<00:03:04.970> for<00:03:05.269> a

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
this guy's not been on his account for a

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:06.910 
this guy's not been on his account for a
very<00:03:05.540> long<00:03:05.720> time<00:03:05.780> hopefully<00:03:06.349> we<00:03:06.590> can<00:03:06.680> get<00:03:06.739> all

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
very long time hopefully we can get all

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
is lagging again I guess my internet

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.650 
is lagging again I guess my internet
actually<00:03:41.750> isn't<00:03:42.079> fixed<00:03:42.590> but<00:03:43.280> um<00:03:43.519> as<00:03:44.000> we<00:03:44.480> wait

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
actually isn't fixed but um as we wait

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.750 
actually isn't fixed but um as we wait
