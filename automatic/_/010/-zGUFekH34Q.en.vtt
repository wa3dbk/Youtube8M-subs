00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
the the overhead part the simulator and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.429 
the the overhead part the simulator and
I<00:00:15.980> had<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.010> few<00:00:17.220> stuff<00:00:17.490> done<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:18.720> it's<00:00:19.289> not

I had a few stuff done but it's not

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.010 
I had a few stuff done but it's not
really<00:00:19.680> really<00:00:19.980> showing<00:00:20.430> too<00:00:20.609> much<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.180> I've

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
really really showing too much and I've

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.730 
really really showing too much and I've
only<00:00:22.199> I've<00:00:23.160> only<00:00:23.400> been<00:00:23.580> able<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.939> work<00:00:24.269> like

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
only I've only been able to work like

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.890 
only I've only been able to work like
four<00:00:25.939> five<00:00:26.939> hours<00:00:27.359> straight

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
four five hours straight

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.380 
four five hours straight
maybe<00:00:28.289> six<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:29.099> what<00:00:29.730> I've<00:00:29.820> been<00:00:29.939> working<00:00:30.269> on

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
maybe six and what I've been working on

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.840 
maybe six and what I've been working on
is<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:31.710> eyebrow<00:00:32.239> window<00:00:33.239> frames<00:00:34.670> because<00:00:35.670> the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
is the eyebrow window frames because the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.030 
is the eyebrow window frames because the
next<00:00:36.059> step<00:00:36.120> was<00:00:36.450> after<00:00:37.050> after<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.680> overhead

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
next step was after after the overhead

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.750 
next step was after after the overhead
was<00:00:38.250> mounted<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.850> had<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.629> start<00:00:39.840> making<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
was mounted I had to start making the

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:47.170 
was mounted I had to start making the
interior<00:00:42.500> the<00:00:43.500> roof<00:00:43.710> panels<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:45.710> close<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.860> up

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
interior the roof panels to close it up

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.799 
interior the roof panels to close it up
so<00:00:49.129> but<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.160> figured<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.640> could<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:51.000> can't<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.480> can't

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
so but I figured I could I can't I can't

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.430 
so but I figured I could I can't I can't
start<00:00:52.110> making<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.800> making<00:00:53.070> those<00:00:53.340> panel<00:00:54.440> until

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
start making it making those panel until

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.500 
start making it making those panel until
I'm<00:00:55.620> done<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:57.020> with<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.109> eyebrow<00:00:58.469> windows

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
I'm done with with the eyebrow windows

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.799 
I'm done with with the eyebrow windows
and<00:01:00.510> then<00:01:00.719> those<00:01:01.760> those<00:01:02.760> windows<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.480> a<00:01:03.510> pain

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and then those those windows are a pain

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.170 
and then those those windows are a pain
there's<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.739> lot<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.100> angles<00:01:05.430> there's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.820> lot<00:01:06.060> of

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
there's a lot of angles there's a lot of

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.200 
there's a lot of angles there's a lot of
this<00:01:06.330> there's<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.659> lot<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.080> but<00:01:08.060> right<00:01:09.060> now

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
this there's a lot of that but right now

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.280 
this there's a lot of that but right now
I<00:01:09.240> got<00:01:09.570> them<00:01:09.659> crudely<00:01:10.110> done<00:01:11.960> and<00:01:12.960> I'm<00:01:13.080> right

stringers<00:01:54.920> around<00:01:55.920> these<00:01:56.189> windows<00:01:57.860> around

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
stringers around these windows around

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.109 
stringers around these windows around
like<00:01:59.369> three<00:01:59.880> millimeters<00:02:01.909> from<00:02:02.909> three

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
like three millimeters from three

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.819 
like three millimeters from three
millimeters<00:02:03.659> I'm<00:02:03.899> going<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.170> put<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.350> stringer

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
millimeters I'm going to put a stringer

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.120 
millimeters I'm going to put a stringer
so<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.790> something

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
so I have something

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.880 
so I have something
to<00:02:07.760> attach<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.330> roof<00:02:08.929> on<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:10.429> those<00:02:10.580> windows

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
to attach the roof on to those windows

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.130 
to attach the roof on to those windows
when<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.980> roof<00:02:13.190> is<00:02:13.430> on<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.840> interior<00:02:15.580> roof<00:02:16.580> I

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
when the roof is on the interior roof I

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.570 
when the roof is on the interior roof I
will<00:02:18.140> I<00:02:18.950> will<00:02:19.130> start<00:02:19.459> making<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:21.250> last<00:02:22.250> stage

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
will I will start making the last stage

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.010 
will I will start making the last stage
it's<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:23.090> window<00:02:23.390> frame<00:02:23.660> that<00:02:23.900> goes<00:02:23.930> around

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
it's the window frame that goes around

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.490 
it's the window frame that goes around
the<00:02:27.020> eyebrows<00:02:28.630> this<00:02:29.630> is<00:02:29.780> kind<00:02:30.170> of<00:02:30.230> hard<00:02:30.440> to

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
the eyebrows this is kind of hard to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.360 
the eyebrows this is kind of hard to
explain

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370
