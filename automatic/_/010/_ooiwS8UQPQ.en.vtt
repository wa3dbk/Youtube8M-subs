00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
together then they form this infinite

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.679 
together then they form this infinite
bond<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.649> we<00:01:59.100> are<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.640> too<00:01:59.700> when<00:02:00.479> we

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
bond and we are like that too when we

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.899 
bond and we are like that too when we
are<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:00.899> our<00:02:01.259> own<00:02:01.290> we<00:02:02.159> can<00:02:02.340> do<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> fair<00:02:02.880> amount

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
are on our own we can do a fair amount

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.230 
are on our own we can do a fair amount
but<00:02:03.899> when<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.170> come<00:02:04.380> together<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.759> bond<00:02:06.060> of
