smoother as you can see my fingers

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.469 
smoother as you can see my fingers
moving<00:01:33.930> at<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> same<00:01:34.470> rate<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.479> windows

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
moving at the same rate and windows

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.859 
moving at the same rate and windows
phone<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.869> doing<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.170> better<00:01:37.409> job<00:01:37.530> at<00:01:37.979> scrolling

html5<00:01:42.500> capability<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.530> both<00:01:44.009> devices<00:01:44.280> so

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
html5 capability on both devices so

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.780 
html5 capability on both devices so
we're<00:01:44.909> going<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.119> go<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.270> html5<00:01:49.369> test.com<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
we're going to go to html5 test.com and

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.950 
we're going to go to html5 test.com and
html5

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.440 

test<00:01:58.790> dot<00:01:59.790> com<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.570> nokia<00:02:01.140> n900<00:02:01.800> 50<00:02:02.450> so

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
test dot com on the nokia n900 50 so

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.100 
test dot com on the nokia n900 50 so
there<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.900> just<00:02:04.050> hit<00:02:04.260> enter<00:02:04.470> and<00:02:06.110> you're

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
there it just hit enter and you're

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:15.650 
there it just hit enter and you're
loading<00:02:11.060> well<00:02:12.060> that's<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.480> bit<00:02:13.200> difference<00:02:14.660> so

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
loading well that's a bit difference so

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.840 
loading well that's a bit difference so
basically<00:02:16.080> that's<00:02:16.350> this<00:02:16.680> court<00:02:17.010> for<00:02:17.310> me<00:02:17.670> go

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
basically that's this court for me go

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.340 
basically that's this court for me go
and<00:02:18.090> that's<00:02:18.240> the<00:02:18.420> square<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:18.900> windows<00:02:19.320> phone

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
and that's the square for windows phone

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.440 
and that's the square for windows phone
for<00:02:20.390> HTML<00:02:21.500> processing<00:02:22.500> power<00:02:22.790> looks<00:02:23.790> like<00:02:24.060> me

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
for HTML processing power looks like me

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.440 
for HTML processing power looks like me
go<00:02:24.660> is<00:02:24.870> winning<00:02:25.290> by<00:02:25.500> a<00:02:26.000> little<00:02:27.000> bit<00:02:27.180> more<00:02:27.390> than

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
go is winning by a little bit more than

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.660 
go is winning by a little bit more than
a<00:02:27.630> hundred<00:02:27.870> points<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.560> that's<00:02:28.800> that's<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.459> big

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
a hundred points and that's that's a big

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.740 
a hundred points and that's that's a big
difference<00:02:31.040> again<00:02:32.040> scrolling<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.030> smoother

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
difference again scrolling is smoother

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.070 
difference again scrolling is smoother
in<00:02:33.959> Windows<00:02:34.470> Phone<00:02:34.650> for<00:02:34.980> some<00:02:35.160> reason<00:02:35.959> but<00:02:36.959> it

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
in Windows Phone for some reason but it

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.699 
in Windows Phone for some reason but it
seems<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.530> Mego<00:02:38.459> has<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:39.000> more<00:02:39.239> powerful<00:02:39.709> web

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
seems that Mego has a more powerful web

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.989 
seems that Mego has a more powerful web
browser<00:02:41.190> than<00:02:41.810> Windows<00:02:42.810> Phone
