00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.410
 Hello to you again in the very anton 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:17.150
 at dot com and i keep talking about 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.150
 that I played on the last e3 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.150
 2014 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.609
 actually of course I could not get through 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.129
 past far cry 4 which is all very very 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.680
 liked during the press conference and 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:37.290
 bulls what are there to say three types of rca and 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.379
 great game was and as i was told 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.239
 ubisoft themselves for the fourth part were 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.610
 the biggest query caught by tov from 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.769
 press just get in here and play 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.199
 it was very very difficult thank god sony 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.489
 at the exhibition there were stands with a game on there 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.290
 you could only play solo 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.540
 game and duck ubisoft had to get 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.579
 to try the rock itself and that 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.199
 and the other one did and played everything first 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.239
 at home then to the club where everything happens 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.390
 on one card and not just from the open 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.039
 the world cut a piece of taking farta 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.340
 Well, here you can try to take it 

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:10.560
 in many ways 1 is he so aggressive 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.560
 and is that you climb on 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.200
 huge giant elephant and bump 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.119
 central gate security starts 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.970
 panic run in different directions 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:24.259
 with firewood than on this elephant ride them 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.360
 left-right bullet do not have time 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.130
 grab an elephant with its trunk and sends 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.560
 a few meters air afterwards 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.500
 reinforcements arrive at several 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.700
 jeeps and jeep just as scatter in 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.149
 different sides 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.579
 elephant brain thinks everything is very fun 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.560
 wild order to very short i mean 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.719
 just kill the whole fort then arrive 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.610
 a couple of jeeps but dunk them and therefore 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:49.610
 helicopter and your achieve 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.120
 definitely better shooting yet 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.950
 better feel the weapon is generally very 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.170
 enjoyable and shoot very healthy 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.140
 the hero clambers constantly climbing on 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.580
 all sorts of home barn used in gameplay 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.920
 set they need to come in from different 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.780
 sides to change the height to successfully all 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.640
 scatter but for that naturally 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.950
 there were various devices dragons 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.570
 have a bullet you climb on the rocks but 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.340
 very much all of course do not need when you 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.260
 breaking into base with mania 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.000
 if you try to do everything stealth 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.370
 this already has sense when fasted 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.220
 coming from interesting it appeared 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:27.490
 bait can be thrown to the guard who 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.740
 a piece of meat and if there is a predator in the area and 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.690
 come running will eat them and predators everything 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.900
 time is different that is it really and 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.580
 creak work with open world stove 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.410
 may come running may not run 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:43.810
 really cool chip did well 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.170
 third way to take Fartagh who was 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.390
 the demo is take such a bookcase with 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.240
 mad max 2 propeller 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.239
 fly up on her over the fort and soak 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.880
 all of the grenade launcher in this version me 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.290
 madly liked the effect of the flight do not know 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.720
 how they did it but right here 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.760
 fantastic feeling you're in the air 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.770
 hang on some days with one 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.100
 propeller which at any time can 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:11.590
 collapse is not your very liked 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.090
 but the coolest of course begins 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.120
 co-op when you have all these 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.310
 opportunities added interaction 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.380
 with another player can each other 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.150
 help set goals to negotiate 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.950
 simultaneously sniper shots 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.410
 remove the guards well or at the end 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.730
 ends breaking into base at 2 with monks 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.730
 on one and just fun 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.440
 Well what can I say all played headlights edge 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.090
 up to about represent something you can 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.700
 to think about and very cool that ubisoft 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.210
 done from a banal one rides on a jig 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.880
 another shoots up some moments with 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.110
 placing enemies with baits for 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.660
 predators or 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.960
 one player runs along the ground another hair 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.480
 This helicopter shelves cover well then 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.030
 you can create any different 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.520
 very happy and most of all happy 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.250
 that anyone will be available at any time 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.920
 on two players in the open world and me 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.050
 it seems like a huge find because 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.780
 well that's what stopped me from full 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.970
 headlight cleaning edge 3 but the chapter went clear 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.860
 the company is like after this 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.620
 to return to the game and did not really want 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.630
 here you are the reason for the network of forts and turrets 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.060
 grab that don't talk about yubisoft 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.250
 its this concept of the open world though 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.440
 multiplies in different in different games 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.540
 constantly they move forward and this 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.220
 very very happy about the axis of the new company in 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.530
 the club and will not be able to pass on 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.750
 clean the proper Himalayas please 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.930
 take the other we smash everything to the left and 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.930
 on the right 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.360
 otherwise graphically the game how to see 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.360
 not much on 30 part 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.030
 certainly better but generally the same 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.550
 engine I have no surprises here, but sorry 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.780
 I personally already want some straight on 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.790
 xd our turn 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.830
 but here in principle weights can be understood 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.930
 because one thing to do is joking in 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.490
 the novelty of us theater would do but flaw 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.260
 shooter in the open world is still 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:10.980
 harder for earlier and apparently we will have 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:12.600
 wait a little for the rest 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.970
 the plot is still not known 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.640
 except that everything will happen in 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.730
 Himalayas where the pain of Moses raised 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:24.000
 own country dictatorial is that 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.660
 some tourist in this cue glad by chance 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.740
 to please 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.050
 what actually everyone saw on 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.590
 press conferences generally what's the plot 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:33.860
 In principle, mother is important far cry 4 Dnieper 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.860
 this 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.080
 certification 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:06:04.660
 come on angles of an outskirts. 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:06:06.930
 and this is all thanks for watching this is not 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.979
 last video on e3 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:11.800

 more desire to make new videos is 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:21.900
 true truth on it all 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.900
 I'll see you 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.770
