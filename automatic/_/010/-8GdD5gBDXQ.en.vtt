00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.250
 Hello, I want to tell you today 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:13.860
 how to cook one of the best baits 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:16.710
 for carp and carp bream it's boiled 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.880
 unfortunately, I cook potatoes 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:25.710
 recently began to forget a little bit 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.110
 about potatoes as a nozzle in connection 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.550
 with the advent of everyones boilov 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.660
 and similar nozzles but on potatoes 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:40.800
 caught and 100 years ago when else 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:46.170
 boilie and there was no mention so 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:50.719
 try maybe you will not regret so 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.879
 we take potatoes it is better to take potatoes 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:58.129
 the old she more tightly and better kept 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.659
 on a hook, put in salted water and 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:09.049
 cook depending on the size of the potatoes 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:12.270
 10-15 minutes and so I failed the potatoes 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:17.270
 about 10 minutes for this size 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:25.430
 Iâ€™ll have enough potatoes now 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:25.430
 what we do with it further on can 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:38.060
 just chop the potatoes 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:41.010
 on the cubes of the desired size 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.760
 I usually do it right on the fishing I take 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:49.380
 Boiled whole potatoes and cut into 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:52.380
 fishing as needed or here with 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.340

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.550

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.550

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.350
 I'm doing here such neat 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.649
 circles again depending on 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:20.670
 size and syringe 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:24.450

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.830
