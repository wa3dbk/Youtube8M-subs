00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
I would as an architect would call human

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:30.500 
I would as an architect would call human
scale<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.670> little<00:02:29.849> closer<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.299> ground

Sanford and South Donahue the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.160 
Sanford and South Donahue the
significant<00:02:38.489> thing<00:02:38.610> about<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:39.030> unit<00:02:39.390> is<00:02:39.569> it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
significant thing about this unit is it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.819 
significant thing about this unit is it
does<00:02:40.530> wrap<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.810> what<00:02:42.810> we<00:02:42.989> call<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.409> kink<00:02:43.680> in

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
does wrap the what we call the kink in

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.039 
does wrap the what we call the kink in
the<00:02:43.920> building<00:02:44.280> this<00:02:45.150> intersection<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.900> not

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
the building this intersection is not

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.860 
the building this intersection is not
square<00:02:46.590> it's<00:02:47.220> kind<00:02:47.549> of<00:02:47.640> it's<00:02:48.420> about<00:02:48.569> 30

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
square it's kind of it's about 30

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.990 
square it's kind of it's about 30
degrees<00:02:49.019> tighter<00:02:49.590> than<00:02:49.799> square<00:02:50.159> and<00:02:50.489> this

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
degrees tighter than square and this

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.610 
degrees tighter than square and this
unit<00:02:51.329> has<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.659> wrap<00:02:51.810> around<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.140> corner<00:02:52.470> so

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
unit has to wrap around the corner so

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.710 
unit has to wrap around the corner so
it's<00:02:52.769> layout<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.790> actually<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.329> lot<00:02:54.540> more

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
it's layout is actually a lot more
