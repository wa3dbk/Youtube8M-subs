00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 If I know that I promised you this month, 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.740
 delayed a bit by things I had 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.950
 what to do but here they are ready 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.950
 for 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.769
 or what transa mais I had not seen them 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.930
 end but before going crazy with things 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.960
 crazy for the guitar let's see the 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.370
 basic aspects to be able to study 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.550
 correctly so let's start to 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.440
 start the quill the quill nib or 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.420
 as you want to call it, you have to 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.790
 be of hard consistency and you have to 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.589
 have a fairly acceptable edge like 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.360
 what do you see here if you play with 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:52.729
 a nib that is too thin 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.710
 like this one that easily bends or is 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.900
 another that does not even have edge to the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.580
 time to play will cost them a lot 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.159
 work will be uncomfortable or not 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.409
 they will be able to touch what you want and 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.200
 whatsapp always but always have to 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.909
 study with metronome like this all 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.220
 the exercises that I'm going to get to 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.080
 I'm going to leave them in files of 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.820
 guitar pro in the description box 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.400
 of video I can not tell you where 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.380
 download the guitar pro 5 talin but yes 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.570
 I can tell you see from above 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.400
 it's out there for free if they know it google and 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.590
 before you start playing anything 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.659
 with the love of god affirm if there is no 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.860
 nothing more horrible than the sound of a 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.560
 Dreadful detuned guitar would say I 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.750
 let's move on to how to grasp the pen to the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.000
 time to play there are different ways to 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.590
 grab the nib or quill as 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.100
 you want to call and anyone is the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.100
 correct 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.920
 remember that the hand has to 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.500
 rest well on the guitar so 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.630
 so like that so while everything is heard 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.090
 clean and clear the way to grab the 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.550
 nib does not matter now let's move on to a 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.010
 rather pretty important point not 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.590
 how many hours do you practice if you do not 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:10.720
 you do it right it's wrong and this is a 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.970
 problem that many people have to 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.130
 then the correct way in how 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.160
 you have to study the guitar with a 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.640
 metronome and everything clean without distortion 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.640
 A) Yes 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:37.720
 and not so low and here touching love and you 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:40.000
 yes but it's been like 8 hours if you avoid 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.430
 any kind of distractors while 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.010
 you are playing the guitar personally 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.080
 is a terrible way to study and if to 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:49.360
 the time to study the guitar will be your 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.459
 only girlfriend or boyfriend if you are 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.590
 girls because there are also girls who 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.599
 they play the guitar I want to think when 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.040
 are playing the guitar and are 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:02.019
 nib do not touch hard hit him with 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.120
 security to the fucking guitar although 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.840
 They have clean or they do not have amplifier 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.840
 of bitches 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.730
 the secret of sounding good is that 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.890
 so sure you hit the twine between 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.209
 Stronger you hit it better it will sound 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.709
 although of course there are exceptions but 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.239
 then we will get to these 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.780
 summarizing how to study the 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.050
 guitar 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.760
 we need a metronome we need a 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.580
 nib with good edge and hard 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.780
 let's study without distortion everything in 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.780
 the clean channel 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:48.170
 let's study without distractors or 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.030
 no girlfriend and boyfriend 0 facebook to 0 youtube 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.490
 unless it's clear to see my 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.620
 tutorials or my blogs why the ay 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.440
 Finally, remember to always be well 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.880
 well tuned and remember that it does not matter 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.920
 that so many hours are devoted to 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.570
 guitar if they do it badly they will not see much 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.610
 advance on the contrary if they study 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.100
 even if it's an hour or an hour and a half 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.230
 daily without interruptions are going to have a 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.460
 considerable advance in very very little 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.920
 time and finally do not forget 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.690
 download the guitar hero 5 athlete 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.640
 upstairs since in that program I will be 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.590
 putting all the exercises that we see 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.900
 here so this tutorial is to go 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.000
 heating up engines I do not know I despair in 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.380
 We will see a lot of everything just that there is 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.300
 to start from the basics this has been 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.830

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.320
