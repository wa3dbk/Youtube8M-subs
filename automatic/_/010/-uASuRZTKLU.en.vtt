00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.370
 but where the Alex Bartl will be welcome here under their new 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.270
 Channel and see here 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.829
 the intervention actually I'm with me 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:13.429
 Percent tries the sniper rifle 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.169
 tried to Sniper but not hell on it 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.230
 middle and long tries to tear their war course on short distances and 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.480
 similar things No I have a nice BP 2011 Secondary weapon 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.390
 took 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.910
 and just tried to short-term average distance with the opponents to do 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.440
 and as we can see, we manage to use it at a long distance 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.020
 because I just do not 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.030
 m war gravel war cooper and what cool guy NATO still out there 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.030
 to have this possible on it 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.270
 or not 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.660
 yes I just can not do it as well as him I have that in mind 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.140
 for sure "This long break had been determined with the NWZ Rome around the so of 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.150
 half a year or more ago factor 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.250
 so who saves over a year is it that I once again that in 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.760
 Sniper rifle of one hand had at the biz-mobile 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.560
 I tried that at the time he came this 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.670
 I've got that all the way up on offense 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.270
 tries but I'm just not so successful trendy Memene 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.060
 mp5 grabbed and all the way the boss 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.310
 around 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.490
 and therefore 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.210
 I have here 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.280
 also tried with the intervention with the sniper rifle just so 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.460
 to deal with how it actually thought that in the long distance 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.030
 In order to have its advantage when you hit with the first shot of course 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.560
 and otherwise I have taken the PP 2000 why not it is one 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.470
 Super Secondary around 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.060
 so that the 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.409
 whole super works the world in the gm plans just see that whenever 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.189
 I stop in Thuringia or in the house fight in the on the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.840
 Secondary fall back 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.710
 which I just do not see as a mistake but all the better because that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.550
 just makes sense because you are against 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.320
 the submachine gun or the like is at a disadvantage if one manages to 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.990
 Rifle has and especially if you are not the top Oliver Proske time 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.080
 like me just now 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.429
 not to have 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:11.449
 and that's why 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:15.329
 why this is not threatened with the tide thousands of small vans so much 

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:17.519
 much faster and easier 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.029
 than with the intervention 

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:21.889
 otherwise have here 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.439
 What do you want to say, I played with FC Sion 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.939
 He supported me a bit here, but also saw me 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.629
 Yet his trouble with starting the serb is Wrights gave up and has here 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.399
 now 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:38.549
 spent the first few hours on the PC but that has him like me 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:41.620
 Listening to the mouse was a lot of fun 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.539
 about the 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:46.469
 the remedy Timo wondered why the animals are often used or so 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:47.660
 strong Sawa 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.079
 very easy to explain so have already said 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.170
 Just easier to handle her on the PC and the fake even better 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.449
 used as on the consoles 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:59.739
 yes, but you still have to be as good as any round due to noise 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.169
 won 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.529
 and who should that be in Yemen the round profits 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:08.129
 nor Albig's positive, for the right was "completely round except Ballon d'or 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.360
 Bayer secured Main 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.579
 gameplay 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.899
 Wardrobe my gameplay folder again can perform neatly 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:16.269
 so it is around at the time 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.269
 There is no shortage of me or so I can diligently comment on something always has 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.939
 to the reason as asked 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.399
 So it is definitely taken care of 

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:28.799
 Year I want to tell my last video to he has the big topic 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.389
 Food Broder favorite foods they are Keith Ney Zafira and have alike 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.729
 Happy that you return so many comments are so many dishes 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.069
 were called 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.559
 and 

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:42.989
 yes I have to say some of it was called again I knew that too 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.429
 not for advice then so a bit via YouTube or Google im about this 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:50.059
 informed and must say 

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:54.279
 with some Okan me worse bothers me again only I would have said in 

00:03:54.279 --> 00:03:55.129
 a little disgusting 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.250
 that bothers me Haiti another too expensive you can omit one 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:03:59.539
 Try that too 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.999
 otherwise 

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.119
 but when the lights are being considered 4 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:05.989
 not at all 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.019
 but if you like why male youth are always delicious 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.609
 different and 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.230
 So as I said a lot of new and experienced to learn and 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.459
 was definitely interesting 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.889
 what was written all over there and, above all, I fell in with him that pleased 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.240
 Everyone has commented on ways to 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.529
 had already liked thank you for fleas case 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:31.289
 which is also noticed 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:32.879
 So I have years 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.039
 and team-deathmatch 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.770
 KWO Riedl Aurich also shown and long-distance trains on two vans behind the the 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.439
 was with that even on clock and lead with the MP lead 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.029
 though on 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:48.389
 Red because if I am not mistaken 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:49.610
 and 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.639
 years 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.410
 For example, I had the atomic bomb at the run on a hike 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.969
 then the Harrier did not get the action at 30 league into the bushes because of me 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:59.490
 the triggering 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.970
 to get an atomic bomb and to end the game 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.610
 Chr 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.050
 but came over me a comment 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.040
 which does not bother me now quite the contrary that actually shows me that 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.730
 the gameplay is not so important to you to him is the 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.300
 someone comments themselves and that it should be a commentator as the back 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.219
 I'm happy as a commentator too 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:23.160
 Pellissier 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.200
 the less gamblers on YouTube as a commentator 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:29.430
 and this is how I already stood 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:33.580
 Annihilation quite positive which gives me a bit more freedom 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:35.789
 Rohmann 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:38.370
 who in the selection of new gameplay scenes 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.470
 and I know that I do not always get over scores here 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.840
 This must be rare to see with me anyway, because I'm not 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.419
 Problem 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.539
 and the Cardinals anyway as I said I did not care less 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.659
 if the gameplay I like or has fun playing 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.050
 then that is 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.949
 and yes that shows me that I'm even more gameplay is the 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:05.210
 Example already deleted or so NeuchÃ¢tel Tokyo can show 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.600
 because Ullrich Steinmeier my comment anyway are more important as I said that 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.199
 I'm definitely happy 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.199
 otherwise I'll be in the match here 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.560
 quite often from exactly that guy Yovite pours down like this 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.910
 Meijer manager anything you'll get this stupid night run on command 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.009
 I'm not in the first game 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:29.539
 but as said so long as the crowd win 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:32.779
 - pretty much no matter there was that way again 

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.320
 annually something not important important disgustingly watered down 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.370
 more like you can see how the whole lot of threes victories to such a thing on the 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.699
 finger 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:47.819
 Unfortunately, before that, it will certainly be realized again 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.749
 so we hope this is to be limited and not as easy as 

00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:54.919
 Mandy Zwo's definitely not 

00:06:54.919 --> 00:06:57.680
 and that's definitely the most important thing 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.259
 I can only say to the other one, I am very glad for the next one 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:02.240
 Gameplay is 

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.210
 the next game will get rocks coming from me that one or the other 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.899
 other Schumacher 

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:10.460
 in order to do so 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.130
 with the MP Fifth namely with the sniper rifle with the nw fives 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.509
 Play the 1 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:19.270
 Since I'm right off and that was really really cool so I say 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:20.629
 let's see if I can 

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:23.279
 when I use it for that 

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:24.260
 and 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.030
 otherwise I would like to know about you from time to time here 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:32.559
 Such a Stoiber Gameplay seen as I just play games here 

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:36.529
 or do not you care because I just in terms of Defender right 

00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:39.529
 So here is ISO intervention according to the motto 

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:44.069
 yes that will interest me that I would like to know from you 

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:47.099
 otherwise I would say let's look again in the last election 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:47.960
 on 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.960
 the funds for the 2000 and very little ammunition 

00:07:52.059 --> 00:07:54.379
 but it was enough 

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:56.119
 I have such fall 

00:07:56.119 --> 00:08:00.029
 tell me if he would like to see something quite often again if not then 

00:08:00.029 --> 00:08:01.400
 just not and 

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:03.910
 I would like to say goodbye with you until next time 

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.639
 yesterday then last year's quarter
