00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
okay everybody I promised a video on how

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.480 
okay everybody I promised a video on how
to<00:00:03.090> program<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.689> Motorola<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.830> GP<00:00:05.390> 68<00:00:07.490> first

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
to program the Motorola the GP 68 first

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:09.980 
to program the Motorola the GP 68 first
off<00:00:08.700> when<00:00:08.880> you<00:00:08.940> get<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.269> you're<00:00:09.510> gonna<00:00:09.660> turn<00:00:09.840> it

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
off when you get it you're gonna turn it

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.690 
off when you get it you're gonna turn it
on<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.349> it'll<00:00:11.099> show<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.340> frequency<00:00:13.700> the

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
on and it'll show the frequency the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.210 
on and it'll show the frequency the
frequency<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.509> know<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.809> scroll<00:00:16.710> around<00:00:16.890> you

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
frequency you know the scroll around you

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.340 
frequency you know the scroll around you
can<00:00:17.340> change<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:18.140> anyways

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
can change it anyways

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.670 
can change it anyways
so<00:00:20.310> say<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.300> want<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.660> program<00:00:24.019> 16<00:00:25.019> that's

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
so say you want to program 16 that's

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.250 
so say you want to program 16 that's
okay<00:00:26.010> so<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.279> type<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.699> your<00:00:27.140> frequency<00:00:28.140> that

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
okay so you type in your frequency that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.580 
okay so you type in your frequency that
you<00:00:28.380> want<00:00:28.410> so<00:00:28.920> I'm<00:00:29.010> going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.189> put<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:30.590> six

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
you want so I'm going to put one six

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.410 
you want so I'm going to put one six
zero<00:00:31.920> zero<00:00:32.250> zero<00:00:32.610> zero<00:00:33.800> what<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.920> do<00:00:35.420> after

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
zero zero zero zero what you do after

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.760 
zero zero zero zero what you do after
that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.569 
that
that's<00:00:38.399> your<00:00:38.640> receiving<00:00:39.270> frequency<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.800> you

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
that's your receiving frequency and you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.520 
that's your receiving frequency and you
can<00:00:41.730> also<00:00:41.879> leave<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.809> as<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.440> it

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
can also leave it just as that and it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.590 
can also leave it just as that and it
will<00:00:43.620> transmit<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.789> same<00:00:44.969> frequency<00:00:45.450> but

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
will transmit on the same frequency but

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.180 
will transmit on the same frequency but
if<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:46.079> to<00:00:46.170> have<00:00:46.289> a<00:00:46.320> different<00:00:46.739> transmit

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
if you want to have a different transmit

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.029 
if you want to have a different transmit
frequency<00:00:47.960> you<00:00:48.960> press<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.559> middle<00:00:49.920> button

and<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.460> hold<00:00:50.730> it<00:00:52.219> it'll<00:00:53.219> show<00:00:53.399> up<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
and you hold it it'll show up a

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.670 
and you hold it it'll show up a
different<00:00:53.850> frequency<00:00:54.350> type<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.559> your

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
different frequency type in your

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.170 
different frequency type in your

positive and negative sign are on there

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.440 
positive and negative sign are on there
and<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.110> means<00:02:03.320> that<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.189> is<00:02:04.450> user

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
and that means that it is user

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.790 
and that means that it is user

and<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.780> number<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.230> Channel<00:02:20.500> you<00:02:21.500> go<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:23.030> find

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
and the number of Channel you go to find

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.229 
and the number of Channel you go to find
an<00:02:23.360> empty<00:02:23.540> channel<00:02:23.930> it'll<00:02:24.769> blink<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.910> channel

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
an empty channel it'll blink the channel

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.220 
an empty channel it'll blink the channel
like<00:02:26.420> that<00:02:26.980> that<00:02:27.980> means<00:02:28.130> it's<00:02:28.400> empty<00:02:28.670> but<00:02:29.239> like

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
like that that means it's empty but like

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.930 
like that that means it's empty but like
on<00:02:30.410> those<00:02:30.620> I<00:02:30.980> already<00:02:31.220> have<00:02:31.340> this<00:02:31.519> programmed

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
on those I already have this programmed

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.630 
on those I already have this programmed
in<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.360> I'm<00:02:32.450> not<00:02:32.569> gonna<00:02:32.690> do<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:33.459> so<00:02:34.459> say<00:02:34.610> I
