looks<00:01:12.840> together<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:14.630> also<00:01:15.630> wanted<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:15.990> show<00:01:16.140> you

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
looks together I also wanted to show you

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.810 
looks together I also wanted to show you
a<00:01:16.320> more<00:01:16.470> tailored<00:01:16.799> way<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> wear<00:01:17.400> this<00:01:17.549> sweater

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
a more tailored way to wear this sweater

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
a more tailored way to wear this sweater
and<00:01:17.909> that's<00:01:18.150> by<00:01:18.329> adding<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.840> collared<00:01:19.290> shirt

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and that's by adding a collared shirt

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.319 
and that's by adding a collared shirt
underneath<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:20.070> put<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.460> white<00:01:20.790> collared<00:01:21.180> one

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
underneath I put this white collared one

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.490 
underneath I put this white collared one
underneath<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> red<00:01:22.140> one<00:01:22.290> would<00:01:22.409> look

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
underneath but a red one would look

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.069 
underneath but a red one would look
really<00:01:22.740> good<00:01:22.950> too<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.479> I<00:01:24.479> think<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.990> this

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
really good too and I think that this

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.120 
really good too and I think that this
just<00:01:25.320> adds<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.590> little<00:01:25.710> bit<00:01:25.799> more<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.070> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
just adds a little bit more of a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.950 
just adds a little bit more of a
fashion-forward<00:01:26.579> take<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.689> sweater

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
fashion-forward take on this sweater

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.149 
fashion-forward take on this sweater
this<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.320> probably<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.680> way<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.920> would

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
this is probably the way that I would

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.910 
this is probably the way that I would
wear<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:30.200> also<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.229> wanted<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> show<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.740> how

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.090 
that this is perfect for any sort of
party<00:04:40.880> you<00:04:41.630> can<00:04:41.780> see<00:04:41.960> how<00:04:42.320> it<00:04:42.500> has<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.710> little

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
party you can see how it has a little

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.830 
party you can see how it has a little
bit<00:04:43.190> of<00:04:43.310> a<00:04:43.430> higher<00:04:43.669> neckline<00:04:44.000> and<00:04:44.419> you<00:04:44.690> can

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
bit of a higher neckline and you can

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.780 
bit of a higher neckline and you can
also<00:04:44.960> see<00:04:45.260> here<00:04:45.530> how<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:45.770> has<00:04:46.160> three-quarter

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
also see here how it has three-quarter

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.909 
also see here how it has three-quarter
sleeves<00:04:47.180> and<00:04:47.510> I<00:04:47.900> think<00:04:48.139> that<00:04:48.260> adds<00:04:48.410> a<00:04:48.560> really

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
sleeves and I think that adds a really

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.620 
sleeves and I think that adds a really
classy<00:04:49.430> look<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.790> makes<00:04:49.970> it<00:04:50.150> perfect<00:04:50.540> to

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
classy look that makes it perfect to

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.210 
classy look that makes it perfect to
wear<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.840> a<00:04:50.900> family<00:04:51.350> party<00:04:51.620> or<00:04:51.889> maybe<00:04:52.130> even

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
wear to a family party or maybe even

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.430 
wear to a family party or maybe even
church<00:04:52.669> functions<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:53.510> I<00:04:53.720> think<00:04:54.139> that's

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
church functions so I think that's

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.920 
church functions so I think that's
really<00:04:55.010> really<00:04:55.220> great<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.729> really<00:04:55.850> key<00:04:56.389> to

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
really really great and really key to

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.950 
really really great and really key to
this<00:04:57.080> dress<00:04:57.350> is<00:04:57.500> that<00:04:57.530> it<00:04:57.710> has<00:04:57.950> such<00:04:58.460> a<00:04:58.960> modest

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
this dress is that it has such a modest

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.659 
this dress is that it has such a modest
look<00:05:00.139> to<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.500> but<00:05:00.680> you're<00:05:01.130> gonna<00:05:01.250> see<00:05:01.490> in<00:05:01.580> a

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
look to it but you're gonna see in a

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.129 
look to it but you're gonna see in a
second<00:05:01.970> that's<00:05:02.090> also<00:05:02.389> a<00:05:02.450> little<00:05:02.720> bit<00:05:02.810> shorter

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
second that's also a little bit shorter

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.719 
second that's also a little bit shorter
but<00:05:03.229> I<00:05:03.320> think<00:05:03.530> that<00:05:03.650> it<00:05:03.770> really<00:05:03.979> is<00:05:04.130> okay<00:05:04.580> and

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
but I think that it really is okay and

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.190 
but I think that it really is okay and
you<00:05:04.790> can<00:05:04.970> really<00:05:05.240> pull<00:05:05.419> it<00:05:05.540> off<00:05:05.630> because<00:05:05.870> of

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
you can really pull it off because of

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.020 
you can really pull it off because of
the<00:05:06.290> modesty<00:05:06.680> of<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:07.010> top<00:05:07.280> half<00:05:07.490> of<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.790> dress

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
the modesty of the top half of the dress

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.110 
the modesty of the top half of the dress
and<00:05:08.210> it's<00:05:08.780> not<00:05:08.960> like<00:05:09.139> it<00:05:09.290> is<00:05:09.440> that<00:05:09.880> short<00:05:10.880> of<00:05:11.000> a

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
and it's not like it is that short of a

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.390 
and it's not like it is that short of a
dress<00:05:11.360> it<00:05:11.570> just<00:05:11.740> hits<00:05:12.740> me<00:05:12.830> above<00:05:13.190> my<00:05:13.340> knee

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.430 
dress it just hits me above my knee
which<00:05:13.729> classifies<00:05:14.630> it<00:05:14.810> as<00:05:14.930> shorter

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440
