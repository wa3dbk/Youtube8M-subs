00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so what we're first going to do is we're

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.160 
so what we're first going to do is we're
going<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.719> try<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.989> out<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:46.350> 50%<00:00:47.100> then<00:00:47.940> 75%<00:00:48.870> then

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
going to try it out at 50% then 75% then

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.590 
going to try it out at 50% then 75% then
100%<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.460> guys<00:00:50.700> can<00:00:50.850> have<00:00:51.030> an<00:00:51.120> idea<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> how

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
100% so you guys can have an idea of how

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.209 
100% so you guys can have an idea of how
much<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.930> leaves<00:00:52.110> at<00:00:52.289> those<00:00:52.500> different<00:00:52.860> points

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
much it leaves at those different points

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.770 
much it leaves at those different points
alright<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.300> let's<00:00:54.480> get<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:55.020> started<00:00:55.050> so<00:00:56.780> here

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
alright so let's get it started so here

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.030 
alright so let's get it started so here
it<00:00:57.870> is<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.230> 50%

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.120 

now<00:01:06.820> there's<00:01:07.150> some<00:01:07.360> little<00:01:07.810> decent<00:01:08.560> leakage

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
now there's some little decent leakage

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.540 
now there's some little decent leakage
not<00:01:10.120> too<00:01:10.330> bad<00:01:10.860> nobody<00:01:11.860> next<00:01:12.160> year<00:01:12.370> would<00:01:12.490> be

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
not too bad nobody next year would be

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.300 
not too bad nobody next year would be
really<00:01:12.970> bother<00:01:13.150> at<00:01:13.420> this<00:01:13.600> point<00:01:13.870> um<00:01:14.310> but

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
really bother at this point um but

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.710 
really bother at this point um but
someone<00:01:15.580> next<00:01:15.790> you<00:01:15.970> will<00:01:16.180> hear<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.480> you're

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
someone next you will hear that you're

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.630 
someone next you will hear that you're
listening<00:01:16.870> to<00:01:17.200> music<00:01:17.530> I<00:01:17.680> can<00:01:18.160> hear<00:01:18.340> what<00:01:18.490> song

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
listening to music I can hear what song

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.220 
listening to music I can hear what song
is<00:01:18.850> um<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:21.250> not<00:01:21.370> too<00:01:21.580> bad<00:01:21.790> but<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.660> does<00:01:22.840> leak

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
is um it's not too bad but it does leak

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.830 
is um it's not too bad but it does leak
a<00:01:23.260> bit<00:01:23.350> at<00:01:23.560> 50%<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:25.210> now<00:01:25.300> let's<00:01:25.510> try<00:01:25.570> it<00:01:25.660> out<00:01:25.780> a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
a bit at 50% so now let's try it out a

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:39.360 
a bit at 50% so now let's try it out a
75%<00:01:29.760> is<00:01:30.760> that<00:01:30.910> 75<00:01:37.320> now<00:01:38.320> I<00:01:38.350> hit<00:01:38.860> this<00:01:39.040> pretty

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
75% is that 75 now I hit this pretty

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.520 
75% is that 75 now I hit this pretty
clearly<00:01:39.670> I'm<00:01:40.660> not<00:01:40.960> sure<00:01:41.080> if<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.320> guys<00:01:41.470> can

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
clearly I'm not sure if you guys can

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.950 
clearly I'm not sure if you guys can
pick<00:01:41.830> it<00:01:41.950> up<00:01:42.100> but<00:01:43.000> there's<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.300> decent<00:01:43.690> amount

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
pick it up but there's a decent amount

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.969 
pick it up but there's a decent amount
leakage<00:01:44.620> that<00:01:44.770> 75%<00:01:46.530> yeah

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
leakage that 75% yeah

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.610 
leakage that 75% yeah
so<00:01:48.250> I<00:01:48.580> say<00:01:49.030> 5%<00:01:49.270> there's<00:01:49.900> some<00:01:50.140> good<00:01:50.320> leakage

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
so I say 5% there's some good leakage

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.250 
so I say 5% there's some good leakage
there<00:01:51.060> all<00:01:52.060> right<00:01:52.240> it's<00:01:52.510> kind<00:01:52.720> of<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.870> hundred

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
there all right it's kind of a hundred

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.100 
there all right it's kind of a hundred
percent<00:01:53.350> ready<00:01:54.190> yep<00:01:54.820> once<00:01:55.720> you've<00:01:55.840> done<00:01:55.960> the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
percent ready yep once you've done the

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.310 
percent ready yep once you've done the
studios<00:01:56.440> you<00:01:56.560> can<00:01:56.710> do<00:01:56.830> anything<00:01:57.479> okay<00:01:58.479> all

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
studios you can do anything okay all

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.100 
studios you can do anything okay all
right<00:01:59.560> so<00:01:59.740> here<00:01:59.890> goes<00:02:03.690> it's<00:02:04.690> pretty<00:02:04.720> clear

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
right so here goes it's pretty clear

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.460 
right so here goes it's pretty clear
it's<00:02:06.040> not<00:02:06.220> as<00:02:06.369> bad<00:02:06.490> as<00:02:06.640> the<00:02:06.700> studios<00:02:07.119> but<00:02:07.510> it's

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
it's not as bad as the studios but it's

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.900 
it's not as bad as the studios but it's
very<00:02:08.649> clear<00:02:09.010> this<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.220> not<00:02:09.369> even<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.640> lot<00:02:09.790> of

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
very clear this is not even a lot of

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.360 
very clear this is not even a lot of
point<00:02:10.149> in<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.480> song<00:02:11.010> let's<00:02:12.010> see<00:02:12.190> out<00:02:12.340> of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
point in the song let's see out of

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.390 
point in the song let's see out of
chorus<00:02:13.830> yeah

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
chorus yeah

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.940 
chorus yeah
these<00:02:15.940> are<00:02:16.060> pretty<00:02:16.300> well<00:02:16.810> as<00:02:17.080> if<00:02:17.320> you<00:02:17.530> expect

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
these are pretty well as if you expect

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.199 
these are pretty well as if you expect
that<00:02:18.010> at<00:02:18.220> a<00:02:18.250> hundred<00:02:18.430> percent<00:02:18.610> is<00:02:18.970> going<00:02:19.120> to

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
that at a hundred percent is going to

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.050 
that at a hundred percent is going to
leak<00:02:19.360> really<00:02:19.660> badly<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.980> we've<00:02:21.670> heard<00:02:21.820> worse

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
leak really badly but we've heard worse

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.680 
leak really badly but we've heard worse
so<00:02:22.900> I<00:02:23.230> understand<00:02:24.010> doubly<00:02:24.310> good<00:02:24.580> enough<00:02:27.690> all

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
so I understand doubly good enough all

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.540 
so I understand doubly good enough all
right<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:29.200> now<00:02:29.410> we're<00:02:29.650> gonna<00:02:29.769> start<00:02:29.890> the

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
right so now we're gonna start the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.300

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
we're going to be trying now to see how

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.620 
we're going to be trying now to see how
much<00:02:35.620> I<00:02:35.860> can<00:02:36.010> isolate<00:02:36.330> sounds<00:02:37.330> from<00:02:37.480> the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
much I can isolate sounds from the

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.990 
much I can isolate sounds from the
outside<00:02:38.080> using<00:02:38.410> these<00:02:38.620> headphones<00:02:38.920> just<00:02:39.880> so

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
outside using these headphones just so

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.910 
outside using these headphones just so
we<00:02:40.090> can<00:02:40.180> have<00:02:40.330> how<00:02:40.840> much<00:02:40.989> we<00:02:41.170> can<00:02:41.320> focus<00:02:41.530> on<00:02:41.800> the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
we can have how much we can focus on the

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.910 
we can have how much we can focus on the
music<00:02:42.040> itself<00:02:42.580> and<00:02:42.880> not<00:02:43.150> what's<00:02:43.450> around<00:02:43.660> us<00:02:43.930> so

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
music itself and not what's around us so

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.500 
music itself and not what's around us so
the<00:02:45.160> girlfriend<00:02:45.519> test<00:02:45.700> we'll<00:02:45.850> see<00:02:46.000> what<00:02:46.239> she

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
the girlfriend test we'll see what she

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.080 
the girlfriend test we'll see what she
has<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.810> say<00:02:46.840> or<00:02:47.080> do<00:02:47.530> and<00:02:47.830> see<00:02:48.670> if<00:02:48.730> I<00:02:48.790> can<00:02:48.970> block

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
has to say or do and see if I can block

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.540 
has to say or do and see if I can block
it<00:02:49.150> out<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:51.010> course<00:02:51.220> we're<00:02:51.370> going<00:02:51.459> to

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
it out and of course we're going to

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.100 
it out and of course we're going to
start<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.820> at<00:02:51.940> 50%<00:02:52.239> 75%<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.769> 100%<00:02:54.630> so<00:02:55.630> for<00:02:55.989> now

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
start it at 50% 75% and 100% so for now

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.520 
start it at 50% 75% and 100% so for now
let's<00:02:56.140> see<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:56.880> 50%<00:02:57.880> are<00:02:58.209> you<00:02:58.360> ready<00:02:58.540> yes<00:02:59.050> are

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
let's see that 50% are you ready yes are

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:08.119 
let's see that 50% are you ready yes are
you<00:03:00.459> ready<00:03:00.489> I<00:03:01.230> hopefully<00:03:02.230> I<00:03:02.560> am

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.589 

all<00:03:09.129> right<00:03:09.519> Oh<00:03:09.730> God

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
all right Oh God

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.350 
all right Oh God
what<00:03:11.019> so<00:03:11.260> it<00:03:11.440> works<00:03:11.920> let's<00:03:12.700> see<00:03:12.879> if<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.090> remember

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
what so it works let's see if I remember

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.899 
what so it works let's see if I remember
some<00:03:13.540> tunes<00:03:13.840> from<00:03:14.080> like<00:03:14.349> six<00:03:14.980> years<00:03:15.040> ago<00:03:15.280> you

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
some tunes from like six years ago you

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.830 
some tunes from like six years ago you
to<00:03:16.150> brace<00:03:16.450> yourself<00:03:18.330> all<00:03:19.330> right<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:19.720> we

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
to brace yourself all right so we

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:31.640 
to brace yourself all right so we
started<00:03:20.110> off<00:03:20.200> at<00:03:20.349> 50%<00:03:20.680> and<00:03:21.159> here<00:03:22.030> we<00:03:22.150> go<00:03:30.510> yeah

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
started off at 50% and here we go yeah

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.809 
started off at 50% and here we go yeah
so<00:03:32.650> I<00:03:32.680> can<00:03:32.890> clearly<00:03:33.159> hear<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:33.730> clearly<00:03:35.819> maybe

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
so I can clearly hear that clearly maybe

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.100 
so I can clearly hear that clearly maybe
it's<00:03:37.060> because<00:03:37.150> we're<00:03:37.329> really<00:03:37.480> close<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:37.810> me

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
it's because we're really close to me

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.490 
it's because we're really close to me
but<00:03:38.410> um<00:03:38.739> I<00:03:39.450> really<00:03:40.450> heard<00:03:40.540> that<00:03:40.750> really<00:03:41.260> well

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
but um I really heard that really well

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.580 
but um I really heard that really well
so<00:03:42.069> I<00:03:42.519> mean<00:03:43.019> and<00:03:44.019> it<00:03:44.200> sounded<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.530> little

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
so I mean and it sounded a little

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.979 
so I mean and it sounded a little
muffled<00:03:45.069> but<00:03:45.640> at<00:03:45.819> 50%<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.510> was<00:03:46.660> not<00:03:46.840> quite

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989 
muffled but at 50% it was not quite

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.210 
muffled but at 50% it was not quite
enough<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.349> block<00:03:47.920> out<00:03:48.190> this<00:03:48.849> thing<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:50.230> we'll

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
enough to block out this thing so we'll

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.369 
enough to block out this thing so we'll
try<00:03:51.400> that<00:03:51.579> 75%<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.480> see<00:03:52.569> if<00:03:52.840> we<00:03:52.989> can<00:03:53.109> get<00:03:53.260> the

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
try that 75% and see if we can get the

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.080 
try that 75% and see if we can get the
job<00:03:53.409> done

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:09.820 

all<00:03:58.090> right<00:03:58.450> you<00:03:58.810> ready<00:03:58.989> yes

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.380 

ah<00:04:09.860> it's<00:04:10.640> not<00:04:10.790> bad<00:04:12.190> at<00:04:13.190> 75%<00:04:13.730> I<00:04:14.180> was

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
ah it's not bad at 75% I was

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.770 
ah it's not bad at 75% I was
surprisingly<00:04:14.720> able<00:04:15.230> to<00:04:15.880> block<00:04:16.880> out<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.120> pretty

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
surprisingly able to block out a pretty

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.120 
surprisingly able to block out a pretty
good<00:04:18.019> amount<00:04:18.200> of<00:04:18.350> that<00:04:18.410> I<00:04:18.560> heard<00:04:18.860> a<00:04:18.980> little

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
good amount of that I heard a little

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.340 
good amount of that I heard a little
slightly<00:04:19.790> but<00:04:20.060> I<00:04:20.330> think<00:04:20.989> these<00:04:21.080> will<00:04:21.230> do<00:04:21.320> a

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
slightly but I think these will do a

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.290 
slightly but I think these will do a
good<00:04:21.590> job<00:04:21.650> blocking<00:04:22.010> out<00:04:22.340> most<00:04:22.790> sounds<00:04:23.210> from

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
good job blocking out most sounds from

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.790 
good job blocking out most sounds from
the<00:04:23.420> outside<00:04:23.720> this<00:04:23.870> is<00:04:23.930> really<00:04:24.320> loving<00:04:24.710> and

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
the outside this is really loving and

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.220 
the outside this is really loving and
close<00:04:25.040> to<00:04:25.220> me<00:04:25.340> so<00:04:26.000> I'm<00:04:26.360> assuming<00:04:26.630> that<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.990> tell

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
close to me so I'm assuming that I tell

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.780 
close to me so I'm assuming that I tell
you<00:04:27.290> part<00:04:27.500> percent<00:04:27.950> you<00:04:28.040> won't<00:04:28.250> hear<00:04:28.400> much<00:04:28.640> on

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
you part percent you won't hear much on

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.670 
you part percent you won't hear much on
the<00:04:28.910> outside<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.930> will<00:04:29.990> do<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.140> really<00:04:30.410> good<00:04:30.530> job

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
the outside it will do a really good job

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.430 
the outside it will do a really good job
isolating<00:04:30.860> at<00:04:31.400> 75%<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.600> maybe<00:04:32.900> even<00:04:33.230> a<00:04:33.290> little

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
isolating at 75% and maybe even a little

isolating at 75% and maybe even a little
lower<00:04:33.710> than<00:04:33.920> that<00:04:34.010> so<00:04:34.910> let's<00:04:35.300> try<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.750> out<00:04:35.840> a

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
lower than that so let's try it out a

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.970 
lower than that so let's try it out a

too<00:05:01.310> much<00:05:01.550> I<00:05:02.480> don't<00:05:02.720> know<00:05:02.780> what<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.050> got<00:05:03.230> to

dig<00:05:03.560> up<00:05:03.710> on<00:05:03.920> me<00:05:04.130> these<00:05:05.030> did<00:05:05.210> a<00:05:05.240> perfect<00:05:05.450> job<00:05:05.600> at

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
dig up on me these did a perfect job at

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.110 
dig up on me these did a perfect job at
completely<00:05:06.410> isolating<00:05:06.890> all<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:07.790> noise<00:05:08.000> from

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
completely isolating all the noise from

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.590 
completely isolating all the noise from
100<00:05:08.810> percent<00:05:08.900> so<00:05:09.860> it's<00:05:10.640> a<00:05:10.820> really<00:05:11.090> good<00:05:11.240> job<00:05:11.300> I

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
100 percent so it's a really good job I

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.480 
100 percent so it's a really good job I
think<00:05:11.810> that<00:05:11.960> these<00:05:12.140> will<00:05:12.470> do<00:05:12.740> a<00:05:12.770> great<00:05:13.280> job

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
think that these will do a great job

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.880 
think that these will do a great job
isolating<00:05:13.730> sounds<00:05:14.570> like<00:05:15.410> I<00:05:15.500> said<00:05:15.680> this<00:05:15.770> is

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
isolating sounds like I said this is

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.860 
isolating sounds like I said this is
particularly<00:05:16.220> loud<00:05:16.550> and<00:05:16.910> very<00:05:17.240> close<00:05:17.570> to<00:05:17.720> me

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
particularly loud and very close to me

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.530 
particularly loud and very close to me
and<00:05:18.050> I<00:05:18.680> still<00:05:19.250> struggle<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:19.940> hear<00:05:20.210> it

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
and I still struggle to hear it

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.180 
and I still struggle to hear it
so<00:05:20.810> I<00:05:20.840> think<00:05:20.960> these<00:05:21.200> do<00:05:21.350> a<00:05:21.380> really<00:05:21.620> good<00:05:21.740> job<00:05:21.800> at

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
so I think these do a really good job at

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.950 
so I think these do a really good job at
keeping<00:05:22.220> noise<00:05:22.669> on<00:05:23.000> the<00:05:23.120> outside<00:05:23.450> out<00:05:23.690> and

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
keeping noise on the outside out and

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.659 
keeping noise on the outside out and
you'll<00:05:24.230> will<00:05:24.440> be<00:05:24.590> able<00:05:24.740> to<00:05:24.890> focus<00:05:25.160> on<00:05:25.280> your

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
you'll will be able to focus on your

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.420 
you'll will be able to focus on your
music<00:05:25.790> so<00:05:26.660> good<00:05:27.080> job<00:05:27.260> on<00:05:27.320> the<00:05:27.710> sound<00:05:27.980> isolation

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
music so good job on the sound isolation

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.480 
music so good job on the sound isolation
and<00:05:28.910> the<00:05:29.090> girlfriend<00:05:29.480> test<00:05:29.690> it<00:05:29.840> has<00:05:29.990> passed

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
and the girlfriend test it has passed

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.760 
and the girlfriend test it has passed
but<00:05:31.490> for<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:32.000> sound<00:05:32.240> leakage<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:33.320> did<00:05:33.500> leak<00:05:33.680> a

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
but for the sound leakage it did leak a

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.770 
but for the sound leakage it did leak a
little<00:05:33.919> bit<00:05:34.190> wasn't<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.060> worst<00:05:35.240> we've<00:05:35.419> heard

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
little bit wasn't the worst we've heard

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.350 
little bit wasn't the worst we've heard
but<00:05:36.200> it<00:05:36.650> did<00:05:36.860> leak<00:05:37.010> uh<00:05:37.130> slightly<00:05:37.850> so<00:05:38.060> high

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
but it did leak uh slightly so high

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.570 
but it did leak uh slightly so high
volumes<00:05:38.840> the<00:05:39.290> person<00:05:39.560> next<00:05:39.710> to<00:05:39.830> you<00:05:39.919> or<00:05:40.190> around

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
volumes the person next to you or around

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.330 
volumes the person next to you or around
you<00:05:40.820> probably<00:05:41.330> will<00:05:41.540> hear<00:05:41.750> it<00:05:41.870> but<00:05:42.410> most<00:05:42.800> more

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 
you probably will hear it but most more

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.310 
you probably will hear it but most more
times<00:05:43.580> than<00:05:43.760> that<00:05:43.940> they<00:05:44.630> probably<00:05:44.960> won't<00:05:45.380> so

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
times than that they probably won't so

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.020 
times than that they probably won't so
alright<00:05:48.320> I<00:05:48.380> think<00:05:48.680> that<00:05:48.830> rat<00:05:49.100> who<00:05:49.490> is<00:05:49.550> it<00:05:49.790> and

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
alright I think that rat who is it and

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:55.659 
alright I think that rat who is it and
finally<00:05:50.960> we<00:05:51.230> can<00:05:51.430> put<00:05:52.430> this<00:05:54.490> alright<00:05:55.490> there

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669
