hunter<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:16.650> actually<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.310> ground<00:00:17.910> unit<00:00:18.150> hover

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
hunter is actually a ground unit hover

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.540 
hunter is actually a ground unit hover
unit<00:00:18.900> he<00:00:19.350> starts<00:00:19.680> out<00:00:19.830> actually<00:00:20.160> firing<00:00:20.369> a

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
unit he starts out actually firing a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.150 
unit he starts out actually firing a
single<00:00:20.760> beam<00:00:21.090> weapon<00:00:21.750> I'm<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> little<00:00:22.650> weak<00:00:22.859> at

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
single beam weapon I'm a little weak at

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.950 
single beam weapon I'm a little weak at
the<00:00:23.519> beginning<00:00:23.850> but<00:00:23.939> he<00:00:24.029> levels<00:00:24.359> up<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.779> gets

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
the beginning but he levels up and gets

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.509 
the beginning but he levels up and gets
two<00:00:25.170> beams<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.650> does<00:00:25.830> more<00:00:26.039> damage<00:00:26.070> over<00:00:26.490> time

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
two beams and does more damage over time

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.279 
two beams and does more damage over time
so<00:00:26.849> he's<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.029> unit<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.570> generally<00:00:28.109> want

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
so he's a unit that you generally want

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.490 
so he's a unit that you generally want
to<00:00:28.439> add<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.949> a<00:00:29.220> mixed<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.269> mixed<00:00:30.840> bunch<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.199> units

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
to add to a mixed a mixed bunch of units

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.580 
to add to a mixed a mixed bunch of units
and<00:00:31.710> then<00:00:31.830> as<00:00:32.730> as<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.390> play<00:00:33.630> play<00:00:34.260> through<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
and then as as you play play through the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.720 
and then as as you play play through the
game<00:00:34.620> they<00:00:34.950> level<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.430> become<00:00:35.700> more

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
game they level up and become more

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.700 
game they level up and become more
powerful<00:00:36.000> how<00:00:36.840> does<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> leveling<00:00:37.380> up<00:00:37.530> work

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
powerful how does the leveling up work

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.500 
powerful how does the leveling up work
well<00:00:38.219> actually<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.820> based<00:00:39.300> off<00:00:39.450> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
well actually it's just based off of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.299 
well actually it's just based off of
kills<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.350> it's<00:00:40.649> simple<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.160> not

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
kills and it's it's simple it's not

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.100 
kills and it's it's simple it's not
something<00:00:41.820> similar<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:42.480> you've<00:00:42.750> seen<00:00:42.960> in

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
something similar to what you've seen in

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.720 
something similar to what you've seen in
Warcraft<00:00:43.800> 3<00:00:43.829> or<00:00:44.070> anything<00:00:44.340> like<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.489> it's

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
Warcraft 3 or anything like that it's

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.910 
Warcraft 3 or anything like that it's
specific<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.329> unit<00:00:45.600> he<00:00:45.989> kills<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.379> couple<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
specific to the unit he kills a couple a

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.130 
specific to the unit he kills a couple a
couple<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.700> enemy<00:00:48.059> units<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.510> then<00:00:48.629> he<00:00:48.870> just

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
couple of enemy units and then he just

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.260 
couple of enemy units and then he just
does<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.410> one-step<00:00:50.100> level<00:00:50.489> he<00:00:50.640> gets<00:00:50.820> two<00:00:51.059> beams

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
does a one-step level he gets two beams

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.420 
does a one-step level he gets two beams
at<00:00:51.480> that<00:00:51.629> point<00:00:51.870> causing<00:00:52.680> additional<00:00:52.920> damage

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
at that point causing additional damage

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.240 
at that point causing additional damage
the<00:00:53.699> phase<00:00:53.910> cannon<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.050> new<00:00:55.590> Protoss

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
the phase cannon is the new Protoss

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.250 
the phase cannon is the new Protoss
defensive<00:00:56.969> weapon<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.840> interesting

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
defensive weapon and the interesting

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.779 
defensive weapon and the interesting
thing<00:00:58.289> about<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.800> phase<00:00:58.980> cannon<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.670> you

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
thing about the phase cannon is that you

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.880 
thing about the phase cannon is that you
can<00:00:59.910> take<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.270> if<00:01:00.660> you<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.289> blocking

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
can take it if you have it's a blocking

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.039 
can take it if you have it's a blocking
off<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.250> front<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.730> your<00:01:02.850> base<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.420> then<00:01:03.960> you

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
off the front of your base and then you

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.390 
off the front of your base and then you
get<00:01:04.229> attacked<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.860> rear<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.100> your<00:01:05.189> base

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
get attacked in the rear of your base

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.010 
get attacked in the rear of your base
like<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> shuttle<00:01:06.210> drop<00:01:06.450> or<00:01:06.630> something<00:01:06.930> like

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
like a shuttle drop or something like

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.690 
like a shuttle drop or something like
that<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.799> can<00:01:07.979> actually<00:01:08.250> move<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.430> phase

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
that you can actually move the phase

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.429 
that you can actually move the phase
cannons<00:01:09.090> back<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> rear<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.750> your<00:01:09.900> base<00:01:10.170> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
cannons back to the rear of your base to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.560 
cannons back to the rear of your base to
protect<00:01:10.560> against<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> gimmicks

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
protect against it one of the gimmicks

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.960 
protect against it one of the gimmicks
with<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.930> though<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.159> happen<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.490> be

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
with it though is if if you happen to be

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.730 
with it though is if if you happen to be
outside<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.509> pi<00:01:15.630> line<00:01:15.810> power<00:01:15.990> there's<00:01:16.560> no

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
outside of pi line power there's no

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.560 
outside of pi line power there's no
actual<00:01:17.189> shield<00:01:17.460> on<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.270> you're

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
actual shield on it and if you're

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.700 
actual shield on it and if you're
outside<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.960> pile<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.200> power<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.530> can't

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
outside of pile and power you can't

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
outside of pile and power you can't
change<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.070> back<00:01:20.250> into<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.700> facecam<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.479> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
change it back into a facecam and so it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
change it back into a facecam and so it
can't<00:01:21.780> attack<00:01:22.110> back<00:01:22.590> and<00:01:22.830> basically<00:01:23.130> they're

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
can't attack back and basically they're

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.830 
can't attack back and basically they're
helpless<00:01:23.610> what<00:01:24.060> we're<00:01:24.210> seeing<00:01:24.390> in<00:01:24.600> games

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
helpless what we're seeing in games

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.179 
helpless what we're seeing in games
internally<00:01:25.439> right<00:01:25.619> now<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.040> they're

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
internally right now is that they're

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.710 
internally right now is that they're
using<00:01:26.430> them<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.580> actually<00:01:27.030> push<00:01:27.270> forward<00:01:27.630> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
using them to actually push forward and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.719 
using them to actually push forward and
leapfrog<00:01:27.960> into<00:01:28.470> basis<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.430> put<00:01:29.579> down<00:01:29.670> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
leapfrog into basis so you put down a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
leapfrog into basis so you put down a
pylon<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:31.439> put<00:01:31.710> down<00:01:31.860> some<00:01:32.040> phase

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
pylon and then put down some phase

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.649 
pylon and then put down some phase
cannons<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:32.790> start<00:01:33.030> moving<00:01:33.180> them<00:01:33.450> forward

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
cannons and start moving them forward

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.660

replacement<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.290> game<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.770> little

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
replacement in the game it's a little

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.030 
replacement in the game it's a little
weaker<00:01:41.280> than<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> original<00:01:42.509> carrier<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.649> the

weaker than the original carrier in the
original<00:01:44.159> game<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.420> costs<00:01:45.750> less

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
original game and it costs less

resources<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> little<00:01:47.280> bit<00:01:47.399> weaker<00:01:47.700> but<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
resources is a little bit weaker but it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.120 
resources is a little bit weaker but it
has<00:01:48.119> an<00:01:48.299> actual<00:01:48.780> underbelly<00:01:49.200> shield<00:01:49.619> and

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729

enough to create a twilight Archon so
they're<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.870> little<00:02:23.020> bit<00:02:23.230> more<00:02:23.350> accessible

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
they're a little bit more accessible

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.140 
they're a little bit more accessible
they're<00:02:24.160> powerful<00:02:24.400> units<00:02:24.790> they<00:02:24.910> don't<00:02:25.060> have

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
they're powerful units they don't have

they're powerful units they don't have
any<00:02:25.300> specific<00:02:26.230> abilities<00:02:26.440> other<00:02:26.920> than

they're they're very powerful ground
attacks<00:02:29.920> we<00:02:30.250> are<00:02:30.370> taking<00:02:30.670> pretty<00:02:31.060> much

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
attacks we are taking pretty much

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.530 
attacks we are taking pretty much
picking<00:02:31.630> up<00:02:31.780> from<00:02:31.960> where<00:02:32.050> broodwar<00:02:32.950> left<00:02:33.190> off

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
picking up from where broodwar left off

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.210 
picking up from where broodwar left off
so<00:02:34.540> you<00:02:35.260> will<00:02:35.410> see<00:02:35.470> some<00:02:35.830> returning

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
so you will see some returning

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.590 
so you will see some returning
characters<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.820> really<00:02:37.030> can't<00:02:37.210> go<00:02:37.360> into<00:02:37.390> any
