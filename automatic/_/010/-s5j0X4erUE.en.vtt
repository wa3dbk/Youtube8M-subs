back of the motor when you do that you

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.090 
back of the motor when you do that you
would<00:01:27.630> then<00:01:27.750> lower<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.500> jack<00:01:28.680> down<00:01:28.740> which

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
would then lower the jack down which

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.749 
would then lower the jack down which
will<00:01:29.220> allow<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.520> motor<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.299> drop<00:01:30.540> down

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
will allow the motor to drop down

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.740 
will allow the motor to drop down
approximately<00:01:32.759> four<00:01:33.540> inches<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.439> see

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
there are also two drain plugs that go

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.370 
there are also two drain plugs that go

into the cylinder head left and right if
you<00:03:12.560> wish<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:16.160> water<00:03:16.670> pump<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.030> inaccessible

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
you wish the water pump is inaccessible

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.400 
you wish the water pump is inaccessible
and<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.319> has<00:03:19.209> Torx<00:03:20.209> bolts<00:03:20.510> on<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.049> perimeter

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
and it has Torx bolts on the perimeter

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.349 
and it has Torx bolts on the perimeter
of<00:03:21.440> the<00:03:21.530> water<00:03:21.680> pump<00:03:21.859> you<00:03:22.790> remove<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.209> water

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
of the water pump you remove the water

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:31.449 
of the water pump you remove the water
pump<00:03:23.660> replace<00:03:23.959> with<00:03:24.170> a<00:03:24.200> new<00:03:24.230> one<00:03:24.410> I<00:03:24.920> use

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.160 

so<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:32.909> realized<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.629> spark<00:03:33.900> plugs

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
so that I realized that the spark plugs

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.920 
so that I realized that the spark plugs
were<00:03:34.349> accessible<00:03:36.950> they<00:03:37.950> are<00:03:38.840> when<00:03:39.840> the

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
were accessible they are when the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.140 
were accessible they are when the
exhaust<00:03:40.170> is<00:03:40.319> out<00:03:40.469> there<00:03:41.010> under<00:03:41.370> this<00:03:41.519> plate<00:03:41.879> so

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
exhaust is out there under this plate so

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.720 
exhaust is out there under this plate so
you<00:03:43.019> take<00:03:43.290> this<00:03:43.469> plate<00:03:43.769> off<00:03:43.980> with<00:03:44.280> two<00:03:44.489> 10

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
you take this plate off with two 10

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:57.610 
you take this plate off with two 10
millimeter<00:03:44.760> bolts

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.009 

unplug<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:58.650> wire<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.370> coil<00:03:59.719> by<00:04:00.719> sliding

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
unplug the wire to the coil by sliding

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.500 
unplug the wire to the coil by sliding
back<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.409> rubber<00:04:01.590> boot<00:04:01.859> and<00:04:02.519> then<00:04:03.090> take<00:04:03.359> the

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
back the rubber boot and then take the

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.020 
back the rubber boot and then take the
each<00:04:03.780> wire<00:04:04.200> off<00:04:04.469> then<00:04:05.219> take<00:04:05.489> out<00:04:05.669> the<00:04:05.790> allen

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
each wire off then take out the allen

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.879 
each wire off then take out the allen
key<00:04:06.150> bolts<00:04:06.480> and<00:04:06.689> then<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.930> pull<00:04:07.139> the<00:04:07.290> coil<00:04:07.620> off

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
key bolts and then you pull the coil off

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.369 
key bolts and then you pull the coil off
the<00:04:08.069> spark<00:04:08.310> plug<00:04:08.549> and<00:04:08.730> remove<00:04:09.569> all<00:04:09.870> spark

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
the spark plug and remove all spark

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:17.150 
the spark plug and remove all spark

zero<00:04:31.160> this<00:04:32.160> was<00:04:32.550> very<00:04:32.759> difficult<00:04:32.970> it's<00:04:33.360> not

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
zero this was very difficult it's not

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.420 
zero this was very difficult it's not
much<00:04:33.630> room<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.960> get<00:04:34.080> on<00:04:34.259> but<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:34.680> did<00:04:34.889> this<00:04:37.430> and

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
much room to get on but I did this and

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:55.189 
much room to get on but I did this and
on<00:04:38.729> the<00:04:52.009> right<00:04:53.009> here<00:04:53.310> this<00:04:54.240> bigger<00:04:54.900> hose

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
on the right here this bigger hose

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.620 
on the right here this bigger hose
because<00:04:55.710> the<00:04:56.009> thermostat<00:04:56.430> housing<00:04:56.550> it<00:04:56.940> has

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
because the thermostat housing it has

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.379 
because the thermostat housing it has
three<00:04:58.229> ten<00:04:58.470> millimeter<00:04:58.830> bolts<00:04:59.190> one<00:04:59.970> was<00:05:00.210> easy

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
three ten millimeter bolts one was easy

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.390 
three ten millimeter bolts one was easy
to<00:05:00.630> get<00:05:00.780> out<00:05:00.930> right<00:05:01.080> here<00:05:01.349> but<00:05:01.800> the<00:05:01.889> inner<00:05:02.070> two

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
to get out right here but the inner two

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.270 
to get out right here but the inner two
were<00:05:03.060> bit<00:05:03.270> difficult<00:05:04.050> I<00:05:04.229> had<00:05:04.470> to<00:05:04.590> use<00:05:04.800> some<00:05:04.830> a

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
were bit difficult I had to use some a

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.159 
were bit difficult I had to use some a
swivel<00:05:05.729> extension<00:05:06.240> as<00:05:06.750> well<00:05:06.810> as<00:05:07.020> the

universal joint to get to him the
thermostat<00:05:10.969> was<00:05:11.969> spring-loaded<00:05:14.449> here<00:05:15.449> it<00:05:15.509> is

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:16.759 
thermostat was spring-loaded here it is

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.300 
thermostat was spring-loaded here it is
spring-loaded<00:05:17.759> and<00:05:18.409> I<00:05:19.409> had<00:05:19.560> to<00:05:19.680> push<00:05:19.889> down<00:05:20.099> on

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310

reservoir in the back right here there's

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:37.730 
reservoir in the back right here there's
two<00:05:36.570> turbo<00:05:36.960> jerks

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
two turbo jerks

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:45.249 
two turbo jerks
here<00:05:39.380> and<00:05:40.380> here<00:05:43.190> and<00:05:44.190> also<00:05:44.669> the<00:05:44.789> crank<00:05:45.030> case

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:04.839 

you<00:05:59.310> then<00:06:00.530> unscrew<00:06:01.530> the<00:06:01.770> oil<00:06:01.979> filter<00:06:02.639> cap<00:06:03.000> and

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
you then unscrew the oil filter cap and

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:07.339 
you then unscrew the oil filter cap and
they<00:06:05.849> make<00:06:06.060> a<00:06:06.090> sucker<00:06:06.630> that<00:06:06.840> goes<00:06:06.960> over<00:06:07.139> by

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:07.349 
they make a sucker that goes over by

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:09.499
