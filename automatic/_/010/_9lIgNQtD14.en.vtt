00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
corner and blending it out I just put a

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.160 
corner and blending it out I just put a
little<00:01:46.730> bit<00:01:47.120> in<00:01:47.300> and<00:01:47.540> then<00:01:47.630> i'm<00:01:47.750> using<00:01:47.870> the

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
little bit in and then i'm using the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.170 
little bit in and then i'm using the
brush<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:48.680> spread<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.220> around<00:01:49.310> my<00:01:49.580> crease<00:01:49.880> just

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
so does it create too much of a deep

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.930 
so does it create too much of a deep
color<00:01:52.550> just<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.000> emphasize<00:01:53.270> on<00:01:53.780> my<00:01:53.900> crease
