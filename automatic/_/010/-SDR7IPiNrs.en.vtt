 Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.750
 Today I am making any-baked chocolate peanut butter from the delicate cookies. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 It's super fast to make and requires only 6 components. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.600
 For this recipe, you will need to: 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.090
 3 tablespoons light corn syrup 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.600
 3 tablespoons sugar granules 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.210
 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.620
 3 tablespoons chocolate chips 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.420
 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.420
 And 2/3 cups oats quick. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.200
 In a small sauce pan, add in corn syrup 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:59.200
 I'm using sorghum today. 00: 00: 56: 50 And sugar. 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.290
 On medium and high heat, cook until the sugar dissolves. 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.290
 When the mixture starts to boil, immediately remove the heat. 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.290
 Add the peanut butter and mix quickly until smooth. 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.620
 Then add in chocolate chips, vanilla extract. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.760
 And almost even fold combined. 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.760
 Add the oats quick and stir until well coated. 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.160
 Drop spoons of batter onto a baking paper and padded parchment paper. 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.000
 As you can see, today I do not make a lot of cookies. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
 And press down the cookies with the back of the spoon to make it flat. 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.710
 Then allow to cool completely. 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.000
 Voila, 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
 This is a very fast and easy no-baked chocolate peanut butter from delicate cookies. 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.200
 Bon appetite. 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.200
 Chocolate flavor in these files is stronger than salty peanut butter. 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.040
 The day was no-baked cakes and tomorrow it was espresso. 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.750

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.750
 thanks for watching. Bye for now!
