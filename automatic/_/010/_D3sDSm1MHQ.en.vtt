 tenant own apartment or house 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.560
 and every owner of a cropped DSLR 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.860
 dream of full frame 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.920
 nikon d600 a balm for the soul of everyone not to 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.920
 place 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.580
 weight 600 clad in a magnesium case 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.260
 alloy using some 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.030
 polycarbonate quantities are mostly on 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.800
 front panel rubber lining 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.200
 is in place for ergonomics 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.580
 battery grip no complaints 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.770
 Nikon speaks about quite good 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.150
 Dust moisture protection up to 600 it is incomparable with 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.950
 tank protection d4 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.660
 but with drizzling rain and for another 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.190
 the camera can not particularly worry about 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.710
 dimensions up to 600 are somewhere 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.960
 in the middle between the more compact d7000 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.970
 and older brother d800 all lunges 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.740
 Haters over the fact that up to 600 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.380
 the size has become a camera for housewives 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.810
 groundless body depth is the same as 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.430
 up to 800 and even slightly more than d700 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.100
 the remaining quantities are only a few 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.080
 millimeters less from this d600 lie 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.750
 in the hand did not become worse here 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.850
 such as steep as in 803 g of 2-inch 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.380
 display wide viewing angles on 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.509
 control wheels have protection against

 random scroll tractor cover 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.259
 for better grip with fingers and 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.330
 a clear move besides there are two obligatory 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.400
 additional modes for individual 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.259
 control settings and its 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.990
 customization is about the same as in 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.120
 d7000 on the fn key can be assigned to 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.550
 indecency a lot of things I leave to her 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.650
 change fix dx modes and one-touch 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.750
 I get one and a half times more focal 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.020

 cry 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:59.870
 without entering the menu or even tearing eyes 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.700
 from viewfinder 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.860
 work with autofocus rendered on

 front panel under the thumb many 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.979
 at first meeting can not 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.750
 figure out how to change automatic 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.390
 manual focus point selection 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.640
 we press the button we turn the wheels will 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.450

 From unpleasant to the button ok you can not 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.030
 set 100 percent increase 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.820
 pictures when viewing it promises 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.640
 fix in new firmware in d600 cut down 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.680
 sensor resolution from 36 to 24 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.390
 megapixels compared to d800 but 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.700
 call it low hardly anyone 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.650
 language will turn up add to up to 600 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.360
 good optics and you check from 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.430
 details and it concerns how 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.630
 base sensitivity and value 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.180
 iso 1600 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:45.260
 6,400 lost and the number of points 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:48.080
 focusing 39 vs 50 1 d800 of them 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.240
 only 9 cross vs 15 8 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.180
 weave everything would be nothing if this module 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.129
 focus did not get to 600 from 7000 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.900
 this led to the region of 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.939
 which point you can choose is 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.450
 strictly in the middle if you shoot 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:01.459
 portrait 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.799
 Do you want to visit the eye at the top? 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.900
 the point of the frame here such a number will not work 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.120
 overall speed and rate of fire 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.250
 deserve special attention with such 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.569
 d600 sensor resolution to shoot with 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.760
 five and a half frames per 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:15.859
 second and not shut up on the first 10 like 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.049
 this happens to the big brother d800 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.370
 the flaw that most angered 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.590
 public g600 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.900
 this is a minimum shutter speed of 4,000 to i 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.489
 against 1 8 1000 in all other 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.829
 adult cameras on the other hand 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.840
 calculate yourself how many frames for such 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.200
 values ​​you do for the year the problem 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.389
 there is 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.609
 but its significance is clearly exaggerated that 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:36.950
 Concerning video capabilities here at up to 600 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.239
 all chocolate full hd video up 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.790
 30 frames per second 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.159
 high bitrate manual settings are not 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.620
 compression output hdmi input for 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.299
 microphone and cheers cheers for headphones too 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.280
 and now i will brand you again 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.109
 nikon in the cell for 2 bucks 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.090
 there is still the same bug with 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.930
 the inability to set the aperture in 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.209
 live view 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.310
 How long do users ask you 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.139
 the whole world is rumored to be corrected in 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.090
 closest firmware if you need 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.069
 extreme speed accuracy and 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.169
 autofocus flexibility as well as typing 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.940
 billboards huge format then worth 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.069
 tighten the belt more tightly and still drink 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.560
 a bit on the d800 if you're not interested 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.780
 12-megapixel video clips 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.359
 enough then take almost nothing 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.280
 proven old man d700 but if you 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:21.079
 I want a modern fast full 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.880
 staffing SLR with great 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.500
 image quality promote ishime 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.650
 video capabilities from comparative 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.860
 compact body then nikon d600 your 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.860
 the choice
