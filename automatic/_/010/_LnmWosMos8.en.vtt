00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
doesn't fit I guess cause his is an 18

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.920 
doesn't fit I guess cause his is an 18
by<00:01:15.540> 18<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.409> base<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.920> like<00:01:17.130> 20<00:01:17.970> wide<00:01:18.119> by<00:01:18.420> 17
