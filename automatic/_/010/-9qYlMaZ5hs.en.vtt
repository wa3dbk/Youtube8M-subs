what<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.640> need<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:11.909> do<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.390> fat<00:01:12.570> out<00:01:12.600> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
what I need to do is get the fat out of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.690 
what I need to do is get the fat out of
my<00:01:12.900> diet<00:01:13.110> when<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:13.950> especially<00:01:14.340> if<00:01:14.610> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
my diet when really especially if the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.070 
my diet when really especially if the
triglycerides<00:01:15.210> are<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.450> issue<00:01:15.570> what's<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
triglycerides are the issue what's the

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.300 
triglycerides are the issue what's the
building<00:01:16.380> block<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> triglyceride

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
building block for a triglyceride

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.950 
building block for a triglyceride
I<00:01:17.490> mean<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.880> three<00:01:18.090> fatty<00:01:18.330> acids<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I mean it's three fatty acids and a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.230 
I mean it's three fatty acids and a
glycerol<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.530> sugar<00:01:19.770> so<00:01:20.490> obviously<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
glycerol of sugar so obviously as you

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.219 
glycerol of sugar so obviously as you
consume<00:01:21.630> more<00:01:21.659> sugar

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
consume more sugar

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.420 
consume more sugar
you're<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:22.950> driving<00:01:23.310> those

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you're going to be driving those

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.100 
you're going to be driving those
triglycerides<00:01:24.030> up<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.450> what<00:01:24.600> does<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.750> do

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
triglycerides up and what does that do

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.870 
triglycerides up and what does that do
that<00:01:25.380> ultimately<00:01:25.830> ends<00:01:26.159> up<00:01:26.250> leading<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.610> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
that ultimately ends up leading to the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.340 
that ultimately ends up leading to the
small<00:01:27.150> dense<00:01:27.390> LDL<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.810> we<00:01:28.049> were<00:01:28.170> just

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
small dense LDL that we were just

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.990 
small dense LDL that we were just
talking<00:01:28.439> about<00:01:28.770> earlier<00:01:29.250> with<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> marbles

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
talking about earlier with the marbles

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.660 
talking about earlier with the marbles
so<00:01:30.210> clearly<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.740> building<00:01:32.130> block<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.549> these

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
so clearly the building block for these

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.160 
so clearly the building block for these
triglycerides<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.630> this<00:01:33.810> really

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
triglycerides for this really

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.380 
triglycerides for this really
atherogenic<00:01:34.560> state<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.670> ultimately<00:01:36.090> leads

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
atherogenic state that ultimately leads

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.149 
atherogenic state that ultimately leads
to<00:01:36.509> insulin<00:01:36.930> resistance<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.950> whole

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
to insulin resistance and this whole

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.780 
to insulin resistance and this whole
cascade<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.729> events<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.740> produces

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
cascade of events that really produces

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.130 
cascade of events that really produces
the<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:42.060> atherogenic<00:01:42.420> state<00:01:42.899> that

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
the the atherogenic state that

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.600 
the the atherogenic state that
ultimately<00:01:43.590> leads<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.979> heart<00:01:44.220> attack<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
ultimately leads to heart attack and

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.819 
ultimately leads to heart attack and
stroke<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.390> built<00:01:45.720> in<00:01:45.960> part<00:01:45.990> by<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.530> sugar

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
stroke is is built in part by the sugar

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.100 
stroke is is built in part by the sugar
we<00:01:47.009> consume<00:01:47.520> obviously<00:01:48.479> there's<00:01:48.659> genetics

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
we consume obviously there's genetics

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.870 
we consume obviously there's genetics
that<00:01:49.320> play<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> role<00:01:49.619> here<00:01:49.799> but<00:01:50.250> certainly<00:01:50.610> our

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
that play a role here but certainly our

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.999 
that play a role here but certainly our
behaviors<00:01:51.869> our<00:01:52.020> lifestyles<00:01:52.649> certainly

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
behaviors our lifestyles certainly

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.950 
behaviors our lifestyles certainly
contribute<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.549> that<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.939> in<00:01:54.420> our<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.810> our

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
contribute to that and in our in our

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.530 
contribute to that and in our in our
practice<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.979> often<00:01:56.520> than<00:01:56.700> not<00:01:56.729> our<00:01:57.180> advice

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
practice more often than not our advice

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.359 
practice more often than not our advice
to<00:01:57.810> people<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.560> need<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.920> get<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.189> sugar

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
to people is you need to get the sugar

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.130 
to people is you need to get the sugar
out<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.670> your<00:01:59.790> diet<00:01:59.880> if<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.540> really<00:02:00.810> want<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
out of your diet if you really want to

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.840 
out of your diet if you really want to
reduce<00:02:01.409> your<00:02:01.469> risk<00:02:01.680> especially<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.729> want

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
reduce your risk especially if you want

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.090 
reduce your risk especially if you want
to<00:02:03.030> modify<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.990> dis<00:02:04.170> lipedema<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:04.890> see

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
to modify the dis lipedema that we see

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.709 
to modify the dis lipedema that we see
in<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.490> setting<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.909> high<00:02:06.060> triglycerides

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
in a setting of high triglycerides

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.790 
in a setting of high triglycerides
without<00:02:07.020> question<00:02:07.469> it<00:02:08.459> makes<00:02:08.640> sense<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.800> can't

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
without question it makes sense I can't

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.980 
without question it makes sense I can't
tell<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.160> how<00:02:11.370> hard

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:11.990

don't eliminate anything else if they

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.220 
don't eliminate anything else if they
just<00:03:14.090> get<00:03:14.210> the<00:03:14.330> sugar<00:03:14.510> out<00:03:14.660> of<00:03:14.780> the<00:03:14.930> fluids

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
they're drinking that's key because it's

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.520 
they're drinking that's key because it's
true<00:03:17.450> and<00:03:17.600> this<00:03:17.660> is<00:03:17.720> and<00:03:17.960> this<00:03:18.050> isn't<00:03:18.290> even<00:03:18.350> a

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
true and this is and this isn't even a

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.800 
true and this is and this isn't even a
big<00:03:18.710> gulp<00:03:18.950> if<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:19.880> go<00:03:20.000> to<00:03:20.060> Wisconsin<00:03:20.690> you<00:03:20.780> can

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
big gulp if you go to Wisconsin you can

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.770 
big gulp if you go to Wisconsin you can
get<00:03:21.020> a<00:03:21.050> big<00:03:21.290> gulp<00:03:21.530> that's<00:03:21.740> like<00:03:22.040> 64<00:03:22.790> ounces<00:03:23.300> I'm

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.960 
get a big gulp that's like 64 ounces I'm
sure<00:03:24.110> it's<00:03:24.260> a<00:03:24.380> lot<00:03:24.530> more<00:03:24.740> sugar<00:03:25.040> than<00:03:25.340> this<00:03:25.610> and

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
sure it's a lot more sugar than this and

sure it's a lot more sugar than this and
you<00:03:26.690> know<00:03:26.780> it's<00:03:27.110> it's<00:03:27.950> really<00:03:28.640> part<00:03:29.450> of<00:03:29.600> the

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
you know it's it's really part of the

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.470 
you know it's it's really part of the
problem<00:03:30.170> that<00:03:30.860> we<00:03:31.070> we<00:03:31.340> don't<00:03:31.520> understand<00:03:32.090> what
