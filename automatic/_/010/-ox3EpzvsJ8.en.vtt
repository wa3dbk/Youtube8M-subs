we can toggle up to 20 slots which you
can<00:01:27.030> define<00:01:27.299> individually<00:01:28.009> by<00:01:29.009> going<00:01:29.340> down

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
can define individually by going down

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.249 
can define individually by going down
once<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.210> set<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.509> battery<00:01:30.750> type<00:01:31.049> and

proceed through the menus we need to go
to<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.759> 3300<00:01:45.420> yeah<00:01:46.130> there<00:01:47.130> we<00:01:47.189> go<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.570> charge

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
to a 3300 yeah there we go on charge

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.060 
to a 3300 yeah there we go on charge
current<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.079> where<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.409> gets<00:01:49.530> interesting

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
current is where it gets interesting

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.510 
current is where it gets interesting
oh<00:01:53.570> we<00:01:54.570> can<00:01:54.689> only<00:01:54.810> go<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> 6.6<00:01:55.619> m/s<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
oh we can only go to 6.6 m/s and this is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.090 
oh we can only go to 6.6 m/s and this is

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
capable of since we're charging high

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.969 
capable of since we're charging high
Piron<00:02:09.420> levels<00:02:09.810> we<00:02:10.020> are<00:02:10.229> capable<00:02:10.590> of<00:02:10.740> charging

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
Piron levels we are capable of charging

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.090 
Piron levels we are capable of charging
them<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.370> 6c<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.930> after<00:02:13.290> setting<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.710> we

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
them with 6c so after setting that we

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.540 
them with 6c so after setting that we
will<00:02:14.280> go

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
will go

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.330 
will go
back<00:02:14.670> into<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.410> mode<00:02:16.410> of<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.800> Webley<00:02:17.190> work

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.520 
back into the mode of the Webley work
before<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.970> increased<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.870> six<00:02:19.110> point<00:02:19.320> six

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
before and increased the six point six

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.160 
before and increased the six point six
can<00:02:19.890> now<00:02:20.040> go<00:02:20.250> way<00:02:20.430> beyond<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.330> we<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:21.690> actually

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
can now go way beyond so we can actually

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.190 
can now go way beyond so we can actually
go<00:02:22.530> six<00:02:23.160> times<00:02:23.600> three<00:02:24.600> thousand<00:02:25.110> three

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.750 
go six times three thousand three
hundred<00:02:25.410> which<00:02:25.920> should<00:02:26.100> come<00:02:26.310> very<00:02:26.490> close<00:02:26.670> to

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
hundred which should come very close to

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.460 
hundred which should come very close to
twenty<00:02:27.240> let's<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:29.780> nineteen<00:02:30.780> point<00:02:30.960> eight

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.610 
twenty let's see nineteen point eight
there<00:02:31.860> we<00:02:31.950> go<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.960> that's<00:02:33.960> basically<00:02:34.380> all<00:02:34.470> we

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
there we go and that's basically all we

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.770 
there we go and that's basically all we
have<00:02:34.740> to<00:02:34.980> do<00:02:35.100> we<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:35.880> do<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> number<00:02:36.600> of<00:02:36.720> other

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
have to do we can do a number of other

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.320 
have to do we can do a number of other
things<00:02:37.140> this<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.120> terminal<00:02:39.120> capacity

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
things this is the terminal capacity

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.220 
things this is the terminal capacity
selection<00:02:40.290> system<00:02:40.530> which<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.630> in<00:02:42.630> most<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.140> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
selection system which is in most of the

selection system which is in most of the
hyperion<00:02:43.380> charges<00:02:43.980> it<00:02:44.130> allows<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.640> have

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
hyperion charges it allows you to have

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.120 
hyperion charges it allows you to have
the<00:02:45.570> charge<00:02:45.960> a<00:02:46.110> break<00:02:46.350> off<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.770> charging

the charge a break off the charging

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.730 
the charge a break off the charging
process<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.700> little<00:02:47.850> early<00:02:48.510> in<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.260> case<00:02:49.500> at

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
process a little early in this case at

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.500 
process a little early in this case at
ninety<00:02:50.100> five<00:02:50.280> percent<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.910> this<00:02:51.030> makes<00:02:51.300> all

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
ninety five percent and this makes all

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.970 
ninety five percent and this makes all
the<00:02:51.810> sense<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.200> world<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.770> your

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
the sense in the world and this your

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.760 
the sense in the world and this your
competition<00:02:53.640> pilot<00:02:54.030> or<00:02:54.150> driver<00:02:54.390> because<00:02:55.380> the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
competition pilot or driver because the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.460 
competition pilot or driver because the
last<00:02:56.070> five<00:02:56.460> percent<00:02:56.880> takes<00:02:57.300> a<00:02:57.690> very<00:02:58.290> long<00:02:58.410> time

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
last five percent takes a very long time

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.590 
last five percent takes a very long time
compared<00:02:59.130> with<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.340> rest<00:02:59.520> of<00:02:59.610> the<00:02:59.730> charge<00:02:59.970> so

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
compared with the rest of the charge so

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.450 
compared with the rest of the charge so
we<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:00.840> set<00:03:01.020> it<00:03:01.140> up<00:03:01.230> like<00:03:01.410> that<00:03:01.440> and<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.310> can

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
we have set it up like that and you can

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.220 
we have set it up like that and you can
set<00:03:02.670> up<00:03:02.700> what<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.240> action<00:03:03.570> should<00:03:03.720> be<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.080> can

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
set up what the action should be you can

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.630 
set up what the action should be you can
travel<00:03:04.440> between<00:03:04.620> that<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.160> charge<00:03:05.400> actually

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
travel between that the charge actually

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.270 
travel between that the charge actually
stops<00:03:06.090> or<00:03:06.480> it<00:03:06.870> continues<00:03:07.380> if<00:03:07.680> you're<00:03:07.860> busy

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
stops or it continues if you're busy

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.680 
stops or it continues if you're busy
talking<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.760> a<00:03:08.880> friend<00:03:09.030> or<00:03:09.240> whatever<00:03:09.360> you<00:03:09.600> will

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
talking to a friend or whatever you will

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.770 
talking to a friend or whatever you will
get<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.960> full<00:03:10.140> charge<00:03:10.500> anyway<00:03:11.330> so<00:03:12.330> let's<00:03:12.630> go

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
get the full charge anyway so let's go

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.740 
get the full charge anyway so let's go
let's<00:03:13.110> start<00:03:13.290> by<00:03:13.620> checking<00:03:13.860> up<00:03:14.130> out<00:03:14.520> the<00:03:14.880> lipo

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
let's start by checking up out the lipo

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.040 
let's start by checking up out the lipo
and<00:03:15.900> see<00:03:16.110> what<00:03:16.230> it<00:03:16.320> does<00:03:16.350> in<00:03:16.860> terms<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:18.050> the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
and see what it does in terms of the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.530 
and see what it does in terms of the

do that which means I had to terminate
the<00:06:14.590> charge<00:06:15.300> I'll<00:06:16.300> then<00:06:16.539> go<00:06:16.810> down<00:06:17.050> until<00:06:18.039> I

reach<00:06:18.550> the<00:06:18.909> 95<00:06:19.599> and<00:06:20.110> increase<00:06:20.500> actual

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
reach the 95 and increase actual

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.580 
reach the 95 and increase actual
