00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.850 
machines a 16 bobbin rope braiding
machine<00:00:07.880> and<00:00:09.080> I'll<00:00:10.080> are<00:00:10.200> you<00:00:10.260> working<00:00:10.620> on<00:00:10.679> it

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
machine and I'll are you working on it

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.520 
machine and I'll are you working on it
um<00:00:11.160> I've<00:00:11.969> probably<00:00:12.300> got<00:00:12.570> like<00:00:12.870> two<00:00:13.170> months

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
um I've probably got like two months

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.240 
um I've probably got like two months
into<00:00:14.540> it<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.960> probably<00:00:16.410> one<00:00:16.710> month<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.100> that

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
into it and probably one month of that

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.269 
into it and probably one month of that
is<00:00:18.439> time<00:00:19.439> that's<00:00:19.680> been<00:00:19.830> sitting<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.130> my

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
is time that's been sitting on my

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.310 
is time that's been sitting on my
workbench<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:21.270> I<00:00:21.330> understand<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.660> got<00:00:21.810> TSA

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
workbench so I understand I got TSA

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.200 
workbench so I understand I got TSA
screen<00:00:22.769> but<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.279> still<00:00:23.490> functioning<00:00:24.029> ever

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
screen but is it still functioning ever

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.990 
screen but is it still functioning ever
yeah<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.990> think<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.980> tension<00:00:26.220> as<00:00:26.670> long<00:00:26.910> as

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
yeah I think so the tension as long as

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.330 
yeah I think so the tension as long as
we<00:00:27.060> don't<00:00:27.150> have<00:00:27.330> any<00:00:27.480> tangles<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.830> think<00:00:29.250> we're

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
we don't have any tangles I think we're

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.780 
we don't have any tangles I think we're
gonna<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.640> some<00:00:29.880> functionality<00:00:30.330> here<00:00:30.800> so

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.740

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
and I'll just slow it down doesn't like

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.500 
and I'll just slow it down doesn't like

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it I have to do this I have to you know

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.560 
it I have to do this I have to you know
make<00:01:37.619> make<00:01:38.159> one<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.400> these<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.820> bunch<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.360> times

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
make make one of these a bunch of times

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.240 
make make one of these a bunch of times
for<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.810> project<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.380> think<00:01:40.860> I'm<00:01:41.100> going<00:01:41.189> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
for the project I think I'm going to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.780 
for the project I think I'm going to
make<00:01:41.400> a<00:01:41.430> kit<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.570> people<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.680> try<00:01:44.460> making

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
make a kit that people can try making

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.730 
make a kit that people can try making
their<00:01:44.909> own<00:01:44.939> rope<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:45.990> different<00:01:46.290> purposes

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
their own rope for different purposes

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.219 
their own rope for different purposes
it's<00:01:47.040> sixteen<00:01:47.970> Bob<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.750> theory<00:01:49.079> we

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
it's sixteen Bob and so in theory we

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.660 
it's sixteen Bob and so in theory we
could<00:01:49.649> get<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.369> know<00:01:50.490> like

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
could get up to you know like

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.859 
could get up to you know like
three-eighths<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.119> an<00:01:51.240> inch<00:01:52.100> rope<00:01:53.780> awesome<00:01:54.780> I

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
three-eighths of an inch rope awesome I

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:55.969 
three-eighths of an inch rope awesome I
will<00:01:55.020> thank<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.259> much<00:01:55.350> for<00:01:55.560> sharing<00:01:55.649> with<00:01:55.799> us
