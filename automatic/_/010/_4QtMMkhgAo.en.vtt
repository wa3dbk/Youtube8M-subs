style we're gonna lean to playing is
where<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:06.780> push<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.170> wave<00:02:07.320> early<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.280> by

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
where we push the wave early and by

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.119 
where we push the wave early and by
pushing<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.569> way<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.810> early<00:02:10.080> Jayce<00:02:10.800> has<00:02:10.830> to

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
pushing the way of early Jayce has to

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.770 
pushing the way of early Jayce has to
either<00:02:11.280> focus<00:02:11.760> on<00:02:11.910> getting<00:02:12.180> his<00:02:12.270> last<00:02:12.510> hits

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
either focus on getting his last hits

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.680 
either focus on getting his last hits
under<00:02:12.959> tower

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
under tower

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.410 
under tower
or<00:02:14.250> harassing<00:02:15.250> us<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.640> if<00:02:15.730> he's<00:02:15.850> harassing<00:02:15.970> us

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
or harassing us and if he's harassing us

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.240 
or harassing us and if he's harassing us
in<00:02:16.600> missing<00:02:16.870> lass<00:02:17.020> hits<00:02:17.290> we<00:02:17.800> end<00:02:17.950> up<00:02:18.040> winning

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
in missing lass hits we end up winning

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.190 
in missing lass hits we end up winning
anyways<00:02:18.670> our<00:02:21.120> goal<00:02:22.120> early<00:02:22.270> game<00:02:22.630> against<00:02:22.960> Jase

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
anyways our goal early game against Jase

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.080 
anyways our goal early game against Jase
is<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.530> hit<00:02:23.680> level<00:02:23.830> 2<00:02:24.070> before<00:02:24.250> he<00:02:24.550> does<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:24.970> we

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
is to hit level 2 before he does so we

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.600 
is to hit level 2 before he does so we
can<00:02:25.210> apply<00:02:25.300> pressure<00:02:25.750> and<00:02:26.320> get<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.620> lane<00:02:26.860> into

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
can apply pressure and get the lane into

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.140 
can apply pressure and get the lane into
a<00:02:27.640> spot<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.000> we<00:02:28.270> like<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:29.020> spot<00:02:29.260> we<00:02:29.380> like<00:02:29.590> is

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
a spot that we like the spot we like is

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.030 
a spot that we like the spot we like is
so<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.870> lanes<00:02:32.050> lined<00:02:32.290> up<00:02:32.470> right<00:02:32.620> next<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
so the lanes lined up right next to the

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.950 
so the lanes lined up right next to the
bush<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:33.670> we<00:02:33.790> can<00:02:33.940> constantly<00:02:34.390> duck<00:02:34.660> into<00:02:34.840> the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
bush so we can constantly duck into the

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.250 
bush so we can constantly duck into the
bush<00:02:35.260> avoiding<00:02:35.950> auto<00:02:36.130> attacks<00:02:36.520> and<00:02:37.260> keeping

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
bush avoiding auto attacks and keeping

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.670 
bush avoiding auto attacks and keeping
guessing<00:02:38.620> where<00:02:38.800> we<00:02:38.920> are<00:02:39.870> so<00:02:40.870> we're<00:02:41.320> gonna<00:02:41.410> try

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
guessing where we are so we're gonna try

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.360 
guessing where we are so we're gonna try
and<00:02:41.920> push

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
and push

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.230 
and push
we<00:02:42.910> took<00:02:43.090> wolf<00:02:43.720> XP<00:02:44.140> that<00:02:44.560> means<00:02:44.770> that<00:02:45.240> three

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
we took wolf XP that means that three

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.240 
we took wolf XP that means that three
melee<00:02:46.600> creeps<00:02:46.870> and<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.380> caster<00:02:47.770> creep<00:02:47.980> will

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
melee creeps and a caster creep will

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.270 
melee creeps and a caster creep will
give<00:02:48.400> us<00:02:48.550> level<00:02:48.850> two<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.840> try<00:02:50.710> and<00:02:50.830> time<00:02:51.010> it<00:02:51.160> up

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
give us level two so try and time it up

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.920 
give us level two so try and time it up
perfectly<00:02:51.790> go<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.960> get<00:02:53.500> some<00:02:53.650> damage<00:02:53.950> off<00:02:54.160> I

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
perfectly go and get some damage off I

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.360 
perfectly go and get some damage off I
like<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:56.110> start<00:02:56.320> with<00:02:56.740> W<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.400> E<00:02:59.280> this<00:03:00.280> is

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
like to start with W and E this is

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.030 
like to start with W and E this is
because<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:01.360> feel<00:03:02.080> comfortable<00:03:02.320> pushing<00:03:02.920> the

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
because I feel comfortable pushing the

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.460 
because I feel comfortable pushing the
lane<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.910> not<00:03:04.060> taking<00:03:04.420> a<00:03:04.600> lot<00:03:04.750> of<00:03:04.780> damage<00:03:05.260> if

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
lane and not taking a lot of damage if

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.090 
lane and not taking a lot of damage if
you<00:03:05.590> think<00:03:05.980> you're<00:03:06.100> gonna<00:03:06.190> get<00:03:07.830> like<00:03:08.830> poked

you think you're gonna get like poked
really<00:03:09.460> hard<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:10.540> might<00:03:10.720> be<00:03:10.870> better<00:03:11.050> to<00:03:11.170> take

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
really hard it might be better to take

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.650 
really hard it might be better to take
you<00:03:11.830> early<00:03:12.250> so<00:03:12.790> you<00:03:12.880> can<00:03:13.090> get<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.480> lane

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
effective you're not you're not really

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.710 
effective you're not you're not really
gonna<00:04:41.590> kill<00:04:41.680> him<00:04:42.069> without<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.759> gank<00:04:43.150> most<00:04:43.569> of

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
gonna kill him without a gank most of

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.330 
gonna kill him without a gank most of
the<00:04:43.780> time<00:04:43.960> unless<00:04:44.319> you<00:04:44.560> miss<00:04:44.740> plays<00:04:44.949> horribly

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
the time unless you miss plays horribly

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.460 
the time unless you miss plays horribly
so<00:04:46.120> it's<00:04:46.270> really<00:04:46.539> good<00:04:46.780> just<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.080> use<00:04:47.199> it<00:04:47.379> to

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
so it's really good just to use it to

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.320 
so it's really good just to use it to
force<00:04:47.710> him<00:04:47.860> from<00:04:47.889> Lane<00:04:48.220> so<00:04:48.460> you<00:04:48.580> get<00:04:48.759> a<00:04:48.909> CS
