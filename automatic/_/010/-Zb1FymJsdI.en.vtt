know for sure I think they'd be three
and<00:00:44.719> one<00:00:44.960> they<00:00:45.170> were<00:00:45.230> right<00:00:45.530> in<00:00:45.559> both<00:00:46.339> games<00:00:46.579> a

loss they gained over 500 yards and both
of<00:00:49.129> them<00:00:49.460> but<00:00:49.640> five<00:00:50.089> turnovers<00:00:50.420> in<00:00:50.899> each<00:00:51.079> is

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
of them but five turnovers in each is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.290 
of them but five turnovers in each is
what<00:00:51.440> did<00:00:51.649> a<00:00:51.679> min<00:00:51.949> now<00:00:52.399> this<00:00:52.609> is<00:00:52.760> a<00:00:52.789> talented

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
what did a min now this is a talented

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.819 
what did a min now this is a talented
football<00:00:53.809> team<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.199> they<00:00:54.350> are<00:00:54.440> good<00:00:54.649> enough

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
football team and they are good enough

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.889 
football team and they are good enough
to<00:00:55.010> win<00:00:55.190> every<00:00:55.460> game<00:00:55.910> remaining<00:00:56.510> on<00:00:56.719> their

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
to win every game remaining on their

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.299 
to win every game remaining on their
schedule<00:00:57.140> but<00:00:57.379> they've<00:00:57.649> got<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:58.039> get<00:00:58.129> the

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
schedule but they've got to get the

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:00.160 
schedule but they've got to get the
turnover<00:00:58.789> thing<00:00:59.030> fixed<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.809> I<00:00:59.870> think<00:01:00.109> it

turnover thing fixed and I think it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.689 
turnover thing fixed and I think it
starts<00:01:00.469> with<00:01:00.530> their<00:01:00.739> quarterback<00:01:01.129> Tommy<00:01:01.370> Rees
