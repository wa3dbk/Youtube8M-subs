00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.009
 thing that the contract even though it's 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.570
 always difficult to leave channel 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.090
 because channel was the diffuser 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.890
 history who knew how to do the sport 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.390
 it was still a TV that loved 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.609
 the sport who knew how to do that had 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.410
 supported basketball for twenty maybe 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.070
 thirty years so it's always difficult 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.880
 to leave each other like this 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.980
 however, I find that the new 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.990
 contract is rather interesting already 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.730
 financially you do not have to 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.579
 forget it since it is in net 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.710
 valuation but also in terms 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.329
 of exposure because we find 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.730
 visibility with the team 21 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:47.640
 and if indeed my sports channel 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.370
 guided by sfr could allow us 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.010
 to get the support 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.070
 digital subscribers sfr 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.280
 the stake I believe it is really there if 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.930
 we really are able tomorrow and sfr and 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.930
 league and clubs to get involved 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.740
 to precisely appear on the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.930
 mobile sfr 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.930
 the battle will be won 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.900
 very happy with the result 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.980
 it is true that we took a little 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.600
 against everything that was being done 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.360
 including a ticket with parks is 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.390
 very very clear see parks and white 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.300
 I think white is an image a 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.350
 identity to there is a vibration canton 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.550
 performance is that there is what 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.750
 nowadays says that's what the 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.170
 spectators say is the team 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.180
 adversary usually says and so we have 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.340
 want to continue to cultivate this 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.440
 particular identity and want to 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.640
 to show that when we 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.840
 was returning to this room there was 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.450
 a story things had happened 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.100
 completely different and that and that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.140
 therefore we had to be 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.670
 able at any given moment through 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.590
 the color of the park and the intensity 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.450
 that we were going to show that what 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.860
 that this park is there it is totally 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.840
 different from the other parquets of France 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.580
 may be from europe and that simply 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.610
 when we once saw the image of the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.870
 parquet we knew it was a beautiful 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.540
 white it was happening while it was 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.929
 in the press the media 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.580
 paper newspapers whether it's on TV on 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.020
 had a little that envy there an image 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.120
 retransmitted on the internet 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.870
 this park is there had to be identified 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.870
 in limoges csp 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.960
 yes we can talk about it is a secret of 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.490
 polichinelle today we tried 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:30.010
 for four years to make a shop 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.660
 rue de vienne at our headquarters is 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.560
 not our job we tried to 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.360
 develop a lot of products 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.040
 it allowed us to take a step 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.840
 but if we really wanted to cross a 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.380
 extra step have a real 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.810
 shop 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.540
 it had to be downtown of which 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.200
 4 Ferry Street Between Bell Tower Street 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.500
 consulate street 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.760
 it will be a shop 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.170
 we will not reveal anything but who will be 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.140
 certainly a little different and 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.090
 that will surprise people since all 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.120
 those who knew the paper house 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.420
 who were there before go see a spirit 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.700
 completely different and I invite everything 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.620
 the world to come discover it 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.200
 late September early October and especially 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.420
 that the delivery of subscriber cards is 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.970
 will be there for the first time so 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.330
 it will be an opportunity to see the new 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.330
 products 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:23.820
 the environment that is and we delegated 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.230
 in fact to a private company society 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.660
 replica who belonged to the club 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.980
 for several years the management of 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.940
 this shop there because it's their 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.920
 profession that it was not at all the 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:41.610
 ours the only word of encouragement we 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.320
 can have towards them this is there is a 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.970
 amazing shooting window for basketball 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.520
 we have the opportunity to be champion 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.500
 from home to Europe we may have the 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.910
 best team of france all 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.040
 generations combined 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.110
 we never had a team with so much 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.340
 good players when we see in the 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.990
 selection in dismissing 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.790
 Players everybody complains 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.020
 thomas heurtel either be dismissed but 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.550
 if he had not been thomas heurtel he 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.810
 had to rule out who is managing kenya towards a 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.390
 group of fifteen twenty players 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.310
 exceptional we have leaders with tony 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.920
 fabulous parker we have wingers with 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.110
 nicolas boat we have with boris diaw 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.150
 rudy gobert interiors with ovary has 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.680
 hungry there are good players everywhere but 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.500
 not good players big players 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.500
 everywhere the final will go to Lille 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.930
 in a room of 27000 square was 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.160
 never been done in europe we have 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.560
 the opportunity to be European champion in 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.180
 home without putting pressure on them 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.060
 because it's players who know 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.650
 manage it but for them it's important 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.440
 for the important French team at 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.260
 French basketball is important and so 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.000
 for all French clubs of cold 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.310
 pro b but even national clubs 3 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.930
 2 regional make a big competition 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.770
 is European champion at home this is 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.770
 really all the harm they want 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.390
 the winners were happy to have the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.150
 maccabi tel aviv who was champion 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.330
 of Europe and the CSK Moscow which 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.380
 was the biggest budget of the Euroleague 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:08.200
 but for us limougeaud the maccabi the 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.600
 of the couple for us limougeaud the nokia 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.420
 caused particular that is to say that it is 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.800
 jousting here amazing with 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.270
 players remember battles 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.520
 between michael young and if gallas ans 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.740
 reminds the ioannidis the Greek coach who 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.300
 smoked on the edge of the field 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:23.710
 matches attitudes of fights 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.540
 dddd a voltage 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.610
 we remember the famous quarterback match 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:30.400
 final of the Euroleague that sends us to 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.890
 final strong athens and we are in which 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.330
 we become european champion with this 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.800
 shoot of lloris deutsch everyone 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.290
 has in mind everything that happened so 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.610
 no it is true that olympiakos has 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.650
 really it was really a poster 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.300
 we wanted there are 2-3 clad obviously 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:45.190
 there is barcelona yesterday she madrid 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.750
 olympiakos suffer Scotland and we wanted a 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.980
 of these four and we are very happy 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.710
 to have olympiakos 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.050
 we especially hope to have the other three 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.270
 if we ever qualify in tab will be 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.460
 maybe keep invincibility against 

00:05:55.270 --> 00:06:03.190
 olympiakos at home ie I 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:04.810
 I'm not in the story yet that's 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.660
 still an info and it's really 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:09.760
 the info that will have to be fought 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.420
 highlight one forward at the moment of 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:14.890
 to play even though at the time I wanted to 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.600
 say the suspect was a little gran 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:19.540
 colombia causse and that for twenty years 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.770
 a piia coes took dimensions con 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.270
 we are not ready to reach 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.100
 french clubs le limoges csp en 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.120
 but it's a great challenge 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.360
 it's a great challenge to meet in 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.360
 any case
