and then let's have a look at the other

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.179 
and then let's have a look at the other
unique<00:01:39.659> cooling<00:01:40.079> features<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> 1/2<00:01:40.920> X

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
unique cooling features that the 1/2 X

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.789 
unique cooling features that the 1/2 X
has<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:42.060> will<00:01:42.240> enable<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.810> support<00:01:43.320> this

kind<00:01:44.040> of<00:01:44.189> hardware<00:01:44.759> first<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.390> all<00:01:45.509> we've<00:01:45.659> got

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
kind of hardware first of all we've got

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.230 
kind of hardware first of all we've got
a<00:01:45.840> 230<00:01:46.619> millimeter<00:01:47.040> red<00:01:47.280> LED<00:01:47.700> fan<00:01:47.939> at<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
a 230 millimeter red LED fan at the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.200 
a 230 millimeter red LED fan at the
front<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.899> actually<00:01:49.320> switches<00:01:49.740> on<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.729> LED

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
front that actually switches on the LED

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.730 
front that actually switches on the LED
switches<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:51.869> off<00:01:52.140> if<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.500> press<00:01:52.710> a

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740

button on the front of the case check
that<00:01:54.960> out<00:01:55.140> pretty<00:01:55.649> sweet

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
that out pretty sweet

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.130 
that out pretty sweet
okay<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.180> that's<00:01:57.299> one<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.780> features<00:01:57.930> that

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
okay so that's one of the features that

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.660 
okay so that's one of the features that
I<00:01:58.350> thought<00:01:58.649> was<00:01:58.799> kind<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.040> unique<00:01:59.189> about<00:01:59.430> this

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
I thought was kind of unique about this

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.760 
I thought was kind of unique about this
case<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.149> then<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.750> next<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.290> at<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> back

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
case and then the next is at the back

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.740 
case and then the next is at the back
we've<00:02:01.979> got<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> 140<00:02:02.670> millimeter<00:02:03.000> fan<00:02:03.240> that's

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
we've got a 140 millimeter fan that's

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.780 
we've got a 140 millimeter fan that's
pretty<00:02:04.020> standard<00:02:04.259> fare<00:02:04.740> but<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.280> also<00:02:05.460> has

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
pretty standard fare but it also has

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.700 
pretty standard fare but it also has
mounting<00:02:06.240> holes<00:02:06.450> for<00:02:06.540> 120<00:02:07.079> millimeter<00:02:07.469> if<00:02:07.590> you

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
mounting holes for 120 millimeter if you

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.040 
mounting holes for 120 millimeter if you
want<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:07.950> put<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.310> radiator<00:02:09.060> or<00:02:09.420> any<00:02:09.599> other<00:02:09.780> kind

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
want to put a radiator or any other kind

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.170 
want to put a radiator or any other kind
of<00:02:10.140> cooling<00:02:10.530> solution<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.160> there<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.610> then

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
of cooling solution up there and then

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.990 
of cooling solution up there and then
finally<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.110> top<00:02:13.349> we<00:02:13.920> have<00:02:14.099> room<00:02:14.459> for<00:02:14.489> two

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
finally in the top we have room for two

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.780 
finally in the top we have room for two
and<00:02:15.840> I'm<00:02:16.020> just<00:02:16.170> going<00:02:16.290> to<00:02:16.379> move<00:02:16.530> my<00:02:16.770> 1/2<00:02:16.980> 922

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
and I'm just going to move my 1/2 922

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.000 
and I'm just going to move my 1/2 922
here<00:02:18.030> which<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.330> for<00:02:18.870> comparison's<00:02:19.860> sake

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
here which I have for comparison's sake

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.650 
here which I have for comparison's sake
we'll<00:02:20.220> get<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.489> later<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:21.300> can<00:02:21.480> actually

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
we'll get to that later you can actually

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.920 
we'll get to that later you can actually
put<00:02:22.110> two<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.860> it<00:02:23.190> comes<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.520> one<00:02:23.930> 200

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
put two and it comes with one 200

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.260 
put two and it comes with one 200

cooling options etc etc this one is just

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.399 
cooling options etc etc this one is just
more<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.430> bigger<00:03:17.879> and<00:03:18.150> better<00:03:18.629> so<00:03:19.050> that's<00:03:19.200> why

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:19.409 
more and bigger and better so that's why

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:20.960 
more and bigger and better so that's why
we<00:03:19.560> went<00:03:19.709> with<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:20.069> I<00:03:20.280> just<00:03:20.310> wanted<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.819> show

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
we went with it I just wanted to show

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.759 
we went with it I just wanted to show
you<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.420> how<00:03:21.569> big<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.140> thing<00:03:22.349> is<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.560> even

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
you just how big this thing is I even

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.830 
you just how big this thing is I even
have<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.099> 1/2<00:03:23.250> 922<00:03:23.940> sitting<00:03:24.239> in<00:03:24.330> front<00:03:24.510> of<00:03:24.720> it

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
have the 1/2 922 sitting in front of it

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.949 
have the 1/2 922 sitting in front of it
and<00:03:25.049> it<00:03:25.409> still<00:03:25.530> Dwarfs<00:03:26.129> it<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.760> half<00:03:26.959> 2922

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
and it still Dwarfs it and the half 2922

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.860 
and it still Dwarfs it and the half 2922
is<00:03:28.200> not<00:03:28.409> even<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.950> tiny<00:03:29.549> case<00:03:29.909> by<00:03:30.450> any<00:03:30.480> stretch

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
is not even a tiny case by any stretch

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.410 
is not even a tiny case by any stretch
of<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.110> imagination<00:03:31.580> so<00:03:32.580> now<00:03:33.000> let's<00:03:33.209> talk<00:03:33.360> a

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
of the imagination so now let's talk a

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.880 
of the imagination so now let's talk a
little<00:03:33.510> bit<00:03:33.720> about<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.110> component<00:03:34.590> selection

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
little bit about the component selection

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.430 
little bit about the component selection
that<00:03:35.430> went<00:03:35.640> into<00:03:36.000> building<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.780> most<00:03:36.959> extreme

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
that went into building the most extreme

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.530 
that went into building the most extreme
machine<00:03:37.769> we<00:03:37.950> can<00:03:38.159> I<00:03:38.370> did<00:03:38.700> make<00:03:38.909> a<00:03:38.940> couple<00:03:39.330> of

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
machine we can I did make a couple of

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.089 
machine we can I did make a couple of
compromises<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.409> I'll<00:03:40.470> talk<00:03:40.650> about<00:03:40.680> those

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
compromises and I'll talk about those

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.610 
compromises and I'll talk about those
first<00:03:41.700> I'm<00:03:42.090> using<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.840> Intel<00:03:43.170> stock<00:03:43.409> cooler

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
first I'm using the Intel stock cooler

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.770 
first I'm using the Intel stock cooler
the<00:03:44.159> reason<00:03:44.459> for<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.640> is<00:03:45.000> that<00:03:45.180> it<00:03:45.299> was<00:03:45.390> handy

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
the reason for that is that it was handy

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.380 
the reason for that is that it was handy
ok<00:03:46.260> really<00:03:47.099> you<00:03:47.519> should<00:03:47.730> be<00:03:47.760> using<00:03:48.030> something

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
ok really you should be using something

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.800 
ok really you should be using something
like<00:03:48.510> a<00:03:48.659> naught<00:03:48.900> 2<00:03:49.080> a<00:03:49.110> d<00:03:49.560> 4<00:03:50.310> D<00:03:50.610> 14<00:03:51.120> or<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.629> could

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
like a naught 2 a d 4 D 14 or you could

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.690 
like a naught 2 a d 4 D 14 or you could
be<00:03:51.930> using<00:03:52.140> anything<00:03:52.739> like<00:03:52.920> a<00:03:52.950> Coolermaster

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
be using anything like a Coolermaster

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.759 
be using anything like a Coolermaster
v10<00:03:54.120> something<00:03:54.750> huge<00:03:55.080> would<00:03:55.230> be<00:03:55.349> great

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
v10 something huge would be great

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.710 
v10 something huge would be great
ideally<00:03:56.489> though<00:03:56.640> water<00:03:57.090> cooling<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:57.540> going<00:03:57.659> to

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
ideally though water cooling is going to

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.119 
ideally though water cooling is going to
be<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.930> way<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.080> go<00:03:58.260> in<00:03:58.409> a<00:03:58.470> machine<00:03:58.739> like<00:03:58.950> this

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
be the way to go in a machine like this

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.570 
be the way to go in a machine like this
secondly<00:04:00.090> I'm<00:04:00.360> also<00:04:00.840> only<00:04:01.080> using<00:04:01.650> three<00:04:02.220> dims

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
secondly I'm also only using three dims

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.699 
secondly I'm also only using three dims
and<00:04:02.939> the<00:04:03.120> reason<00:04:03.480> for<00:04:03.510> that<00:04:03.659> is<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.409> you<00:04:04.530> get

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
and the reason for that is that you get

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.619 
and the reason for that is that you get
the<00:04:04.860> best<00:04:05.069> overclocking<00:04:05.849> out<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.060> your<00:04:06.180> CPU

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
the best overclocking out of your CPU

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.720 
the best overclocking out of your CPU
and<00:04:06.870> out<00:04:07.049> of<00:04:07.170> your<00:04:07.290> Ram<00:04:07.500> when<00:04:07.950> you<00:04:08.069> don't<00:04:08.430> load

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
and out of your Ram when you don't load

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.490 
and out of your Ram when you don't load
up<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:09.030> motherboard<00:04:09.510> with<00:04:09.750> six<00:04:10.049> dims<00:04:10.319> of

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
up the motherboard with six dims of

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.380 
up the motherboard with six dims of
memory<00:04:10.769> so<00:04:11.189> that's<00:04:11.370> another<00:04:11.670> small

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
memory so that's another small

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.390 
memory so that's another small
compromise<00:04:12.959> that<00:04:13.200> I<00:04:13.230> did<00:04:13.439> make<00:04:13.709> other<00:04:14.220> than

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
compromise that I did make other than

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.719 
compromise that I did make other than
that<00:04:14.700> this<00:04:15.030> machine<00:04:15.209> is<00:04:15.680> loaded<00:04:16.680> to<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.250> gills

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
that this machine is loaded to the gills

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.670 
that this machine is loaded to the gills
so<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.479> motherboard<00:04:18.989> that's<00:04:19.380> where

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
so the motherboard that's where

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.379 
so the motherboard that's where
everything<00:04:20.130> starts<00:04:20.489> because<00:04:20.880> we<00:04:21.060> started

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
everything starts because we started

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.540 
everything starts because we started
with<00:04:21.449> the<00:04:21.660> EVGA

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
with the EVGA

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.999 
with the EVGA
58<00:04:23.060> for<00:04:23.479> weight<00:04:23.690> classified<00:04:24.470> motherboard

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
58 for weight classified motherboard

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.670 
58 for weight classified motherboard
this<00:04:25.490> motherboard<00:04:25.819> is<00:04:26.150> actually<00:04:26.599> two<00:04:27.139> slots

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
this motherboard is actually two slots

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.040 
this motherboard is actually two slots
longer<00:04:28.490> than<00:04:28.849> a<00:04:28.879> standard<00:04:29.000> ATX<00:04:29.599> board<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.020> I

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
longer than a standard ATX board and I

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.899 
longer than a standard ATX board and I
did<00:04:30.199> a<00:04:30.229> full<00:04:30.470> video<00:04:30.770> on<00:04:30.979> that<00:04:31.129> topic<00:04:31.340> check<00:04:31.729> out

00:04:31.899 --> 00:04:31.909 
did a full video on that topic check out

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.210 
did a full video on that topic check out
that<00:04:32.120> video<00:04:32.300> as<00:04:32.659> well<00:04:32.960> if<00:04:33.349> it's<00:04:33.560> uploaded<00:04:34.009> yet

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
that video as well if it's uploaded yet

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.430 
that video as well if it's uploaded yet
but<00:04:34.879> what<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.270> means<00:04:35.599> is<00:04:35.900> that<00:04:36.139> there<00:04:36.319> are

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
but what that means is that there are

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.830 
but what that means is that there are
only<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.830> couple<00:04:36.889> cases<00:04:37.460> in<00:04:37.849> the<00:04:38.030> world<00:04:38.060> that

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
only a couple cases in the world that

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.330 
only a couple cases in the world that
will<00:04:38.960> support<00:04:39.229> that<00:04:39.319> motherboard<00:04:39.919> yet

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
will support that motherboard yet

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.070 
will support that motherboard yet
another<00:04:40.580> reason<00:04:41.000> we<00:04:41.240> chose<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.690> 1/2<00:04:41.840> X

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
another reason we chose the 1/2 X

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.200 
another reason we chose the 1/2 X
because<00:04:42.500> if<00:04:43.009> you<00:04:43.159> look<00:04:43.340> up<00:04:43.490> at<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.669> top<00:04:43.940> of<00:04:44.120> the

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
because if you look up at the top of the

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.350 
because if you look up at the top of the
1/2<00:04:44.389> X<00:04:44.629> here<00:04:44.930> you<00:04:45.319> can<00:04:45.530> see<00:04:45.680> there<00:04:45.889> are<00:04:46.009> two

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
1/2 X here you can see there are two

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.300 
1/2 X here you can see there are two
unused<00:04:47.360> PCI<00:04:47.900> slots<00:04:48.289> there<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:48.710> I'm<00:04:48.800> yeah

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
unused PCI slots there and I'm yeah

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.700 
unused PCI slots there and I'm yeah
there<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.639> go<00:04:49.669> two<00:04:50.150> unused<00:04:50.599> PCI<00:04:51.050> slots<00:04:51.440> there

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
there you go two unused PCI slots there

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:54.580 
there you go two unused PCI slots there
even<00:04:52.370> though<00:04:52.520> we've<00:04:52.759> actually<00:04:52.970> got<00:04:53.419> 8<00:04:53.840> PCI

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
even though we've actually got 8 PCI

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.379
