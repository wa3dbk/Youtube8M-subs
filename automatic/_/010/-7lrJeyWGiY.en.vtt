00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.389
 so it must have been 18:40 game sorges 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.550
 snow the lotto once the car 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 light I said to myself I'll go 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.369
 look for the strawberry and at the moment I 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.020
 Advance to the garage door 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.840
 I see an avalanche of snow 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.369
 fall from the pylon and I said to myself 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.859
 something is happening at that moment 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:30.929
 I see that everything is moving and I 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.520
 did not have time to react 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.450
 anything I threw myself on my 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.180
 table 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.640
 I was sitting on it and there the Polish 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.050
 had fallen and there you are you see 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.809
 ground it made a big park it 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.750
 still sees it at that moment 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.930
 I called for help and my friend 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.280
 called the fire department and it was very 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.820
 very fast in it maybe going to last a 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.730
 ten seconds and this is due to what 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.920
 exactly 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.309
 you know the ua cua then there 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.670
 frankly I first thought about 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.680
 step since on Friday he has 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.620
 a lot of snow 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.190
 it was a 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:18.400
 very wet snow and saadi froze around 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:21.780
 cables and as it's not part of that 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:25.600
 differs a lot of weight so what 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.640
 here I'll explain it like that so this 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.160
 morning before 7 o'clock a little scary it was 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.820
 the least 10 I was really home 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.140
 between the antenna de-snow frequently 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.050
 I hear suddenly I heard a 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.700
 big sound it looks like an art that has 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.220
 broken or a wooden pillars that 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.920
 were falling I looked up and saw 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.640
 a pylon tdf that was intense and 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.860
 bedtime I quickly fell into my 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.780
 garage and after I heard a soul to 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.180
 the cables shoulder that arises is under 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.770
 our house does not reside if a 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.210
 earthquake would be almost there 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.250
 my daughter who was sleeping 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.450
 in the room so washed the impression 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.000
 that 29 32 we have right away 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.190
 called the firefighters 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.070
 and then we were closed 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.120
 in the house fearing the launch 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:18.330
 of the current spark but sometimes has 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.330
 to get out
