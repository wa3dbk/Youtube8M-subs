some of the dirt will adhere to it it's
part<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.380> transition<00:04:14.390> try<00:04:15.390> to<00:04:15.450> make<00:04:15.720> it

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
part of the transition try to make it

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.970 
part of the transition try to make it
relatively<00:04:16.680> seamless<00:04:18.109> be<00:04:19.109> putting<00:04:19.440> trees<00:04:19.709> and
