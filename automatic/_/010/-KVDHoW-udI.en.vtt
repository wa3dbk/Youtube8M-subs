00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.020 
to the builders well if we had problems
say<00:04:27.170> look<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:28.340> work<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.850> was<00:04:28.970> done

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
say look the the work that was done

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.820 
say look the the work that was done
wasn't<00:04:29.600> done<00:04:29.780> properly<00:04:29.810> because<00:04:30.320> it<00:04:30.530> wasn't

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
wasn't done properly because it wasn't

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.130 
wasn't done properly because it wasn't
sealed<00:04:31.070> which<00:04:31.700> is<00:04:31.880> why<00:04:32.090> because<00:04:32.750> when<00:04:32.900> it<00:04:33.020> was

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
sealed which is why because when it was

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.770 
sealed which is why because when it was
done<00:04:33.380> when<00:04:34.100> they<00:04:34.220> did<00:04:34.400> the<00:04:34.520> warranty<00:04:35.030> work<00:04:35.270> it

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
done when they did the warranty work it

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.510 
done when they did the warranty work it
wasn't<00:04:36.020> sealed<00:04:36.320> properly<00:04:36.560> which<00:04:37.010> is<00:04:37.040> why<00:04:37.310> it's

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
wasn't sealed properly which is why it's

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.900 
wasn't sealed properly which is why it's
gone<00:04:37.730> like<00:04:37.940> as<00:04:38.240> now<00:04:39.070> they<00:04:40.070> went<00:04:40.250> through<00:04:40.400> the
