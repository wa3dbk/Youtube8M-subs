Heath Slater right back as build up that
has<00:02:02.520> been<00:02:02.700> built<00:02:02.880> up<00:02:02.969> some<00:02:03.149> great<00:02:03.450> momentum<00:02:03.840> as

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
has been built up some great momentum as

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.569 
has been built up some great momentum as
of<00:02:04.320> late<00:02:04.469> so<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> don't<00:02:05.100> see<00:02:05.280> why<00:02:05.399> they<00:02:05.549> would

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
of late so I don't see why they would

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.760 
of late so I don't see why they would
kill<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:05.969> off<00:02:06.360> with<00:02:06.810> Ryback<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.710> said

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
kill that off with Ryback so like I said

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.990 
kill that off with Ryback so like I said
this<00:02:07.979> i<00:02:08.129> think<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.399> has<00:02:08.520> something<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.789> do<00:02:08.879> it

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
this i think this has something to do it

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.850 
this i think this has something to do it
Survivor<00:02:09.330> Series<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:09.810> wanted<00:02:10.379> hate<00:02:10.649> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
now once again I know it does seem a

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.390 
now once again I know it does seem a
little<00:02:15.960> bit<00:02:16.080> odd<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.800> they<00:02:17.190> would<00:02:17.220> have

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
little bit odd that they would have

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.340 
little bit odd that they would have
Ryback<00:02:17.820> go<00:02:18.000> against<00:02:18.240> John<00:02:18.540> Cena<00:02:18.720> seeing<00:02:19.140> them

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
you know who what we've witnessed out a

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.910 
you know who what we've witnessed out a
ride<00:02:21.510> back<00:02:21.690> in<00:02:21.870> the<00:02:21.960> crowd<00:02:22.170> get<00:02:22.470> really<00:02:22.740> into

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
ride back in the crowd get really into

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.320 
ride back in the crowd get really into
him<00:02:23.010> again<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.520> if<00:02:23.790> anything<00:02:23.970> they'll<00:02:24.240> be

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
him again and if anything they'll be

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.540

cheering right back over John Cena once

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.800 
cheering right back over John Cena once
again<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:27.090> think<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.570> all

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
again I just think that this is all

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.960 
again I just think that this is all
going<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.080> be<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.200> plan<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:29.040> leads<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.760> ride

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
going to be a plan that leads to ride

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.060 
going to be a plan that leads to ride
back<00:02:30.240> being<00:02:30.480> on<00:02:30.750> Team<00:02:31.020> Cena<00:02:31.050> but<00:02:31.740> that's<00:02:31.890> my

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
back being on Team Cena but that's my
