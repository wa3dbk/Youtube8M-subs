00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.090
 so back and 

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:15.089
 he 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:20.230
 No 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.810
 on 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.509
 out 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:26.969
 This is supposed to be quite good here with the iPad though maybe 

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:30.739
 not quite as nice as checked on the Haardter 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.739
 now where you can try something because we can under Lotti announces the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.430
 Magic and Ola do Divinity reversal that's what we do now 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.330
 four times 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.880
 Prof Take you is also called immediately and now you have to 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.380
 Either this leads to the setting for 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.150
 Lisbon young the stomach feather leads 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.150
 and can now here 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.120
 the parameters of the IC use control 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.200
 but that's a lot 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.140
 now must be here with mine 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.430
 to go through the keys with the corresponding parameters 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.310
 they can now choose something to the area 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.579
 Picture problems the new city hall you can already see that you open 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 Wiesner 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.050
 on 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.680
 m 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.680
 m 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.579
 and this really does not just work with the local clubs 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.530
 All Voss should have the plaques 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.300
 In this way taxes and even software instruments can be made 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.520
 we now 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.310
 then we would serve the door again first, that's all 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.460
 beautiful from the iPad 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.430
 go here on the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.430
 without a trace that you can not get them back together 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.380
 how exactly 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.320
 Automation off 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.310
 four times now 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.750
 9 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.409
 are the track 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.409
 either leads 

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:14.870
 and now I can too 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.229
 over the iPad 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.509
 the chicken desserts 1 full throttle 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:23.429
 The two times her appearance has been synonymous and it works the same way 

00:02:23.429 --> 00:02:26.479
 just with the regions you can here 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.479
 go through the different parameters 

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:32.619
 and then directly return taxes because of the filter 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.099
 to clarify with personnel questions 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.249
 however, directed 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:50.889
 Goma in 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.889
 and so on 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:57.799
 and that works 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.870
 also with others not only with the core and software instruments 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.569
 from the beginning of the really fine thing 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.509
 So who say that you are under Ludwig 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:11.719
 Zero had a similar range of functions as a real one 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.369
 Matic and show disadvantage is 

00:03:14.369 --> 00:03:15.709
 still is 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.729
 This whole for the operation me optimally because there are so easy 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:25.060
 Delay I have PrÃ¶ll the iPad is not always clear with the 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.230
 and percent Mac connected but an answer because it made connections 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:35.019
 there is in my opinion such a real mistake in any case always 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.579
 even more precise and better to tax, however 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.279
 Of course, Solmecke checks school already a bit 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:47.799
 Place if we do not have maybe the iPad alternative and what director 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.930
 Prof thanks to the Balkans is that they just take with us as wireless 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.930
 Remote control we do now too 

00:03:58.619 --> 00:04:04.369
 Soloist is the woman for our also come work and then wondering bar 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:08.089
 May in Ludwigsburg what come from taxes and always pulled along 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.589
 that's what they say is serious this is really a good application 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:12.839
 for the iPad 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:16.879
 and the way they software 7 the whole thing so wireless me courage control 

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:21.419
 to be able to use so in company Linus in the studio and in the singing career and 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.619
 then you can actually quite like them all the functions for recording 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
 remote control via wireless network 

00:04:29.819 --> 00:04:33.949
 Sometimes the Artists Erben software does not replace the GEMAC light 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:38.270
 Main because the control is not precise enough 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.580
 But that's a really great wireless controller 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.980
 as a remote control for the studio 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.289
 with really the most important features for smart Lubchenco 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:50.599
 the sound of it was fun watching overfly soon 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:52.039
 again on these stations 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.039
 Make Money Away with Near the Top Kilz 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.379
 my father is 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.379
 the software for the iPad the Azego 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:05.580
 that is not always say 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.870
 but it is small and light and with really great wireless remote control 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.529
 for Ludwig and cake 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.769
 how will you say Coach was now what was now what came NRWs 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.070
 and I hope to see you soon again on this station stiff 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:25.129
 that was single again 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.719
 he is a bishop
