00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.649
 you were here today I introduce you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.690
 again two psychological play style 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.610
 first of all a concept that many 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.530
 players do not know or at least 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.740
 seldom do you remember the creeping death 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.750
 song down in starcraft is the concept 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.669
 more obvious if I ask player 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.039
 why do you lose in minute 30 then 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.960
 the answer was often there at 12 o'clock 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.819
 bad colleague have the fact 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.980
 that you survived until minute 30 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:30.689
 Does not mean that while it's his 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.880
 win chance is convinced that 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.970
 seven times on purple to feel some 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.410
 then sometimes I want to 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:48.390
 normal colors come from the rule 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:50.220
 I just want fun with lines hey 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.020
 can draw with certainty certain 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.090
 Spain, of course, work well 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.420
 but when new handlebars sat in the meantime 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.430
 three tanks market twice in a row for 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.970
 theme plays and free all the time 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.710
 farm 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.000
 that was not good at all after that 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.009
 who lost the game before 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.659
 At all the camps has got even better 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.399
 if only one-time champion new 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.469
 orleans plays I needed myself 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:12.780
 wonder if your team go to Lake 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:14.969
 totally collapsing there you can still do so 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.579
 many understand that player sven 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:18.929
 Belgium lost you can use a jar with 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.030
 let a vague what he wants 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:25.109
 you are you are always made for that 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.030
 and to make a mighty ruckus on those 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:31.229
 the trains focus so badly 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.090
 Do you really believe that in me 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.740
 not bad and in that case only 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.899
 lost because we are not right in the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.520
 would have focus in some situations 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.409
 do not even go back to the game 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.579
 just accept it 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.710
 rather than worrying about a situation 

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:45.100
 to be upset already lost in advance 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.539
 was 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.950
 you should rather after the moment 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.229
 Search was creeping death 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.670
 has used and the superior what you think 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.350
 because it keeps doing better 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.810
 it will be interesting in the complete now 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.189
 so soon with the on lose is in 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.429
 You have to starcraft in such a situation 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.829
 to increase your risk further or further 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.630
 munchi's ford songs in new are available 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.670
 another goal of success 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.250
 does that make 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.530
 Are you, for example, 0 2 3 can you 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.599
 your risk x10 mini kidney and 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.549
 practically goes into the creeping death 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.530
 but wait in league of legends 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.079
 even the other players the whole 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:26.739
 play still turning when your 0 2 on 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:28.150
 the condition you can but now realize 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.890
 I agree again 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.069
 you are the type of team marshal 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.120
 teenager well then forget mister 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.700
 just what i said 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.890
 as soon as you feel sorry for this option 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.109
 no longer played together as a team 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.010
 and the creeping death gets you 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.930
 all together 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.880
 if your team is with children then 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.069
 rather use one of the fight some 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.840
 two money even if you do not help the 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.970
 the latter participate when the others 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.040
 three must appear attitude is clear 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.650
 come stop that team then 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.630
 you start to flame but only good each one 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.880
 rather these 20 are subject to man 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.139
 as you afterwards in the opponent at the mountains 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.030
 to watch battles 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.160
 and then I can be mine easy 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.190
 friend chance to have but there I would 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.200
 at least no plans for salt apply 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.299
 of course also situations or very good 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.620
 is not necessary and you better 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.290
 odds 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.730
 only experiences and self-reflection 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.079
 through here the right decisions 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.599
 to meet over the whole game 

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.519
 ultimately a matter of consideration one can not 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.349
 exactly say which situation is better 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.120
 is to play either way 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.000
 Two could say but from this video 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.010
 Firstly, the largest lateral system 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.409
 exist and both their pores night 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.120
 the better the understanding 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:40.750
 better i could be the right style for 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.150
 your situations choose second absolutely 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.040
 this is essential to your team at one 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.439
 strand pull tries your team too 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.629
 guide makes intelligible announcements and 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:51.519
 stay calm and have it 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.620
 understanding for when your team one 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.299
 other style chooses even if it is not 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.430
 even now it is up to you 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.470
 not to be from it 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.389
 whether you are right or not 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:04.230
 most important is that you play together 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:07.560
 and not against each other so with boris 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.560
 home away
