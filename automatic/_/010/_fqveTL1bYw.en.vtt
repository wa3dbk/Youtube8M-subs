00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.720
 here is the test michell again 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.819
 youtube and today I introduce you already 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.210
 even a small advantage but 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.210
 cheated 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.160
 it will be more of a little spontaneous 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.780
 video because the slackline just stops 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.789
 times there was and I thought the 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.150
 must now a technical or 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.369
 my youtube briefly introduce the 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.720
 slackline gives it as a donor us delicious 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.820
 set classics 13 versions to 41 81 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.920
 free shipping these are there 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.510
 still as a trio version 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.670
 then there would have to be a tree protection 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.390
 being with you is a bit more expensive 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.649
 that costs 25 eur 46 the link to 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.270
 Both products break again in the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.950
 text box and a video clip on it comes 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.000
 your direct information should be the link 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.410
 times you can not do that 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.300
 like to post in comments 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.710
 yes, here always the gibbon classic line 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.289
 By chance, I discovered my tested out 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.850
 Steinert had practiced there and 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.850
 Introduce the böschemer bit 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.180
 There are different lions on Amazon 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.630
 different strengths and strengths 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.690
 to dye 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.650
 this one now has 50 millimeters in the 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.210
 Width which leans 15 meters length 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.920
 You can for example trees and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.950
 wrap or now here with us at the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.950
 school on such a ray celebration 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.650
 that keeps it great here but the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.729
 quick closure there is already here 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.800
 about it you straight back 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:35.850
 and then he looks out of the line 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 as a tüv-seal maximum 50 centimeters 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.210
 height should you stretch the one and one 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:47.039
 should be a maximum of 150 kilos 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:49.200
 dish 25 tons and maximum load 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:51.289
 be four tons and have one here 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.500
 below a number 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.610
 You have to end the two first 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.550
 once here perform 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.470
 then do the same and then do it 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:07.190
 the one end here comes through the 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:09.000
 Quickly get started 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.509
 make sure that I do not 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.509
 twisted 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:25.760
 and then I'll just have it 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.260
 something like that does not sound like it 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.990
 it would be better to go further 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.330
 curious is that would be now now 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.590
 it does not go on anymore 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.020
 then this is folded up again and 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:40.360
 then the padding comes over it again 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.360
 so you do not hurt yourself 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.440
 the rest of the band you can then 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:52.660
 great in the tree or post 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.660
 Then you wrap the practice used 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.270
 so there's everything here again that 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.690
 thing between double page 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.430
 see 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:13.690
 Rada comes one of the holy three 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:13.690
 kings is perhaps the mood 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:25.940
 important to fix it is about five 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:29.180
 up to six carriers ahead is better 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:35.060
 the same confessed okay you said 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:37.570
 since september five months every second 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.630
 week y 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:45.410
 Now we have the gibbon for you 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.560
 so really presented a classic line 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:50.900
 great product who has interest 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.460
 the link to the post text with the 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.500
 Video clip on it comes directly formations 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.860
 that was again the test of youtube and 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.020
 then I thank ghosts 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.220
 missed marcel without a subscription mission 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.220
 but no further video
