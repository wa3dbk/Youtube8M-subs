00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.250
 hello friends because of the success of the 

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.650
 first part I have decided to continue my 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.020
 series of geas terex in videos 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.660
 this video will be exclusively of 

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.730
 astérix of sega games we started with 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.129
 a curious disaster of the video game of 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.170
 drink casting clip in the final phase of 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.630
 game give us to choose between three bosses 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.730
 to those who want to face us then 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.980
 well one of them is called bull steam 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.259
 see what anagram of blue steam see 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.070
 a game of the same creators where 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.230
 this same enemy appeared 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.290
 we continue with some curious references 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.480
 of the game bayonet as well you will know this 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.760
 game was created by platinum games for 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.340
 be so there are various references 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 to its classic games the currency of 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.830
 game are rings referring to 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.510
 the song series and when a new one appears 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.370
 type of enemy a book appears 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.650
 showing us his name and hierarchy 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.809
 within the army, because this is just 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.330
 what happens in the house of the dead 2 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.160
 before the battle against each boss in 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.230
 the game there is a motorcycle phase whose 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.210
 Background music is a remix of the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.570
 game after burner here I leave the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.570
 test 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.710
 and in a Martian Martian phase happens what 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.520
 same but with space harrier here they 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.520
 I leave the test 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.489
 we continue with a curious and aster axis 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.319
 Sonic and the secret rings remember 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.730
 of the stellar appearances of beagle 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:03.730
 data ansón and tambén hard 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.310
 and stay still at a specific point 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:13.080
 of certain 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.080
 although it usually happens in the vision 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:22.720
 and we do it well the camera 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.790
 to a pose the truth be astérix me 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.250
 scare me a little because you do not know how 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.290
 cojones has managed to get into the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.150
 world of the Arabian Nights' at 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.980
 better if he greets us is because he is 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.230
 asking for help because he wants to be 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.030
 let's get out but it's always so hidden 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.040
 that nobody will help him and he will stay 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.900
 stuck in this nightmare world by 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.599
 always never without being able to have 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.370
 fired from his beloved flower we continue 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.769
 with a curious asteroid on it 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.959
 adventure you can see that in the 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.120
 Sister theme is hidden a fragment 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:55.319
 of the theme of hydro city the song and 3par 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.319
 Here is the proof 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.660
 We continue with some curious and astérix of 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:37.009
 sonic and exclusive list of 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.289
 xbox 360 and ps3 versions if we go to the 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.570
 professor bestiary and we go to the 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.699
 description of the exlíder we will see that in 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.250
 the last paragraph says its structure 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:48.199
 robust reminds the good this is a 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.210
 reference or gives me since both 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.370
 they have the same body structure and 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.380
 can rotate on your waist if we 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.020
 we put in the teacher directory and 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.880
 Pajer city selected in the pass 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.919
 descriptions of citizens until 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.900
 you get to a reporter 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:05.120
 if you see the end of his description says 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.310
 who has written several books between 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.590
 they called one dreams the hedgehogs with 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.150
 electric eggs is a clear 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:12.979
 reference to the book of Philip K 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.560
 december dream the androids with 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.630
 electric sheep that was the inspiration 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.050
 for the well-known blade film 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.729
 runner 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.099
 to finish I'll mention some curious 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.830
 references of three romances of the 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:26.780
 dreamcast if we look closely every 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.539
 character of the game is based on a 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.849
 anime of goals different for example that 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.700
 fell is based on mazinger z 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.680
 It also has folding cuffs 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:38.690
 the protagonist of the story and his 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.760
 Grandpa is killed when he starts the mode 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.310
 history leaving you with this heritage 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.650
 robot the bixen is based on found 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.560
 I think it is not necessary to explain the 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:50.720
 why x of the drives are a mixture 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.240
 between vangioni ultraman for several 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.520
 reasons drive itself is not a robot 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.710
 but a humanoid alien capable of 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.350
 become a giant superhero and 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.960
 able to throw triangular rays just 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.370
 as ultraman and is similar to evangelion 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.010
 for its design and method of attack 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.450
 focused on the melee using 

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.520
 a spear as a projectile and 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.800
 occasionally a skewer that comes out of its 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.020
 hand the burst is based on the saga 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.600
 macro has been given the character of pilot 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.610
 a womanizer of city and the ability to 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.770
 the meccas of transforming into vehicles 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:24.680
 and the characteristic shape of the cabin 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.050
 the wingham robot is based on theft 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.510
 since they are two robots combinable at 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.580
 anime style mentioned the robot 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.610
 hard and is based on word of scotland 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.460
 since he is a robot swordsman target 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.110
 17 is based on ariel given its design and 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.880
 his apparent female sex 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.600
 guaita that is based 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.060
 one of the macro robots the hw r 00 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.150
 mk2 of straight monsters I think it 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.070
 they appreciate the similarities xd and finally 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.050
 bolón is based on vos bolón de 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.880
 mazinger z side his design and his 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.740
 conductive po lin has influence of 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.750
 anime and marvelous I add that 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.000
 both have a childish appearance but 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.830
 can become adults 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.380
 this resource is known as is 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:08.330
 progression but that's another story xd 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.030

 To the boy 

00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.870
