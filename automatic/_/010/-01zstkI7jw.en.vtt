00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 the land is still at the top three of the last time in the 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.020
 this year's fed stands this year for a second time 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.409
 actually martin's lola-mazda 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:09.459
 the state is one 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.499
 our strengths slow 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:14.889
 we can certainly again in communication 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.980
 with what weapons 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.980
 an exceptional evening on has arrived 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.140
 and there was debris elements of the railway went to paris 

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:28.539
 monday in the midst of these whale-watching which michael hall ravel to 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.590
 take off a car that is typing with incredible violence asked them yesterday to 

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:35.589
 the exit of the chicane dunlop 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.600
 practice what just happened to the car is completely destroyed and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.620
 especially the most serious the most serious of the elements have gone from each other 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.940
 side of the security barriers 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.150
 there is a need for safety the car number 58 the safety car 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.460
 which intervenes immediately silent 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.690
 dramatic probably it is necessary to remain silent it is necessary to wait 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.730
 it is the car of anthony beltoise which was retained what was in contact 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.370
 with 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.110
 the car is better 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.910
 axel in the matrix 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.370
 who did it all 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:11.950
 tivoly get back on his wheels 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.040
 but the car has completely dislocated 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.190
 and many elements his past on the other side of the rails 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.910
 look at euro that almost took away a reinforcement of edf 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.020
 we hold his breath and his breath and if obviously you always say 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.149
 that when we have 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:30.670
 this kind of image 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.100
 there are risks we are afraid 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.070
 our cars and moral interests and the car ended well on my 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.359
 skis 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:40.489
 finally it's anecdotal it's with an address that the elected alsace 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.430
 everything is destroyed 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.090
 we have seen disappear in front of the other who address the sail or we are at 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.810
 the crossroads of the law 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.810
 Tuesday the tension at home manual 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.850
 a priori a little what we know 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.540
 for them to show us these images I imagine and I hope there is no 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.439
 had wounded behind it's difficult security al-ahmad difficult 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.979
 German already has this temptation sap is a dream that one 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.439
 could have done what we have to a miracle 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.439
 happens to mans and adopting the risk he applauds 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:15.019
 after all happy to see his pilot spring 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:18.140
 but I have the impression I have this impression to go out not too much 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:19.050
 besides, 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.379
 barriers 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:23.510
 which would suggest to them that there were no injuries 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.409
 more behind the barriers and that's obviously all we want 

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.430
 going to see again jobless what's going on actually alain battisti is in 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.980
 train 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.000
 to overtake timo bernhard 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.260
 but at ferrari that of anthony beltoise 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.499
 he does not see he only sees an audi 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:38.879
 but at the last moment he takes his normal trajectory for these 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.469
 cars there he has no choice at the n-va that michel will not have been able to 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.180
 undo two cars at afp at once 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.660
 destabilized by the back he will cross he will fly over 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.180
 practically the gravel pit so a car that will arrive after high 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.209
 speed without decelerating all the emotion 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.010
 the doctors of the regions note in a car 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.059
 understood that 

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:04.299
 he could have also made a pilot certainly there are fed up we have the flesh of 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.249
 hen and a year like the hen 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:10.180
 saiva iraq because no one is hurt wesa on the side of the raïs 

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:13.599
 seemed to give on arrival it can also be so good bye to the wood 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.599
 sleeping or die the fate of his car 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:21.889
 but in Rome we were scared we were hot but finally it ends 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:23.199
 visibly good 

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:26.759
 luckily for everyone thankfully for this 79th edition of 

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:28.289
 24 hours of mans but audi 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:30.719
 now finds himself with two cars 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:34.069
 two cars occupying the first two places behind 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.949
 thus explained having made formal commitments when it is 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.769
 precisely already on the side of these auditions and young adults come al 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.699
 alam 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.219
 I'm sorry it's true that cars and batteries in numbers but here 

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.519
 we saw the animator michel jean-pierre 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.989
 the obligations 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.079
 region by region oracle long live courage and up 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:56.799
 the qatar scholarship was successful its debut to return in the order of 80 to 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:57.919
 hide 

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:00.369
 even if we saw these images we saw them 

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:03.509
 Well here we are going to leave each other and already on this first coup de theater 

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:08.759
 after 50 minutes in 16 hours in this 79th edition of the 24 hours of mans 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.930
 they will approach the total destruction of one of the audi 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.280
 which is the fact of avatar and actress number 3 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.370
 who will not win in this edition of the 24 hours of mans tom 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.850
 kristensen will not be on the charts for the ninth time in 11 innings ago 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.949
 obviously not two injured in this very violent road exit 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:30.039
 I remind you obviously that the 24 hours of mans continues in some 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.309
 moments on eurosport antenna we will now devote 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:36.619

00:04:40.869 --> 00:04:46.169
 canada we will return on the antenna of eurosport around 20:15 and he 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.139

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:59.399
 loss of points and fine
