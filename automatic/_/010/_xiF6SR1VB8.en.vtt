mini<00:00:16.110> video<00:00:16.320> guitar<00:00:16.830> lesson<00:00:17.220> we're<00:00:17.400> going<00:00:17.430> to

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
mini video guitar lesson we're going to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.820 
mini video guitar lesson we're going to
learn<00:00:17.670> bar<00:00:18.029> chords<00:00:18.480> now<00:00:18.960> if<00:00:19.260> you<00:00:19.380> remember<00:00:19.710> me

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
learn bar chords now if you remember me

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.400 
learn bar chords now if you remember me
telling<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.220> before<00:00:20.730> there's<00:00:21.150> two<00:00:21.480> ways<00:00:22.169> of

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
telling you before there's two ways of

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.079 
telling you before there's two ways of
playing<00:00:22.589> guitar<00:00:23.039> there's<00:00:23.400> rhythm<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:23.939> lead

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:24.089 
playing guitar there's rhythm and lead

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.509 
playing guitar there's rhythm and lead
and<00:00:24.480> rhythm<00:00:24.960> tends<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.650> be<00:00:25.769> chords<00:00:26.249> where

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
and rhythm tends to be chords where

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.069 
and rhythm tends to be chords where
you're<00:00:26.730> strumming<00:00:27.060> or<00:00:27.390> playing<00:00:27.630> more<00:00:27.929> than

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
you're strumming or playing more than

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:30.259 
you're strumming or playing more than
one<00:00:28.230> note<00:00:28.439> at<00:00:28.470> once<00:00:28.829> generally<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.730> lead

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
one note at once generally and lead

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.240 
one note at once generally and lead
tends<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.050> be<00:00:31.169> where<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:31.470> play<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.980> note<00:00:32.189> at

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
tends to be where you play one note at

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.220 
tends to be where you play one note at
once<00:00:32.550> where<00:00:32.970> you're<00:00:33.090> doing<00:00:33.300> solos<00:00:33.870> or

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
once where you're doing solos or

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.710 
once where you're doing solos or
melodies<00:00:34.800> or<00:00:35.090> improvising<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:36.510> usually

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
melodies or improvising you know usually

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.310 
melodies or improvising you know usually
using<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.440> scale<00:00:37.740> or<00:00:38.010> something<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.880> bar<00:00:39.870> chords

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
using a scale or something so bar chords

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.320 
using a scale or something so bar chords
definitely<00:00:40.890> fall<00:00:41.100> into<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.490> rhythm<00:00:41.640> category

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:42.330 
definitely fall into the rhythm category

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.930 
definitely fall into the rhythm category
because<00:00:42.870> they're<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> type<00:00:43.560> of<00:00:43.620> chords<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.550> if

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
because they're a type of chords and if

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.000 
because they're a type of chords and if
you<00:00:45.270> remember<00:00:45.990> earlier<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> course<00:00:46.830> we

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you remember earlier in the course we

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.560 
you remember earlier in the course we
learned<00:00:47.280> some<00:00:47.580> other<00:00:47.760> chords<00:00:48.150> we<00:00:48.270> learned<00:00:48.450> an

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
learned some other chords we learned an

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.070 
learned some other chords we learned an
E<00:00:48.690> and<00:00:48.990> a<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.980> D<00:00:50.400> and<00:00:50.790> a<00:00:51.030> G<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.690> learn<00:00:51.840> how<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
E and a a D and a G and we learn how to

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.230 
E and a a D and a G and we learn how to
strum<00:00:52.560> them<00:00:52.740> and<00:00:52.920> pick<00:00:53.100> them<00:00:53.130> and<00:00:53.760> we<00:00:54.090> also

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:54.240 
strum them and pick them and we also

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.360 
strum them and pick them and we also
learned<00:00:54.600> power<00:00:54.900> chords<00:00:55.410> richer<00:00:55.800> when<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.130> just

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
learned power chords richer when we just

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.610 
learned power chords richer when we just
hold<00:00:56.550> down<00:00:56.640> these<00:00:56.940> two<00:00:57.210> notes<00:00:57.480> at<00:00:57.660> once<00:00:57.690> so<00:00:58.590> I

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
hold down these two notes at once so I

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.470 
hold down these two notes at once so I
hope<00:00:59.010> you've<00:00:59.160> had<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.340> chance<00:00:59.580> to<00:00:59.760> practice<00:01:00.300> all

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
hope you've had a chance to practice all

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.480 
hope you've had a chance to practice all
that<00:01:00.720> and<00:01:00.900> I<00:01:00.930> hope<00:01:01.260> you've<00:01:01.470> really<00:01:01.980> memorized

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 
that and I hope you've really memorized

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.850 
that and I hope you've really memorized
it<00:01:02.700> all<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.240> play<00:01:03.450> easily<00:01:03.750> now<00:01:04.229> now

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it all and you can play easily now now

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.039 
it all and you can play easily now now
bar<00:01:05.159> chords<00:01:05.670> are<00:01:05.820> like<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> cross<00:01:06.450> between<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
bar chords are like a cross between the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.830 
bar chords are like a cross between the
two<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.920> in<00:01:08.579> the<00:01:08.909> same<00:01:09.119> way<00:01:09.329> that<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.539> move

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
two because in the same way that we move

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.539 
two because in the same way that we move
power<00:01:10.140> cords<00:01:10.530> around<00:01:10.649> we're<00:01:11.159> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.399> move

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
power cords around we're going to move

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.580 
power cords around we're going to move
the<00:01:11.700> bar<00:01:11.880> chords<00:01:12.299> around<00:01:12.600> but<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.380> does

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
the bar chords around but it does

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.289 
the bar chords around but it does
involve<00:01:13.920> strumming<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.969> strings

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
involve strumming all the strings

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.289 
involve strumming all the strings
usually<00:01:15.979> so<00:01:16.979> let<00:01:17.280> me<00:01:17.369> stop<00:01:17.579> talking<00:01:17.609> about<00:01:18.030> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
usually so let me stop talking about it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.910 
usually so let me stop talking about it
let<00:01:18.450> me<00:01:18.539> just<00:01:18.749> give<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.960> an<00:01:19.049> example<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.710> what

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
let me just give you an example of what

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:31.160 
let me just give you an example of what
these<00:01:20.039> bar<00:01:20.310> chords<00:01:20.640> look<00:01:20.819> like

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.560 

so<00:01:31.830> I<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.310> gather<00:01:32.549> from<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.299> bar

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
so I think you gather from that the bar

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.050 
so I think you gather from that the bar
chords<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> little<00:01:34.830> bit<00:01:35.070> more<00:01:35.640> complicated

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
chords are a little bit more complicated

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.450 
chords are a little bit more complicated
they<00:01:36.600> use<00:01:36.780> more<00:01:37.049> notes<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> result<00:01:38.189> of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
they use more notes and as a result of

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.920 
they use more notes and as a result of
that<00:01:38.549> it<00:01:38.880> means<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.330> can<00:01:39.479> play<00:01:39.689> more

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
that it means you can play more

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.929 
that it means you can play more
interesting<00:01:40.530> things<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.399> I<00:01:41.430> don't<00:01:41.700> want<00:01:41.880> you

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
interesting things but I don't want you

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.120 
interesting things but I don't want you
to<00:01:42.090> be<00:01:42.210> worried<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.920> two

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
to be worried really the the the two

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.560 
to be worried really the the the two
chords<00:01:44.490> i'm<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> show<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:44.970> today<00:01:45.090> which

chords i'm going to show you today which
a<00:01:45.869> minor<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.979> major<00:01:47.250> will<00:01:47.820> allow<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.509> play

bar<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.270> and<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.630> means<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.289> hold

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
bar on and what that means is to hold

bar on and what that means is to hold
down<00:02:01.710> all<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.189> strings<00:02:02.549> flat<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.509> we're

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
down all the strings flat and we're

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.430 
down all the strings flat and we're
going<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.929> do<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.200> at<00:02:04.259> fret<00:02:04.530> 7<00:02:05.659> so<00:02:06.659> what<00:02:07.350> you

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
going to do it at fret 7 so what you

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.109 
going to do it at fret 7 so what you
need<00:02:07.590> to<00:02:07.679> do<00:02:07.830> is<00:02:07.860> hold<00:02:08.250> down<00:02:08.340> with<00:02:08.610> plenty<00:02:09.090> of

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
need to do is hold down with plenty of

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.180 
need to do is hold down with plenty of
pressure<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.840> if<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.500> pluck<00:02:10.769> all<00:02:11.009> those

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
pressure and if you pluck all those

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.070 
pressure and if you pluck all those
strings<00:02:11.580> they<00:02:11.850> should<00:02:12.120> all<00:02:12.330> signed<00:02:12.630> crystal

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
strings they should all signed crystal

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.059 
strings they should all signed crystal
clear

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.399 

now<00:02:16.700> that<00:02:17.090> takes<00:02:17.359> a<00:02:17.540> lot<00:02:17.689> of<00:02:17.749> strength<00:02:18.170> from

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
now that takes a lot of strength from

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:19.869 
now that takes a lot of strength from
your<00:02:18.499> hands<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.069> to<00:02:19.189> be<00:02:19.280> honest<00:02:19.519> stop<00:02:19.670> he's

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:19.879 
your hands and to be honest stop he's

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.250 
your hands and to be honest stop he's
surprised<00:02:20.299> if<00:02:20.540> you<00:02:20.629> can<00:02:20.780> do<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.079> like<00:02:21.200> that

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
surprised if you can do it like that

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.679 
surprised if you can do it like that
first<00:02:21.829> time<00:02:22.159> it<00:02:22.609> usually<00:02:22.849> takes<00:02:23.209> people<00:02:23.299> a<00:02:23.540> lot

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:23.689 
first time it usually takes people a lot

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:25.300 
first time it usually takes people a lot
of<00:02:23.810> practice<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.260> build<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.769> strength<00:02:25.040> in

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
of practice to build the strength in

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.729 
of practice to build the strength in
their<00:02:25.430> fingers<00:02:25.909> and<00:02:26.090> and<00:02:26.659> also<00:02:27.230> just<00:02:27.439> to<00:02:27.560> get

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
their fingers and and also just to get

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.530 
their fingers and and also just to get
used<00:02:28.040> to<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.609> position<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.180> you<00:02:29.299> need<00:02:29.450> to

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
used to the position that you need to

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.420 
used to the position that you need to
have<00:02:29.749> your<00:02:29.840> hand<00:02:30.079> in<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.709> don't<00:02:30.950> worry<00:02:31.099> if<00:02:31.249> it's

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
not perfect straight away just try it

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.620 
not perfect straight away just try it
again

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
once you've got that bar on and is

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.950 
once you've got that bar on and is
signed<00:02:40.010> in<00:02:40.160> okay<00:02:40.520> we're<00:02:41.390> going<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.570> use<00:02:41.780> these

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
signed in okay we're going to use these

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.530 
signed in okay we're going to use these
two<00:02:42.230> fingers<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.770> form<00:02:43.190> a<00:02:43.400> minor<00:02:43.760> chord<00:02:44.150> and

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
two fingers to form a minor chord and

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.120 
two fingers to form a minor chord and
what<00:02:44.750> that<00:02:44.870> means<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.410> to<00:02:45.620> take<00:02:45.800> the<00:02:45.980> third

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
what that means is to take the third

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.190 
what that means is to take the third
finger<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.700> put<00:02:46.820> it<00:02:46.910> on<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.360> fifth<00:02:47.870> string<00:02:47.930> at

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
finger and put it on the fifth string at

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.960 
finger and put it on the fifth string at
fret<00:02:48.230> nine<00:02:48.590> and<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:49.340> little<00:02:49.490> finger<00:02:49.730> goes

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
fret nine and the little finger goes

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.550 
fret nine and the little finger goes
right<00:02:50.210> next<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.630> it<00:02:50.720> on<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.930> fourth<00:02:51.170> string<00:02:51.260> at

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
right next to it on the fourth string at

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.640 
right next to it on the fourth string at
fret<00:02:51.590> nine<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.640> now<00:02:52.990> you<00:02:53.990> can<00:02:54.170> also<00:02:54.290> look<00:02:54.530> at

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
fret nine so now you can also look at

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.100 
fret nine so now you can also look at
the<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:55.180> chord<00:02:56.180> chart<00:02:56.450> next<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.840> me<00:02:56.960> if<00:02:57.020> you

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
the the chord chart next to me if you

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.930 
the the chord chart next to me if you
just<00:02:57.290> want<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.500> clarify<00:02:57.710> that<00:02:58.220> so<00:02:58.790> I'm<00:02:58.910> going

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
just want to clarify that so I'm going

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.690 
just want to clarify that so I'm going
to<00:02:59.090> strum<00:02:59.330> all<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.600> strings<00:02:59.900> again

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.550 

and<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.420> can<00:03:04.569> hear<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.780> this<00:03:05.080> time<00:03:05.379> it

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
and you can hear that this time it

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.559 
and you can hear that this time it
sounds<00:03:05.800> like<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.950> proper<00:03:06.220> cord<00:03:06.610> now<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.270> is<00:03:07.510> a

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:07.569 
sounds like a proper cord now that is a

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.839 
sounds like a proper cord now that is a
minor<00:03:08.019> chord<00:03:08.410> because<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.250> only<00:03:09.489> using<00:03:09.819> two

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:09.849 
minor chord because it's only using two

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:12.150 
minor chord because it's only using two
fingers<00:03:10.239> if<00:03:10.720> we<00:03:11.200> were<00:03:11.319> to<00:03:11.470> put<00:03:11.650> our<00:03:11.800> middle

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
fingers if we were to put our middle

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.630 
fingers if we were to put our middle
finger<00:03:12.190> on<00:03:12.760> the<00:03:12.819> 3rd<00:03:13.300> string<00:03:13.330> at<00:03:13.930> fret<00:03:14.170> 8<00:03:14.800> that

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
finger on the 3rd string at fret 8 that

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.070 
finger on the 3rd string at fret 8 that
would<00:03:15.910> become<00:03:16.239> a<00:03:16.269> major<00:03:16.569> chord

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.320 

and<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.740> can<00:03:20.860> hear<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.460> sounds<00:03:21.880> happier

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
and you can hear that it sounds happier

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.210 
and you can hear that it sounds happier
you<00:03:22.720> know<00:03:22.840> generally<00:03:23.290> speaking<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.830> mine<00:03:24.010> is

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
you know generally speaking the mine is

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.270 
you know generally speaking the mine is
sound<00:03:24.460> sadder<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:26.650> major<00:03:26.860> sounds

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
sound sadder and the major sounds

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.230 
sound sadder and the major sounds
happier<00:03:28.290> okay<00:03:29.290> so<00:03:29.860> what<00:03:30.430> we've<00:03:30.580> got<00:03:30.610> here<00:03:30.820> at

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
happier okay so what we've got here at

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.400 
happier okay so what we've got here at
fret<00:03:31.510> 7<00:03:31.840> is<00:03:31.960> a<00:03:31.990> b-minor<00:03:32.470> chord<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.780> it's<00:03:34.990> B

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:35.410 
fret 7 is a b-minor chord and it's B

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.010 
fret 7 is a b-minor chord and it's B
minor<00:03:35.710> because<00:03:36.070> it's<00:03:36.490> at<00:03:36.610> fret<00:03:36.820> 7<00:03:37.240> if<00:03:37.420> we<00:03:37.840> were

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
minor because it's at fret 7 if we were

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.320 
minor because it's at fret 7 if we were
to<00:03:38.170> move<00:03:38.320> our<00:03:38.530> bar<00:03:38.830> down<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.400> fret<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.180> bar

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
to move our bar down to fret so the bar

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.260 
to move our bar down to fret so the bar
is<00:03:40.360> now<00:03:40.570> at<00:03:40.720> fret<00:03:40.930> 5<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.680> we<00:03:42.040> were<00:03:42.220> to<00:03:42.370> do<00:03:42.610> a

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
is now at fret 5 and we were to do a

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.630 
is now at fret 5 and we were to do a
major<00:03:44.110> chord<00:03:44.500> like<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.160> would<00:03:45.280> now<00:03:45.460> be

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
major chord like this that would now be

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.690 
major chord like this that would now be
in<00:03:45.670> a<00:03:45.940> shape<00:03:46.330> because<00:03:46.960> fret<00:03:47.260> 5<00:03:47.560> is<00:03:47.980> an<00:03:48.880> a<00:03:50.640> if<00:03:51.640> we

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
in a shape because fret 5 is an a if we

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.760 
in a shape because fret 5 is an a if we
were<00:03:52.090> to<00:03:52.240> move<00:03:52.390> down<00:03:52.630> two<00:03:52.870> more<00:03:53.050> frets<00:03:53.410> and

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 
were to move down two more frets and

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.670 
were to move down two more frets and
play<00:03:54.460> the<00:03:54.610> major<00:03:54.820> shape<00:03:55.150> like<00:03:55.570> that<00:03:55.780> we'd<00:03:56.560> have

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
play the major shape like that we'd have

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.620 
play the major shape like that we'd have
a<00:03:56.740> g<00:03:58.470> g<00:03:59.470> major<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.190> take<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.209> down<00:04:01.390> one<00:04:01.600> more

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
a g g major and take it down one more

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.540 
a g g major and take it down one more
fret<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.320> you've<00:04:02.470> now<00:04:02.709> got<00:04:02.770> f<00:04:03.280> sharp<00:04:03.640> major<00:04:05.550> so

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
fret and you've now got f sharp major so

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.980 
fret and you've now got f sharp major so
let<00:04:06.820> me<00:04:06.940> just<00:04:07.090> play<00:04:07.270> that<00:04:07.420> again<00:04:07.540> because<00:04:07.840> i

exactly<00:04:09.910> what<00:04:10.090> I'm<00:04:10.209> doing<00:04:10.240> this<00:04:10.990> first<00:04:11.410> shape

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
exactly what I'm doing this first shape

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.590 
exactly what I'm doing this first shape
is<00:04:11.770> at<00:04:11.890> fret<00:04:12.160> 7<00:04:12.580> with<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.880> bar<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.360> we're<00:04:13.450> just

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
is at fret 7 with the bar and we're just

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.050 
is at fret 7 with the bar and we're just
using<00:04:13.870> two<00:04:14.170> fingers<00:04:14.440> and<00:04:14.890> so<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.610> means<00:04:15.850> it's

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
using two fingers and so that means it's

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.780 
using two fingers and so that means it's
a<00:04:16.150> b-minor<00:04:16.720> because<00:04:17.200> b<00:04:17.410> is<00:04:17.590> fret<00:04:17.859> 7<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.519> two

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
a b-minor because b is fret 7 and two

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.520 
a b-minor because b is fret 7 and two
fingers<00:04:19.090> is<00:04:19.450> Molina<00:04:21.090> move<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.240> down<00:04:22.480> to<00:04:23.140> fret

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
fingers is Molina move it down to fret

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.500 
fingers is Molina move it down to fret
for<00:04:23.740> you<00:04:23.860> which<00:04:23.980> is<00:04:24.010> now<00:04:24.220> an<00:04:24.370> A<00:04:24.520> and<00:04:24.820> we're

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
for you which is now an A and we're

for you which is now an A and we're
going<00:04:25.630> to<00:04:25.660> include<00:04:26.020> the<00:04:26.320> middle<00:04:26.650> finger<00:04:27.070> and

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
going to include the middle finger and

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.980 
going to include the middle finger and
that<00:04:27.460> makes<00:04:27.669> it<00:04:27.790> a<00:04:27.880> major<00:04:28.120> so<00:04:28.480> we<00:04:28.630> don't<00:04:28.840> have

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
that makes it a major so we don't have

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.140 
that makes it a major so we don't have
to<00:04:29.230> say<00:04:29.380> major<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.890> can<00:04:30.040> just<00:04:30.220> say<00:04:30.400> a<00:04:30.669> or<00:04:30.940> you
