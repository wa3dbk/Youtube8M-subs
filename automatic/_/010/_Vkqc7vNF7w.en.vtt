00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
photographer I really can't be weighed

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.369 
photographer I really can't be weighed
down<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.390> much<00:02:09.599> equipment<00:02:10.200> so

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
down with just so much equipment so

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.070
