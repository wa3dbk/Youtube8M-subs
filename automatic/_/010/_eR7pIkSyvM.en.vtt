one<00:03:26.549> two<00:03:27.549> and<00:03:27.989> three<00:03:28.989> is<00:03:29.049> down<00:03:29.200> here<00:03:29.440> it's<00:03:29.950> a

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
one two and three is down here it's a

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.710 
one two and three is down here it's a
regular<00:03:30.610> braid<00:03:31.000> but<00:03:31.360> you're<00:03:31.510> gonna<00:03:31.600> be

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
regular braid but you're gonna be

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.380 
regular braid but you're gonna be
braiding<00:03:32.019> backwards<00:03:32.709> and<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:34.090> just<00:03:34.329> gives

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
braiding backwards and this just gives

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.150 
braiding backwards and this just gives
your<00:03:34.720> braid<00:03:35.049> a<00:03:35.079> different<00:03:35.560> texture<00:03:35.920> in<00:03:36.100> a

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
your braid a different texture in a

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.430 
your braid a different texture in a
different<00:03:36.459> feel<00:03:36.670> so<00:03:37.420> I<00:03:37.480> like<00:03:37.840> braiding<00:03:38.079> kind

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
different feel so I like braiding kind

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.050 
different feel so I like braiding kind
of<00:03:38.530> like<00:03:38.709> halfway<00:03:39.010> through<00:03:39.430> my<00:03:39.459> hairs<00:03:39.760> because

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
of like halfway through my hairs because

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.170 
of like halfway through my hairs because
it<00:03:40.180> gives<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.420> different<00:03:40.450> look<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:42.100> you<00:03:42.730> grab

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
it gives a different look so you grab

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.130 
it gives a different look so you grab
the<00:03:44.140> back<00:03:44.410> strand<00:03:44.980> of<00:03:45.250> the<00:03:45.760> braid<00:03:46.390> and<00:03:46.630> slide

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
the back strand of the braid and slide

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.700 
the back strand of the braid and slide
it<00:03:47.170> underneath

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
it underneath

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.400 
it underneath
and<00:03:48.860> you<00:03:49.670> do<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.030> same<00:03:50.060> with<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.960> forward

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
and you do the same with the forward

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.550 
and you do the same with the forward
strand<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.370> slide<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.730> underneath<00:03:53.560> and

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
strand and you slide it underneath and

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.000 
strand and you slide it underneath and
you<00:03:54.680> just<00:03:54.890> keep<00:03:55.070> doing<00:03:55.130> this<00:03:55.580> until<00:03:56.440> you<00:03:57.440> reach

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
you just keep doing this until you reach

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.960 
you just keep doing this until you reach
the<00:03:58.040> bottom<00:04:00.010> so<00:04:01.010> right<00:04:01.370> now<00:04:01.400> you<00:04:01.550> might<00:04:01.820> feel

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
the bottom so right now you might feel

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.750 
the bottom so right now you might feel
like<00:04:02.120> I<00:04:02.300> see<00:04:02.810> no<00:04:03.020> difference<00:04:03.290> if<00:04:03.980> I<00:04:04.280> can't<00:04:04.580> I'll

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
think that three bubbles work best even

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.170 
think that three bubbles work best even
for<00:05:16.540> if<00:05:16.660> you<00:05:16.810> want<00:05:17.020> to<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.850> create<00:05:18.850> another
