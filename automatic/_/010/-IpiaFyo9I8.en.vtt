cold it's winter time middle of February
I<00:01:50.670> suspect<00:01:51.660> the<00:01:51.780> waters<00:01:52.200> around<00:01:52.920> about<00:01:53.280> 4<00:01:53.820> or<00:01:53.850> 5

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
I suspect the waters around about 4 or 5

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.200 
I suspect the waters around about 4 or 5
degrees<00:01:54.800> so<00:01:55.800> we're<00:01:56.280> down<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.730> trying<00:01:57.030> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
degrees so we're down there trying to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.010 
degrees so we're down there trying to
catch<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.600> few<00:01:57.840> core<00:01:58.170> um<00:01:59.030> probably<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.420> method

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
catch a few core um probably the method

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.620 
catch a few core um probably the method
that<00:02:01.290> wins<00:02:01.530> more<00:02:02.520> matches<00:02:03.060> than<00:02:03.090> any<00:02:03.420> other

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
that wins more matches than any other

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.070 
that wins more matches than any other
method<00:02:03.930> during<00:02:04.920> this<00:02:05.100> time<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> month<00:02:05.900> time<00:02:06.900> of

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
method during this time a month time of

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.490 
method during this time a month time of
year<00:02:07.320> sorry<00:02:07.620> the<00:02:08.580> bombing<00:02:08.910> core<00:02:09.500> I'm

year sorry the bombing core I'm

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.290 
year sorry the bombing core I'm
suspecting<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.550> fishings<00:02:11.940> going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.209> be

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
suspecting that the fishings going to be

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.410 
suspecting that the fishings going to be
very<00:02:12.540> difficult<00:02:12.810> today<00:02:13.790> it<00:02:14.790> might<00:02:15.030> be<00:02:15.240> that

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
very difficult today it might be that

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.660 
very difficult today it might be that
you<00:02:15.959> know<00:02:16.110> we're<00:02:16.380> really<00:02:16.709> struggling<00:02:17.190> for<00:02:17.490> by

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
you know we're really struggling for by

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.350 
you know we're really struggling for by
so<00:02:18.150> if<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.020> situation<00:02:19.410> arises<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.910> I'll

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
so if that situation arises and I'll

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.460 
so if that situation arises and I'll
also<00:02:21.800> need<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:23.240> to<00:02:24.240> fish<00:02:24.420> with<00:02:24.630> another<00:02:24.990> method

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
also need to to fish with another method

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.620 
also need to to fish with another method
in<00:02:25.620> between<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.310> try<00:02:26.550> and<00:02:26.670> keep<00:02:26.820> fish<00:02:27.150> coming

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
in between to try and keep fish coming

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.320 
in between to try and keep fish coming
or<00:02:28.050> at<00:02:28.380> least<00:02:28.620> cut<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.920> few<00:02:29.340> decent<00:02:29.610> fish<00:02:30.090> for

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
or at least cut a few decent fish for

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.140 
or at least cut a few decent fish for
the<00:02:30.420> cameras<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:32.160> as<00:02:32.400> well<00:02:32.580> as<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.820> bombing

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
the cameras so as well as the bombing

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.350 
the cameras so as well as the bombing
cord<00:02:33.390> I'll<00:02:33.930> be<00:02:34.170> fishing<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.650> pole<00:02:35.330> quite<00:02:36.330> a

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
cord I'll be fishing the pole quite a

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.120 
cord I'll be fishing the pole quite a
long<00:02:36.660> pole<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.200> know<00:02:37.230> you<00:02:37.410> got<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.920> got

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
long pole you know you got you got

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.800 
long pole you know you got you got
remember<00:02:38.550> that<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.760> fish<00:02:38.970> go<00:02:39.180> out<00:02:39.360> towards

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
remember that the fish go out towards

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.170 
remember that the fish go out towards
the<00:02:39.900> middle<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.350> lake<00:02:40.560> in<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:40.980> winter<00:02:41.400> so

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
the middle of the lake in the winter so

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.330 
the middle of the lake in the winter so
obviously<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:43.170> need<00:02:43.320> two<00:02:43.560> lengths<00:02:43.800> there<00:02:44.130> to

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
obviously you need two lengths there to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.820 
obviously you need two lengths there to
try<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.730> get<00:02:44.910> near<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.390> fish<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.110> I<00:02:46.620> also

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
try and get near the fish and I also

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.910 
try and get near the fish and I also
show<00:02:47.370> you<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:48.060> best<00:02:48.300> ways<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.920> feeding

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
show you the the best ways of feeding

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.960 
show you the the best ways of feeding
and<00:02:50.550> presenting<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.300> bait<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:52.250> so<00:02:53.250> I'm

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
and presenting the bait on that so I'm

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.210 
and presenting the bait on that so I'm
going<00:02:54.209> to<00:02:54.269> quickly<00:02:54.450> strip<00:02:55.200> this<00:02:55.350> rig<00:02:55.620> down<00:02:55.890> and

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
going to quickly strip this rig down and

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.670 
going to quickly strip this rig down and
say<00:02:56.730> all<00:02:56.970> from<00:02:57.269> scratch<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:58.260> show<00:02:58.410> you

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
say all from scratch and show you

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.710 
say all from scratch and show you
exactly<00:02:58.950> how<00:02:59.610> I<00:02:59.850> use<00:03:00.030> it

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.570 

well<00:03:03.720> these<00:03:03.900> fish<00:03:04.260> really<00:03:04.560> are<00:03:04.860> turning<00:03:05.430> on

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
well these fish really are turning on

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.970 
well these fish really are turning on
now<00:03:06.860> in<00:03:07.860> fact<00:03:08.220> I'm<00:03:08.549> quite<00:03:08.760> surprised<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.980> the

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
now in fact I'm quite surprised that the

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.780 
now in fact I'm quite surprised that the
time<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.519> year<00:03:12.350> now<00:03:13.350> called<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.950> waters<00:03:14.430> and

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
time of year now called the waters and

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.520 
time of year now called the waters and
and<00:03:15.150> everything<00:03:16.140> else

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
and everything else

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.330 
and everything else
the<00:03:16.890> fish<00:03:17.100> are<00:03:17.250> turning<00:03:17.700> on<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.090> quick

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.910 

must<00:03:25.180> have<00:03:25.360> something<00:03:25.660> to<00:03:25.900> do<00:03:26.140> with<00:03:26.170> he

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
must have something to do with he

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.600 
must have something to do with he
started<00:03:27.400> off<00:03:27.550> quite<00:03:27.730> cloudy<00:03:28.270> today<00:03:28.870> did<00:03:29.170> but

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
started off quite cloudy today did but

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.309 
started off quite cloudy today did but
as<00:03:30.610> you<00:03:30.850> can<00:03:31.000> see<00:03:31.240> now<00:03:31.480> the<00:03:31.630> sun's<00:03:31.930> come<00:03:32.200> out

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
as you can see now the sun's come out

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.580 
as you can see now the sun's come out
winds<00:03:32.800> picked<00:03:33.100> up<00:03:33.280> slightly<00:03:34.140> still<00:03:35.140> really

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
winds picked up slightly still really

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.250 
winds picked up slightly still really
cold<00:03:35.830> but<00:03:36.280> I<00:03:36.610> think<00:03:37.390> it's<00:03:37.600> just<00:03:37.780> been<00:03:38.020> enough

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
cold but I think it's just been enough

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.790 
cold but I think it's just been enough
to<00:03:38.470> raise<00:03:38.650> the<00:03:38.890> temperature<00:03:39.100> a<00:03:40.380> degree<00:03:41.380> or<00:03:41.560> so

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
to raise the temperature a degree or so

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.530 
to raise the temperature a degree or so
fine<00:03:44.800> quite<00:03:45.310> well<00:03:45.610> we<00:03:45.730> don't<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.180> want<00:03:46.420> to

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
fine quite well we don't really want to

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.470 
fine quite well we don't really want to
leave<00:03:46.720> where<00:03:47.080> I<00:03:47.470> hope<00:03:48.280> the<00:03:48.520> fish<00:03:48.760> which<00:03:49.270> isn't

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
leave where I hope the fish which isn't

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.290 
leave where I hope the fish which isn't
really<00:03:49.900> what<00:03:50.080> you<00:03:50.230> want<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.650> know<00:03:51.090> unless<00:03:52.090> you

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
really what you want you know unless you

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.410 
really what you want you know unless you
got<00:03:52.510> fish<00:03:52.900> fighting<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:54.370> get<00:03:54.520> away<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:55.030> the<00:03:55.209> pit

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
got fish fighting to get away in the pit

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.240 
got fish fighting to get away in the pit
in<00:03:55.600> the<00:03:55.630> in<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.290> area<00:03:56.709> where<00:03:56.890> you've<00:03:57.070> been

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
in the in the area where you've been

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.640 
in the in the area where you've been
loose<00:03:57.519> feeding<00:03:58.150> then<00:03:58.360> there's<00:03:59.050> a<00:03:59.140> chance<00:03:59.440> of

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
loose feeding then there's a chance of

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.500 
loose feeding then there's a chance of
it<00:03:59.800> spooking<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.550> others<00:04:00.760> so<00:04:01.030> it's<00:04:01.180> best<00:04:01.390> to

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
it spooking the others so it's best to

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.130 
it spooking the others so it's best to
try<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:01.840> get<00:04:02.050> the<00:04:02.230> fish<00:04:02.670> out<00:04:03.670> of<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:04.150> target
