breaking down the top layer of the clear

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:24.220 
breaking down the top layer of the clear
coat<00:03:21.560> that's<00:03:21.740> on<00:03:21.950> there<00:03:22.250> which<00:03:22.850> it<00:03:23.150> has<00:03:23.360> the

light little circular motion to get that

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.840 
light little circular motion to get that
out<00:03:41.260> and<00:03:42.260> again<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.680> same<00:03:42.890> way<00:03:42.920> you'll<00:03:43.580> use
