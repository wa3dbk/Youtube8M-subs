um yeah so what I've been using is for

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.000 
um yeah so what I've been using is for
this<00:01:11.460> these<00:01:11.909> are<00:01:12.060> meant<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.360> kind<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:13.010> basis

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
this these are meant to kind of be basis

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.450 
this these are meant to kind of be basis
um<00:01:14.600> if<00:01:15.600> you're<00:01:16.140> using<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.530> as<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> base<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.280> use

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
um if you're using it as a base just use

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.730 
um if you're using it as a base just use
a<00:01:17.490> little<00:01:17.610> bit<00:01:18.030> because<00:01:18.180> they<00:01:18.479> are<00:01:18.600> very

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
a little bit because they are very

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.899 
a little bit because they are very
creamy<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:21.600> crease<00:01:22.490> but<00:01:23.490> i've
