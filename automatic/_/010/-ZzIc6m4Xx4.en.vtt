of<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.230> cut<00:02:12.410> crease<00:02:12.440> but<00:02:12.890> it's<00:02:13.040> going<00:02:13.160> to<00:02:13.250> be

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
of a cut crease but it's going to be

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.950 
of a cut crease but it's going to be
more<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.580> like<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.820> smoky<00:02:15.430> type<00:02:16.430> cut<00:02:16.700> crease<00:02:16.960> so

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
more of like a smoky type cut crease so

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.720 
more of like a smoky type cut crease so
I'm<00:02:18.050> going<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.260> follow<00:02:18.530> along<00:02:18.950> what<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.340> did<00:02:19.580> on

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
I'm going to follow along what I did on

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:33.040 
I'm going to follow along what I did on
the<00:02:19.850> other<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.060> just<00:02:20.480> a<00:02:20.600> little<00:02:20.900> match

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.300 

this<00:02:33.620> doesn't<00:02:33.830> have<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.130> be<00:02:34.280> perfect<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:36.310> it's

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
this doesn't have to be perfect and it's

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.250 
this doesn't have to be perfect and it's
probably<00:02:37.700> going<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.000> have<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.150> be<00:02:38.420> not<00:02:38.750> exactly

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
probably going to have to be not exactly

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.930 
probably going to have to be not exactly
the<00:02:39.440> same<00:02:41.830> because<00:02:42.830> my<00:02:43.010> eyes<00:02:43.190> aren't<00:02:43.490> exactly

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
the same because my eyes aren't exactly

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:53.290 
the same because my eyes aren't exactly
the<00:02:44.060> same<00:02:48.910> okay<00:02:51.430> so<00:02:52.430> once<00:02:52.610> you<00:02:52.730> got<00:02:52.850> your<00:02:52.970> line

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.300 
the same okay so once you got your line

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.880 
the same okay so once you got your line
there<00:02:55.750> we're<00:02:56.750> going<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:56.930> take<00:02:57.110> more<00:02:57.350> shadow

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.330 

we're<00:03:00.890> going<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.040> fill<00:03:01.400> it<00:03:01.520> in<00:03:01.640> a<00:03:01.940> little

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
we're going to fill it in a little

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.440 
we're going to fill it in a little
darker<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:07.670> you're<00:03:07.820> going<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.090> go<00:03:08.210> up<00:03:08.330> a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
darker and you're going to go up a

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.620 
darker and you're going to go up a
little<00:03:08.570> higher<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:10.400> this<00:03:11.090> doesn't<00:03:11.300> have<00:03:11.570> to

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
little higher and this doesn't have to

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.330 
little higher and this doesn't have to
