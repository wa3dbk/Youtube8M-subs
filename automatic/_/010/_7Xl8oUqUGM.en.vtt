00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
let's open up unity and model

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.490 
let's open up unity and model
development<00:00:11.960> and<00:00:12.960> let's<00:00:13.139> just<00:00:13.320> start

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
development and let's just start

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.790 
development and let's just start
commenting<00:00:18.109> so<00:00:19.109> we<00:00:19.199> start<00:00:19.439> off<00:00:19.529> with<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
commenting so we start off with the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:37.220 
commenting so we start off with the
class<00:00:20.400> name<00:00:22.100> and<00:00:23.100> then<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.640> date<00:00:28.099> the<00:00:29.099> author

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.110 

and<00:00:38.230> then<00:00:38.380> a<00:00:38.410> description<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:42.790> class

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
and then a description this class

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.820 
and then a description this class
contains<00:00:44.130> all<00:00:45.130> the<00:00:46.530> extra<00:00:49.530> methods<00:00:50.530> or

either some sort of scroll or at home or
maybe<00:01:30.910> talk<00:01:31.240> to<00:01:31.479> some<00:01:31.810> sort<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.050> MPC<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:32.710> will

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
maybe talk to some sort of MPC that will

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.430 
maybe talk to some sort of MPC that will
train<00:01:33.100> them<00:01:33.250> but<00:01:34.090> that's<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.810> variables<00:01:35.200> for

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
train them but that's that variables for

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:55.249 
train them but that's that variables for
a<00:01:41.039> boolean<00:01:42.179> variable<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:46.119> toggle

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:05.600 

fake<00:01:56.259> charcter<00:01:57.780> knows<00:01:58.780> a<00:02:00.509> skill

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.910 

so<00:02:06.240> your<00:02:06.390> basic<00:02:06.720> setter<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:07.230> your<00:02:07.620> basic

so your basic setter or your basic

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.790 
so your basic setter or your basic
constructor<00:02:08.850> and<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:10.259> course<00:02:10.440> I'm<00:02:10.590> going<00:02:10.740> to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
constructor and of course I'm going to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.530 
constructor and of course I'm going to
add<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.370> debug<00:02:11.910> statement<00:02:17.270> guess<00:02:18.270> what<00:02:18.420> it's

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
add a debug statement guess what it's

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.780 
add a debug statement guess what it's
called<00:02:18.750> or<00:02:19.560> get<00:02:19.830> some<00:02:19.980> sky<00:02:20.220> output<00:02:22.790> that's

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
called or get some sky output that's

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
called or get some sky output that's
right<00:02:25.670> okay<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.850> everything<00:02:27.210> else<00:02:27.360> I'm<00:02:27.630> just

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
setting all the default values okay now

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.820 
setting all the default values okay now
i<00:02:34.260> have<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.500> getter<00:02:34.740> and<00:02:34.830> setter<00:02:35.040> for<00:02:35.700> no<00:02:36.330> one

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
i have a getter and setter for no one

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:45.690 
i have a getter and setter for no one
nothing<00:02:37.830> special<00:02:38.040> here

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.540 

ok

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
ok

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.840 
ok
so<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.270> skill<00:02:49.600> names<00:02:50.730> this<00:02:51.730> enumeration<00:02:52.500> is

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
so the skill names this enumeration is

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:01.520 
so the skill names this enumeration is
just<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:56.400> list<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:58.710> spell<00:02:59.710> it<00:02:59.740> right<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.160> skills<00:03:00.970> a

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
just a list I spell it right of skills a

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:09.900 
just a list I spell it right of skills a
player<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:03.720> or<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:08.620> again<00:03:09.460> you<00:03:09.490> can<00:03:09.610> add<00:03:09.820> as

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
many skills as you want just make sure

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.110 
many skills as you want just make sure
the<00:03:11.500> last<00:03:11.710> one<00:03:11.950> doesn't<00:03:12.070> have<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.340> comma<00:03:12.640> after

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
the last one doesn't have a comma after

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.580 
the last one doesn't have a comma after
it<00:03:13.600> and<00:03:15.030> that's<00:03:16.030> it<00:03:16.270> for<00:03:16.540> our<00:03:16.600> skills<00:03:17.200> class

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
it and that's it for our skills class

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.090 
it and that's it for our skills class
I'll<00:03:18.040> see<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:18.520> the<00:03:18.610> next<00:03:18.730> video
