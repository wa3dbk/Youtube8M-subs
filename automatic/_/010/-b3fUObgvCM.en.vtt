00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.190
 the ingredients that we are going to use 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.049

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.429
 vegetable three eggs and one can or 450 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.170
 grams of pumpkin puree first thing 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.250
 what we have to do is integrate the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.250
 sugar with eggs 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.329
 Y 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.530
 we started to beat at medium speed 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.260
 we incorporate sugar and vanilla 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.280
 and the vegetable oil in the form of thread 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.469
 and finally the pumpkin puree 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.729
 at low speed we incorporate the flour 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.729
 little by little 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.380
 the bicarbonate 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.500
 cinnamon and nutmeg 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.590
 yes 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.630
 and we beat until we get a mixture 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.630
 homogeneous 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.080
 once our ingredients are 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.640
 incorporated we are going to pour the mixture in 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.780
 a previously greased mold and 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.709

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.900
 bake it at 180 degrees celsius from 50 to 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.900
 60 minutes 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.450
 once our cake left the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:47.090

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.970
 that it is to rest at least 45 minutes 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.410
 before demolding the last thing we're going to 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.410

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.519

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.220
 i 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:14.180
