00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.139
 and very slow guys are burning we're 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.460
 as always week 50 from the south in 

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:10.280
 these historical recommendations 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.750
 available this week a little late I 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.400
 I apologize that you the truth is that 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.710
 good honestly it's the week 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.539
 I do not know what they will be looking for 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.730
 I would still be interested in surfing 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.990
 comments if you can let me gun 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.850
 they are still looking with you from 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.590
 Surf this weekly or they expect you 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.180
 bring to comment your collision but 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.070
 good in that it is south in the 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.010
 Hall of the Guardians on this occasion 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.440
 the truth is that as I say of the 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.179
 last week I do not think it surprises us 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.210
 but peking a part of good things 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:41.690
 we have the return helmet of the titan 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.089
 It has 172 disciplines of intellect and 57 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.479
 of discipline a good your majesty is 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.370
 a 127 which is good in helmet like 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:51.049
 you know has the ability to prevent and 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.789
 health that allows you to activate unstoppable 

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:55.100
 in the fist of soap on the titan's 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.319
 assault and he also has this infusion 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.239
 recover life by collecting the virus and 

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:00.409
 sum invested to recover more in 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.139
 super energy kill enemies of the 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.949
 darkness is a good helmet is not of the 

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:06.539
 Titan's best aesthetics 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.180
 nothing more if they want to have the skill 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:11.579
 in the active assailant and at the same time have 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.429
 the shoulder load in the same column 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.020
 but the rest is not that much not 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.689
 we have the mask between his name as 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.610
 you know this acrobat of the cutting edge makes 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.350
 you can use super for more time and 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.689
 that the less super gas attacks 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.149
 Perez energy has very low intellect 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.560
 since up to 102 could reach 130 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.390
 or even more if I'm not wrong and the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.090
 truth is that by the states they are very 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.759
 low on this occasion then we have this 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.319
 the fire star protocol if I do not 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.439
 wrong them 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:43.619
 130 intellect is very low for chest 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.689
 can reach up to 180 to 190 this 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.880
 allows loading of a second Granada 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.500
 fusion in the solar sorcerer but I do not know 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.329
 accumulates with the ability to load two 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.920
 grenades so it would be like that load 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.920
 two fusion grenades which is the third 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.630
 of those subclasses and have let's say that 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.789
 that ability to use another skill 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.110
 from that column as I tell you by the 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:03.599
 I do not recommend this much in this 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.090
 occasion we have the weapon of the Lord of the 

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:09.060
 excellent thunder submachine gun is one of 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.069
 the heavy weapons confirmed that 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.709
 will have an improved version in 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.060
 the possessed ones so if they lack or 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.370
 they want a spare something like that 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.739
 I recommend that you get it, I do not know 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.900
 buy for 17th I would need if I did not 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.760
 wrong is what they cost if 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.709
 let's say that having it already safe for 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.060
 when the expansion is made we do not know 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.650
 what other weapons are going to have a version 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.879
 or we know of some we know 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.469
 which ones are they all have a 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:33.629
 improved version on radio the possessed 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.030
 but the heavy ones are confirmed 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.290
 this i launches tells the truth so that 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.169
 I recommend that they have it if it makes them 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.700
 missing then we have exotic fragment in 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:43.530
 chest of grass between speck of light as 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.049
 always one thing that I'll say 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.969
 is that now the cce the speck of light and the 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.370
 mona is strange if she has nothing 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.569
 buy by necessity to ourense the 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.609
 once it comes out of expansion since 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.569
 we are going to need more than before 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.810
 over all light specks 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.250
 they will have the use of being able to be used for 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.469
 as consumables to raise the 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.569
 experience and improve weapons armor 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.969
 as I understand it as always 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.930
 curious riff automatic re pulse and 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:11.370
 telemetry of this rocket launcher the 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.139
 curious are going to work on the clock 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.699
 possessed and you will see yourself simply one 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:15.780
 for primary one for secondary for 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.150
 heavy 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.190
 one for each type of weapon we have 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.800
 impulse of webber and plasma and emerald 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.470
 five heavy ammunition for one 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.450
 expertise I understand that once you 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.430
 pÃ³sitos is attacked south will increase 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.590
 the price of gold will reduce the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.540
 amount of heavy ammunition that gives you 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.550
 for strange coins so I'm not 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.050
 sure of this but just in case if 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.690
 they need heavy ammunition to buy it 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.370
 at this time they are cheap then and 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.930
 finally as always exchange 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.090
 this two strange coins for a speck 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.510
 of light so with the guys this is your 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.550
 week 50 have passed 50 weeks since 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.530
 that came out the first time this his 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.390
 weekly on the sting and almost 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.550
 we come to week 54 that is going to be 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.709
 let's say that the first week of surfing in 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.540
 the king of the possessed and nothing this has 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:05.330
 been all by study guys a greeting to 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.330
 all feel and until next 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.290
 ah
