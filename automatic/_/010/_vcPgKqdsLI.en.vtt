bow is made to hunt your thoughts on it
I<00:00:36.149> think<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.989> price<00:00:37.140> point<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.680> you're

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
I think for the price point that you're

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.260 
I think for the price point that you're
probably<00:00:38.010> looking<00:00:38.340> about<00:00:38.399> five<00:00:38.760> six<00:00:39.030> hundred

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
probably looking about five six hundred

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.270 
probably looking about five six hundred
bucks<00:00:39.420> there's<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:40.140> lot<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.500> adjustability<00:00:40.950> on

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
bucks there's a lot of adjustability on

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.310 
bucks there's a lot of adjustability on
this<00:00:41.550> bow<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> mean<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.149> goes<00:00:42.270> from<00:00:42.450> 40<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.989> 70

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
this bow I mean it goes from 40 to 70

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.560 
this bow I mean it goes from 40 to 70
problems<00:00:43.710> without<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.950> new<00:00:44.129> cam<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:45.360> you

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
problems without a new cam I think you

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.600 
problems without a new cam I think you
can<00:00:45.690> even<00:00:45.809> adjust<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.770> draw<00:00:46.980> length<00:00:47.219> on<00:00:47.430> it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
can even adjust the draw length on it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.850 
can even adjust the draw length on it
and<00:00:48.000> it'll<00:00:48.450> probably<00:00:48.629> be<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:48.930> good<00:00:49.260> bow

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and it'll probably be a really good bow

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.189 
and it'll probably be a really good bow

line<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.700> see<00:01:08.850> from<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> riser<00:01:09.360> it's

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
line as you can see from the riser it's

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.480 
line as you can see from the riser it's
got<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> beauty<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.770> Prime<00:01:11.040> it's<00:01:11.280> almost

got the beauty of the Prime it's almost
getting<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.060> prime<00:01:12.330> riser<00:01:12.630> has<00:01:13.560> plastic

getting to that prime riser has plastic

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.240 
getting to that prime riser has plastic
pockets<00:01:15.689> whereas<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> prime<00:01:16.830> will<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.100> like

great idea too with this boat because I

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.069 
great idea too with this boat because I
mean<00:03:57.010> anywhere<00:03:57.640> from<00:03:57.790> 40<00:03:58.150> to<00:03:58.180> 70<00:03:58.600> pounds<00:03:59.019> you

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
could give it to it you know a younger

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.340 
could give it to it you know a younger
shooter<00:04:00.760> even<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.510> shooter<00:04:01.810> doesn't<00:04:02.049> shoot

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
shooter even a shooter doesn't shoot

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.170 
shooter even a shooter doesn't shoot
that<00:04:02.500> much<00:04:02.739> and<00:04:03.010> pass<00:04:03.430> along<00:04:03.700> to<00:04:03.880> somebody

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
that much and pass along to somebody

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.970

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
else so it's a really good idea yeah I

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.620 
else so it's a really good idea yeah I

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 
think they went with this I think the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.750
