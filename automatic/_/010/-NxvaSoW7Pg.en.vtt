00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
today what I do have is not so much

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.120 
today what I do have is not so much
people<00:00:28.529> mover<00:00:29.069> as<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> people<00:00:29.789> remover<00:00:30.919> it<00:00:31.919> is

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130

this<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:33.630> bins<00:00:33.930> purse<00:00:35.270> so<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.390> question<00:00:36.750> is

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
this the bins purse so the question is

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.560 
this the bins purse so the question is
will<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.890> drift<00:00:38.040> if<00:00:38.460> you're<00:00:39.150> going<00:00:39.240> to<00:00:39.330> go<00:00:39.420> out

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
will it drift if you're going to go out

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.750 
will it drift if you're going to go out
in<00:00:39.690> style<00:00:39.840> then<00:00:40.830> it's<00:00:40.980> hard<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.340> imagine<00:00:41.520> doing

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
in style then it's hard to imagine doing

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.660 
in style then it's hard to imagine doing
so<00:00:42.240> in<00:00:42.630> anything<00:00:43.320> more<00:00:43.500> appropriate<00:00:44.070> than<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
so in anything more appropriate than the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.980 
so in anything more appropriate than the
bins<00:00:46.430> it's<00:00:47.430> based<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.000> Mercedes<00:00:48.150> e-class

I promise now they would you like some
light<00:01:29.000> drifting<00:01:29.600> towards<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.110> underworld<00:01:30.530> or

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
light drifting towards the underworld or

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.669 
light drifting towards the underworld or
the<00:01:31.399> full<00:01:31.580> treatment<00:01:31.990> whole<00:01:32.990> nine<00:01:33.200> yards<00:01:33.560> you

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
the full treatment whole nine yards you

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:49.370 
the full treatment whole nine yards you
say<00:01:33.890> right

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.350 

let's<00:01:50.380> see<00:01:50.590> that<00:01:50.620> again<00:01:51.100> in<00:01:51.360> gratuitous

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
let's see that again in gratuitous

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:03.340 
let's see that again in gratuitous
slow-motion

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.530 

this<00:02:04.350> may<00:02:04.560> seem<00:02:04.620> a<00:02:05.070> little<00:02:05.400> twisted<00:02:06.120> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
this may seem a little twisted to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.090 
this may seem a little twisted to
observe<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.920> thing<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.310> actually<00:02:09.860> dead<00:02:10.860> easy

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
observe this thing is actually dead easy

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.910 
observe this thing is actually dead easy
to<00:02:11.490> drift<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.690> massive<00:02:13.170> wheel<00:02:13.350> base<00:02:13.590> means

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
to drift the massive wheel base means

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.350 
to drift the massive wheel base means
that<00:02:14.070> everything<00:02:14.340> happens<00:02:14.640> really<00:02:14.670> slowly

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
that everything happens really slowly

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.360 
that everything happens really slowly
and<00:02:16.170> there's<00:02:16.320> actually<00:02:16.680> enough<00:02:16.860> power<00:02:17.160> to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
and there's actually enough power to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.180 
and there's actually enough power to
keep<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.640> baptized<00:02:18.090> knit<00:02:18.680> so<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.710> question

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
keep the baptized knit so the question

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.150 
keep the baptized knit so the question
was<00:02:20.430> will<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.180> drift<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.860> answer<00:02:23.280> is

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.220 

you
