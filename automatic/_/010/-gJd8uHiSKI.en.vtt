00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.690

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.750
 Argentina in terms of after sales look 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.750

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.300

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.329
 partner of the supervisor of kia motors 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:37.520
 Good Argentina at this time what 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.360
 we're going to do is present the new one 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.010
 new product that we are bringing 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.019
 argentina which is the new picanto 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.519
 we are bringing two versions the 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.670
 four-speed automatic version 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:50.399
 and the five-speed manual version 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.739
 It is completely a new product from 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:56.760
 the design until the motorization the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.920
 motorization is 1.2 mp and has 86 hp to 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:04.309
 6,000 revolutions per minute and a couple 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.309
 maximum of 12.2 meters of torque 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.960
 of what the equipment is what 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.760
 we treat from between the two 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.880
 versions that there is not much difference 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.840
 of equipment 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.300
 basically what security has to 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.840
 electronic stability control 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.240
 esp in the automatic version comes from 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.090
 cpi in the manual version does not bring the cp 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.350
 then in the rest of the versions in 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.290
 the rest the equipment of what 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.230
 security is the same has double airbag 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.950
 and what changes in some measures is the 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:41.310
 theme of the rims the theme of the headlights 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.170
 look for footprints and in the mirrors with the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.480
 winks that in one version the other and in 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.620
 another version does not usually bring it 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.710
 equipped version in what is 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.810
 equipment the manual version is the one 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:56.430
 comes more equipped with the system of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.630
 headlights look for footprints and what is the 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.630
 videos are the rear view mirrors 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.040
 as you will know kia motors has a 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.810
 head of design in which he has changed 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.160
 all the product identity and 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.320
 just what he does with the new 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.670
 picanto is that it is one of the models that 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.150
 it was necessary to include the family of 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.549
 kia products 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.560
 is to finish closing what is the 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.870
 family feeling of the brand this can be 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.390
 see from the point of what is the part 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.299
 front of the vehicle is to say what it is 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.970
 the grill that resembles the rest more 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.189
 of kia products and then the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.489
 rest of the car in what is design in 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.409
 relation to the previous one is a car much 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.599
 more muscular when it comes to 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:41.810
 design has the waist of the line 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:43.099
 waist of the highest car and then everything 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.590
 what is the interior equipment 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:52.010
 it's totally a new car regarding 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:53.450
 the previous good version another of the 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.450
 features that you just highlighted from 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.129
 the new engines of the new picanto is 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.970
 that has the valve system of the 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.280
 variable 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.100
 the bb &amp; t system that what it does is 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.930
 optimizes engine performance 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.240
 especially in the engines of low in 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.660
 entry as in the case of this 1.2 what 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.680
 what it does is just optimize more the 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.680
 performance of it 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.020
 good as regards the comfort of the 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.940
 vehicle we can mention aspects 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:27.850
 interesting as that nuanced automatic 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.460
 height-adjustable steering wheel 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.490
 the stereo has mp3 player with 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.700
 access to ipod connection 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.890
 has supports heads in the five 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.020
 squares raise glasses and squares 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.650
 front and then small differences 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:48.660
 what is there with the automatic version and 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.890
 manual that is in the manual version brings 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.130
 children in the mirrors and in the version 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.540
 automatic not after another minimum 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.270
 difference after the rest of the car is 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.100
 same is that in the manual version it has 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.930
 headlights search footprints without the version 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.140
 automatic does not come with this 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.140
 equipment 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.140
 kia motors at a level like I had 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.480
 mentioned not only in Argentina 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.660
 but globally he is betting a lot 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.010
 to the service because it is what he thinks 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.400
 gives added value to the product and what 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.900
 finish completing in the line of 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.850
 product either the brand 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.650
 that's why he created the new concept of 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.310
 family lakers that is what it means 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.260
 is the care of the family 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:36.240
 take the client as a family and what 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.550
 what it does is have a relationship 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.020
 direct and a friendly relationship and 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.940
 familiar with all our customers 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.259
 in this case we are going to speak as good 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.800
 we had presented the picanto the 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:50.479
 picanto that we import Argentina for 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.159
 moment is only naftera version 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:55.099
 therefore what we are going to talk about in 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:56.720
 this case is going to be the maintenance of 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:58.340
 the vehicles naphtha we divide 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.889
 Maintenance says maintenance 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.500
 naphtha and after we maintain the 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.539
 utility vehicles us in the 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.310
 petrol vehicles service 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:11.650
 conducted 15,000 kilometers 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.560
 or a year whichever comes first or is it 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.860
 the first service this what includes 

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:18.259
 is 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:23.210
 the standard service that is the change of 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:24.500
 both air-cabin filters as 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.629
 which is the lubricating fluid of the engine 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.879
 in this case the oil and then to 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:30.500
 measure of the other services in the 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:32.330
 first service excuse me I forgot 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.250
 mention is made a control of all 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.139
 the systems of the car an inspection like this 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.360
 we call it ourselves and then in the 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.699
 successive services for example in the 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.000
 30,000 kilometers filter change 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:46.330
 of fuel and at 40 45 thousand 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.039
 kilometers what is the change of spark plugs 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.229
 as we go prolonging let's say 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.240
 they are passing the kilometers that is the 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:55.750

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.659
