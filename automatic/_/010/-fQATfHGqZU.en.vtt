00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:15.690
 and I went to the United States in 2005 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:20.570
 more or less 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:24.180
 my maximum weight was 120 kilos in aunt bad 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.840
 but it was uuuu when I told him a 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.650
 try more I got myself 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.730
 see see information source 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.510
 which I had access to thanks to 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.890
 university where my mastery says 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.079
 and I met a group of people 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.130
 that are with a new focus makes a 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:46.850
 this was pretty little known 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.380
 and these people wanted to focus on 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.420
 topic of nutrition and exercise since 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.620
 an evolutionary biology perspective 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.730
 what thing and how did man evolve and 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.310
 what thing like the man while 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.840
 evolved and how the diet has changed 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.500
 today compared to our 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.930
 ancestors palio pallium actually is that 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.750
 things do not eat anything else can eat what 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.890
 you want when you want as you want 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.970
 basically it 's basically eat like a 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.550
 animal, not like when you're hungry 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.470
 until not hungry 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.040
 then the only thing you have to do 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.670
 is to be attentive to the composition of your 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.490
 food if one eliminates the cereal or it 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.320
 gluten eliminates vegetable oils 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.360
 industrial and excess sugar and 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.290
 you're a lot better than most 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.970
 the population 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.800
 the first thing that ferments is 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.370
 anxiety to eat sugar one followed 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.620
 by eating as flour was the first thing that 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.180
 you feel when you cut it that already indicates 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.220
 that something there is something weird 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.190
 when you eat when you are satisfied 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.150
 but it still causes you to eat sugar if 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.850
 it's not with an addiction 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.210
 then that lasts 34 days is at the end 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.740
 you lose it goes away and what you feel 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.280
 start the first one loses zawate 's 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.230
 cinchas you start to feel good you 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.700
 is chronic hunger the people who have 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.770
 overweight tends to be chronically hungry 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.840
 all the time that's a problem 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.190
 physiological is a problem of eating badly 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.170
 it's not a psychological problem in 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.970
 reality the idea is not to imitate what 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.580
 cavemen the idea not to eat meat 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.120
 the idea is not this is not 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.659
 automatic about avoiding 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.690
 the name of the cave the idea is to take 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.989
 to the human being to our ancestors as 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.989
 reference to maximize health then 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:33.450
 the premise that I handle in the next 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.610
 the more you deviate from your diet 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.040
 natural or while more food 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.750
 outsiders are incorporated into your diet more 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.370
 odds are that something is going 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.260
 wrong 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.480
 [Music] 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.750
 the goal of this lifestyle is not 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.269
 chance is to maximize health that's why 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.400
 a lot of people who start with that and 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.900
 lose weight keep it because you 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.239
 you feel so good that you do not want to go back 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.850
 to the previous the idea is to exercise 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.460
 that are aligned with 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.210
 With our natural design with the type 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.640
 exercise for which we have 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.580
 evolved to realize there are themes 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.840
 also psychological, that is, for 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.940
 mayonnaise health has to minimize the 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.920
 stress the human being is not adapted 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.270
 for so much stress all the time you have 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.800
 that sleeping well is very important to sleep 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.040
 all right 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.510
 to the theme of leisure the ideal is to have a 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.390
 little leisure life where he sleeps well 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.040
 eat well you exercise good for you 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.590
 while your lifestyle comes closer 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.280
 more to the natural in theory should 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.280
 feel better not 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.319
 unlike cereals with 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:46.230
 grass seeds 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.280
 dairy products are a natural element in 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.620
 man not man is a mammal 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.810
 that mom is an element to which we have already 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.489
 been exposed and the only thing they have 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.799
 what to do is tolerate 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.680
 sorry to extend the tolerance to that 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.930
 food and adapt of consuming milk 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.299
 of an animal other than the man of a 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.719
 cow for example then to late 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.639
 consuming dairy as an adult is much more 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.840
 easy to adapt to consume one 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.079
 seed of a grass that we have never 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.609
 eaten the step are the serials that 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.880
 they are also full of toxins and the 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:21.850
 gluten is a toxin 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.920
 [Music] 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:28.480
 the you hear the one menestra know one 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:31.000
 legume I am in particular is 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.580
 very problematic because it is a 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.050
 phytohormone and generates many problems 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.050
 many women are supposed to be 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.790
 consumption of soy increases the risk of 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.470
 cancer to mom for example in women 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.240
 and there are many women the problem of 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.340
 infertility there are many women who 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.810
 cut the soy 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.930
 and can not have children and suddenly 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.000
 they get pregnant for example 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.530
 but soybeans and beans have been 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.550
 glorified because they have protein 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.440
 vegetable because because I knew how it 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.680
 had demonized the flesh before the 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.509
 50 in the USA satanize to the lack not 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.280
 the animal products are bad that is 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.590
 lie or be the human being with me 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.870
 animals from all their history for 200 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.150
 thousand years we have like animals always 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.949
 when your Satanists meat and have 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.289
 that consume protein because if you do not 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:19.500
 you die then that 's when you 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:22.020
 the ministers glorify the soybean and the 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.370
 gluten wheat but when you give yourself 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.449
 that meat is bad and accounts 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.699
 of all the options that the 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:30.810
 menestras and the wheat full of my site 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:32.340
 consume them there is no meat gives you everything 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.720
 what you need and more between less than 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.150
 less acids than what I have dish 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.090
 lentils or a soy dish or a bread already 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:42.830
 I do not need it 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.830
