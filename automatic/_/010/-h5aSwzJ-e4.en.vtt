00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.200 
attack when he has his power gathered I
don't<00:01:00.879> think<00:01:01.000> he<00:01:01.059> can<00:01:01.149> use<00:01:01.299> it<00:01:01.360> randomly<00:01:01.870> but

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
don't think he can use it randomly but

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.830 
don't think he can use it randomly but
he<00:01:04.210> does<00:01:04.390> have<00:01:04.570> a<00:01:04.629> six-stage<00:01:05.110> attack<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.600> that

did<00:02:05.549> get<00:02:05.700> Goku<00:02:06.030> solid<00:02:06.479> shot<00:02:06.719> technique<00:02:07.259> in

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
did get Goku solid shot technique in

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.529 
did get Goku solid shot technique in
this<00:02:07.500> run-through<00:02:08.060> if<00:02:09.060> we<00:02:09.269> had<00:02:09.390> been<00:02:09.509> using

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
this run-through if we had been using

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.350 
this run-through if we had been using
the<00:02:10.140> defeat<00:02:10.500> deck<00:02:10.860> from<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.880> beginning<00:02:12.060> I

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
the defeat deck from the beginning I

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.790 
the defeat deck from the beginning I
think<00:02:12.569> we<00:02:12.660> would<00:02:12.780> have<00:02:12.840> gotten<00:02:12.930> solid<00:02:13.380> shot

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
think we would have gotten solid shot

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.440 
think we would have gotten solid shot
and<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.940> would<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.120> got<00:02:17.060> rising<00:02:18.060> kick<00:02:18.300> or

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
and it would have got rising kick or

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.470 
and it would have got rising kick or
whatever<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:18.810> for<00:02:19.019> trunks<00:02:19.349> too<00:02:20.330> that's<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
whatever it is for trunks too that's the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.640 
whatever it is for trunks too that's the
main<00:02:21.630> difference<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:22.140> start<00:02:22.349> getting<00:02:22.410> keep

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
main difference you start getting keep

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.140 
main difference you start getting keep
you<00:02:22.860> get<00:02:23.010> people's<00:02:23.340> signature<00:02:26.150> physical

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
you get people's signature physical

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.699 
you get people's signature physical
attacks<00:02:27.480> instead<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.049> their<00:02:28.170> signature<00:02:28.530> key

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
attacks instead of their signature key

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:35.630 
attacks instead of their signature key
attacks

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.150
