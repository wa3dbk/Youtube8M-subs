to avoid today we're going to be talking

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.589 
to avoid today we're going to be talking
about<00:00:09.540> salt<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.650> good<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:11.340> bad<00:00:11.550> and<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.940> even

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
about salt the good the bad and the even

about salt the good the bad and the even
worse

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:20.300 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.019 

I<00:00:20.359> want<00:00:21.019> to<00:00:21.080> start<00:00:21.289> off<00:00:21.410> by<00:00:21.470> saying<00:00:21.859> salt<00:00:22.429> is<00:00:22.849> an

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
I want to start off by saying salt is an

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.819 
I want to start off by saying salt is an
essential<00:00:23.539> mineral<00:00:23.900> in<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.080> body<00:00:24.199> we're

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:24.829 
essential mineral in the body we're

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.300 
essential mineral in the body we're
needed<00:00:25.130> for<00:00:25.310> a<00:00:25.369> lot<00:00:25.550> of<00:00:25.579> things<00:00:25.869> fluid<00:00:26.869> balance

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310

let<00:00:42.769> me<00:00:42.860> give<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:43.100> an<00:00:43.190> idea<00:00:43.250> what<00:00:43.610> this<00:00:43.850> would

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:44.089 
let me give you an idea what this would

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.350 
let me give you an idea what this would
look<00:00:44.300> like<00:00:44.360> if<00:00:45.019> you<00:00:45.230> added<00:00:46.040> no<00:00:46.309> salt<00:00:46.699> to<00:00:47.149> any

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
look like if you added no salt to any

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.829 
look like if you added no salt to any
food<00:00:47.720> that<00:00:47.960> you<00:00:48.320> eat<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:49.129> you<00:00:49.489> ate<00:00:49.670> no<00:00:50.239> refined

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:50.839 
food that you eat and you ate no refined

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:53.290 
food that you eat and you ate no refined
foods<00:00:51.170> no<00:00:51.649> prepared<00:00:52.070> foods<00:00:52.370> you<00:00:52.969> would<00:00:53.059> still

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
foods no prepared foods you would still

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.330 
foods no prepared foods you would still
get<00:00:53.449> between<00:00:53.840> five<00:00:54.199> hundred<00:00:54.230> and<00:00:54.680> a<00:00:54.769> thousand

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
get between five hundred and a thousand

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.520 
get between five hundred and a thousand
milligrams<00:00:55.699> of<00:00:56.149> sodium<00:00:56.359> per<00:00:56.570> day<00:00:56.750> which<00:00:57.379> is

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
milligrams of sodium per day which is

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.529 
milligrams of sodium per day which is
completely<00:00:57.949> adequate<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:58.850> right<00:00:59.239> in<00:00:59.390> that

completely adequate and right in that
recommended<00:01:00.320> daily<00:01:00.500> dose<00:01:00.620> just<00:01:01.239> to<00:01:02.239> give<00:01:02.390> us

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
recommended daily dose just to give us

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.570

an idea it's interesting to note that
the<00:01:05.360> average<00:01:05.600> American<00:01:06.320> needs<00:01:06.710> much<00:01:07.429> more

the average American needs much more

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.120 
the average American needs much more
than<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.060> let<00:01:08.660> me<00:01:08.750> give<00:01:08.899> you<00:01:08.990> an<00:01:09.080> idea<00:01:09.140> if<00:01:09.890> you

than that let me give you an idea if you
need<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:10.310> lot<00:01:10.460> of<00:01:10.490> refined<00:01:10.880> foods<00:01:11.270> mostly

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
need a lot of refined foods mostly

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.810 
need a lot of refined foods mostly
refined<00:01:12.020> foods<00:01:12.289> and<00:01:12.470> prepared<00:01:12.920> foods<00:01:13.220> hello

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
refined foods and prepared foods hello

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.060 
refined foods and prepared foods hello
take<00:01:14.210> out<00:01:14.450> you're<00:01:15.320> probably<00:01:15.500> consumed<00:01:15.950> around

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
take out you're probably consumed around

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.190 
take out you're probably consumed around
ten<00:01:16.460> thousands<00:01:17.000> and<00:01:17.149> milligrams<00:01:17.420> of<00:01:17.899> sodium

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
ten thousands and milligrams of sodium

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.130 
ten thousands and milligrams of sodium
per<00:01:18.649> day<00:01:18.679> you<00:01:19.429> can<00:01:19.640> see<00:01:19.789> how<00:01:19.970> this<00:01:20.149> is<00:01:20.390> seven<00:01:21.080> to

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
per day you can see how this is seven to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.380 
per day you can see how this is seven to
ten<00:01:21.380> times<00:01:21.679> the<00:01:21.979> recommended<00:01:22.250> daily<00:01:23.000> intake

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
ten times the recommended daily intake

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.469 
ten times the recommended daily intake
and<00:01:24.080> that's<00:01:24.860> why<00:01:25.190> it's<00:01:25.369> become<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.700> big<00:01:25.880> deal<00:01:26.119> is

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
and that's why it's become a big deal is

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.690 
and that's why it's become a big deal is
not<00:01:26.690> that<00:01:26.899> sodium<00:01:27.289> on<00:01:27.410> its<00:01:27.560> own<00:01:27.649> is<00:01:27.800> bad<00:01:28.039> it<00:01:28.489> but

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
not that sodium on its own is bad it but

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.940 
not that sodium on its own is bad it but
the<00:01:28.819> overconsumption<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:30.050> sodium<00:01:30.410> is<00:01:30.560> and<00:01:30.800> I

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
the overconsumption of sodium is and I

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.350 
the overconsumption of sodium is and I
know<00:01:31.009> you've<00:01:31.280> heard<00:01:31.459> this<00:01:31.520> before<00:01:31.700> and

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
know you've heard this before and

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.680 
know you've heard this before and
probably<00:01:32.840> always<00:01:33.200> wondered<00:01:33.590> yes<00:01:33.860> but<00:01:34.160> why<00:01:34.690> so

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
probably always wondered yes but why so

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.449 
probably always wondered yes but why so
let's<00:01:36.020> talk<00:01:36.200> a<00:01:36.259> little<00:01:36.380> bit<00:01:36.619> about<00:01:36.739> the<00:01:37.220> rise

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:37.459 
let's talk a little bit about the rise

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:40.779 
let's talk a little bit about the rise
of<00:01:37.789> sodium<00:01:38.289> first<00:01:39.289> off<00:01:39.500> I<00:01:39.619> want<00:01:39.800> to<00:01:39.860> say<00:01:40.039> those

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
of sodium first off I want to say those

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.359 
of sodium first off I want to say those
table<00:01:41.270> salt<00:01:41.450> is<00:01:41.720> made<00:01:41.959> up<00:01:42.080> of<00:01:42.229> sodium<00:01:42.679> chloride

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
table salt is made up of sodium chloride

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.180 
table salt is made up of sodium chloride
the<00:01:43.610> combination<00:01:44.390> of<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.690> two<00:01:44.929> so<00:01:45.800> you<00:01:45.860> get

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
the combination of the two so you get

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.949 
the combination of the two so you get
some<00:01:46.369> of<00:01:46.459> each<00:01:46.580> mineral<00:01:46.849> and<00:01:47.330> we<00:01:47.509> get<00:01:47.630> too<00:01:47.810> much

00:01:47.949 --> 00:01:47.959 
some of each mineral and we get too much

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.139 
some of each mineral and we get too much
of<00:01:47.989> each<00:01:48.229> mineral<00:01:48.530> if<00:01:49.009> that<00:01:49.310> makes<00:01:49.580> sense<00:01:49.729> I

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
of each mineral if that makes sense I

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.330 
of each mineral if that makes sense I
also<00:01:50.420> want<00:01:50.750> to<00:01:50.780> note<00:01:50.959> that<00:01:50.989> all<00:01:51.619> kinds<00:01:52.220> of

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
also want to note that all kinds of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.030 
also want to note that all kinds of
things<00:01:52.550> have<00:01:52.789> sodium<00:01:53.239> in<00:01:53.479> them

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
things have sodium in them

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.930 
things have sodium in them

henkins a salt right somes

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.030 
henkins a salt right somes
enhances<00:03:33.160> all<00:03:33.370> flavor<00:03:33.790> it<00:03:34.269> makes

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
so I spent years trying to perfect how

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.149 
so I spent years trying to perfect how
to<00:03:44.849> get<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:45.239> salt<00:03:45.540> content<00:03:45.810> right<00:03:46.260> it's<00:03:46.920> been

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
to get that salt content right it's been

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.309 
to get that salt content right it's been
a<00:03:47.189> whole<00:03:47.400> unlearning<00:03:48.060> for<00:03:48.510> me<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.750> say<00:03:48.959> start

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
from scratch cut back on sodium and I

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.740 
from scratch cut back on sodium and I
slowly<00:03:52.319> cut<00:03:52.859> back<00:03:53.189> on<00:03:53.459> sodium<00:03:53.939> a<00:03:54.180> day<00:03:54.209> at<00:03:54.629> a

place and I really try to hit those
recommend<00:03:59.730> dosages<00:04:00.299> but<00:04:00.959> now<00:04:01.049> that<00:04:01.200> I'm

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
recommend dosages but now that I'm

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.050 
recommend dosages but now that I'm
pregnant<00:04:01.500> I'm<00:04:01.950> really<00:04:02.250> craving<00:04:02.489> sodium<00:04:02.970> and

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
pregnant I'm really craving sodium and

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.490 
pregnant I'm really craving sodium and
I'm<00:04:03.150> looking<00:04:03.480> for<00:04:03.689> alternatives<00:04:04.260> and<00:04:04.439> I've

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
I'm looking for alternatives and I've

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.229 
I'm looking for alternatives and I've
been<00:04:04.650> looking<00:04:04.799> and<00:04:05.129> looking<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.700> what<00:04:06.090> do<00:04:06.150> I

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
been looking and looking and what do I

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:06.679 
been looking and looking and what do I
find

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
find

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.429 
find
sodium<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.889> there's<00:04:08.099> low<00:04:08.489> sodium<00:04:09.120> salt<00:04:09.659> and

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
sodium so there's low sodium salt and

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:13.039 
sodium so there's low sodium salt and
guess<00:04:10.590> what<00:04:10.769> I<00:04:10.799> found<00:04:11.159> it<00:04:11.310> like<00:04:11.670> light<00:04:12.090> salt<00:04:12.480> it

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
guess what I found it like light salt it

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.599 
guess what I found it like light salt it
just<00:04:13.349> didn't<00:04:13.620> kill<00:04:13.799> my<00:04:13.980> craving<00:04:14.370> with<00:04:14.579> a

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
just didn't kill my craving with a

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.879 
just didn't kill my craving with a
little<00:04:14.939> like<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.750> sodium<00:04:16.109> alternatives<00:04:16.709> like

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
little like the sodium alternatives like

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.150 
little like the sodium alternatives like
I<00:04:17.009> said<00:04:17.329> it<00:04:18.329> just<00:04:18.449> didn't<00:04:18.780> hit<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.109> spot<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:20.130> I

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
I said it just didn't hit the spot so I

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.279 
I said it just didn't hit the spot so I
just<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.579> little<00:04:20.820> deeper<00:04:21.239> and<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:21.660> found<00:04:21.690> some

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
just a little deeper and I found some

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.960 
just a little deeper and I found some
alternatives<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:22.979> one<00:04:23.190> really<00:04:23.550> hit<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
alternatives that one really hit the

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.330 
alternatives that one really hit the
spot<00:04:24.090> and<00:04:24.570> helps<00:04:25.020> cut<00:04:25.199> down<00:04:25.229> on<00:04:25.530> sodium<00:04:25.949> intake

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
spot and helps cut down on sodium intake

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.520 
spot and helps cut down on sodium intake
at<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.580> same<00:04:26.820> time<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:28.020> here's<00:04:28.320> my

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
at the same time and here's my

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.879 
at the same time and here's my
suggestion<00:04:29.300> mineral<00:04:30.300> salts<00:04:30.750> why<00:04:31.620> are<00:04:31.680> these

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
suggestion mineral salts why are these

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:34.730 
suggestion mineral salts why are these
so<00:04:32.160> great<00:04:32.460> when<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.060> told<00:04:33.150> you<00:04:33.509> earlier<00:04:33.740> most

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
so great when I told you earlier most

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.860 
so great when I told you earlier most
table<00:04:35.160> salt<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:35.699> just<00:04:35.729> sodium<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.509> chloride

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
table salt is just sodium and chloride

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.430 
table salt is just sodium and chloride
together<00:04:37.910> mineral<00:04:38.910> salts<00:04:39.330> are<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.720> combination

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
together mineral salts are a combination

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.890 
together mineral salts are a combination
of<00:04:40.500> many<00:04:40.830> minerals<00:04:41.159> including<00:04:42.150> sodium<00:04:42.780> and

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
of many minerals including sodium and

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.990 
of many minerals including sodium and
chloride<00:04:43.139> but<00:04:43.860> usually<00:04:44.310> spent<00:04:44.580> a<00:04:44.610> number<00:04:44.789> of

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
chloride but usually spent a number of

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.060 
chloride but usually spent a number of
other<00:04:45.240> minerals<00:04:45.750> as<00:04:45.870> well<00:04:45.900> potassium<00:04:46.889> and

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
other minerals as well potassium and

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.649 
other minerals as well potassium and
cheese<00:04:47.520> it<00:04:47.699> really<00:04:47.940> depends<00:04:48.330> on<00:04:48.389> where<00:04:48.599> it

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
cheese it really depends on where it

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:51.890 
cheese it really depends on where it
comes<00:04:48.930> from<00:04:49.080> that<00:04:50.039> way<00:04:50.280> with<00:04:50.940> each<00:04:51.180> serving

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
comes from that way with each serving

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.870 
comes from that way with each serving
the<00:04:52.110> sodium<00:04:52.590> content<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:53.310> little<00:04:53.580> bit<00:04:53.669> lower

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
the sodium content a little bit lower

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.089 
the sodium content a little bit lower
and<00:04:54.210> you<00:04:54.360> get<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.690> benefit<00:04:55.169> of<00:04:55.380> all<00:04:55.919> the

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:56.099 
and you get the benefit of all the

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.159 
and you get the benefit of all the
others<00:04:56.340> minerals<00:04:56.760> in<00:04:56.940> there<00:04:57.120> too<00:04:57.389> I'm<00:04:57.990> not

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
others minerals in there too I'm not

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.649 
others minerals in there too I'm not
saying<00:04:58.470> used<00:04:58.680> to<00:04:58.889> tons<00:04:59.159> of<00:04:59.250> it<00:04:59.430> some<00:04:59.880> say<00:05:00.120> put

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:00.659 
saying used to tons of it some say put

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:03.010 
saying used to tons of it some say put
it<00:05:00.750> back<00:05:00.960> but<00:05:01.620> this<00:05:01.800> is<00:05:01.949> a<00:05:01.979> nice<00:05:02.220> alternative

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
it back but this is a nice alternative

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.100 
it back but this is a nice alternative
to<00:05:04.020> your<00:05:04.440> normal<00:05:05.130> table<00:05:05.789> salt<00:05:05.820> I<00:05:06.479> want<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.020> go

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
to your normal table salt I want to go

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.149 
to your normal table salt I want to go
through<00:05:07.260> a<00:05:07.320> few<00:05:07.530> of<00:05:07.560> them<00:05:07.710> with<00:05:07.860> you<00:05:08.010> because

some of these not just cook West but
it's<00:05:50.720> finishing<00:05:51.139> so<00:05:51.530> when<00:05:52.160> you<00:05:52.310> feel<00:05:52.550> those

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
but the more you start putting back

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.529 
but the more you start putting back
little<00:06:06.919> by<00:06:07.009> little<00:06:07.220> the<00:06:07.759> less<00:06:07.970> you'll<00:06:08.210> need<00:06:08.419> it

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:08.539 
little by little the less you'll need it

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:10.839 
little by little the less you'll need it
if<00:06:08.720> you<00:06:08.840> appreciate<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:09.949> natural<00:06:10.190> saltiness

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
if you appreciate the natural saltiness

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.749 
if you appreciate the natural saltiness
in<00:06:11.180> your<00:06:11.300> food<00:06:11.569> pay<00:06:12.440> attention<00:06:12.470> your<00:06:13.460> fish

just<00:06:14.599> as<00:06:14.780> they<00:06:14.960> are<00:06:15.169> actually<00:06:15.979> resolved<00:06:16.550> you

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
just as they are actually resolved you

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.939 
just as they are actually resolved you
never<00:06:17.000> noticed<00:06:17.479> that<00:06:17.509> before<00:06:17.630> even<00:06:18.590> some<00:06:18.860> of

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
never noticed that before even some of

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:20.350 
never noticed that before even some of
the<00:06:19.039> vegetables<00:06:19.639> from

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
the vegetables from

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.719 
the vegetables from
but<00:06:20.960> I<00:06:21.139> love<00:06:21.379> so<00:06:21.650> much<00:06:21.830> to<00:06:22.069> have<00:06:22.310> a<00:06:22.340> lot<00:06:22.610> of

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
but I love so much to have a lot of

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.119 
but I love so much to have a lot of
minerals<00:06:22.939> in<00:06:23.300> them<00:06:23.509> so<00:06:24.110> they're<00:06:24.439> naturally

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:25.129 
minerals in them so they're naturally

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.550 
minerals in them so they're naturally
pretty<00:06:25.550> salty<00:06:26.000> as<00:06:26.120> well<00:06:26.449> and<00:06:27.020> I<00:06:27.139> realized

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 
pretty salty as well and I realized

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.619 
pretty salty as well and I realized
while<00:06:27.949> I<00:06:27.979> don't<00:06:28.159> need<00:06:28.550> as<00:06:28.699> much<00:06:28.909> salt<00:06:29.240> in<00:06:29.479> these

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:29.629 
while I don't need as much salt in these

00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:32.290 
while I don't need as much salt in these
and<00:06:30.169> I<00:06:30.229> can<00:06:30.409> take<00:06:30.650> salt<00:06:30.889> away<00:06:31.099> from<00:06:31.340> here<00:06:31.610> put

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
and I can take salt away from here put

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.820 
and I can take salt away from here put
it<00:06:32.419> in<00:06:32.539> things<00:06:32.750> that<00:06:32.810> are<00:06:32.990> really<00:06:33.199> important

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:33.830 
it in things that are really important

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.189 
it in things that are really important
to<00:06:33.889> me<00:06:33.949> and<00:06:34.280> that<00:06:34.849> way<00:06:35.000> I<00:06:35.210> really<00:06:35.659> hit<00:06:35.840> a<00:06:35.870> good

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:36.199 
to me and that way I really hit a good

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:38.559 
to me and that way I really hit a good

balance I got to tell you the less salt
I<00:06:38.750> eat<00:06:39.020> also<00:06:39.620> the<00:06:40.159> less<00:06:40.460> water<00:06:40.789> you<00:06:41.000> hold<00:06:41.509> onto

come<00:06:50.659> from<00:06:50.689> overconsumption<00:06:51.650> of<00:06:51.889> salt<00:06:52.159> so

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:52.639 
come from overconsumption of salt so

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:54.550 
come from overconsumption of salt so
just<00:06:52.879> think<00:06:53.180> of<00:06:53.330> the<00:06:53.449> wonderful<00:06:54.020> benefits

00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 
that come with cutting out salt I gotta

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:59.320 
that come with cutting out salt I gotta
say<00:06:57.439> as<00:06:57.590> somebody<00:06:57.830> who<00:06:58.189> has<00:06:58.370> really<00:06:58.400> low<00:06:59.090> blood

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:06.550 
know he's a physician why should I care
about<00:07:05.060> salt<00:07:05.419> raising<00:07:05.900> my<00:07:06.020> blood<00:07:06.169> pressure

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
about salt raising my blood pressure

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.129 
about salt raising my blood pressure
taught<00:07:07.430> me<00:07:07.580> something<00:07:07.789> interesting<00:07:08.139> the

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:09.139 
taught me something interesting the

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:11.980 
taught me something interesting the
folder<00:07:09.590> we<00:07:09.740> get<00:07:09.949> our<00:07:10.639> blood<00:07:11.629> pressure

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
folder we get our blood pressure

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.010 
folder we get our blood pressure
naturally<00:07:12.560> raises<00:07:13.430> and<00:07:14.180> it'll<00:07:14.389> keep<00:07:14.599> raising

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
naturally raises and it'll keep raising

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.709 
naturally raises and it'll keep raising
as<00:07:15.500> we<00:07:15.800> get<00:07:15.919> older<00:07:16.340> as<00:07:16.909> we<00:07:17.120> get<00:07:17.210> older<00:07:17.509> there's

as we get older as we get older there's

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:19.149 
as we get older as we get older there's
very<00:07:17.990> little<00:07:18.259> we<00:07:18.469> can<00:07:18.500> do<00:07:18.740> about<00:07:18.770> it

00:07:19.149 --> 00:07:19.159 
very little we can do about it

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:20.920 
very little we can do about it
there's<00:07:19.430> a<00:07:19.520> lot<00:07:19.759> to<00:07:20.060> do<00:07:20.240> about<00:07:20.449> it<00:07:20.569> while<00:07:20.719> we're

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:20.930 
there's a lot to do about it while we're

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.439 
there's a lot to do about it while we're
still<00:07:21.169> healthy<00:07:21.529> that's<00:07:22.490> the<00:07:22.699> start<00:07:22.939> watching

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:23.449

become conscious of it and as we get

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.029 
become conscious of it and as we get
older

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:28.039
