prone<00:03:50.239> I<00:03:51.250> think<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.519> benefit<00:03:53.060> from<00:03:53.269> having

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
prone I think I benefit from having

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.379 
prone I think I benefit from having
everyone<00:03:54.620> else<00:03:54.739> here<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.280> not<00:03:56.090> compete

everyone else here to not compete

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:58.240 
everyone else here to not compete
against<00:03:56.690> as<00:03:56.870> such<00:03:57.019> but<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.440> you<00:03:57.680> always<00:03:57.859> see

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
against as such but it you always see

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.400 
against as such but it you always see
who's<00:03:59.030> above<00:03:59.359> you<00:03:59.540> and<00:03:59.690> who<00:03:59.810> you<00:03:59.840> who<00:04:00.260> you're

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
who's above you and who you who you're

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.590
