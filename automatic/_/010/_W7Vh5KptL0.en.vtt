00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.260
 I have had knowledge of that 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:11.620
 national assembly company will 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:14.080
 supplies the vehicle to the dealer 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.480
 box and the assembler fixes the price 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.630
 of sale that because it is a margin between 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.440
 what goes out in the factory there between 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.020
 14 15 and 17 percent 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.910
 the dealer 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.490
 as you know 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.570
 how is the vehicle market is 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:37.140
 say how is the demand what does it do if 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:41.010
 This vehicle brings a price set by 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:45.030
 the assembler let's put 1,500,000 or 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.390
 free to round he tells who 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.900
 he is going to buy him he pays with his check to 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:56.160
 your company 1,500,000 leader and has the 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:59.430
 invoice that allows that but does not 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.149
 deliver the vehicle until that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.550
 sir deposits you outside in a 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.220
 that he has on the outside in 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.610
 dollar a differential you can put the 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:15.070
 same value one thousand 500 one million 500 medium 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.400
 free in dollars 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.100
 I deposit dollars abroad and 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.860
 when receiving it delivers 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.650
 your vehicle how much the vehicle cost you 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.729
 cost him 3 million bolivars 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.830
 many times many times who buys 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.990
 that's because you'd have to ask yourself if you 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.180
 you know that in the 500,000,000,000,000 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.120
 because you pay 3 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.760
 well that same person what is 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:47.290
 using that is like a means of 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:50.460
 investment and it goes and resells sometimes the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.690
 double in 6 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.580
 or in 5 you have to ask yourself how it is that 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.010
 that person 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:03.590
 knowing that something that is worth a million and 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:05.619
 medium is willing and pays 5 million 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.560
 the one who works honestly 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.030
 honestly be what the money costs 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.640
 then there you have to be stuck 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.440
 people of what are the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.220
 smugglers smugglers 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:23.450
 gasoline extraction station 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.849
 the paracos the corrupt because the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.500
 drug traffickers because there is no other 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.660
 recharge explanation that I'm 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.010
 doing an account arrives for example I 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.440
 I will go to the list that is published 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.950
 fifth day of prices by none 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:42.400
 explorer truck 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:45.340
 it costs 55 thousand dollars but in the usa 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:51.519
 here leads to that the value of selling to 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:55.080
 value to the value of more than 198 as 11 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.080
 millions of bolivars 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:07.299
 that is not so much that as they bought as 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.709
 well tell me that with this they are going to 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.470
 subsidize the production of vehicles 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.019
 popular that is adventures it seems that 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.880
 there is a proposal is that I'm going to 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.430
 allow because the following the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.310
 assembler will bring the dry material 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.170
 he will not receive foreign currency from him 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.099
 of the Venezuelan state but he brings his 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.299
 dry material from 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.110
 but it's going to be close to you 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:34.620
 you value what is the top change of 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.599
 jose el viene joins his vehicle but 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.610
 you have to pay salary here 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.340
 service of your embolism and you have to 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.060
 to declare taxes on the 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.610
 rent and good as how to bring the 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.299
 value to ask him how he is going to 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.190
 do 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:52.560
 how will he do it because he has 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.909
 asked no no, they did not tell me 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.530
 officially that is what revenge but 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.819
 I tell you once how it's going to 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.400
 do because he is what he is doing 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.840
 is what I explained earlier that 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.459
 what the dealer did then 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.379
 good as the dealer is 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.810
 doing good business with my business 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.730
 that I am the producer of good vehicles 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.450
 I'm going to get into the business that's 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.099
 What you are doing 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.390
 You see an official to concentrate 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.669
 is in the package of this 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.430
 player and a spare thread I ask him and 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.600
 I fill the spare parts to 100 bolivars 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:26.300
 but it turns out that the dollar change if 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.490
 mother you have a net charge that is 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.290
 this accident 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.770
 then you are going to pay a replacement 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:38.710
 price almost 200 injured 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:38.710
 how does that affect the device 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.160
 that has an incidence that is that it 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.110
 they extend all sectors plus there are with 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.080
 with this approach, what you are is 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.760
 guaranteeing the occupation of 2,700 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.740
 workers that there is in the sector the 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.810
 form with a union what is 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.210
 guaranteeing that but it is the following 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.450
 how it affects the other sectors not 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.490
 only how does the pressure on 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.590
 the same dollar if damn because this 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.960
 sir has no dollars here you have to 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.790
 buy with the bolivars has to 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.970
 buy dollars then affect if 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.160
 madrid was going to affect the parallel 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.900
 then that they have to think it over and 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.010
 that they have to talk to those who know 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.969
 of that 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.339
 fernando can leave you 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:29.449
 for what the entrepreneurs tell you 

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:29.449
 reference to consultation does not evaluate to 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.999
 find out what I read in the press I have not been 

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:37.679
 saying 

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:40.610
 zhang and do not agree with this I 

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:40.610
 I do not agree with that
