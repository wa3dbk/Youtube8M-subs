00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
for some reason like my Wi-Fi analyzer

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.270 
for some reason like my Wi-Fi analyzer
right<00:02:17.880> there<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:19.050> really<00:02:19.440> helpful<00:02:19.950> to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
to see what else is in there so we'll go

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.670 
to see what else is in there so we'll go
ahead<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.280> open<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.940> YouTube<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.989> we'll<00:02:46.530> go

ahead and open up YouTube and we'll go

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.960 
ahead and open up YouTube and we'll go
through<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.190> first<00:02:47.400> time<00:02:47.580> I've<00:02:47.730> run

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
through this the first time I've run

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.270 
through this the first time I've run
this<00:02:48.150> so<00:02:48.450> let's<00:02:48.900> go<00:02:49.019> ahead<00:02:49.050> and<00:02:49.230> look<00:02:49.560> at<00:02:49.769> san

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
this so let's go ahead and look at san

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.229 
this so let's go ahead and look at san
andreas<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.540> here's<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.930> video<00:02:52.970> come<00:02:53.970> over

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
andreas so here's that video come over

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.170 
andreas so here's that video come over
into<00:02:54.680> landscape<00:02:55.680> mode<00:02:55.860> and<00:02:55.890> now<00:02:56.160> let's<00:02:56.970> go

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
into landscape mode and now let's go

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.290 
into landscape mode and now let's go
ahead<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.440> adjust<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> volume<00:02:58.800> so<00:02:59.700> here<00:03:00.120> it

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
ahead and adjust the volume so here it

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.630 
ahead and adjust the volume so here it
thinks<00:03:00.690> that<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:01.140> media<00:03:01.470> volume<00:03:01.680> that

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
thinks that this is media volume that

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.600 
thinks that this is media volume that
I'm<00:03:02.790> adjusting<00:03:03.090> which<00:03:03.480> I<00:03:03.630> am<00:03:03.890> there's<00:03:04.890> muted<00:03:05.400> a

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
lot more responsive than what we're used

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.430 
lot more responsive than what we're used
to<00:03:08.280> with<00:03:08.550> lollipop<00:03:09.150> but<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.900> other<00:03:09.930> thing<00:03:10.140> is

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
and the media all right there and then I

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.740 
and the media all right there and then I
can<00:03:16.800> close<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.069> so<00:03:17.820> it's<00:03:18.030> still<00:03:18.329> trying<00:03:18.570> to

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
can close that so it's still trying to

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.890 
can close that so it's still trying to
be<00:03:18.870> smart<00:03:19.290> you'll<00:03:19.920> also<00:03:20.160> notice<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.630> is

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
be smart you'll also notice that this is

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.350 
be smart you'll also notice that this is
the<00:03:22.140> active<00:03:22.829> color<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.459> then<00:03:23.850> the<00:03:24.000> others<00:03:24.209> are

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
the active color and then the others are

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.000 
the active color and then the others are
gray<00:03:24.660> but<00:03:25.049> as<00:03:25.170> soon<00:03:25.260> as<00:03:25.380> I<00:03:25.500> switch<00:03:25.769> over<00:03:25.980> to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
gray but as soon as I switch over to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.840 
gray but as soon as I switch over to
that<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.459> switches<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:29.040> highlight<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.610> so

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
that it switches to to highlight that so

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.729 
that it switches to to highlight that so
you<00:03:30.299> can<00:03:30.420> tell<00:03:30.600> which<00:03:30.780> one<00:03:30.989> you're<00:03:31.290> adjusting

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
you can tell which one you're adjusting

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.979 
you can tell which one you're adjusting
just<00:03:32.340> because<00:03:32.760> it's<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.090> one<00:03:33.209> that's<00:03:33.450> got<00:03:33.930> the

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
just because it's the one that's got the

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.170 
just because it's the one that's got the
focus<00:03:34.380> color<00:03:34.620> set<00:03:34.890> on<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.160> next<00:03:35.700> up<00:03:35.820> we<00:03:36.000> saw

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
I think this is where we're going to see

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.810 
I think this is where we're going to see
them<00:05:15.990> when<00:05:16.530> you<00:05:16.680> sort<00:05:17.010> by<00:05:17.570> permission<00:05:18.570> type

show it to you right now this is an

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.159 
show it to you right now this is an
early<00:06:08.190> preview<00:06:08.460> I've<00:06:08.880> had<00:06:09.150> my<00:06:09.419> fair<00:06:09.750> share<00:06:09.810> of

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
early preview I've had my fair share of
