kind of none of this length then I'll do

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.930 
kind of none of this length then I'll do
an<00:04:30.529> outside<00:04:30.860> turn<00:04:31.070> so<00:04:31.430> I<00:04:31.460> don't<00:04:31.610> want<00:04:31.729> prayers

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
napping I'll having to go to the right

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.100 
napping I'll having to go to the right
when<00:04:33.919> a<00:04:33.949> half<00:04:34.099> doing<00:04:34.279> oxide<00:04:34.610> turn<00:04:34.960> would<00:04:35.960> be

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
when a half doing oxide turn would be

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.080 
when a half doing oxide turn would be
back<00:04:36.260> far<00:04:36.560> enough<00:04:36.590> from<00:04:36.979> them<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.669> where<00:04:37.820> just

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
back far enough from them to where just

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.589 
back far enough from them to where just
hit<00:04:38.330> out<00:04:38.539> you<00:04:38.870> know<00:04:38.990> I'm<00:04:39.340> not<00:04:40.340> by<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.580> way<00:04:40.760> just

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
hit out you know I'm not by the way just

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.450 
hit out you know I'm not by the way just
kick<00:04:41.810> out<00:04:41.930> I'll<00:04:42.139> go<00:04:42.229> back<00:04:42.440> do<00:04:42.919> another<00:04:43.130> upside

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
kick out I'll go back do another upside

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.219 
kick out I'll go back do another upside
turn<00:04:43.699> until<00:04:44.120> just<00:04:44.330> kick<00:04:44.539> out<00:04:44.690> and<00:04:44.900> go<00:04:45.050> to<00:04:45.110> the

turn until just kick out and go to the

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:46.659 
turn until just kick out and go to the
right<00:04:45.380> then<00:04:45.589> we'll<00:04:45.770> start<00:04:45.949> cracking<00:04:46.070> inside

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
right then we'll start cracking inside

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.879 
right then we'll start cracking inside
turn<00:04:46.880> as<00:04:47.150> long<00:04:47.300> as<00:04:47.389> he<00:04:47.479> doesn't<00:04:47.659> charge<00:04:47.990> if<00:04:48.740> he

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
turn as long as he doesn't charge if he

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:50.469 
turn as long as he doesn't charge if he
does<00:04:49.070> charge<00:04:49.430> or<00:04:49.669> kick<00:04:49.820> out<00:04:49.969> then<00:04:50.180> we'll<00:04:50.330> talk

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
does charge or kick out then we'll talk

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.120 
does charge or kick out then we'll talk
about<00:04:50.539> what<00:04:50.900> to<00:04:50.930> do<00:04:51.139> it<00:04:51.260> after<00:04:51.500> that<00:04:51.650> first

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
about what to do it after that first

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.320 
about what to do it after that first
thing<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.339> have<00:04:52.430> to<00:04:52.520> do<00:04:52.699> is<00:04:52.789> clear<00:04:53.000> horsing

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
thing you have to do is clear horsing

00:04:53.330 --> 00:05:29.950 
thing you have to do is clear horsing
around<00:04:53.620> so<00:04:54.639> right

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:37.510 

now<00:05:30.960> if<00:05:31.020> I<00:05:31.229> turn<00:05:31.340> you<00:05:32.340> can't<00:05:32.610> charge<00:05:32.970> into<00:05:33.300> me

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.659 

now<00:05:38.090> we're<00:05:38.270> going<00:05:38.539> to<00:05:38.599> go<00:05:39.050> back<00:05:39.229> in<00:05:39.440> to

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
now we're going to go back in to

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.460 
now we're going to go back in to
continuing<00:05:40.669> doing<00:05:40.910> the<00:05:41.030> outside<00:05:41.360> turns<00:05:41.660> V

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
continuing doing the outside turns V

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.339 
continuing doing the outside turns V
doesn't<00:05:43.160> outside<00:05:43.550> turn<00:05:43.819> you<00:05:44.060> can't<00:05:44.389> charge

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:45.349 
doesn't outside turn you can't charge

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:47.710 
doesn't outside turn you can't charge
into<00:05:46.009> me<00:05:46.130> if<00:05:46.250> I<00:05:46.370> do<00:05:46.430> an<00:05:46.669> inside<00:05:47.090> turn<00:05:47.389> I'm

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
into me if I do an inside turn I'm

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.180 
into me if I do an inside turn I'm
giving<00:05:48.470> them<00:05:48.560> a<00:05:48.770> direct<00:05:50.530> you<00:05:51.530> know<00:05:51.560> direction

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
giving them a direct you know direction

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.400 
giving them a direct you know direction
into<00:05:52.550> me<00:05:52.699> where<00:05:53.210> it<00:05:53.270> can<00:05:53.389> easily<00:05:53.780> charge<00:05:54.050> me

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
into me where it can easily charge me

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.170 
into me where it can easily charge me
and<00:05:54.680> there's<00:05:55.130> no<00:05:55.280> way<00:05:55.310> I<00:05:55.460> can<00:05:55.580> get<00:05:55.789> out<00:05:55.940> of<00:05:55.970> the

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
and there's no way I can get out of the

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.650 
and there's no way I can get out of the
way<00:05:56.300> in<00:05:56.479> time<00:05:57.250> before<00:05:58.250> you<00:05:58.550> know<00:05:58.910> gets<00:05:59.210> to<00:05:59.479> me

00:05:59.650 --> 00:05:59.660 
way in time before you know gets to me

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.480 
way in time before you know gets to me
so<00:05:59.990> it's<00:06:00.199> outside<00:06:00.349> turns<00:06:00.830> what's<00:06:01.160> out<00:06:01.310> of<00:06:01.400> the

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
so it's outside turns what's out of the

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.040 
so it's outside turns what's out of the
way<00:06:01.610> up<00:06:01.759> kicking<00:06:02.000> distance<00:06:02.509> then<00:06:02.780> I'm<00:06:02.900> going

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
way up kicking distance then I'm going

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.450 
way up kicking distance then I'm going
to<00:06:03.110> go<00:06:03.169> to<00:06:05.110> inside<00:06:06.110> turns<00:06:06.440> here<00:06:07.069> in<00:06:07.160> a<00:06:07.220> little

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:07.460 
to go to inside turns here in a little

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.980 
to go to inside turns here in a little
bit<00:06:08.710> where<00:06:09.710> I<00:06:09.909> step<00:06:10.909> back<00:06:11.180> and<00:06:11.240> he<00:06:11.630> does<00:06:11.840> the

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
bit where I step back and he does the

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:13.360 
bit where I step back and he does the
inside<00:06:12.349> turnip<00:06:12.770> I<00:06:12.889> thought<00:06:13.069> he<00:06:13.130> was<00:06:13.220> going<00:06:13.310> to

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
inside turnip I thought he was going to

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.050 
inside turnip I thought he was going to
charge<00:06:13.580> me

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
charge me

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.460 
charge me

I didn't mean Utley go back to an

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.620 
I didn't mean Utley go back to an
outside<00:06:15.830> turn<00:06:16.150> and<00:06:17.150> continue<00:06:17.509> that<00:06:19.330> it's<00:06:20.330> not

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:12.399 
acceptable and the horses have to learn
that<00:07:10.940> when<00:07:11.090> we<00:07:11.210> go<00:07:11.330> to<00:07:11.389> catch<00:07:11.659> them<00:07:11.930> that<00:07:12.229> they

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:14.890 
that when we go to catch them that they
can't<00:07:12.650> do<00:07:12.889> that<00:07:13.099> or<00:07:13.430> in<00:07:13.940> any<00:07:14.090> case<00:07:14.419> they<00:07:14.630> can't
