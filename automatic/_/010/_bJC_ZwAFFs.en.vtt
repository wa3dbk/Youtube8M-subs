00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:10.130
 Yes, I would like to introduce this one that I bought in Jason today 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.450
 Yes here 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:18.020
 Sold by buffalo 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:23.380
 It's a wireless game controller 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:28.830
 This is the main part but it has a very strange shape 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:34.250
 This is what it says as a wireless game controller 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:38.420
 It is a controller used when playing games 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.940
 This is supposed to be connected by bluetooth 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:46.420
 Communication method is bluetooth standard version 2.1 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.420
 It is to say 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.320
 If you go back 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:59.570
 It is written here that it is g and js 1 h 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:06.590
 It seems like this is a global project 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:09.740
 When I search for the word g と と and is released from other than the buffalo i 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:14.380
 It seems that there are many products 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:22.350
 So from this is referred to as the original product of love Buffalo 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:22.350
 It seems that the buffalo sells the thing of the standard such as g more . 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:29.360
 8 This is it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:34.250
 Well I do not play games so much 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.650
 It's about 500 yen here at Jason I think I'll try buying it for a bit 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.990
 Was 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.990
 Then I think I want to open a little 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Hmm 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.979
 I feel like this manual 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.979
 Jar contains 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:56.380
 I have 2 AAA batteries. 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.220
 And here is the main body 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:07.100
 We have to have a ipod touch 4th generation as a comparison of size 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:09.119
 Well It is smaller than the feeling that I thought in something like this 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.030
 Even when holding 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.520
 I feel like this 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.520
 I think it is easy to hold 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.890
 If you take a closer look at the body 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:25.540
 First of all , I write it here already 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.790
 And here is the power button 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.750
 So here's what led 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.100
 The lamp is lit up and this part is 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.870
 It is a joystick eh 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.790
 in this way 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:45.190
 You can move it vertically and horizontally 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.220
 And here there is a vivo turn a button and here there is a c button 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.550
 Oh dear 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:54.620
 such as the nunchaku with or not come wii comes with b 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:00.190
 It feels like 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:05.080
 The rubber coating is generally done in a little slippery feeling 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:07.290
 A little dirty, I think whether anxious But I'd feel you have to eat a little Ppe to 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.290
 I will 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:15.349
 I would like to turn on the power 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.349
 I want to press and hold this power button 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:29.360
 Then the al ed lamp starts to blink orange to meet 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:33.740
 It means that the power was turned on by voice 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:36.500
 Well, I can not use anything in this condition yet 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.720
 As this is a bluetooth terminal 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:43.490
 Well with a smartphone etc 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:51.040
 It means that you will use it after pairing 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:57.519
 The use of tearing is in the case of the xperia example introduced earlier in the video. 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:58.650
 I want to pair Yes I struggled a little, but somehow I can pair 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:04.319
 The 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:08.760
 Rather than pairing from android settings 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:11.909
 This g original exclusive application is out 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.810
 There is an app called js 1 quick start 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:18.750
 Here it is that there is faster to pairing from was found 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.670
 Even this 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:24.800
 Do you understand the joystick? 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:29.090
 It works well towards you 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.840
 It is for those of here g another with the official app 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:36.500
 There is an item to try 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.550
 If you try this, it looks like this 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.969
 There is a simple app 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:47.639
 You have won the game 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:51.020
 This contains the g other operability for now 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.020
 I can feel it 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:57.930
 Of course I went to g original planning besides this 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.840
 If it is a game 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.129
 In this g original controller 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:08.009
 Can play 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:08.009
 For example, here galaxy 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:16.590
 galaxy ace Come on ? 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:20.310
 This game comes with a mark that z here in g original because here 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:25.220
 Tap and play gamepad connection 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:30.500
 g using the other To js 1 h device say Are you sure that you want to play 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:33.220
 Now When you Jesus that you can question whether that dial temple is 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.220
 Is it good with voice? 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.770
 If you 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.810
 Ah 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.930
 And 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.930
 Take y and capture station 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:51.579
 I will 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:03.240
 Now connected to g books and you are to 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:04.860
 Yes, like this, it 's a great game over the camera . 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.169
 Right here 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.910
 Oh game King 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:15.410
 A person who doesn't usually play games 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:19.940
 I mean I do not know even the Well other Innovation example it looks like this 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:23.900
 g There are several kinds of games for the original 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:29.980
 I think I can use it for various things 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:35.590
 You can also use it as a mouse by connecting to a computer like this 

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:39.670
 So, this time, I introduced a device called here g 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:42.680
 It seems that there is really a great stock at Jason right now 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:46.560
 We pile up and sell for 500 yen 

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.770
 Oh, it's 500 yen so it's easy to buy 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:53.250
 It can also be used as a simple mouse 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:57.169
 If you have an android device, you can use the game 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:07:02.270
 Well maybe it's like android 4.0 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:05.330
 I think I can get the cursor out with android 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:12.190
 By So I think that can also be used in such applications 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:19.470
 Well it's 500 yen and I think it might be interesting to try to buy it 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:26.120
 This time, it has been sold from here i Buffalo g anymore To 

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:26.120
 The model number introduced the thing of js 1 h
