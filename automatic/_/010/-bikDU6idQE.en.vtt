00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.160
 hello guys welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.019
 sandy today we are going to prepare an exquisite 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.910
 pioneer of tuna 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:16.039
 these are the ingredients that we are going to 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:19.160
 need 250 grams of tuna 4 eggs 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:22.039
 salt black pepper 170 grams of 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.169
 olive half kilo of mayonnaise and I have 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.140
 approximately 100 grams of pepper 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:29.029
 canned as you see I already have my pianito 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.219
 prepared here that I accept made by my 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.200
 little hands and the one who does not know how to do 

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:35.210
 to leave a video here on the side of the 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.450
 screen so they can learn what 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.450
 super easy and fast 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.460
 and it's super easy, this is a bonus 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.660
 to mix and what we are going to do is 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.580
 start putting all the ingredients 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.640
 important the mayonnaise although you 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.200
 look like there's a lot mayonnaise has 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.560
 to be because if not then they will 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:01.180
 get very take off 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.180
 we are going to put the pepper 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.900
 some olives 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.380
 web 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.259
 and the tuna 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.380
 so let's mix everything until the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.270
 mayonnaise mix well with all 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.220
 ingredients and we are going to add a 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.220
 little salt and black pepper 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.969
 so this is the texture is more or less 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.770
 that has to have even me 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.659
 I would encourage you to put a little more 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.149
 mayonnaise but good that 's to taste 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.270
 always everything is at ease is if they like it 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.490
 more not pepper it puts more pepper 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.520
 more egg as you want but this 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.740
 has to be half weak so that 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.100
 then the sweet pionono absorb the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.540
 mayonnaise and mix the flavors 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.640
 This saw me Nonito 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:13.430
 that is spectacular 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.340
 as you know it is done, let it cool down 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.980
 little bit and you roll up quickly to 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.470
 that does not lose the humidity in the same 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.660
 paper and so we're going to take it off 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.660
 slowly and we will fill it 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.930
 ready 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.940
 very well 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:38.170
 spectacular is clean nonito 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.610
 well now we are going to put the filling 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.700
 and we are going to extend it 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.500
 in a uniform way detail have in 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.230
 account 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:53.360
 as I'm going to screw it up 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:58.560
 well I will try to always put well 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:03:01.410
 for here but this part of here almost not 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.750
 I'm going to put stuffing because after 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.180
 when I roll it up if it's not going to come out 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.110
 all the stuffed polis ice cream and goes to 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.110
 be a suc enchastre 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.120
 I'm going to put a little bit here because 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.480
 these little tips when it is screwed are the 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.970
 that I eat myself so 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.960
 let's start rolling with the 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.310
 little paper 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.290
 we give it the first push 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.849
 well I do not know if they realized that I did not 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.640
 I took the paper from below just 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:33.400
 for this and apart for later we're going 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.460
 to keep on this paper until it's the 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.060
 time to serve and cut 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.380
 how it looks spectacular with a lot 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.960
 watch out 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.440
 ling ling ling ling the part this is 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:50.780
 down and now what we do is 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.880
 squeeze it a little bit to make it settle 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.420
 if we did not have to save and 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.920
 book for later or tomorrow what 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.819
 what we do is wrap it in it 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.250
 paper that we cook it as we see well 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.319
 tight to take shape 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.000
 then we can wrap it in a paper 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.620
 aluminum we can wrap in 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.239
 transparent or we can put it in a 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.630
 bag, the important thing is that it fits 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:16.930
 tight and well let's put it right 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.079
 in the refrigerator or in the refrigerator 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.030
 so that it does not lose the shape ok good 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:25.100
 guys at the end of the recipe saw that it's 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.980
 super easy not everything came in a bag 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.380
 gindÃ­n team I stretch it in the pionono and what 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.980
 I put two things in the refrigerator 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.560
 keep in mind you can choose to leave it 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:38.210
 whole put it in a fountain and decorate it 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.220
 all the source with mayonnaise with 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.770
 olives whatever you think of the 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.190
 way you like it or just 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:49.030
 cut them directly and place the and 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.130
 It is also another very easy option 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.230

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.990
