00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.010
 when you play in detroit 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.199
 ask something 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.310
 I think many people we can do with it 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.080
 live because they had how to get in the 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:07.510
 frame press lose or less 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.800
 Jump far as if you are in check 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.020
 lose because that's the thing 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.020
 is that just one of the deepest concerns 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.900
 your side in a moment 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.720
 with massive danger exists 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.540
 and also show 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.530
 So some people play farmers 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.300
 to wake up Spanish butchers are that 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.770
 a daredevil guy and others are 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.120
 rather defensive of waiting does not have any 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.920
 make mistakes and watch wait until the 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.590
 other mistakes make me a type 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.570
 probably similar to actually 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.240
 rather offensive player so i mean no 

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:42.160
 good but I try somehow 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:43.630
 to go forward and make an effort 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.390
 at least not completely out of sight 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.530
 lose what the other one has before but 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.530
 Actually, I'm an offensive player 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.439
 and the game consists of thousands of 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.260
 tasks and until you have the opportunity 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.400
 to the market to the opponent or 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.129
 very fast so you only once 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.890
 it has to be like that too 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.849
 You have to live there at any time 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.439
 makes fend off 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.030
 and that does not always succeed 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.030
 live both on the board and in the 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.450
 live 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.900
 hmm 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.900
 you can already go crazy in the community 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.849
 like everyone else, you also have an art 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.629
 can go crazy and then rather and 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.319
 alan everything what with having passion with 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:02.319
 to do passion
