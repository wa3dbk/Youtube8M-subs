00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.460
 cycling is fun cycling is 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.550
 healthy 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.939
 Cycling is exploring cycling it 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.140
 but not always comfortable 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.910
 all around the bike is a lot 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.369
 developed and invented 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.410
 However, a bike could not function 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.539
 the world so far are the 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.340
 height adjustment of the saddle without 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.199
 wrench but only per 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.199
 button pressure also during the ride 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.750
 every cyclist inevitably comes in 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.530
 a dangerous situation when he is on 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.210
 For example, he has to make a crossing 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.610
 stop at a traffic light 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.730
 so the pickup process is slow 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.170
 drive to stop always come down 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.450
 associated with a risk 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.010
 the problem that the feet are not up 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.860
 The earth often requires 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.489
 artistic performance of a kippelt 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:07.490
 of the top ten to count 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.810
 others fall a little and 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.220
 the third one can only do it with one 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.220
 daredevil takeoff 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.070
 everything is dangerous and everything would be 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.100
 not necessary a completely new kind 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.690
 construction also brings the possibility 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.450
 during the ride the bicycle saddle 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.350
 Lowering your feet safely on the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.600
 to bring earth 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:42.580
 So ran go down to the intersection 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:45.260
 the saddle both legs on the ground 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.830
 comfortable and stress-free waiting 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:53.500
 drive off green and saddle again after 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.500
 up and down through the middle 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.760
 this satellite consists of few 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.910
 components 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.020
 the centerpiece is a gas spring 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.509
 delivered naturally in one 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.340
 complete assembly which everyone without 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.790
 technical knowledge of his 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.840
 can mount a standard bicycle 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.150
 First, the old seatpost 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.570
 away to seat for the saddle lift 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.750
 do 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.530
 only a few existing in every household 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.840
 tools are striving for assembly 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.120
 The upper end of the satellite is in the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.520
 Now open frame tube pushed and with 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.060
 the attached screw connection attached 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.920
 with different frame tube diameter 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.660
 the difference is with commercial 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.000
 calibrated eyelets balanced 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.209
 which every bicycle dealer can supply 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.209
 can 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.240
 compensated 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.340
 the gas spring becomes a clamp 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.040
 at the bottom frame in the locked and 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.610
 is thus the bike frame firmly 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.610
 connected 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.459
 can be synonymous with a few simple steps 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.220
 the lever for pressing the spring on 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.470
 Handlebars attach via a bowden cable 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.260
 this lever is with the saddle lift 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.660
 connected now only needs the 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.800
 saddle detached from the old post and 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.569
 be installed on the new lift 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.880
 All standard bicycles are 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.880
 easy to convert in this way 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.099
 the height is currently 12 cm and each 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.969
 The desired intermediate level is natural 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:52.469
 also possible 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:54.810
 the satellite was just that 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:56.760
 Possibility also during the ride 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.459
 Height of the saddle infinitely adjustable 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.739
 brings unforeseen benefits for the 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.450
 cycling the population and 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.760
 also increases for the others 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.030
 road safety in the 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.030
 road traffic 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:18.900
 but also the Radwanderer at one 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.359
 does not want to stop viewpoint 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.889
 but you can relax more easily 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.259
 stay seated on his bike 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:28.530
 Of course only if he has the saddle before 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:30.210
 has lowered so brings the stop 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.990
 when cycling no more stress 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:37.139
 but just makes fun more 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.840
 comfort more security and one 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.320
 better posture go with the 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.970
 time or better you drive with time 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.240
 drive with the saddle lift in the new 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:47.240
 millennium
