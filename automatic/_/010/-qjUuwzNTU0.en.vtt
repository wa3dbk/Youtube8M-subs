what<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.670> got<00:00:47.820> here<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.359> bottom<00:00:48.809> part<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.050> a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
what we got here is the bottom part of a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.750 
what we got here is the bottom part of a
remote<00:00:49.289> control<00:00:49.590> car<00:00:49.620> we<00:00:50.039> put<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> batteries

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
remote control car we put the batteries

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.180 
remote control car we put the batteries
in<00:00:50.989> what<00:00:51.989> we<00:00:52.050> did<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.379> took<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> saws<00:00:52.890> off

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
in what we did was we took the saws off

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.790 
in what we did was we took the saws off
kind<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.690> box<00:00:54.899> leave<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> bottom<00:00:55.649> and

kind of out the box leave the bottom and

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619 
kind of out the box leave the bottom and
try<00:00:56.460> not<00:00:56.609> to<00:00:56.730> ruin<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> wires<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.269> will<00:00:57.420> most

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
try not to ruin the wires you will most

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.180 
try not to ruin the wires you will most
likely<00:00:58.100> it<00:00:59.100> takes<00:00:59.399> four<00:01:00.300> double<00:01:00.809> A<00:01:00.899> batteries

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
likely it takes four double A batteries

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.040 
likely it takes four double A batteries
we<00:01:02.190> zip-tied<00:01:02.640> them<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.969> hold<00:01:03.510> them<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:03.750> for

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
we zip-tied them in hold them in for

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.080 
we zip-tied them in hold them in for
extra<00:01:05.040> durability<00:01:05.900> take<00:01:06.900> wires<00:01:07.880> side<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:09.000> them

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
extra durability take wires side of them

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.480 
extra durability take wires side of them
on<00:01:09.210> here<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.140> power<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:11.130> plug

60 turning but this year well you want
to<00:03:13.420> find<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.690> nice<00:03:13.810> your<00:03:13.990> most<00:03:14.140> like<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.500> I

to find a nice your most like this I

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.170 
to find a nice your most like this I
think<00:03:14.680> this<00:03:14.980> I'm<00:03:15.640> not<00:03:15.730> sure<00:03:15.970> what<00:03:16.090> the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
think this I'm not sure what the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.670 
think this I'm not sure what the
distance<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:16.660> remote<00:03:16.960> is<00:03:17.080> but<00:03:17.320> what<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.560> can

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
distance this remote is but what you can

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.830 
distance this remote is but what you can
do<00:03:17.800> is<00:03:17.860> you<00:03:17.980> can<00:03:18.040> have<00:03:18.190> it<00:03:18.220> set<00:03:18.490> just<00:03:19.420> always

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
do is you can have it set just always

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.100 
do is you can have it set just always
turns<00:03:20.200> but<00:03:20.770> you<00:03:20.860> can<00:03:21.010> adjust<00:03:21.100> I<00:03:21.730> like<00:03:22.690> that<00:03:22.900> how

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
turns but you can adjust I like that how

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:30.070 
turns but you can adjust I like that how
fast<00:03:23.380> it<00:03:23.590> turns<00:03:24.870> Justin<00:03:25.870> -<00:03:25.960> not<00:03:26.110> at<00:03:26.260> all

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
now but you can adjust the speed on this

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.640 
now but you can adjust the speed on this
with<00:03:35.030> these<00:03:35.600> those<00:03:35.780> are<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:35.960> nicer<00:03:36.140> marks<00:03:36.560> you
