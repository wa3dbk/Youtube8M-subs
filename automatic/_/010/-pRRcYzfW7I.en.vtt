returners<00:00:33.030> really<00:00:33.270> well<00:00:33.420> i<00:00:33.690> think<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.110> year

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
returners really well i think this year

returners really well i think this year
one<00:00:35.280> great<00:00:35.430> strong<00:00:35.730> suit<00:00:36.000> is<00:00:36.030> going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> be

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
one great strong suit is going to be

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.869 
one great strong suit is going to be
speeds<00:00:37.350> coming<00:00:37.710> out<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> back<00:00:38.040> court<00:00:38.309> I've

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
speeds coming out of the back court I've

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.069 
speeds coming out of the back court I've
been<00:00:38.969> working<00:00:39.300> on<00:00:39.360> counter<00:00:39.660> attacks<00:00:39.690> we've

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
been working on counter attacks we've

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.930 
been working on counter attacks we've
been<00:00:40.200> working<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.620> six<00:00:40.920> on<00:00:41.040> five<00:00:41.250> counter<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.430 
been working on six on five counter and
I<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:42.780> we're<00:00:42.870> going<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.050> get<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.200> lot<00:00:43.260> of

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
I think we're going to get a lot of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.799 
I think we're going to get a lot of
great<00:00:43.710> looks<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.789> get<00:00:44.879> quick<00:00:45.149> goals<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.570> teams

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
great looks to get quick goals on teams

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.779 
great looks to get quick goals on teams
this<00:00:45.960> year<00:00:46.170> we're<00:00:46.770> last<00:00:47.070> year<00:00:47.309> maybe<00:00:47.489> we<00:00:47.700> were

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
this year we're last year maybe we were

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.630 
this year we're last year maybe we were
slow<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.420> slow<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> back<00:00:49.170> court<00:00:49.500> got<00:00:50.370> hung

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
slow to slow out the back court got hung

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.080 
slow to slow out the back court got hung
up<00:00:50.760> got<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:52.250> ran<00:00:53.250> through<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.460> motions<00:00:54.000> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
up got to ran through the motions a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.180 
up got to ran through the motions a
little<00:00:54.270> bit<00:00:54.360> too<00:00:54.510> much<00:00:54.629> also<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.980> year<00:00:56.039> I

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
little bit too much also this year I

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.470 
little bit too much also this year I
think<00:00:56.250> six<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.699> five<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> be<00:00:57.270> great

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
think six on five is going to be great

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.590 
think six on five is going to be great
much<00:00:58.469> more<00:00:58.649> consistent<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.850> much<00:01:00.449> higher

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
much more consistent a much higher

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.360 
much more consistent a much higher
percentage<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.230> conversion<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:01.920> well<00:01:02.129> as<00:01:02.280> a

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
percentage of conversion as well as a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.100 
percentage of conversion as well as a
five-man<00:01:02.940> defense<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.600> think<00:01:03.809> we'll<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:03.960> able

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
five-man defense I think we'll be able

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.670 
five-man defense I think we'll be able
to<00:01:04.260> wear<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.650> wear<00:01:05.010> teams<00:01:05.280> down<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:06.680> really

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
to wear to wear teams down and really

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.770 
to wear to wear teams down and really
pull<00:01:07.890> games<00:01:08.100> out<00:01:08.310> where<00:01:08.760> maybe<00:01:09.210> last<00:01:09.479> year<00:01:09.630> we

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
pull games out where maybe last year we

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.750 
pull games out where maybe last year we
fell<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.140> short<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:11.040> coupled<00:01:11.729> with

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
fell a little short that coupled with

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.080 
fell a little short that coupled with
our<00:01:12.000> strong<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.960> meter<00:01:13.140> offensive<00:01:13.950> players<00:01:14.159> is

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
our strong to meter offensive players is

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.700 
our strong to meter offensive players is
really<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> generate<00:01:15.900> our<00:01:16.049> offense<00:01:16.500> and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
really going to generate our offense and

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.990 
really going to generate our offense and
really<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> help<00:01:17.280> lock<00:01:17.610> down<00:01:17.820> our

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
really going to help lock down our

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.030 
really going to help lock down our
defensive<00:01:18.479> side<00:01:18.689> well<00:01:18.930> well<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.770> year<00:01:19.950> is

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.289 
defensive side well well this year is
different<00:01:20.159> because<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.700> think<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> lot<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.119> us

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
different because I think a lot of us

a big sense of team camaraderie that we

a big sense of team camaraderie that we
were<00:01:55.049> able<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.320> build<00:01:55.439> off<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.829> he's<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
were able to build off and he's in the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.039 
were able to build off and he's in the
pool<00:01:56.340> our<00:01:56.820> biggest<00:01:57.090> focus<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.570> defense

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
pool our biggest focus is the defense

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.319 
pool our biggest focus is the defense
defense<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.770> six<00:01:58.979> on<00:01:59.130> five<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.549> know<00:01:59.640> when<00:02:00.240> we

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
defense in six on five you know when we

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.609 
defense in six on five you know when we
get<00:02:00.450> those<00:02:00.540> opportunities<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:01.170> games<00:02:01.350> we<00:02:01.469> got

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
get those opportunities the games we got

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.080 
get those opportunities the games we got
to<00:02:01.680> be<00:02:01.740> able<00:02:01.829> to<00:02:01.950> finish<00:02:02.100> those<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.610> key<00:02:02.850> part

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
to be able to finish those and key part

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.789 
to be able to finish those and key part
of<00:02:03.149> that<00:02:03.270> is<00:02:03.360> not<00:02:03.540> allowing<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> opponents<00:02:04.680> to

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
of that is not allowing the opponents to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.370 
of that is not allowing the opponents to
get<00:02:05.159> those<00:02:05.340> opportunities<00:02:05.490> so

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
get those opportunities so

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.929 
get those opportunities so
they<00:02:06.439> function<00:02:06.829> on<00:02:06.920> both<00:02:07.070> suppose<00:02:07.399> both<00:02:07.700> ends

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
they function on both suppose both ends

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.999 
they function on both suppose both ends
of<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.060> pool<00:02:08.270> I'd<00:02:09.080> say<00:02:09.289> water<00:02:09.530> polo<00:02:09.770> is<00:02:09.979> a

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
of the pool I'd say water polo is a

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.370 
of the pool I'd say water polo is a
uniquely<00:02:12.160> physically<00:02:13.160> engaging<00:02:13.489> team<00:02:13.940> sport

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
uniquely physically engaging team sport

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.370 
uniquely physically engaging team sport
it<00:02:15.380> come<00:02:15.560> as<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.310> level<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.959> one-on-one<00:02:17.959> like

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
it come as a level of one-on-one like

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.530 
it come as a level of one-on-one like
grappling<00:02:18.950> wrestling<00:02:19.459> as<00:02:20.060> well<00:02:20.330> as<00:02:20.420> the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
grappling wrestling as well as the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.910 
grappling wrestling as well as the
overall<00:02:20.780> team<00:02:21.050> dynamic<00:02:21.560> it's<00:02:21.709> really

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
overall team dynamic it's really

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.530 
overall team dynamic it's really
interesting<00:02:22.190> for<00:02:22.640> it's<00:02:22.849> really<00:02:23.090> hard<00:02:23.330> to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
interesting for it's really hard to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.170 
interesting for it's really hard to
understand<00:02:23.989> at<00:02:24.140> first<00:02:24.170> but<00:02:25.130> there's<00:02:25.580> depth<00:02:25.880> in

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
understand at first but there's depth in

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.140 
understand at first but there's depth in
this<00:02:26.390> game<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:27.519> out<00:02:28.519> there<00:02:28.760> certain<00:02:29.030> other

this game that out there certain other

this game that out there certain other
sports<00:02:29.420> simply<00:02:29.750> don't<00:02:29.930> have<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:31.130> complexity

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
sports simply don't have a complexity

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.570 
sports simply don't have a complexity
that<00:02:32.500> even<00:02:33.500> after<00:02:33.590> playing<00:02:33.920> for<00:02:34.130> years<00:02:34.280> some

that even after playing for years some

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.040 
that even after playing for years some
things<00:02:34.640> are<00:02:35.000> still<00:02:35.180> hard<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.420> figure<00:02:35.569> out<00:02:35.780> you

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
things are still hard to figure out you

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.180 
things are still hard to figure out you
still<00:02:36.290> you're<00:02:36.680> constantly<00:02:37.040> learning

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
still you're constantly learning

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.920 
still you're constantly learning
constantly<00:02:37.880> trying<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.180> evolve<00:02:38.450> as<00:02:38.660> a<00:02:38.690> player
