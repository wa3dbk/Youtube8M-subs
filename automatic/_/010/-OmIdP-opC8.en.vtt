00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.389 

this<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.020> a<00:00:01.050> demonstration<00:00:01.620> of<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:01.949> pull<00:00:02.159> push

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
this is a demonstration of the pull push

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.789 
this is a demonstration of the pull push
technique<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:03.090> steering<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.689> figure<00:00:03.959> eight<00:00:04.140> the

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
technique of steering a figure eight the

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.499 
technique of steering a figure eight the
first<00:00:05.009> section<00:00:05.400> of<00:00:05.460> clip<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.910> slowed<00:00:06.120> down<00:00:06.330> to

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
first section of clip is slowed down to

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.030 
first section of clip is slowed down to
half<00:00:06.690> speed

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.129 

so<00:00:11.040> when<00:00:11.219> steering<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.940> right<00:00:12.210> need<00:00:13.019> to

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
so when steering to the right need to

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.270 
so when steering to the right need to
move<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.380> right<00:00:13.530> hand<00:00:13.740> at<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.860> top<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
move to right hand at the top of the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.070 
move to right hand at the top of the
whale<00:00:14.460> pull<00:00:15.089> down<00:00:15.330> with<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.570> right<00:00:15.780> hand

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
whale pull down with the right hand

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.950 
whale pull down with the right hand
while<00:00:16.949> sliding<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.609> left<00:00:17.789> hand<00:00:18.029> down<00:00:18.210> and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
while sliding the left hand down and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.630 
while sliding the left hand down and
then<00:00:19.109> changed<00:00:19.470> group<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.859> left<00:00:20.039> hand<00:00:20.250> pull

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
then changed group to the left hand pull

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.010 
then changed group to the left hand pull
should<00:00:20.820> left<00:00:21.000> hand<00:00:21.210> out<00:00:21.390> while<00:00:21.570> sliding<00:00:21.840> the

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
should left hand out while sliding the

at<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.369> steering<00:01:29.729> wheel<00:01:29.939> I'll<00:01:30.750> keep<00:01:30.990> your

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
at the steering wheel I'll keep your

at the steering wheel I'll keep your
eyes<00:01:31.289> outside<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.579> car<00:01:32.819> looking<00:01:33.750> where<00:01:33.960> you

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
eyes outside the car looking where you

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.859 
eyes outside the car looking where you
intend<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:35.390> with<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> little<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.780> of

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
intend to go with a little bit of

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.840 
intend to go with a little bit of
practice<00:01:37.289> that<00:01:37.319> we<00:01:37.469> come<00:01:37.710> very<00:01:37.950> very<00:01:38.250> easy<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
practice that we come very very easy and

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.069 
practice that we come very very easy and
you'll<00:01:39.329> be<00:01:39.420> able<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> do<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.840> without<00:01:40.020> even

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
you'll be able to do it without even

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.240 
you'll be able to do it without even
thinking<00:01:40.350> about<00:01:40.740> it

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.190 

best<00:01:46.910> place<00:01:47.090> to<00:01:47.120> practice<00:01:47.330> steering<00:01:47.870> is<00:01:48.050> on<00:01:48.170> a

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
best place to practice steering is on a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.250 
best place to practice steering is on a
car<00:01:48.740> park<00:01:49.040> but<00:01:49.810> unfortunately<00:01:50.810> when<00:01:50.930> I<00:01:50.960> film

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
car park but unfortunately when I film

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.340 
car park but unfortunately when I film
this<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.800> was<00:01:51.950> actually<00:01:52.250> a<00:01:52.280> quiet<00:01:52.730> day<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:54.050> so

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
this it was actually a quiet day and so

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.530 
this it was actually a quiet day and so
finding<00:01:54.650> an<00:01:54.770> empty<00:01:55.040> car<00:01:55.280> park<00:01:55.640> might<00:01:56.330> be<00:01:56.510> a

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
finding an empty car park might be a

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.300 
finding an empty car park might be a
little<00:01:56.810> tricky<00:02:02.710> so<00:02:03.710> return<00:02:04.010> the<00:02:04.160> wheel

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
little tricky so return the wheel

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.970 
little tricky so return the wheel
straight<00:02:04.670> again<00:02:05.320> we<00:02:06.320> will<00:02:06.440> bring<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.710> car<00:02:06.950> to

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
straight again we will bring the car to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.220 
straight again we will bring the car to
a<00:02:07.190> stop
