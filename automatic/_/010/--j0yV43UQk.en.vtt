00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 hello friends and this is a pilot video of 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.420
 a series of tuning models in which you 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.540
 You can directly take some 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.759
 participation and the first model that we 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.320
 you will tune this model 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.240
 lamborghini murselago 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.170
 and from the Russian magazine series 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.660
 supercars from publisher yes yes wall and 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.580
 I have two such models one model I 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.009
 I leave in original condition and 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.570
 the second model I will cut by 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.190
 the prototype of the car from the tuning studio 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.790
 twin racing by twin 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.910
 turbo 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.930
 and the first thing I want to show you is how 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:50.039
 I understand the model see the model already in 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.039
 principle is in the process of disassembling 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.440
 Some items have already been removed front 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.070
 headlights and what difficulties may arise 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.520
 dismantling 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.330
 various parts and in the case 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:09.420
 magazine series this is of course what 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:13.049
 Chinese pickers stick on dead 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.920
 most of the individual parts as you can see 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:21.330
 there are traces of glue on the back 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:24.210
 rear lights were not only glued 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.640
 into the seats themselves so collectors still 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.049
 smeared glue on the plane which 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.369
 adjacent lantern and connection with this 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.710
 Difficulties arise how to evaluate a part 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.670
 not to hurt her because she 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.950
 very tight to all planes 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:50.040
 and pick up this item is very difficult so 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.920
 like the children themselves are glasses too 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.759
 completely covered with glue as you can see one 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.469
 already broke and stayed in the back but this 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.649
 not scary because Farsi but I will 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.719
 glue on the glue further and 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.920
 cut some part of the rear bumper 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:11.360
 to be seen and imitation turbines 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.360
 various cooling systems 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.230
 Now I will try 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:21.260
 disconnect the dashboard mirrors 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:25.970
 glass and to remove the instrument panel 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.840
 need to ream rivets on which 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.440
 it is fixed and for this of course it is necessary 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.700
 use 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.680
 sharp drill bit and gently ream 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.240
 data rivets some people try 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.370
 Immediately just or break off or bend 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.640
 plastic I do not advise doing this because 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.300
 that in most cases he is just 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.780
 cracks and you can spoil yourself 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.680
 detail and upon further installation she 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.460
 will lose its appearance 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.830
 or there will be simply spoiled and more 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:05.680
 one nuance that I want to show you 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.780
 this is what the bottoms of the model data they are 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.770
 screwed as you can see with this 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.640
 peculiar 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.100
 head and I do not have unfortunately 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.470
 a screwdriver that I can unscrew 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:20.990
 I use just a small file 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.930
 triangular it is perfect for 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.720
 order to unscrew 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.170
 This view as you can see includes 2 in 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.870
 principle you can calmly in the absence of 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.610
 special screwdriver 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.610
 unscrew the bottom of these models and 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.620
 I'll show you the next short video. 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.750
 how do i remove the paint from the model 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.850
 i use no solvent so 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.000
 before putting the model there 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.580
 solvent all plastic parts they 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.490
 must be removed otherwise they just 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.630
 used and basically in this video 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:02.810
 you can offer your options 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.690
 the future coloring of this model, I still 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:09.770
 inclined to black color or in 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:12.800
 dark gray as the prototype of this 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.960
 models because as I see in 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.880
 the collection model is already yellow 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.210
 it makes no sense to paint the model the same color 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.340
 and the same model from the more expensive 

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:27.570
 manufacturer out uart 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:30.090
 in a box so bright green 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.510
 so in two of these colors of course 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:34.800
 I will not paint 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:40.620
 so if anyone has a suggestion 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:43.669
 for any interesting colors I write 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.490
 i will definitely take note of them 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:49.880
 thank you for your attention and see you in 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.880
 next video
