00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
things in here there's potash calcium

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.330 
things in here there's potash calcium
oxide<00:01:04.140> magnesium<00:01:04.409> iron<00:01:04.890> 20%<00:01:05.640> iron<00:01:07.280> you<00:01:08.280> know

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
oxide magnesium iron 20% iron you know

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.420 
oxide magnesium iron 20% iron you know
so<00:01:08.640> it's<00:01:08.790> pretty<00:01:08.909> good<00:01:09.060> stuff<00:01:10.040> to<00:01:11.040> aerate<00:01:11.250> the
