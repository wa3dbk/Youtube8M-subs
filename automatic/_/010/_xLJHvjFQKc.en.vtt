00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 and she's all in beauty here to require 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.210
 Excuses and they are alive 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.410
 motorcycle noise or something 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.719
 Because it's late afternoon, I got it. 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.350
 lighting a little better just in the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.789
 Actually, I just got home and I'm 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:23.220
 recording option of 4 and giga strokes 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.830
 Basque dealt with the image itself 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.869
 I'll do throughout the series, actually. 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.539
 I wanted to have a very big episode 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.579
 type the compilation of marks in one place only 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.649
 I already told them to stop the medium. 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.829
 brothers from daniel martins are on 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.680
 truth is a way of playing cards if 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.250
 Do you have any question I'm showing you? 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.230
 talking too much I wish I could even do 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.809
 but it's not something I have in mind 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.489
 with him 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.350
 works more or less so with this 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.309
 person choose a fourth anyone 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.010
 does not matter 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.020
 let's say she chose 12 of spades 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.020
 in the case of the deck 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:10.140
 It's not supposed to get harder for example. 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:16.250
 is down and up quite a bit on the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:20.850
 truth only person that I have four 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.189
 so sugar not responding because as 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.229
 I 'm doing I know it's not a 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.070
 Table're sure there are not four the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.869
 uncertainties 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.329
 So is your s4 card the person talking to 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.950
 so basically I 'm going to beauty then 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.340
 I do not want you to help me search. 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.159
 play by the deck when the person passes 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:48.570
 not to have a down without portfolio 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:51.509
 Stop it but this has a script 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.890
 no easy to sort a little soft by 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.750
 This is what I took here. 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.210
 confused with him because I was with 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.840
 down the new one is a bit tougher and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.840
 there strange 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.850
 the video because it was an essential thing 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.370
 You do not know, you do not like it. 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.400
 boston newspaper, we need to know if the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.060
 Pride in hurry but at least we were in 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:22.000
 guarulhos have here excuse God okay 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.570
 finally we are seven people for one 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.450
 Letter 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.950
 let's say she chose to choose here 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.440
 What you do is I have to control. 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.540
 15 to back up here I go 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.180
 teach more about it but this one 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.350
 episode version easy and simple 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.450
 It works more or less as you 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.430
 put it on top and do it here you go 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.060
 pick up this low carbon letter said 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.530
 The same time you do it, come on. 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.459
 board normally so type 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:55.390
 involving the cars so lost if 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:58.990
 were problem 08 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.060
 now it's eight what you do it will catch 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:04.390
 this one down low can be the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:10.530
 same time doing this here will take vai 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:12.580
 have it here 8 on top of the new 3d 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.260
 board is holding a paper with the 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:18.670
 Expansion and pick up the security guards 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:23.040
 12 two cards here 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.040
 done this you can save this 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.060
 problem 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.180
 done this is just doing the same thing for 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.820
 example he once shuffled the letter in 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.060
 second position, but weird 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.380
 Yes, what you do is bring it back and 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.840
 again the fourth person will be 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.800
 up there will not be this here you 8 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.690
 hence what I do as she is the 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.299
 last I can do is to make the 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.860
 The first time I do it, I'll go 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.570
 distribute letters and when it arrives 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.610
 near the last one begins to use the staff 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.320
 pulling the cards 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.360
 so it started working on oscar lÃ³ 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:02.049
 There are also a few houses if I throw everything. 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.820
 to lose 8 then I do one and sometimes 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.720
 the last one in Switzerland to make sure that 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.690
 I have one more year and then drop 8 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.880
 one more time because you just have to understand 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.850
 seems to pull here ensures that you enjoy the 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.739
 if he was standing on top 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.430
 pull with the two secured on top of 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:24.070
 new and is pulling so think that at 8 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.430
 I'm really sorry today. 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.260
 sometimes a person made what will 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.150
 make a political action 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.220
 You can talk like this, I got a pack. 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.980
 whole here face down on the 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.770
 sequence that she took care of the whole 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.540
 a stop while it's the bulletin below 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.120
 You can do this though, a workout. 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.560
 short and a tip I forget to give 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.080
 to you who came from far away from the hustle and bustle 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.270
 this here in the area were bad for example 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.090
 doing rubbish like this is a bit difficult 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.320
 So I try to do this here, dry. 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.450
 noise ahead 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.570
 here the month with a little behind what 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:05:01.240
 happens if you can see one 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.910
 Any neighbor that is how to separate inter 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.460
 action that makes it easy for you to 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.130
 two letters at last understood then let's go 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:12.250
 do to keep a little up a 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.530
 little indicator here goes down a bit 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.110
 here and bring it down so I do 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.090
 always asking for a frescurinha people 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:26.650
 nobody will see guys it was nobody looks 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:28.419
 which are usually on top of the cake 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:32.260
 cute for example seven actually 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:36.550
 Eight here behind is cute that I 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.919
 I do here and for example the person knows 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.419
 that the sacred deck of this form only 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.710
 she imagines that I have two letters 

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.910
 face up 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:49.870
 so choose here you will do by 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:53.860
 example making this move or for 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.930
 example this action or is to see that you 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:59.710
 you want to be president can generate false then 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.600
 this letter is a cheap one when you 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.720
 pulls so the person will not realize that 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.710
 the technician she thinks everyone 's arm 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:12.400
 below you turned once 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.620
 15 thousand times in ny are at last 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.530
 Sometimes makes the goal of bertin put end 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:20.230
 this letter is not certain whether it was to 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.240
 security and so you have a letter 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:25.870
 unlike I like to make a 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:27.580
 cut in the face necessary I think it does the 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.490
 face of the person working down 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.790
 8 in the case and by means of the 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.940
 so put it in the middle of nowhere look in the 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.740
 middle of the lawn so you talk of course 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.140
 that helps you make up a story 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.570
 any is of no importance 

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.070
 other that is the magic you doing 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.730
 You 're going to say what you want. 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:50.860
 teacher understand better understood 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.440
 better understand what it is, there you are 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.940
 shows a house down the dollar and 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.320
 You can know, you get the person. 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:01.540
 catch type or anyway, just thank you 

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:07.230
 for having attended until now the staff there 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:07.230
 big chatte fulfilled at the end of 2011
