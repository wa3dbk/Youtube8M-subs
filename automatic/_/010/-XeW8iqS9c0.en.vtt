00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.070
 hello people welcome to a new one 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:15.259
 edition of cinemas 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.849
 I have a wish as a spectator 

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.860
 pudding particles and how much will we get 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.630
 Today we also need the same 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.770
 to have a simple involved 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.660
 done more often 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.099
 the start that we also directly times 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:36.469
 I will directly times a couple 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:38.629
 minutes to the yeast and then 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.600
 something at the same time with this pure 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:45.019
 also better dissolve that ready with 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.879
 in brief make-up or 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.559
 Let's leave it five to ten times 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.649
 stand until the ihf dissolved 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.969
 you already see the closure here 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.129
 I have already resolved that 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.129
 flour sugar and a bowl the 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.679
 person my family into it then 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.699
 Mix the sugar for a short time 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.130
 Now I 'm doing such a ladder here 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.720
 coal in the mails and goes to the 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.620
 liquid in one of the founding so one 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.480
 kind advantage 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.350
 we already know that we have the yes 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:18.050
 Ever made more often just any 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.520
 liquid into it and then all 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:24.410
 a spoon of group quantities so be that 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.940
 Now we have the now times about 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.390
 Give brew for 15 minutes 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.560
 the remaining ten pull in ai ksc 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.420
 minutes have passed 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.760
 they only give the rest 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:41.820
 kind of heim gives her the butter 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:45.939
 and one egg now we represent the whole 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.869
 makes it possible to get machine gt marielle 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:55.119
 nice and just all in it 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:57.250
 and five minutes did one portray one 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.060
 does not look a nice ball 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.490
 several ships we think something here 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.039
 what rows misguided in the bowl 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.229
 still very much and naturally 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:09.729
 also use a kitchen block and now 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.420
 Let's leave it for two to three hours 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.190
 stand 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.830
 it always depends on the cold milk 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.360
 we used now I have only five 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.610
 long accurate so it will only be something 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.450
 Need longer if we of course 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.989
 room temperature have the weather frogs 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.450
 denominator 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.500
 when the dough rises, we'll get the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.260
 to accompany pudding 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.850
 we do that here I have one here 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.350
 finished pudding you can because in the 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.610
 machine of course also wonderful fields 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.980
 I do I think I've already one 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.830
 video made but today i have to 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.350
 No seat we give because the milk 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.519
 in 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.260
 I'll go and see how we get 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.269
 with relative arise in now 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.880
 when I read a few heights and for that 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:51.220
 compliant with the heating independently 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.739
 on intercepts of a cook to go 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.390
 I will have the pudding powder I have 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.390
 left something left there 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.359
 signature sugar and that could be the 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.489
 Market will be so in the direction 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.170
 We are waiting for this now 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.470
 cooks and then we will do it all 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.359
 The milk head only looks in years 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.600
 here is the mixture that will become this 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.820
 to give my much to the whole 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.410
 again with even more to come up with 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.720
 the nature is also noticed 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.160
 It was not a liquid when I was 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.180
 then something is boiled up again 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.010
 Let's leave the whole team 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.079
 or received 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.070
 we have our help here 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:35.640
 wonderful also meant more out 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.640
 excluded 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.140
 because now we have the policy formulas 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.590
 he at least form of the letters 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.850
 That's why we walk here for such a long time 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.989
 snake to form a fred out 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.739
 where both were I always believe 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:04:02.709
 do not break 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:03.989
 that was more so for 22 circles in the 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.220
 we'll do that 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:10.359
 of course we still need a floor 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:15.790
 we take here especially since even einsteigt and 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:20.949
 for my good off that best with 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:23.080
 somewhat inferior flour or with rolling pin 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:27.270
 we 'll do it then I'll take it 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.979
 now just cut your knife 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.130
 The dough is stuck to the top of the paste 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:34.479
 because there are no bugs polish 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.949
 the first particle who is early you 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.500
 could you pull something bigger 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.930
 depending on how much filling and dividing 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.280
 relationship you would like to have 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.660
 Of course, I could make different shapes 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.400
 do you have here is not always so 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.000
 you can do two-parted things too 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:52.540
 we can only do one-piece 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.940
 my a sacred do so 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:57.430
 Round for example, then I cut 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.639
 Here resumed the dough 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.560
 and I finished the second one again 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:05.320
 on the slide with this are now the 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.130
 both and I will all go to and 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.889
 Forward 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.570
 the parts are rolled out here 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.240
 wand is always something up there 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:14.699
 that means we can do that 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.680
 I also have the ships here 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.840
 the somewhat warm bothers but not further 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.430
 if you wanted to prevent that incidentally 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.860
 I train one if we are with them 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.060
 Cover clear film 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.080
 but I just got them in 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:32.830
 It can not be that dramatic now 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:33.819
 disturbed because you give each role then 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.220
 distribute something 

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:37.720
 that goes into the corners and cracks before 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.940
 we deny the whole pack now 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.400
 again rank with yolk so that it 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.270
 also get a nice shine 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.919
 Alternatively, we can also nachgebacken 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.550
 handing over something back 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:52.539
 one sees often paints the team 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.280
 everything is beautiful there it is not quite enough 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:57.060
 but not so bad may he do that 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.620
 putting on the band 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.319
 Now it's off with it in the oven 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.810
 180 degrees above bottom for about 15 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.800
 Find up to 20 minutes in detail and 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.349
 finish bake 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.830
 that's what happened to you now 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:12.940
 let it cool more 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.639
 then comes a little bit of metal 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.440
 take the female ball 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.050
 the parts are now cool you can 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.310
 lift up so nicely 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.009
 it does not work out anymore 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.360
 digging up ground with build up is here 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.669
 stuck on something 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.530
 just as legally solve quite well 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.659
 you want you can of course also with 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.610
 Frosting on the edge is just wanted 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.379
 so to take some water and to the 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.830
 give rand then you have something to 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:41.689
 heard outside but enough for me the one 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:44.240
 that has been our problem repeatedly 

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:44.990
 Particles missing wonderfully attacks in the 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.969
 Spring in it 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.590
 I like the computex I wish 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:50.120
 Of course, have fun imitating 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:53.169
 did not forget her 

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.169
 Until next time 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:02.169
 the
