00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.040
 At one time, 3 US companies 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.840
 infinite lexus this kuro spent a lot 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.779
 effort to prove that they 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.820
 not divisions nissan toyota and honda 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:22.590
 and high-grade American companies with 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.590
 his view on the creation of a car 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.890
 now the situation has changed in infinite 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.720
 too much nissan 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.150
 in lexus gives too much and and 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.050
 vice versa, but this year the company acura 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.850
 will prove 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.810
 these shifts in Ukraine on 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.810
 official traffic jams 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.360
 a new one will be offered at the start 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.220
 third generation acura mdx 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.110
 this is an off-road created in america but with 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.670
 aiming at the european premium 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.980
 main external feature 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.570
 This overall style and design is not 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.220
 too characteristic of the states 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.410
 dynamic formatted line 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.780
 face optics aggressive elements 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.640
 front bumper and most importantly when 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.500
 this mdx does not cause an impression 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.390
 American heavyweight though by 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.260
 This SUV is larger than 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.479
 bmw x5 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.860
 mercedes m-class and even range rover 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.229
 sport from size respectively 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.090
 depends on the price and status, and even 7-seater 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.990
 Salon and with a normal trunk on 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.700
 425 games approximate sight is concentrated in 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.650
 the interior and not so much in the design 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.750
 how much in the selection of materials and quality 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.520
 performance and this is the way the traditional 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.920
 problem for american cars which 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.410
 designed for dusty highways and eating 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.270
 fast food driving inside the same new vat 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.630
 carefully selected leather tree and 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.060
 metal and they make out obviously business you 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.070
 or premium options such as heating 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.410
 Steering TV for rear passengers 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.759
 electric drive of all parts and components in 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.130
 which can be wired 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.680
 12 speakers sound systems and complex

 360 degree camera attention 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.030
 detail and maximize with this 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.370
 ergonomics are implemented so that not 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.500
 evoke criticism and avoid comparisons with 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.960
 German business class in general find fault 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.880
 nothing but one fonts and 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.950
 digitizing instrument layout for 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.409
 interior solutions present tangible 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.750
 the amount of honda that for and the chickens are not 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.420
 quite logical but what is so logical 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.160
 motor new acura mdx does not offer 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.940
 delights at the start will be only one 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.580
 engine version 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.950
 volume three and a half liters power 297 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.780
 automatic box with sports 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.130
 mode despite the mass 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.230
 overall center of gravity 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.510
 in the dynamics of a real fact 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.000
 Yandex can not just go fast 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.890
 be able to do this with a new generation faster 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.390
 predecessor maximum speed increased to 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.070
 two hundred and twenty kilometers per hour 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.140
 acceleration to a hundred reduced to seven from 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.480
 half seconds all the salt in the new chassis 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.780
 and the new complex which is responsible for 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.400
 thrust distribution on different wheels 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.860
 branded a kurovsky wheel drive with 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.510
 Interior Ministry is now paired with the system 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.270
 dynamic weight stabilization 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.490
 electronics evaluates grip speed 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.959
 each wheel with a surface speed 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.030
 engine and body roll and 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.400
 accordingly throws traction between 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.580
 axles ranging from 10 to 90 percent 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.380
 more than that mdx electronics is capable 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.410
 briefly concentrate one hundred 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.470
 percent moment on one wheel and this 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.260
 really works and here's the time 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.250
 say a few words about the subtleties 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.989
 positioning drive in such 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.090
 cars is regarded more as 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.340
 additional and somewhat pontovy 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.860
 acura program element 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.750
 mdx are unlikely to be g Persian irida but if 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.489
 fate will throw you off the road 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.709
 reality you know what you have 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.480
 arsenal clearance of 207 millimeters and 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.730
 very efficient drive four on 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.440
 four even on acura mdx road tires 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.800
 without problems on difficult sections 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.540
 with mud clay and a puddle depth of 35 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.209
 centimeters besides disabling traction 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.130
 control releases everything 360 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.930
 newton meters of torque and then 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.579
 you have the opportunity for purely fan 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.530
 four by four aesthetics when 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.000
 this from the premium segment and in spite of 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.489
 this premium 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.290
 and supporting body structures new 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.120
 index sometimes reminds frame 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.610
 SUV and manage it very much 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.530
 just of course such an expensive segment is not 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.630
 emphasizes fuel consumption 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.940
 more if it comes to three and a half 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.680
 liter petrol v6 with american 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.989
 passport however in combined cycle 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.970
 acura mdx fits into 11 liters 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.950
 gasoline per 100 kilometers and it's not 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.720
 economical rather average rate 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.180
 the city certainly increases the appetite 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.519
 up to about 15 liters and off-road 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.739
 mode can pump out of tank and 18 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.130
 liters but still the same American approach 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:23.690
 to appetite allows acura mdx 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.110
 1590 second gasoline with no loss 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.060
 speakers 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.470
 one more thing which is not really 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.510
 often emphasized 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.370
 this modulation of braking force for 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.240
 car weighing 2 tons and high 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.460
 center of gravity 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.680
 acura mdx surprisingly predictable 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.330
 slow down of course here plays a role and 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.280
 multi-link suspension with stabilizer 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.110
 lateral stability which 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.270
 provides not just accuracy but 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.460
 comfortable. objective conclusion from fate 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.710
 official acura mdx will depend on 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.390
 two things first it really 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.930
 difficult segment in which each of 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.480
 competitors 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.400
 has a very strong second argument 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.470
 pricing policy of the new index for 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.450
 our market with other problems 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.850
 this car copes perfectly and 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.730
 on the highest level of equipment and 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.620
 quality of finish and assembly and power 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.570
 and status segment approximate 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.850
 SUVs in the form of acura mdx received 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:15.040
 a strong player can only wait for him 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:15.040
 valuation and first of all finance
