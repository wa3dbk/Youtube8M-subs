00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:07.220
 the samsung galaxy at first 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.420
 Look like a normal one 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.070
 it is changeable lens camera but 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.540
 not probably was in the last 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.110
 no camera on it for years 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.360
 away 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.340
 why that is so we see on the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.350
 front not on the first 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.490
 back it starts already on such a 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.289
 big screen 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.050
 he has no other camera so far 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.730
 commanded that are incredible 48 inches in 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.830
 the diagonal that also leads to that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.840
 almost no space left for controls 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.160
 but remains the second surprise 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.340
 comes when turn on 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.170
 it is android the camera 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.690
 based on the android operating system 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.969
 as well as the smart phone or how many 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.149
 Tablets also means that in reverse 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.950
 But the camera function is too 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.510
 become an app and we get that 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.379
 either by pressing the trigger 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.969
 or start the camera app 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.489
 after about a second or a while 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.800
 two seconds it looks like from 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.750
 We used to have a samsung cellphone 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.920
 a complete camera control over that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.799
 big touchscreen 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.350
 We can open photo by simply 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.000
 click or press the trigger 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.500
 but there are also many more 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.689
 Modes for selection 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.280
 here is the simulated mode dial 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.080
 I can choose 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.090
 how would I like to take pictures then 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.640
 Programmed automatic in time or 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.820
 fully automatic manual shutter 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.189
 attitudes or with different 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.560
 motivational programs samsung really has 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.479
 a huge number packed in it 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.670
 gives landscape its own program 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.600
 for macro for party recordings and such 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.270
 on and on 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.070
 quite amusing is the mode for children 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.930
 in that case we can get involved 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.970
 to seek sound that the child to 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.730
 be amazed 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.870
 camera should motivate or how it would be 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.680
 with brabus clearly the 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.660
 automatic programs are already available 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.220
 foreground even if we are at this 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.270
 Camera setting by hand 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.040
 can make 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.600
 In that case, then too 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.370
 Touchscreen operation first choice 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.530
 the fall the blind we can stay here 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.480
 the aperture over the touchscreen 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.320
 move 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.420
 Alternatively, one of the few 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.640
 Controls use the wheel up here 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.119
 Turn goes and confirm 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.580
 to press 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.530
 or is the next point I can do that 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.070
 iphone functions collection lenses 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.900
 use 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.250
 then i can get the functions i want 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.709
 want to set by keystroke 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.530
 Select and I turn on the lens ring 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.650
 to the desired setting 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.200
 make 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.240
 the touchscreen operation is only 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.920
 one of the clubs on this camera 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.410
 The real highlight is the full 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.930
 networking cameras with errors 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.760
 We have known that for a while and that is 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.730
 Of course, in the galaxy, nothing in it 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.410
 but a camera in the same time 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.150
 mobilfunk this is still a rarity 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.390
 and dslr with mobile 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.310
 this has never happened in the galaxy nx 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.690
 there is an old module in it 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.300
 here on the bottom of the 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.220
 memory card we have the sim card 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.170
 which is inserted in the misfortune is one 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.700
 sim card can be inserted in the camera 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.070
 always a connection in the 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.780
 build mobile network and then turn 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.550
 I can program the camera so 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.980
 that pictures automatically become a google 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.650
 plus account will be uploaded that you 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.200
 fully automatic landing in the dropbox 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.730
 to wherever they are in the cloud 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.530
 The whole thing is going to be sent 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.530
 fully automatic and will end up only 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.000
 limited by own data plan 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.840
 alternatively is significantly cheaper 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.340
 it over the wlan 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.590
 Of course that is also for 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.070
 disposal but that is of course still 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.350
 not everything 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.870
 since the device is based on android 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.430
 I can do full network connectivity like this 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.080
 pretty much anything with it hires what I 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.850
 also with an android handy can do 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.700
 that means I can of course facebook 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.320
 I can visit websites 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.090
 I can retrieve my e-mails I can 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.200
 I can send the photos 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.330
 edit via apps 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.680
 I can play games actually stands 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:46.100
 me the whole world is google places 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.930
 open on mobile is the galaxy xm 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.740
 all currently relevant networks 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.530
 on the go that means both umts 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.060
 also super fast lte to the choice and 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.770
 I can take my pictures with that 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.780
 Send pictures really fast now 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.640
 So who makes pictures on location and who 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.650
 will proceed as quickly as possible is 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.300
 hardly a faster option than 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.820
 find the galaxy nx 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.490
 who knows because I know what he is photographing 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.590
 Now the samsung also thought it 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.230
 there is an app called photo 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.750
 suggestions and this app combines one 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.489
 Cartography with blitzerfotos the 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.020
 can be found on the internet and the 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.350
 just taken on this point of view 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.760
 has been 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.380
 so I get to new places 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.120
 make an overview what is in mine 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.300
 environment what is it possibly worth ? 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.670
 Of course, there is still time to take pictures 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.730
 two ask the first how about it 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.890
 The picture quality only samsung obstructs the 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:37.990
 already known 20 megapixel sensor im 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.410
 aps c format offers one 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.660
 Photosensitivity of iso 100 to 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:46.210
 25,600 and the image quality we in 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.670
 laboratory determine diaz divided into 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.650
 one as soon as it is daylight that the 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:52.990
 pictures just in sharp detail are rich and 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.550
 they are absolutely rushing we have to 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:55.060
 but the photosensitivity upwards 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.460
 screw 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:01.330
 then the details take off relatively quickly 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.740
 iso 1600 then you can see okay here 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.260
 go the first fine elements 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:09.270
 lost at iso 3200 we are already 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:12.460
 more obvious and at 64 or iso 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.140
 12,800 further back the positive side 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.180
 this very strong intervening 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:20.380
 noise filter, however, that low 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:22.840
 Image noise before iso 6,400 or 12,800 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.000
 when you discover almost no stupid pixels 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.740
 the second important question is the post 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.690
 the speed if you are on it 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.440
 android is running as it stands around the 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.870
 performance 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.580
 there are again several answers 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:36.280
 Let's start with the good ones 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.890
 camera in standby mode then woke up 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.690
 after a press on the trigger or 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.910
 the power switch after two seconds to 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:44.650
 life is then relatively fast 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:46.510
 snapshot ready so that goes in 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.480
 less than five seconds sharp 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.340
 However, that is again or prevails 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.470
 then the autofocus has little light 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:55.480
 Partial problems and it takes time 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.750
 a while until he has the right sharpness 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.220
 has found the last point is that 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.110
 complete boats of the camera 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.580
 this is necessary 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.980
 For example, if you take the battery 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.470
 have or he was completely emptied 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:09.360
 this huge piece almost as much 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.460
 energy like no other camera 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.060
 when he is loaded then 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.340
 in there again 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.860
 the camera is started going round 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.180
 half a minute the difficult 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.250
 light situations, not the big one 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.080
 Touchscreen wants to use the stands 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.040
 also a seeker for the work 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.000
 also switched electronically 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:29.010
 automatically that means as soon as I start with that 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.990
 approach here, the picture changes 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.700
 to the seeker and I see him if one 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:35.040
 sharp a pretty big picture 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:37.260
 Here are some millions of pixels on 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.180
 works of mobile stuck in the galaxy 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:41.490
 nothing but I can call it 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.860
 it looks very funny in any case 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.940
 if i hold the camera it has samsung 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.560
 also not intended 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.970
 But what is it about I can 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.960
 communicate in a roundabout way 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:51.870
 I can skype for example 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.920
 install then I can either 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.290
 chat or i can do one 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.220
 Video calling can open up my 

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.780
 interlocutor 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.980
 but that does not it is possible 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.800
 of course that does not see me that 

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.060
 camera picture is taken here in front 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.440
 after many questions and answers 

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.380
 still remains a crucial one 

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:10.230
 open who needs the light galaxy nx 

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:12.360
 the camera costs with 1500 euro to 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.360
 start a very proud price the 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.800
 Competition is really full format 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.940
 mirror cameras but I think so 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.610
 is not really the competition 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.690
 the galaxy nx samsung shield here 

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.450

 circle of users on one of the fully networked 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.160

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:31.410

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.050
 wlan has everything available and the

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:38.010
 sensor is sufficient for this target group 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:40.520
 small but I think this audience 

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:40.520
 there is
