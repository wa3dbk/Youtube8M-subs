00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.620 
on my stove it's about a seven and then
what<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.489> want<00:03:11.639> to<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.819> is<00:03:11.940> get<00:03:12.060> your<00:03:12.209> pan<00:03:12.420> nice

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
what you want to do is get your pan nice

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.789 
what you want to do is get your pan nice
and<00:03:12.690> hot<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.870> want<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.230> make<00:03:16.410> sure<00:03:16.440> that

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
and hot and you want to make sure that

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.420 
and hot and you want to make sure that
your<00:03:16.950> oil<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:18.410> spread<00:03:19.410> all<00:03:19.680> even<00:03:20.069> evenly

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
your oil is spread all even evenly

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.379 
your oil is spread all even evenly
across<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.940> pan<00:03:22.040> okay<00:03:23.040> now<00:03:23.790> if<00:03:23.940> you<00:03:24.060> if<00:03:24.269> you

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:24.389 
across the pan okay now if you if you

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:25.729 
across the pan okay now if you if you
get<00:03:24.540> your<00:03:24.630> pan<00:03:24.810> hot<00:03:25.019> before<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.319> put<00:03:25.410> your<00:03:25.590> oil

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
get your pan hot before you put your oil

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.610 
get your pan hot before you put your oil
and<00:03:25.920> of<00:03:26.040> course<00:03:26.069> it's<00:03:26.340> going<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.519> smoke<00:03:27.620> now

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
and of course it's going to smoke now

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.819 
and of course it's going to smoke now
olive<00:03:29.519> oil<00:03:29.730> has<00:03:30.299> a<00:03:30.329> low<00:03:30.720> smoke<00:03:30.780> point<00:03:31.079> so<00:03:31.620> if

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
olive oil has a low smoke point so if

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.949 
olive oil has a low smoke point so if
you<00:03:32.340> leave<00:03:32.849> it<00:03:33.000> on<00:03:33.060> there<00:03:33.209> too<00:03:33.389> long<00:03:33.599> it's

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
you leave it on there too long it's

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.740 
you leave it on there too long it's
going<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.410> get<00:03:34.940> it's<00:03:35.940> going<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.180> start<00:03:36.329> smoking

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
going to get it's going to start smoking

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.120 
going to get it's going to start smoking
so<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:36.930> could<00:03:37.200> use<00:03:37.319> something<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:37.680> peanut

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
so you could use something like peanut

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.680 
so you could use something like peanut
oil<00:03:38.340> or<00:03:38.519> whatever<00:03:38.700> if<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.060> wanted<00:03:39.359> to<00:03:39.510> and

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
oil or whatever if you wanted to and

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.330 
oil or whatever if you wanted to and
it's<00:03:40.049> got<00:03:40.169> a<00:03:40.200> higher<00:03:40.380> smoke<00:03:40.620> point<00:03:40.650> but<00:03:41.310> I

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
it's got a higher smoke point but I

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.370 
it's got a higher smoke point but I
basically<00:03:41.760> only<00:03:42.060> let<00:03:42.389> it<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:42.810> don't<00:03:42.959> only<00:03:43.230> has

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
basically only let it you don't only has

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.409 
basically only let it you don't only has
to<00:03:43.530> warm<00:03:43.709> up<00:03:43.889> for<00:03:44.130> you<00:03:44.730> know<00:03:44.849> about<00:03:45.060> about<00:03:45.239> a

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
to warm up for you know about about a

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:47.539 
to warm up for you know about about a
min<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.870> a<00:03:45.900> half<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:46.260> two<00:03:46.410> minutes<00:03:46.709> now<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:47.370> know

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
min and a half to two minutes now I know

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.159 
min and a half to two minutes now I know
one<00:03:47.819> that's<00:03:47.849> hot<00:03:48.150> because<00:03:48.389> I'll<00:03:48.569> see<00:03:48.840> the<00:03:48.959> oil

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
one that's hot because I'll see the oil

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.110 
one that's hot because I'll see the oil
start<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.650> bubble<00:03:49.980> I<00:03:50.099> don't<00:03:50.579> want<00:03:50.700> put<00:03:50.819> my<00:03:50.940> egg

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
start to bubble I don't want put my egg

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.670 
start to bubble I don't want put my egg
on<00:03:51.329> until<00:03:51.959> the<00:03:52.200> oil<00:03:52.230> is<00:03:53.389> really<00:03:54.389> hot<00:03:54.510> okay

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
on until the oil is really hot okay

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.890 
on until the oil is really hot okay
now<00:03:56.160> I'm<00:03:56.310> not<00:03:56.489> I'm<00:03:56.700> not<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.940> cook<00:03:57.209> so<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:57.510> can't

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
now I'm not I'm not a cook so I can't

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.720 
now I'm not I'm not a cook so I can't
tell<00:03:58.109> you<00:03:58.200> what<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.440> temperature<00:03:58.829> is<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.190> you

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
tell you what the temperature is and you

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.039 
tell you what the temperature is and you
know<00:03:59.849> Alton<00:04:00.180> Brown<00:04:00.359> could<00:04:00.569> probably<00:04:00.750> tell<00:04:00.959> you

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
know Alton Brown could probably tell you

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.110 
know Alton Brown could probably tell you
exactly<00:04:01.380> what<00:04:01.650> what<00:04:02.549> temperature<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.030> need

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
exactly what what temperature you need

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.390 
exactly what what temperature you need
to<00:04:03.239> cook<00:04:03.359> it<00:04:03.419> at<00:04:03.630> but<00:04:04.380> he'd<00:04:04.650> probably<00:04:04.680> yell<00:04:05.280> at

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
to cook it at but he'd probably yell at

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.979 
to cook it at but he'd probably yell at
me<00:04:05.519> for<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.760> way<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:05.910> cracked<00:04:06.239> my<00:04:06.299> eggs<00:04:06.540> too<00:04:06.780> so

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
me for the way I cracked my eggs too so

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.750 
me for the way I cracked my eggs too so
it<00:04:07.109> doesn't<00:04:07.349> matter<00:04:07.470> so<00:04:08.190> anyways<00:04:08.459> I<00:04:08.549> want<00:04:08.700> to

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
it doesn't matter so anyways I want to

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.809 
it doesn't matter so anyways I want to
get<00:04:08.849> it<00:04:08.940> nice<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.120> hot<00:04:09.329> now<00:04:10.610> basically<00:04:11.610> you'll

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
get it nice and hot now basically you'll

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.670 
get it nice and hot now basically you'll
know<00:04:12.000> when<00:04:12.209> it's<00:04:12.360> it<00:04:12.540> there's<00:04:12.930> two<00:04:13.170> two<00:04:13.500> ways

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
know when it's it there's two two ways

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.960 
know when it's it there's two two ways
you<00:04:13.799> can<00:04:13.890> tell<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.129> it's<00:04:14.280> hot<00:04:14.370> enough

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
you can tell that it's hot enough

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.670 
you can tell that it's hot enough
the<00:04:15.120> one<00:04:15.300> is<00:04:15.450> that<00:04:15.480> you'll<00:04:15.720> see<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:16.110> oil<00:04:16.140> start

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
the one is that you'll see the oil start

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.370 
the one is that you'll see the oil start
to<00:04:16.890> start<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:18.000> kind<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.269> bubble<00:04:18.540> up<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.870> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
to start to kind of bubble up and the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.530 
to start to kind of bubble up and the
other<00:04:19.500> one<00:04:19.680> is<00:04:19.799> when<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.010> drop<00:04:20.100> my<00:04:20.310> egg<00:04:20.610> on<00:04:20.820> it'll

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
other one is when I drop my egg on it'll

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.000 
other one is when I drop my egg on it'll
automatically<00:04:21.959> start<00:04:22.230> to<00:04:22.320> cook<00:04:22.470> instantly

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
automatically start to cook instantly

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.140 
automatically start to cook instantly
and<00:04:23.190> that's<00:04:23.580> what<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:23.820> want<00:04:25.490> if<00:04:26.490> some<00:04:26.730> pans<00:04:26.970> of

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
and that's what you want if some pans of

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.120 
and that's what you want if some pans of
course<00:04:27.300> do<00:04:27.510> take<00:04:27.720> longer<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.200> heat<00:04:28.380> up<00:04:28.410> and<00:04:28.770> you

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
course do take longer to heat up and you

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.620 
course do take longer to heat up and you
could<00:04:29.430> if<00:04:29.580> you<00:04:29.670> wanted<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.060> turn<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.360> up<00:04:30.510> on

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
could if you wanted to turn it up on

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.540 
could if you wanted to turn it up on
high<00:04:30.870> so<00:04:31.470> that<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:31.710> pan<00:04:31.890> starts<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.430> get

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
high so that the pan starts to get

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.830 
high so that the pan starts to get
really<00:04:32.700> hot<00:04:32.940> and<00:04:33.090> then<00:04:33.210> turn<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.630> heat<00:04:33.810> down

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
really hot and then turn the heat down

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.380 
really hot and then turn the heat down
to<00:04:34.050> to<00:04:34.740> medium-high<00:04:35.100> but<00:04:35.490> I<00:04:35.610> just<00:04:36.030> put<00:04:36.180> it<00:04:36.330> on

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 
to to medium-high but I just put it on

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.940 
to to medium-high but I just put it on
medium-high<00:04:36.780> about<00:04:37.140> a<00:04:37.170> seven<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.620> only<00:04:37.740> takes

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
medium-high about a seven it only takes

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.300 
medium-high about a seven it only takes
a<00:04:38.040> few<00:04:38.070> minutes<00:04:38.340> for<00:04:38.550> it<00:04:38.700> to<00:04:38.790> heat<00:04:39.030> up<00:04:39.060> nice

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
a few minutes for it to heat up nice

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.290 
a few minutes for it to heat up nice
okay<00:04:41.310> so<00:04:41.370> it's<00:04:41.580> been<00:04:41.730> about<00:04:41.820> three<00:04:42.180> minutes

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
okay so it's been about three minutes

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
that my pan is kind of probably warped a

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.110 
that my pan is kind of probably warped a
little<00:05:08.310> bit<00:05:08.430> because<00:05:08.520> I've<00:05:08.670> had<00:05:08.820> this<00:05:08.940> thing

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
little bit because I've had this thing

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.970 
little bit because I've had this thing
for<00:05:09.180> like<00:05:09.480> ever<00:05:09.750> I<00:05:10.050> mean<00:05:10.470> they<00:05:10.650> brought<00:05:10.860> this

thing over on the Mayflower you'll

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.980 
thing over on the Mayflower you'll
notice<00:05:13.410> that<00:05:13.500> a<00:05:13.560> lot<00:05:13.620> of<00:05:13.770> my<00:05:13.950> oil<00:05:14.160> is<00:05:14.460> down<00:05:14.990> here

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
notice that a lot of my oil is down here

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.500 
notice that a lot of my oil is down here
in<00:05:16.170> the<00:05:16.200> you<00:05:16.890> know<00:05:17.010> down<00:05:17.280> the<00:05:17.460> bottom<00:05:17.820> where

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
in the you know down the bottom where

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:19.760 
in the you know down the bottom where
it's<00:05:18.630> kind<00:05:18.810> of<00:05:18.840> sloped<00:05:19.140> down<00:05:19.350> a<00:05:19.380> little<00:05:19.560> bit

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
it's kind of sloped down a little bit

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.190 
it's kind of sloped down a little bit
which<00:05:20.370> which<00:05:20.669> which<00:05:21.150> indicates<00:05:21.750> I<00:05:21.900> don't<00:05:22.080> even

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
which which which indicates I don't even

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.540 
which which which indicates I don't even
need<00:05:22.380> a<00:05:22.440> tablespoon<00:05:22.830> I<00:05:23.100> could<00:05:23.250> probably<00:05:23.400> get

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
need a tablespoon I could probably get

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.920 
need a tablespoon I could probably get
by<00:05:23.700> with<00:05:23.850> like<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.000> quarter<00:05:24.300> of<00:05:24.360> a<00:05:24.419> tablespoon

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
by with like a quarter of a tablespoon

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.020 
by with like a quarter of a tablespoon
but<00:05:25.140> I<00:05:25.320> always<00:05:25.740> throw<00:05:25.919> a<00:05:25.980> tablespoon<00:05:26.640> on<00:05:26.820> there

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
but I always throw a tablespoon on there

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.750 
but I always throw a tablespoon on there
because<00:05:27.210> it<00:05:27.630> coats<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.110> whole<00:05:28.350> pan<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:28.950> that

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760 
because it coats the whole pan and that

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.030 
because it coats the whole pan and that
way<00:05:29.910> it<00:05:30.030> doesn't<00:05:30.240> get<00:05:30.720> the<00:05:30.870> pan<00:05:31.050> too<00:05:31.260> hot<00:05:31.440> now

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
way it doesn't get the pan too hot now

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.320 
way it doesn't get the pan too hot now
you<00:05:32.100> can<00:05:32.370> if<00:05:32.490> you<00:05:32.580> want<00:05:32.700> to<00:05:32.910> of<00:05:33.000> course<00:05:33.030> you<00:05:33.210> to
