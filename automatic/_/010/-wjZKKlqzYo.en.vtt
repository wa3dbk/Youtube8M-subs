00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.349
 vehicles for delivery 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.210
 feed etc etc. in bulk are 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.869
 studied to ensure productivity and 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.869
 reliability 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.669
 the large roof opening allows a 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.449
 very fast loading and ensures a 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.449
 optimal filling 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.780
 the form in chorus seedlings bulk echoes 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.730
 allows volume optimization 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.850
 the vehicles are very compact 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.180
 only 10 meters 34 for 52 meters 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.090
 cubes 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.239
 the lowered center of gravity ensures a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.280
 excellent stability thanks to the last 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.260
 stories hydraulically assisted access 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.210
 simplified even for tight places 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.920
 it's axles also allow a 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.920
 help with setting up at the silo 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.280
 a bulk echo trailer associated with 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.780
 a hydraulic assistance tractor 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.640
 four wheel drive 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.939
 it is the assurance of an excellent 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.939
 traction 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.229
 the screw drain system 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.299
 archimedes provides a flow of more than 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.210
 100 tonnes per hour without dust or 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.130
 food blends through the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.259
 radio control and on-board camera 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.500
 the implementation at the silo is extremely 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.500
 quick 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.590
 when the silos are not equipped 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.600
 an opening in you it is possible 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.980
 emptying and wind tunnel with a 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.980
 flow rate of 25 tons per hour 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.150
 equipped with a pit dump hatch 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.840
 the return of raw materials 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.090
 is carried out with large flows 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.890
 the diesel engine to house on the semi the 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.480
 makes it totally autonomous and allows 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.480
 use in zero-rated fuel 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:33.080
 each compartment is equipped with a 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.080
 hatch bd tempt you 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.600
 the configuration of compartmentalization 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.520
 is adapted to the needs 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.420
 it is between 5 and 10 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.430
 compartment cast iron extraction 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.160
 trough is done with a carrier 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.160
 chain pallets and florac lodge 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.230
 allowing excellent cleaning the 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.720
 will carry string does not require any 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.940
 maintenance for a complete emptying 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.940
 The echo fans can be associated as an option 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.220
 our materials are designed and manufactured 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.319
 to meet the machine directive 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.319
 European Union 42nd 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.720
 it also has a reception rce 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.960

 opening and 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.050
 closing hatches with a 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.320
 gps positioning an insurance for the 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.730
 traceability the automaton also manages the 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.960
 start of the different organs

 design and production of 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.659
 food vehicles since manufacture 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.659
 galvanized chassis 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.120
 studies are managed internally through 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.459
 a ca or in 3d tanks to carry 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.630
 are fully designed and adapted to 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.630
