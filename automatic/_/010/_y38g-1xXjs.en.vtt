up in the technique but it's simply not

want you to become more aware in your
practice<00:00:31.410> swings<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.920> where<00:00:32.130> your<00:00:32.309> low<00:00:32.520> point

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
practice swings of where your low point

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.110 
practice swings of where your low point
is<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.420> want<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.809> low<00:00:34.020> point<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.500> your<00:00:34.620> swing

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
is we want the low point of your swing

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.360 
is we want the low point of your swing
where<00:00:36.120> you'll<00:00:36.270> be<00:00:36.390> brushing<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> grass<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:38.250> be

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
where you'll be brushing the grass to be

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.020 
where you'll be brushing the grass to be
somewhere<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> center<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.570> feet

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
somewhere in the center of your feet

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.340 
somewhere in the center of your feet
where<00:00:42.030> you'll<00:00:42.210> be<00:00:42.329> positioning<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.899> ball<00:00:43.079> I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
where you'll be positioning the ball I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.069 
where you'll be positioning the ball I
think<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.700> something<00:00:44.910> elite<00:00:45.480> players<00:00:45.809> do

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
think this is something elite players do

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.299 
think this is something elite players do
and<00:00:46.110> professional<00:00:46.829> players<00:00:47.010> do

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and professional players do

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.069 
and professional players do
instinctively<00:00:48.270> even<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:48.719> they're<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:48.930> aware

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
instinctively even if they're not aware

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.139 
instinctively even if they're not aware
of<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.469> yes<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.399> their<00:00:50.550> practice<00:00:50.910> swings

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
of it yes in their practice swings

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.119 
of it yes in their practice swings
they're<00:00:51.390> getting<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.660> feeling<00:00:52.110> for<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> speed

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
they're getting a feeling for the speed

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.010 
they're getting a feeling for the speed
of<00:00:53.280> swing<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.640> need<00:00:53.879> but<00:00:54.780> they're<00:00:54.899> also

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
of swing they need but they're also

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.630 
of swing they need but they're also
getting<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.440> feeling<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.039> developing<00:00:56.520> the

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
getting a feeling of developing the

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.790 
getting a feeling of developing the
correct<00:00:56.910> low<00:00:57.180> point<00:00:57.510> where<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.410> golf<00:00:58.590> pole

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
correct low point where the golf pole

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.849 
correct low point where the golf pole
will<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.100> positioned<00:01:00.289> maybe<00:01:01.289> when<00:01:01.500> you<00:01:01.620> become

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
will be positioned maybe when you become

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.349 
will be positioned maybe when you become
a<00:01:01.920> little<00:01:02.100> more<00:01:02.340> aware<00:01:02.609> of<00:01:02.789> where<00:01:02.969> your<00:01:03.180> low

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
a little more aware of where your low

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.329 
a little more aware of where your low
point<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.260> might<00:01:04.439> start<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> realize<00:01:05.129> that

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
point is you might start to realize that

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.859 
point is you might start to realize that
your<00:01:05.460> low<00:01:05.670> points<00:01:06.030> too<00:01:06.210> much<00:01:06.390> towards<00:01:06.780> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
your low points too much towards the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.289 
your low points too much towards the
right<00:01:07.080> side<00:01:07.549> now<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.610> instinctively<00:01:09.000> just

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
right side now I instinctively just

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.390 
right side now I instinctively just
trying<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.960> move<00:01:10.320> your<00:01:10.530> little<00:01:10.740> point<00:01:11.010> more<00:01:11.250> to

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
trying to move your little point more to

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.550 
trying to move your little point more to
the<00:01:11.490> middle<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.729> your<00:01:11.850> feet<00:01:12.119> your<00:01:13.049> mechanics

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the middle of your feet your mechanics

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.260 
the middle of your feet your mechanics
can<00:01:13.710> change<00:01:14.010> maybe<00:01:14.610> you'll<00:01:14.850> start<00:01:15.090> with<00:01:15.210> a

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
can change maybe you'll start with a

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.310 
can change maybe you'll start with a
little<00:01:15.479> more<00:01:15.570> weight<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:15.869> your<00:01:15.900> left<00:01:15.990> foot

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
little more weight in your left foot

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.350 
little more weight in your left foot
naturally<00:01:16.619> your<00:01:17.490> left<00:01:17.700> shoulder<00:01:18.060> will<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.330> a

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
naturally your left shoulder will be a

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.320 
naturally your left shoulder will be a
little<00:01:18.630> lower<00:01:19.159> it'll<00:01:20.159> also<00:01:20.250> stop<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.880> hanging

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
little lower it'll also stop you hanging

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.880 
little lower it'll also stop you hanging
back<00:01:21.540> trying<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> lift<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.320> ball<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> air

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
back trying to lift the ball in the air

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
back trying to lift the ball in the air
definitely<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> cause<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.030> low<00:01:24.180> point

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
definitely a cause of the low point

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.649 
definitely a cause of the low point
being<00:01:25.200> too<00:01:25.380> much<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> right<00:01:25.979> side<00:01:26.659> maybe

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
being too much to the right side maybe

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.969 
being too much to the right side maybe
it'll<00:01:27.869> become<00:01:27.930> aware<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.409> your<00:01:28.530> low<00:01:28.650> points

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
it'll become aware that your low points

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.050 
it'll become aware that your low points
too<00:01:29.100> much<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.549> left

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
too much to the left

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.240 
too much to the left
you're<00:01:30.420> leaning<00:01:30.659> into<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.079> shot<00:01:31.380> again

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you're leaning into the shot again

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.819 
you're leaning into the shot again
trying<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.780> make<00:01:33.960> your<00:01:34.110> low<00:01:34.259> point<00:01:34.500> more<00:01:34.710> in

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
trying to make your low point more in

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.219 
trying to make your low point more in
the<00:01:34.920> center<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.369> feet<00:01:36.229> instinctively

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the center of your feet instinctively

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.020 
the center of your feet instinctively
start<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.710> rotate<00:01:37.979> through<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.579> shot<00:01:38.790> better

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
start to rotate through the shot better

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.920 
start to rotate through the shot better
creating<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.140> correct<00:01:40.290> low<00:01:40.619> point<00:01:41.899> it's<00:01:42.899> very

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
creating the correct low point it's very

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.899 
creating the correct low point it's very
important<00:01:43.560> in<00:01:43.710> your<00:01:43.920> practice<00:01:44.310> swings<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.790> get

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
important in your practice swings to get

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.719 
important in your practice swings to get
a<00:01:44.939> feeling<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.600> where<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:46.020> low<00:01:46.170> point<00:01:46.409> is
