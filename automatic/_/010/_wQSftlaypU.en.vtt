it<00:00:33.870> goes<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.590> around<00:00:35.090> much<00:00:36.090> better<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:37.170> have

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
it goes all around much better you have

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.590

spread<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.569> out<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.730> put

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
spread it out like this you can put

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.250 
spread it out like this you can put
later<00:02:12.840> or<00:02:13.319> as<00:02:14.069> much<00:02:14.790> as<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.180> want<00:02:15.420> but<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.020> has

later or as much as you want but it has

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.809 
later or as much as you want but it has
to

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
to

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.509 
to
or<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.569> portray<00:02:18.109> now<00:02:18.769> I<00:02:18.799> do<00:02:19.010> the<00:02:19.280> same<00:02:19.459> thing

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
or the portray now I do the same thing

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.410 
or the portray now I do the same thing
only<00:02:20.060> this<00:02:20.569> time<00:02:20.900> you<00:02:21.349> have<00:02:21.790> approximately<00:02:22.790> to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
only this time you have approximately to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.259 
only this time you have approximately to
make<00:02:23.629> as<00:02:23.870> flat<00:02:24.319> as<00:02:24.560> you<00:02:24.829> want<00:02:25.370> because<00:02:26.090> you

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
make as flat as you want because you

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.449 
make as flat as you want because you
cannot<00:02:26.629> press<00:02:27.019> it<00:02:27.230> too<00:02:27.590> much<00:02:28.959> under<00:02:29.959> it<00:02:30.109> and<00:02:30.459> I

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
cannot press it too much under it and I

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.080 
cannot press it too much under it and I
press<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.030> meat<00:02:32.209> down<00:02:32.870> like<00:02:33.709> this<00:02:33.980> so<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.370> it

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
press the meat down like this so that it

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.050 
press the meat down like this so that it
goes<00:02:35.299> into<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:36.530> cooktop<00:02:37.239> velocity<00:02:39.909> then<00:02:40.909> I

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
goes into the cooktop velocity then I

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.670 
goes into the cooktop velocity then I
cover<00:02:41.359> the<00:02:41.989> cooktop

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
cover the cooktop

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.940 
cover the cooktop
see<00:02:43.159> I<00:02:43.189> cannot<00:02:43.669> spread<00:02:44.150> spread<00:02:44.689> it<00:02:44.840> like<00:02:45.079> I<00:02:45.379> did

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
see I cannot spread spread it like I did

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.110 
see I cannot spread spread it like I did
the<00:02:46.159> first<00:02:46.310> time<00:02:47.019> that's<00:02:48.019> why<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.260> has<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:48.620> be

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
the first time that's why it has to be

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.979 
the first time that's why it has to be
the<00:02:50.120> thickness<00:02:50.599> that<00:02:50.629> you<00:02:50.840> want<00:02:51.169> just<00:02:52.989> few

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
the thickness that you want just few

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.449 
the thickness that you want just few
times<00:02:54.290> and<00:02:55.269> that's<00:02:56.269> all<00:02:56.540> it<00:02:56.840> means<00:02:57.129> it's<00:02:58.129> okay

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
times and that's all it means it's okay

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.449 
times and that's all it means it's okay
to<00:02:58.519> overlap<00:02:59.209> and<00:02:59.449> the<00:02:59.930> other<00:03:00.459> portions

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
to overlap and the other portions

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.869 
to overlap and the other portions
because<00:03:02.090> once<00:03:02.989> you<00:03:03.169> are<00:03:03.199> done<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.949> you<00:03:04.579> smooth

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
because once you are done and you smooth

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.899 
because once you are done and you smooth
it<00:03:04.909> out<00:03:05.180> with<00:03:05.239> water<00:03:05.719> a<00:03:06.019> little<00:03:06.560> kick<00:03:06.859> and<00:03:07.189> it's

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
from the edge of the pan we just go

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.810 
from the edge of the pan we just go
along<00:04:21.209> the<00:04:21.660> hand<00:04:22.350> nothing<00:04:23.160> will<00:04:23.400> happen<00:04:23.580> to

along the hand nothing will happen to

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.270 
along the hand nothing will happen to
the<00:04:24.090> cooktop<00:04:24.509> you<00:04:24.780> push<00:04:25.020> it<00:04:25.229> against<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.889> end

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
the cooktop you push it against the end

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.180 
the cooktop you push it against the end
the<00:04:26.820> proof<00:04:27.060> that<00:04:27.330> will<00:04:27.630> come<00:04:27.930> forward<00:04:28.860> by

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
the proof that will come forward by

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.029 
the proof that will come forward by
itself<00:04:29.580> now<00:04:30.360> it<00:04:30.630> will<00:04:30.780> look<00:04:31.020> this<00:04:31.229> way<00:04:31.530> away

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
itself now it will look this way away

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.689 
itself now it will look this way away
from<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.580> edge<00:04:32.729> if<00:04:33.690> you<00:04:33.870> notice<00:04:34.349> here<00:04:34.800> here

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
from the edge if you notice here here

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.070 
from the edge if you notice here here
now<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.360> put<00:04:36.780> some<00:04:37.289> vegetable<00:04:37.860> lay<00:04:38.729> almost<00:04:39.630> on

now I put some vegetable lay almost on

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.930 
now I put some vegetable lay almost on
each<00:04:40.580> square<00:04:41.580> if<00:04:42.509> you<00:04:42.720> don't<00:04:42.960> want<00:04:43.229> to<00:04:43.500> use

little bit and then you have to put some

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.270 
little bit and then you have to put some
water<00:04:51.389> knead<00:04:51.810> otherwise<00:04:52.320> it<00:04:52.530> will<00:04:52.710> burn

that<00:05:43.580> the<00:05:44.580> moisture<00:05:45.800> vapor<00:05:46.800> goes<00:05:47.250> out<00:05:52.039> this<00:05:53.039> is

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
that the moisture vapor goes out this is

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:59.180 
that the moisture vapor goes out this is
how<00:05:53.639> it<00:05:53.849> looks<00:05:54.120> when<00:05:54.840> cooked<00:05:55.550> then<00:05:57.979> you<00:05:58.979> let<00:05:59.159> it

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
how it looks when cooked then you let it

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.860 
how it looks when cooked then you let it
cool<00:05:59.550> down<00:06:00.800> like<00:06:01.800> five<00:06:02.340> minutes<00:06:02.940> before<00:06:03.419> you

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
cool down like five minutes before you

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.689 
cool down like five minutes before you
serve<00:06:04.110> it<00:06:04.169> will<00:06:04.530> be<00:06:04.680> very<00:06:04.979> hot

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699
