00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
here we have a variety of Flint glass

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.900 
here we have a variety of Flint glass
we're<00:00:02.939> going<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.120> talk<00:00:03.360> about<00:00:03.540> this<00:00:03.810> today<00:00:04.049> and

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:04.910 
we're going to talk about this today and

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.460 
we're going to talk about this today and
these<00:00:05.910> are<00:00:06.150> some<00:00:06.330> nice<00:00:06.480> examples<00:00:06.690> there's<00:00:07.379> a

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
these are some nice examples there's a

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.950 
these are some nice examples there's a
number<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.950> patterns<00:00:08.189> in<00:00:08.610> each<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:09.179> number<00:00:09.719> of

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
number of patterns in each a number of

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.049 
number of patterns in each a number of
different<00:00:10.500> shapes<00:00:10.559> in<00:00:11.040> each<00:00:11.219> pattern<00:00:11.880> that

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
different shapes in each pattern that

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.640 
different shapes in each pattern that
you<00:00:12.179> can<00:00:12.210> take<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.540> look<00:00:12.750> at<00:00:12.929> but<00:00:13.110> this<00:00:13.320> Flint

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
you can take a look at but this Flint

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.950 
you can take a look at but this Flint
glass<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.160> in<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.059> era<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.770> 1850<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:17.960> little

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
glass is in the era of 1850 a little

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.140 
glass is in the era of 1850 a little
earlier<00:00:19.289> little<00:00:19.619> later<00:00:19.770> is<00:00:20.070> prior<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
earlier little later is prior to the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.130 
earlier little later is prior to the
Civil<00:00:21.420> War<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:22.430> 1860<00:00:23.430> and<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:24.330> reason<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:24.960> call

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
Civil War of 1860 and the reason we call

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.230 
Civil War of 1860 and the reason we call
it<00:00:25.199> Flint<00:00:25.529> glass<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.099> because<00:00:26.340> there<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.029> an

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
it Flint glass is because there is an

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.540 
it Flint glass is because there is an
awful<00:00:27.660> lot<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.930> lead<00:00:28.260> in<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.039> when<00:00:29.429> you

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
awful lot of lead in here and when you

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.939 
awful lot of lead in here and when you
pick<00:00:29.760> up<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.029> piece<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.660> can<00:00:31.349> show<00:00:31.679> you<00:00:31.740> an

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
pick up a piece I can show you an

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.720 
pick up a piece I can show you an
example<00:00:32.460> like<00:00:33.030> this<00:00:33.290> compote<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.370> pick<00:00:35.579> it

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
example like this compote if you pick it

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.840 
example like this compote if you pick it
up<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:37.440> ring<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.890> can<00:00:38.070> hear<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.489> sound

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
up and you ring you can hear the sound

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.180 
up and you ring you can hear the sound
of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> Bell<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.840> Bell<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.710> caused<00:00:40.980> from

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
of the Bell and the Bell is caused from

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.209 
of the Bell and the Bell is caused from
the<00:00:41.340> lead<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:42.320> after<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.500> Civil<00:00:43.680> War<00:00:43.829> or

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the lead and after the Civil War or

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.729 
the lead and after the Civil War or
during<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> Civil<00:00:44.879> War<00:00:44.910> they<00:00:45.629> had<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.989> use<00:00:46.230> the

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
during the Civil War they had to use the

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.330 
during the Civil War they had to use the
lead<00:00:46.980> for<00:00:47.640> bullets<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.930> they<00:00:49.440> stopped<00:00:49.860> putting

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
lead for bullets so they stopped putting

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.529 
lead for bullets so they stopped putting
lead<00:00:50.670> into<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:52.260> glass<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.489> lost<00:00:54.210> this

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
lead into the glass and so you lost this

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.260 
lead into the glass and so you lost this
tone<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.770> that's<00:00:56.039> how<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:56.879> way<00:00:57.090> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
tone so that's how you can one way that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.639 
tone so that's how you can one way that
you<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.510> tell<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.050> is<00:00:58.109> Flint<00:00:58.500> glass

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you can tell that this is Flint glass

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.189 
you can tell that this is Flint glass
and<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.940> another<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.480> have<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> few<00:01:01.079> other

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and we have another we have a few other

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.959 
and we have another we have a few other
varieties<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:01.859> Flint<00:01:02.250> glass<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.879> we

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
varieties of Flint glass here that we

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:03.889 
varieties of Flint glass here that we
can<00:01:03.149> show<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.359> today

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
can show you today

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.920 
can show you today
these<00:01:04.260> are<00:01:04.470> compote<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.299> if<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.450> look<00:01:06.600> around

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
these are compote and if you look around

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.899 
these are compote and if you look around
there<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.290> there's<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> number<00:01:08.130> three<00:01:08.460> or<00:01:08.580> four

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
there so there's a number three or four

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.250 
there so there's a number three or four
we<00:01:09.390> have<00:01:09.540> goblets<00:01:10.340> tumblers<00:01:11.900> they<00:01:12.900> made<00:01:13.110> them

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
we have goblets tumblers they made them

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.899 
we have goblets tumblers they made them
in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.740> shapes<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.340> oil<00:01:14.670> lamps<00:01:15.320> with<00:01:16.320> patterns

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
in the shapes of oil lamps with patterns

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.399 
in the shapes of oil lamps with patterns
we<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.200> what<00:01:19.200> they<00:01:19.320> call<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> Spooner<00:01:20.159> a

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
we have what they call a Spooner a

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.350 
we have what they call a Spooner a
really<00:01:22.409> pretty<00:01:22.740> picture<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:24.030> an<00:01:24.150> applied

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
really pretty picture with an applied

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.399 
really pretty picture with an applied
handle<00:01:24.990> it<00:01:25.799> was<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.140> handle

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
handle it was the way that the handle

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.080 
handle it was the way that the handle
was<00:01:28.530> applied<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.159> back<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.790> pitcher

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
was applied to the back of the pitcher

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.560 
was applied to the back of the pitcher
which<00:01:30.720> was<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.610> perfected<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.970> well<00:01:33.240> during

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
which was not perfected very well during

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.170 
which was not perfected very well during
that<00:01:33.720> period<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.710> tell<00:01:34.979> if<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.820> are

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
that period and you can tell if you are

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.719 
that period and you can tell if you are
looking<00:01:36.600> at<00:01:36.720> pictures<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.100> majority<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
looking at pictures that the majority of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.980 
looking at pictures that the majority of
them<00:01:39.030> will<00:01:39.689> you'll<00:01:40.079> see<00:01:40.380> in<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> back<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
them will you'll see in the back the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.719 
them will you'll see in the back the
most<00:01:42.990> of<00:01:43.200> them<00:01:43.320> are<00:01:43.439> cracked<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.159> reason

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
most of them are cracked and the reason

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:45.980 
most of them are cracked and the reason
they're<00:01:44.850> cracked<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.329> because<00:01:45.630> they<00:01:45.750> didn't

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
they're cracked is because they didn't

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.980 
they're cracked is because they didn't
have<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> firing<00:01:46.710> down<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.850> perfection<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.750> if

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
have the firing down to perfection so if

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
have the firing down to perfection so if
you're<00:01:49.530> looking<00:01:49.649> at<00:01:49.920> these<00:01:50.040> pictures<00:01:50.399> don't

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you're looking at these pictures don't

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.399 
you're looking at these pictures don't
be<00:01:50.909> surprised<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> see<00:01:51.930> nine<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.380> of

ten are cracked and let's see we have

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.090 
ten are cracked and let's see we have
