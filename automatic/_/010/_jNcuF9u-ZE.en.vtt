 welcome by hand to parents dotcom 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.190
 On this day, the topic of protein intolerance of the 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.729
 Cow milk 

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:12.289
 it is not known exactly why this painting is produced but it is known that 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.289
 It is not of allergic origin it is believed that the infant's intestine is little 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:17.199
 developed 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.739
 so it will let go of bad cow's milk proteins 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:25.250
 digested that are recognized as strange and of being determined chain 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.980
 symptom 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.520
 The symptoms that the baby can present are very varied and are not always 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.569
 easy to see 

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:34.850
 fulfilling the mini that the start of artificial lactation 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.470
 the child may have diarrhea, vomiting, and his irritability or 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.010
 blood loss of losing positions 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.080
 but other times the picture is not so clear and what can draw attention 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.500
 is that the minister had in the bottle feeds 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.360
 but yes reiterated will continue to even reject the take without 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.850
 complete it even if you are hungry 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.190
 After a while he cried again because of hunger and the same thing happened to him in 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.190
 any of these cases it is always advisable to consult with the pediatrician 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.199
 If it is an intolerance, the first thing to be clear is that there is no 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.840
 that overwhelm at all the pictures of intolerance to the proteins of the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.160
 cow's milk are relatively common in our environment and the 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.160
 Most spontaneously remitting over the year of life 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.369
 The treatment consists simply of replacing milk preparations with 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.210
 cow by formulas that are named and performed that are better tolerated by 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.830
 the child's intestine 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.910
 these formulas are expensive although they are financed and tend to have a worse taste 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.770
 so the pediatrician will look for the most appropriate for each case and now 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.200
 close monitoring of the child's evolution although at the beginning the 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.870
 most infants reject it because of its bad taste normally this is 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.340
 something transient and finally tolerate them well 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.860
 in cases where, in addition to artificial milk, the stay was continued 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.510
 maternal diet it is important to remember that protein must also be removed from 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.460
 cow's milk of the mother's diet 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.600
 these proteins can reach infants also through this 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.350
 In addition, it is advisable to prolong breastfeeding 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.890
 maximum possible 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.229
 the pediatrician will control the proper development of the child and over 10 12 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.900
 months of age will probably soon indicate enter 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.220
 new itaÃº latina mind cow's milk 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.250
 to see if the organism of the child already tolerates it of block mind 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:22.230
 only in exceptional cases are the table perpetuated beyond the year of 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.489
 nursing life and can even become permanent so it follows that it is 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.279
 important that the pediatrician follow up until the complete 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.929
 disappearance of the painting 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:36.699
 and up to here the issue of the intolerance to the proteins of cow's milk 

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:40.519
 thank you very much for consulting by hand to parents dotcom
