water<00:02:01.330> on<00:02:01.659> and<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:03.100> at<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.460> point<00:02:03.640> you<00:02:04.030> get

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
water on and if at this point you get

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.600 
water on and if at this point you get
any<00:02:04.450> leaking<00:02:04.899> um<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:06.130> means<00:02:06.340> there's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
any leaking um it means there's

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.430 
any leaking um it means there's
something<00:02:06.820> not<00:02:07.509> hooked<00:02:07.780> up<00:02:07.960> right<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.380> you

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
something not hooked up right and you

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.020 
something not hooked up right and you
want<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.739> try<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.009> again<00:02:09.099> turn<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.640> water<00:02:09.880> off

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
want to try it again turn the water off

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.910 
want to try it again turn the water off
and<00:02:10.390> start<00:02:10.690> over<00:02:10.810> again<00:02:10.989> this<00:02:11.500> seems<00:02:11.739> to<00:02:11.890> be

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
and start over again this seems to be

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.449 
and start over again this seems to be
right<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:13.090> now<00:02:13.300> we<00:02:13.360> have<00:02:13.720> our<00:02:13.870> machine<00:02:14.310> turn<00:02:15.310> it

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
right so now we have our machine turn it

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.590 
right so now we have our machine turn it
on<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:17.410> knob<00:02:17.770> selects<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.550> cycle<00:02:19.030> we

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
on this knob selects the cycle we

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.809 
on this knob selects the cycle we
actually<00:02:19.900> keep<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.200> list<00:02:20.410> of<00:02:20.709> cycles<00:02:21.220> over<00:02:21.610> here

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
actually keep a list of cycles over here

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.070 
actually keep a list of cycles over here
to<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.060> left<00:02:22.239> of<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:22.450> machine<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:22.900> we've

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
to the left of the machine but we've

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.500 
to the left of the machine but we've
done<00:02:23.290> pretty<00:02:23.500> well<00:02:23.620> with<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.190> shortest<00:02:24.760> 45

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
done pretty well with the shortest 45

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.229 
done pretty well with the shortest 45
minute<00:02:25.950> delicate<00:02:26.950> cycle<00:02:27.370> it<00:02:27.489> seems<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:28.030> wash

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
minute delicate cycle it seems to wash

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.809 
minute delicate cycle it seems to wash
everything<00:02:28.600> and<00:02:29.110> pretty<00:02:29.830> nicely<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:30.459> that's

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
everything and pretty nicely so that's

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.350 
everything and pretty nicely so that's
the<00:02:31.090> shorter<00:02:31.390> cycle<00:02:31.780> we<00:02:32.200> we<00:02:33.190> use<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.640> you

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the shorter cycle we we use that you

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.150 
the shorter cycle we we use that you
just<00:02:34.540> press<00:02:34.720> the<00:02:34.930> start<00:02:35.260> button<00:02:35.319> just<00:02:36.010> like

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
just press the start button just like

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.660 
just press the start button just like
you<00:02:36.250> would<00:02:36.430> on<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.610> CD<00:02:37.330> player<00:02:38.130> when<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.280> cycle

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
you would on a CD player when the cycle

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.280 
you would on a CD player when the cycle
is<00:02:39.730> done<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:41.110> will<00:02:41.890> beep<00:02:42.430> several<00:02:43.000> times<00:02:43.290> we

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
is done it will beep several times we

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.220 
is done it will beep several times we
like<00:02:44.500> to<00:02:44.709> get<00:02:44.799> it<00:02:45.239> opened<00:02:46.239> soon<00:02:46.840> after<00:02:47.200> that

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
like to get it opened soon after that

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.620 
like to get it opened soon after that
turn<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.680> off<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.430> then<00:02:48.489> I<00:02:48.880> open<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.299> up<00:02:49.390> and

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
turn it off and then I open it up and

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.360 
turn it off and then I open it up and
pull<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:49.959> dishes<00:02:50.260> out<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.739> then<00:02:50.890> they<00:02:51.069> dry

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
pull the dishes out and then they dry

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.410 
pull the dishes out and then they dry
fairly<00:02:52.150> quickly<00:02:52.360> because<00:02:52.780> they're<00:02:52.930> hot<00:02:53.250> and

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
fairly quickly because they're hot and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.120 
fairly quickly because they're hot and
then<00:02:55.420> you<00:02:55.630> come<00:02:55.810> over<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.260> the<00:02:56.380> sink<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:56.890> the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130

little sleeve down remove it and then I

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.250 
little sleeve down remove it and then I
like<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.459> let<00:03:21.970> any<00:03:22.180> excess<00:03:22.630> water<00:03:22.840> come<00:03:23.230> down

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
like to let any excess water come down

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.319 
like to let any excess water come down
the<00:03:23.560> hose<00:03:23.769> so<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:24.280> when<00:03:24.430> we<00:03:24.579> store<00:03:24.880> it<00:03:25.000> behind

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
the hose so that when we store it behind

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:29.430 
the hose so that when we store it behind
we<00:03:25.690> don't<00:03:25.900> end<00:03:26.769> up<00:03:26.980> with<00:03:27.010> a<00:03:27.220> lot<00:03:27.489> of<00:03:28.440> water

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
we don't end up with a lot of water

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.039 
we don't end up with a lot of water
behind<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:30.120> machine<00:03:31.120> now<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:31.780> should<00:03:32.019> have

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
behind the machine now you should have

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.289 
behind the machine now you should have
clean<00:03:32.440> dishes<00:03:32.709> keep<00:03:33.459> in<00:03:33.609> mind<00:03:33.820> that<00:03:33.970> during

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
clean dishes keep in mind that during

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.660 
clean dishes keep in mind that during
the<00:03:34.420> cycle<00:03:34.630> you'll<00:03:35.260> hear<00:03:35.560> some<00:03:35.829> noise<00:03:36.100> at<00:03:36.519> the
