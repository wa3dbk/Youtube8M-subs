00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:08.179 
our tutorial the part number 2 of 3

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.749 
our tutorial the part number 2 of 3
today<00:00:09.179> we're<00:00:09.360> going<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.679> look<00:00:10.679> at<00:00:10.860> importing

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
today we're going to look at importing

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.060 
today we're going to look at importing
our<00:00:11.969> image<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.349> created<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.889> last

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
our image that we created in the last

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.340 
our image that we created in the last
part<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.309> our<00:00:14.400> tutorial<00:00:14.820> from<00:00:15.120> GIMP<00:00:15.960> to

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
part of our tutorial from GIMP to

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.580 
part of our tutorial from GIMP to
inkscape<00:00:17.029> so<00:00:18.029> what<00:00:18.779> we're<00:00:18.900> gonna<00:00:18.960> do<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.410> have

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
inkscape so what we're gonna do we have

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.109 
inkscape so what we're gonna do we have
our<00:00:19.740> image<00:00:19.980> but<00:00:20.189> we<00:00:20.279> didn't<00:00:20.550> actually<00:00:20.670> stated

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
our image but we didn't actually stated

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.580 
our image but we didn't actually stated
in<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.270> last<00:00:21.390> tutorial<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.900> probably<00:00:22.410> should

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
in the last tutorial I probably should

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.960 
in the last tutorial I probably should
have<00:00:22.650> done<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.859> before<00:00:23.279> we<00:00:23.430> finished<00:00:23.789> off

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
have done that before we finished off

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.640 
have done that before we finished off
but<00:00:24.240> i<00:00:24.269> just<00:00:24.689> wanted<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.019> go<00:00:25.260> ahead<00:00:25.350> and<00:00:25.560> get

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
but i just wanted to go ahead and get

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.810 
but i just wanted to go ahead and get
that<00:00:25.680> first<00:00:25.980> part<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.400> way<00:00:26.519> because<00:00:26.730> i

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
that first part of the way because i

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.009 
that first part of the way because i
figured<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.180> might<00:00:27.480> have<00:00:27.570> been<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.689> long

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
figured that might have been a long

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.540 
figured that might have been a long
looked<00:00:28.740> back<00:00:28.949> at<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.099> recording<00:00:29.429> and

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
looked back at the recording and

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.189 
looked back at the recording and
realized<00:00:29.849> i<00:00:30.060> actually<00:00:30.449> had<00:00:30.599> more<00:00:30.750> time<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.019> I

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
realized i actually had more time but I

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.350 
realized i actually had more time but I
thought<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.439> did<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:32.000> that's<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.120> way<00:00:33.239> of

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
thought I did but that's the way of

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.500 
thought I did but that's the way of
things<00:00:33.540> mhm<00:00:33.930> alright<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.210> we're<00:00:36.210> gonna<00:00:36.300> go<00:00:36.480> up

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
things mhm alright so we're gonna go up

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.720 
things mhm alright so we're gonna go up
to<00:00:36.750> file<00:00:37.079> now<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.680> our<00:00:37.710> new<00:00:38.250> thing<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.579> I

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
to file now with our new thing and I

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.770 
to file now with our new thing and I
don't<00:00:38.879> want<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.059> save<00:00:39.239> over<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.570> file

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
don't want to save over this file

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.910 
don't want to save over this file
because<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.110> might<00:00:40.320> want<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.530> go<00:00:40.590> back<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
because I might want to go back to the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.410 
because I might want to go back to the
source<00:00:41.129> file<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.640> use<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.910> mail<00:00:42.059> at<00:00:42.239> some

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
source file and use the mail at some

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.360 
source file and use the mail at some
point<00:00:42.690> or<00:00:42.870> I<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.620> might<00:00:43.890> want<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> go<00:00:44.219> back<00:00:44.340> to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.770 
point or I just might want to go back to
the<00:00:44.550> source<00:00:44.760> file<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.120> edit<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.390> little<00:00:45.660> bit

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the source file and edit a little bit

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.110 
the source file and edit a little bit
differently<00:00:46.110> than<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.469> did<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.280> time

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
differently than I did with this time

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.420 
differently than I did with this time
that<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:48.420> just<00:00:48.570> did<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.860> save<00:00:50.129> as

that we just did so I'm going to save as

and<00:01:02.070> we're<00:01:02.399> going<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.550> save<00:01:02.760> it<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:02.969> JPEG<00:01:03.420> not

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and we're going to save it as a JPEG not

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.840 
and we're going to save it as a JPEG not
a<00:01:03.660> PNG<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.830> makes<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.220> simpler<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
a PNG just it makes it simpler for the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.390 
a PNG just it makes it simpler for the
vector<00:01:06.090> conversion<00:01:06.740> PNG's<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.979> sometimes<00:01:08.280> be

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
vector conversion PNG's can sometimes be

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.520 
vector conversion PNG's can sometimes be
a<00:01:08.430> little<00:01:08.549> messy<00:01:08.790> when<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.240> comes<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.659> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
a little messy when it comes to that and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.539 
a little messy when it comes to that and
I'm<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.830> save<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.130> just<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.760> my<00:01:11.820> pictures

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
I'm going to save it just in my pictures

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.240 
I'm going to save it just in my pictures
so<00:01:14.549> let's<00:01:14.760> say<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.740> I'm<00:01:16.740> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> leave

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
so let's say that and I'm going to leave

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920 
so let's say that and I'm going to leave
it<00:01:17.310> at<00:01:17.460> my<00:01:17.700> default<00:01:18.119> which<00:01:18.390> might<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> little

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930

this is what i like to use when i'm not
editing<00:01:45.600> raw<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.020> most<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> mine<00:01:46.470> are<00:01:46.500> jpeg<00:01:46.740> so

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.450 
this is just what I edit with but not
worried<00:01:49.619> about<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.040> we're<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.369> to

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
worried about that so we're going to

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.580

click Save alright so we have that so we
can<00:01:52.680> actually<00:01:52.770> close<00:01:53.040> out<00:01:53.220> Kip<00:01:53.430> now<00:01:53.549> because

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
can actually close out Kip now because

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.830 
can actually close out Kip now because
we<00:01:53.850> won't<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.149> needing<00:01:54.390> it<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.630> rest<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.260 
we won't be needing it for the rest of
time<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.350> have<00:01:55.470> inkscape<00:01:55.890> open<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.369> now

tutorials i'll talk about linking at a

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.429 
tutorials i'll talk about linking at a
later<00:02:26.030> date<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:26.930> we're<00:02:27.019> gonna<00:02:27.109> go<00:02:27.230> ahead<00:02:27.290> and

later date so we're gonna go ahead and
click<00:02:27.620> ok<00:02:27.920> it'll<00:02:28.340> resize<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:29.060> does<00:02:29.329> this

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
click ok it'll resize it does this

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.629

sometimes<00:02:29.569> it's<00:02:30.109> a<00:02:30.200> bit<00:02:30.230> weird<00:02:30.519> so<00:02:31.519> you'll

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:31.639 
sometimes it's a bit weird so you'll

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.099 
sometimes it's a bit weird so you'll
notice<00:02:31.849> it's<00:02:31.969> already<00:02:32.239> really<00:02:32.329> pixely<00:02:32.900> as

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
notice it's already really pixely as

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.720 
notice it's already really pixely as
opposed<00:02:33.620> to<00:02:33.739> our<00:02:33.799> camp<00:02:34.010> we<00:02:34.129> know<00:02:34.219> because<00:02:34.370> GIMP

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
opposed to our camp we know because GIMP

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.190 
opposed to our camp we know because GIMP
has<00:02:34.879> special<00:02:35.389> loaders<00:02:35.689> that<00:02:35.870> inkscape

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
has special loaders that inkscape

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.020 
has special loaders that inkscape
doesn't<00:02:36.439> have<00:02:36.560> but<00:02:37.159> if<00:02:37.370> we<00:02:37.489> zoom<00:02:37.519> out<00:02:37.760> we<00:02:37.909> can

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
doesn't have but if we zoom out we can

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.910 
doesn't have but if we zoom out we can
see<00:02:38.180> what<00:02:38.389> we<00:02:38.480> were<00:02:38.599> in<00:02:38.750> GIMP<00:02:38.930> but<00:02:39.109> um<00:02:39.319> so<00:02:39.590> we

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
see what we were in GIMP but um so we

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.190 
see what we were in GIMP but um so we
can<00:02:40.099> see<00:02:40.250> this<00:02:40.459> is<00:02:40.609> not<00:02:40.819> we<00:02:41.030> want<00:02:41.269> there<00:02:42.109> are

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
can see this is not we want there are

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.720 
can see this is not we want there are
little<00:02:42.379> bits<00:02:42.560> around<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.859> edge<00:02:42.950> jpeg

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
little bits around the edge jpeg

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.339 
little bits around the edge jpeg
compression<00:02:43.909> does<00:02:44.389> that<00:02:44.569> that's<00:02:44.780> fine<00:02:45.079> though

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
compression does that that's fine though

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.110 
compression does that that's fine though
because<00:02:45.919> we're<00:02:46.159> gonna<00:02:46.280> go<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:46.579> here<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:46.849> we're

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
have size 2 because that's all we need

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.220 
have size 2 because that's all we need
there<00:03:05.120> was<00:03:05.150> just<00:03:05.329> a<00:03:05.359> little<00:03:05.569> bits<00:03:05.719> of<00:03:05.810> speckles

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
there was just a little bits of speckles

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.199 
there was just a little bits of speckles
all<00:03:07.099> this<00:03:07.310> other<00:03:07.430> stuff<00:03:07.519> don't<00:03:07.939> worry<00:03:08.000> about

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:08.209 
all this other stuff don't worry about

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:09.909 
all this other stuff don't worry about
it<00:03:08.510> if<00:03:08.629> your<00:03:08.780> settings<00:03:09.109> aren't<00:03:09.230> exactly<00:03:09.620> mine

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:09.919 
it if your settings aren't exactly mine

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.229 
it if your settings aren't exactly mine
that's<00:03:10.189> fine<00:03:10.370> i<00:03:10.400> played<00:03:10.790> with<00:03:10.879> mine<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.090> little

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
that's fine i played with mine a little

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.300 
that's fine i played with mine a little
bit<00:03:11.450> just<00:03:11.659> dip<00:03:11.870> for<00:03:12.169> this<00:03:12.290> tutorial<00:03:12.409> but<00:03:12.829> you

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
bit just dip for this tutorial but you

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.649 
bit just dip for this tutorial but you
don't<00:03:13.459> have<00:03:13.579> to<00:03:13.669> have<00:03:13.849> these<00:03:13.969> exact<00:03:14.299> settings

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659 
don't have to have these exact settings

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:15.759 
don't have to have these exact settings
and<00:03:14.780> it'll<00:03:14.930> still<00:03:15.109> work<00:03:15.139> so<00:03:15.409> you<00:03:15.469> can<00:03:15.590> click

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
and it'll still work so you can click

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:16.899 
and it'll still work so you can click
update<00:03:16.040> if<00:03:16.129> you<00:03:16.190> just<00:03:16.310> wanna<00:03:16.430> see<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.609> preview

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
update if you just wanna see the preview

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.719 
update if you just wanna see the preview
which<00:03:17.060> sometimes<00:03:17.780> gives<00:03:18.169> you<00:03:18.290> white<00:03:18.650> i<00:03:19.159> don't

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:19.729 
which sometimes gives you white i don't

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.939 
which sometimes gives you white i don't
know<00:03:19.940> why<00:03:20.359> it<00:03:20.810> may<00:03:21.260> be<00:03:21.319> a<00:03:21.409> problem<00:03:21.560> with<00:03:21.799> my

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:21.949 
know why it may be a problem with my

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:23.379 
know why it may be a problem with my
copy<00:03:22.280> because<00:03:22.519> i'm<00:03:22.729> using<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.120> portable

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
copy because i'm using the portable

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:24.430 
copy because i'm using the portable
version<00:03:23.750> and<00:03:23.870> not<00:03:23.900> the<00:03:24.109> full<00:03:24.229> version

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
version and not the full version

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.319 
version and not the full version
installed<00:03:25.370> on<00:03:25.430> my<00:03:25.519> computer<00:03:25.549> so<00:03:26.030> that<00:03:26.060> might

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
installed on my computer so that might

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.719 
installed on my computer so that might
be<00:03:26.359> why<00:03:26.599> but<00:03:26.930> yours<00:03:27.739> should<00:03:28.129> not<00:03:28.340> do<00:03:28.489> this<00:03:28.519> if

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:28.729 
be why but yours should not do this if

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:29.800 
be why but yours should not do this if
it<00:03:28.819> does<00:03:28.970> though<00:03:29.150> don't<00:03:29.389> worry<00:03:29.510> about<00:03:29.720> it

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:29.810 
it does though don't worry about it

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.659 
it does though don't worry about it
because<00:03:29.930> it's<00:03:30.139> completely<00:03:30.500> fine<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:31.579> we're

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:31.669 
because it's completely fine so we're

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.759 
because it's completely fine so we're
gonna<00:03:31.760> hide<00:03:31.909> and<00:03:32.030> click<00:03:32.150> OK<00:03:32.419> and<00:03:32.659> then<00:03:32.769> we're

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
gonna hide and click OK and then we're

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.860 
gonna hide and click OK and then we're
going<00:03:33.859> to<00:03:33.949> X<00:03:34.159> out<00:03:34.310> of<00:03:34.430> this<00:03:34.519> so<00:03:35.299> now<00:03:35.419> if<00:03:35.569> you<00:03:35.720> see

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
going to X out of this so now if you see

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.179 
going to X out of this so now if you see
you<00:03:35.989> can<00:03:36.109> drag<00:03:36.319> this<00:03:36.439> over<00:03:36.560> and<00:03:36.739> it<00:03:36.829> looks<00:03:37.099> like

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:37.189 
you can drag this over and it looks like

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:38.979 
you can drag this over and it looks like
it's<00:03:37.310> almost<00:03:37.609> identical<00:03:37.790> copy<00:03:38.239> but<00:03:38.629> when<00:03:38.870> we

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
it's almost identical copy but when we

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:40.749 
it's almost identical copy but when we
zoom<00:03:39.019> in<00:03:39.379> you<00:03:39.829> can<00:03:39.859> quickly<00:03:40.189> notice<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:40.639> this

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:40.759 
zoom in you can quickly notice that this

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:42.309 
zoom in you can quickly notice that this
one<00:03:40.939> is<00:03:41.090> the<00:03:41.299> vector<00:03:41.449> image<00:03:41.750> so<00:03:41.959> I'm<00:03:42.109> gonna<00:03:42.199> go

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
one is the vector image so I'm gonna go

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.869 
one is the vector image so I'm gonna go
and<00:03:42.500> delete<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.889> bitmap<00:03:43.489> because<00:03:43.669> we<00:03:43.729> don't

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:43.879 
and delete the bitmap because we don't

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.550 
and delete the bitmap because we don't
need<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.120> anymore<00:03:44.299> I'm<00:03:45.019> just<00:03:45.109> gonna<00:03:45.229> take<00:03:45.470> the

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
need it anymore I'm just gonna take the

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.319 
need it anymore I'm just gonna take the
vector<00:03:45.739> and<00:03:46.189> put<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.400> over<00:03:46.459> here<00:03:46.909> and<00:03:47.150> just

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
vector and put it over here and just

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.460 
vector and put it over here and just
resize<00:03:47.989> it<00:03:48.229> out<00:03:48.459> right<00:03:49.459> there<00:03:50.169> Center<00:03:51.169> it<00:03:51.199> more

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
resize it out right there Center it more

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.679 
resize it out right there Center it more
there<00:03:52.009> is<00:03:52.129> no<00:03:52.280> there<00:03:52.759> is<00:03:52.790> Center<00:03:53.120> snapping<00:03:53.509> but

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
there is no there is Center snapping but

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.179 
there is no there is Center snapping but
I'm<00:03:54.079> not<00:03:54.290> going<00:03:54.379> to<00:03:54.439> worry<00:03:54.620> about<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:54.979> is

00:03:55.179 --> 00:03:55.189 
I'm not going to worry about that is

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:56.830 
I'm not going to worry about that is
this<00:03:55.519> SVG<00:03:56.060> doesn't<00:03:56.269> have<00:03:56.359> to<00:03:56.449> be<00:03:56.509> precise

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
this SVG doesn't have to be precise

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.879 
this SVG doesn't have to be precise
because<00:03:57.049> we're<00:03:57.319> going<00:03:57.439> to<00:03:57.530> be<00:03:57.590> using<00:03:57.620> in

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
because we're going to be using in

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.490 
because we're going to be using in
blender<00:03:58.509> if<00:03:59.509> we're<00:03:59.810> going<00:04:00.049> to<00:04:00.109> do<00:04:00.229> a<00:04:00.259> little

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
blender if we're going to do a little

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.349 
blender if we're going to do a little
bit<00:04:00.680> more<00:04:00.829> in<00:04:00.919> depth<00:04:01.159> we<00:04:01.519> can<00:04:01.729> look<00:04:01.939> at<00:04:02.060> this

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
bit more in depth we can look at this

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.330 
bit more in depth we can look at this
right<00:04:02.659> here<00:04:02.689> and<00:04:03.199> you'll<00:04:03.769> see<00:04:04.040> that<00:04:04.189> the

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
right here and you'll see that the

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.719 
right here and you'll see that the
shoulders<00:04:04.729> are<00:04:04.909> a<00:04:04.939> little<00:04:05.120> um<00:04:05.359> clipped<00:04:06.139> I

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:06.729 
shoulders are a little um clipped I

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.749 
shoulders are a little um clipped I
could<00:04:07.729> edit<00:04:07.970> this<00:04:08.120> and<00:04:08.329> make<00:04:08.720> this<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.900> complete

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:09.759 
could edit this and make this a complete

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:14.319 
could edit this and make this a complete
Besler<00:04:10.989> rotation<00:04:12.489> not<00:04:13.489> Besler<00:04:13.790> rotation<00:04:14.239> but

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
Besler rotation not Besler rotation but

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:18.039 
Besler rotation not Besler rotation but
a<00:04:14.389> Bezier<00:04:14.750> curve<00:04:15.409> option<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:16.659> actually<00:04:17.659> yeah

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049 
a Bezier curve option and actually yeah

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.449 
a Bezier curve option and actually yeah
see<00:04:18.259> I<00:04:18.289> could<00:04:18.530> do<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.650> but<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:19.009> demo<00:04:19.220> maker

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
see I could do that but the demo maker

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.399 
see I could do that but the demo maker
that<00:04:19.849> a<00:04:20.150> little<00:04:20.570> puffy<00:04:20.750> I'm<00:04:20.989> not<00:04:21.139> the<00:04:21.260> best

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.409 
that a little puffy I'm not the best

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:22.959 
that a little puffy I'm not the best
with<00:04:21.560> vector<00:04:21.889> editing<00:04:22.099> i<00:04:22.430> just<00:04:22.639> know<00:04:22.760> some

00:04:22.959 --> 00:04:22.969 
with vector editing i just know some

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:23.650 
with vector editing i just know some
basics

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
basics

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.090 
basics
I've<00:04:23.720> learned<00:04:23.960> in<00:04:24.170> the<00:04:24.260> past<00:04:24.410> few<00:04:24.650> days<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:24.860> i

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
I've learned in the past few days and i

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.650 
I've learned in the past few days and i
thought<00:04:25.340> i<00:04:25.370> would<00:04:25.520> share<00:04:25.670> this<00:04:25.820> with<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.090> um

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
thought i would share this with you um

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.170 
thought i would share this with you um
just<00:04:27.140> foot<00:04:27.530> looks<00:04:27.770> a<00:04:27.860> little<00:04:28.160> bit<00:04:28.460> off<00:04:28.610> so<00:04:29.090> we

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
just foot looks a little bit off so we

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.730 
just foot looks a little bit off so we
can<00:04:29.300> go<00:04:29.450> ahead<00:04:29.510> and<00:04:29.630> not<00:04:30.040> change<00:04:31.040> that<00:04:32.740> that

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
can go ahead and not change that that

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.350 
can go ahead and not change that that
might<00:04:33.920> look<00:04:34.070> a<00:04:34.160> little<00:04:34.310> better<00:04:34.490> I<00:04:34.640> think<00:04:34.880> yeah

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
might look a little better I think yeah

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.760 
might look a little better I think yeah
that<00:04:35.600> looks<00:04:36.020> at<00:04:36.140> least<00:04:36.290> a<00:04:36.380> little<00:04:36.530> better<00:04:36.650> i

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
that looks at least a little better i

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.290 
that looks at least a little better i
think<00:04:36.860> this<00:04:37.070> is<00:04:37.250> that<00:04:37.430> this<00:04:37.670> is<00:04:37.790> a<00:04:37.850> suitable

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
think this is that this is a suitable

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.480 
think this is that this is a suitable
image<00:04:38.540> actually<00:04:38.780> you<00:04:39.470> know<00:04:39.560> what<00:04:39.710> just<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.370> be

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
image actually you know what just to be

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.540 
image actually you know what just to be
little<00:04:41.120> perfectionist<00:04:41.630> here<00:04:41.870> this<00:04:42.080> should<00:04:42.350> be

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
little perfectionist here this should be

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:51.970 
little perfectionist here this should be
flat<00:04:43.550> as<00:04:43.910> an<00:04:44.060> arrow<00:04:46.450> yeah<00:04:50.380> yeah<00:04:51.380> i<00:04:51.590> want<00:04:51.830> this

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
flat as an arrow yeah yeah i want this

00:04:51.980 --> 00:05:05.830 
flat as an arrow yeah yeah i want this
all<00:04:52.310> right<00:04:59.590> and<00:05:00.590> I<00:05:00.830> think<00:05:00.890> that'll<00:05:01.190> be<00:05:04.270> um<00:05:05.270> let

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
all right and I think that'll be um let

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.990 
all right and I think that'll be um let
me<00:05:05.890> so<00:05:06.890> yeah<00:05:07.040> just<00:05:07.250> doing<00:05:07.400> some<00:05:07.610> little

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
me so yeah just doing some little

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.310 
me so yeah just doing some little
editing<00:05:08.360> stuff<00:05:08.810> here<00:05:09.110> but<00:05:09.140> uh<00:05:10.540> just<00:05:11.540> just<00:05:12.140> to

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
editing stuff here but uh just just to

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.870 
editing stuff here but uh just just to
trim<00:05:12.710> it<00:05:12.800> up<00:05:12.890> I<00:05:13.040> guess<00:05:13.250> a<00:05:13.280> little<00:05:13.610> bit<00:05:13.790> of

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
trim it up I guess a little bit of

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.040 
trim it up I guess a little bit of
perfectionist<00:05:14.480> when<00:05:14.600> it<00:05:14.660> comes<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.960> these

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
perfectionist when it comes to these

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.900 
perfectionist when it comes to these
sorts<00:05:15.350> of<00:05:15.410> things<00:05:15.470> so<00:05:15.770> uh<00:05:15.950> yeah<00:05:16.520> that's<00:05:16.730> much

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
sorts of things so uh yeah that's much

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.570 
sorts of things so uh yeah that's much
better<00:05:17.060> alright<00:05:17.420> so<00:05:17.930> now<00:05:18.920> we<00:05:18.980> have<00:05:19.070> our<00:05:19.190> image

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
better alright so now we have our image

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.970 
better alright so now we have our image
we're<00:05:19.820> going<00:05:20.030> to<00:05:20.120> go<00:05:20.240> file<00:05:20.630> and<00:05:20.990> it<00:05:21.320> not<00:05:21.530> safe

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
we're going to go file and it not safe

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.680 
we're going to go file and it not safe
although<00:05:22.550> I<00:05:22.580> will<00:05:22.880> actually<00:05:23.090> do<00:05:23.360> go<00:05:23.510> ahead<00:05:23.570> and

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:23.690 
although I will actually do go ahead and

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.720 
although I will actually do go ahead and
save<00:05:23.900> a<00:05:23.990> copy<00:05:24.170> of<00:05:24.320> this<00:05:24.610> actually<00:05:25.610> no

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:25.730 
save a copy of this actually no

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.700 
save a copy of this actually no
apparently<00:05:26.330> I<00:05:26.390> want<00:05:26.600> oh<00:05:26.660> no<00:05:26.810> I<00:05:26.840> will<00:05:27.050> okay<00:05:27.170> so

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
I'm going to save this just as an

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.740 
I'm going to save this just as an
inkscape<00:05:29.330> SVG<00:05:29.960> that's<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:30.530> standard<00:05:30.680> format

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
inkscape SVG that's the standard format

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.360 
inkscape SVG that's the standard format
save<00:05:32.750> it<00:05:32.780> to<00:05:32.960> my<00:05:32.990> pictures<00:05:33.410> you<00:05:33.890> can<00:05:34.040> also<00:05:34.160> go

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
save it to my pictures you can also go

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.730 
save it to my pictures you can also go
file<00:05:34.640> export<00:05:35.480> bitmap<00:05:35.870> but<00:05:36.440> that's<00:05:36.680> just

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
file export bitmap but that's just

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.500 
file export bitmap but that's just
exports<00:05:37.190> a<00:05:37.220> bitmap<00:05:37.520> and<00:05:37.730> so<00:05:37.910> we've<00:05:38.090> saved<00:05:38.300> the

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:38.510 
exports a bitmap and so we've saved the

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.320 
exports a bitmap and so we've saved the
SVG<00:05:38.840> now<00:05:39.110> that's<00:05:39.800> good<00:05:40.040> so<00:05:40.669> what<00:05:41.120> are<00:05:41.150> we<00:05:41.240> gonna

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
SVG now that's good so what are we gonna

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.300 
SVG now that's good so what are we gonna
do<00:05:41.510> next<00:05:41.630> well<00:05:42.140> we<00:05:42.440> can<00:05:42.590> actually<00:05:42.740> end<00:05:43.100> off

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
do next well we can actually end off

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.620 
do next well we can actually end off
this<00:05:43.490> part<00:05:43.730> of<00:05:43.790> the<00:05:43.850> tutorial<00:05:43.910> I<00:05:44.270> know<00:05:44.390> this

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
this part of the tutorial I know this

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.230 
this part of the tutorial I know this
was<00:05:44.840> a<00:05:44.870> fairly<00:05:45.260> short<00:05:45.710> one<00:05:45.950> but<00:05:46.130> in<00:05:46.940> the<00:05:47.030> next

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
was a fairly short one but in the next

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.340 
was a fairly short one but in the next
tutorial<00:05:47.360> which<00:05:47.720> i<00:05:47.810> think<00:05:47.870> i'll<00:05:48.050> be<00:05:48.140> uploading

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350
