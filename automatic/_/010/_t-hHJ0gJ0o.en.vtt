00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.190
 AlhaurÃ­n is a celebration of the Anglo-Saxon culture that takes place at night 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.430
 of the day October 31 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.840
 its origins go back to the Celts more than two thousand 500 years ago when the 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.690
 year is finished at the end of summer on October 31 of our 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.820
 calendar that last day it was assumed that the spirits could leave the 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.730
 cemeteries and seize the bodies of the assets to resurrect ask them 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.730
 food and more visible 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.730
 they were made victims of spell if they did not accede to your requests you give me something 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.210
 I make you a prank 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.600
 is that it is the translation of trick or treat 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.330
 to avoid it, the Celtic villages messed up the houses and decorated them with 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.070
 pumpkins skulls and other unpleasant things so that the dead 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.370
 go away scared 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.580
 from italy taking the domains the tas came two Romans 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.670
 they had busy the last days of October and beginning of November with 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.180
 festivities that called the pomona festivities dedicated to the goddess of 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.940
 fruit trees and they could not allow these barbarous people the ignored 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.800
 so it occurred to them to adapt the custom of the dominated to theirs 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.730
 confuse them and then say that he had them from before 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.740
 they mixed fruits with witches and evil spirits the apples that were very 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.740
 popular and soon they were part of the celebrations 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.550
 the history of the pumpkin 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:05.040
 well many many years a stingy and quarrelsome and hernandez and loved and 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.479
 I act unlucky to meet the devil in a tavern at night 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.490
 of witches 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.020
 he is already known drunk he had drunk a lot but he could deceive the devil 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.460
 offering his soul in exchange for one last drink the devil was transformed 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.750
 in a coin to pay the waiter but since he quickly took it and the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.389
 put in your purse 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.699
 as he already had a prudent purse the devil could not return to his form 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:31.009
 original 

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:35.369
 He would not let the devil go until he promised not to ask for his indie soul 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:36.359
 damage 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:40.039
 the devil had no choice but to grant what his claim 

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:44.909
 ten years later since he met the devil in the field 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.709
 the devil was ready to take the beautiful soul I hope already tense very fast 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.689
 I indicated look willingly but before doing so you would bring me the apple that 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.619
 is in that tree and please 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:01.079
 the devil thought he had nothing to lose and jumped into the cup 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.139
 from the tree but before the devil realized it had already exploded 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:08.169
 quickly a cross on the trunk of the tree 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.739
 Then the devil could not come down 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.739
 since he forced the devil to promise that he would never ask his soul 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:15.799
 again 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.319
 the devil had no choice but to accept since he died a few more years 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.979
 late but could not enter the sky because during his life had been a gulf 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:27.289
 drunk and a con man 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:32.299
 but when he tried to enter at least into him is so much his hell the devil 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.699
 he had to send him back because he could not take his soul he had promised 

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:39.179
 where will I go now 

00:03:39.179 --> 00:03:43.229
 she asked activate the devil replied back where you came from 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.169
 the way back was dark and the terrible wind would not let him see anything 

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:53.329
 devil threw him there be tree funk on straight from hell to 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.049
 that was given in the dark and since it was put in a voice that was eating for 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:00.229
 that is not paid for by the wind 

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:03.589
 since he was condemned to pay in the darkness eternally 

00:04:04.089 --> 00:04:08.779
 the peoples of Celtic origin, as tradition dictated, booed you and 

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:12.799
 they put coal in them to light the way back to the world of 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.009
 live their beloved deceased and thus they were welcomed 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.949
 at the same time they protected themselves from evil spirits 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.599
 but when the Irish came to America 

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:26.469
 they knew the pumpkins and they realized that these were much more 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:30.530
 large and easy to hollow out that the turnips since that time that none 

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:35.050
