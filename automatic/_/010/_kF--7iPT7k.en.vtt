covering a bunch of things i see new
players<00:00:22.650> doing<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.330> they<00:00:24.330> shouldn't<00:00:24.539> be

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
players doing that they shouldn't be

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.839 
players doing that they shouldn't be
doing<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:25.140> things<00:00:25.710> they<00:00:25.890> are<00:00:25.920> not<00:00:26.550> doing<00:00:26.820> that

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
doing and things they are not doing that

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.810 
doing and things they are not doing that
they<00:00:27.150> should<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.480> doing<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.590> let's<00:00:29.310> begin<00:00:29.460> here

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
they should be doing so let's begin here

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.010 
they should be doing so let's begin here
so<00:00:30.170> you<00:00:31.170> know<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.679> putting<00:00:32.369> your<00:00:32.780> workers<00:00:33.780> on

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
so you know this putting your workers on

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.600 
so you know this putting your workers on
to<00:00:34.170> your<00:00:34.320> mineral<00:00:34.680> line<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.040> making<00:00:35.309> them<00:00:35.399> to

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
to your mineral line and making them to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.580 
to your mineral line and making them to
start<00:00:35.820> working<00:00:36.000> but<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.750> lot<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.140> players<00:00:37.350> don't

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
start working but a lot of players don't

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.319 
start working but a lot of players don't
know<00:00:37.680> they<00:00:38.010> start<00:00:38.219> making<00:00:38.370> units<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.980> and

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
know they start making units and and

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.729 
know they start making units and and
they<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:42.540> wait<00:00:42.870> till<00:00:43.050> they<00:00:43.140> spawn<00:00:43.320> here<00:00:43.500> then

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
they just wait till they spawn here then

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.830 
they just wait till they spawn here then
move<00:00:43.920> them<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.309> minerals<00:00:44.610> this<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.660> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
move them to the minerals this is a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.950 
move them to the minerals this is a
hundred<00:00:46.440> percent<00:00:46.559> easier<00:00:47.039> than<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.090> or<00:00:48.270> then

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
hundred percent easier than this or then

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.680 
hundred percent easier than this or then
that<00:00:49.140> you<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.879> set<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> rally<00:00:51.239> point<00:00:51.539> if<00:00:51.629> you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
that you just set a rally point if you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.600 
that you just set a rally point if you
don't<00:00:51.870> know<00:00:51.930> what<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.079> rally<00:00:52.320> point<00:00:52.620> is<00:00:52.739> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
don't know what a rally point is it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.299 
don't know what a rally point is it
basically<00:00:53.850> whenever<00:00:54.690> your<00:00:55.050> unit<00:00:55.739> is<00:00:55.860> made<00:00:56.039> it

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
basically whenever your unit is made it

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.670 
basically whenever your unit is made it
goes<00:00:56.520> directly<00:00:56.940> there<00:00:57.149> so<00:00:57.360> let's<00:00:57.989> set<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.440> had<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
goes directly there so let's set I had a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.680 
goes directly there so let's set I had a
nice<00:00:58.800> orange<00:00:59.100> rally<00:00:59.520> point<00:00:59.820> from<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.270> Nexus

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
nice orange rally point from the Nexus

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.990 
nice orange rally point from the Nexus
to<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.469> mineral<00:01:01.770> line<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.489> right<00:01:02.760> when<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
to the mineral line so right when the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.810 
to the mineral line so right when the
probe<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.300> made<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.690> instantly<00:01:04.439> goes<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
probe is made it instantly goes to the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.940 
probe is made it instantly goes to the
mineral<00:01:06.240> line<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:07.020> that's<00:01:07.170> always<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.530> good

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
mineral line so that's always a good

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.280 
mineral line so that's always a good
excellent<00:01:08.700> thing<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.060> do<00:01:09.299> always<00:01:09.990> setting

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
excellent thing to do always setting

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.820 
excellent thing to do always setting
rally<00:01:10.680> points<00:01:11.150> but<00:01:12.150> another<00:01:13.140> thing<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.680> is

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
rally points but another thing this is

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.270 
rally points but another thing this is
pretty<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> do<00:01:14.850> really<00:01:15.659> run<00:01:16.049> when<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> start

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
pretty what I do really run when I start

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.380 
pretty what I do really run when I start
the<00:01:17.369> game<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.840> using<00:01:18.840> hotkeys<00:01:19.430> a<00:01:20.430> lot<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.270> our

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the game is using hotkeys a lot of our

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.840 
the game is using hotkeys a lot of our
to<00:01:21.540> RTS<00:01:22.200> players<00:01:22.439> may<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:22.740> know<00:01:22.890> what<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> hot

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
to RTS players may not know what a hot

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.179 
to RTS players may not know what a hot
keys<00:01:24.090> are<00:01:24.299> how<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.080> use<00:01:25.259> hotkeys<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.710> example

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
keys are how to use hotkeys for example

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.340 
keys are how to use hotkeys for example
well<00:01:26.759> hot<00:01:27.060> keys<00:01:27.240> are<00:01:27.390> basically<00:01:27.810> selecting

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
well hot keys are basically selecting

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.850 
well hot keys are basically selecting
things<00:01:28.970> with<00:01:29.970> your<00:01:30.090> keyboard<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.860> making

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
things with your keyboard or making

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.590 
things with your keyboard or making
control<00:01:32.490> groups<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:32.909> something<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.210> think

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
control groups or something I think

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.899 
control groups or something I think
that's<00:01:33.869> hot<00:01:34.020> keys<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.860> basically<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.369> probe<00:01:35.700> is

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
that's hot keys so basically a probe is

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.520 
that's hot keys so basically a probe is
e<00:01:36.180> instead<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.570> clicking<00:01:36.780> on<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.079> probe<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.380> can

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
e instead of clicking on the probe I can

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.069 
e instead of clicking on the probe I can
just<00:01:37.650> press<00:01:37.799> e<00:01:38.070> whenever<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:38.820> select<00:01:39.600> my<00:01:39.630> Nexus

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
just press e whenever I select my Nexus

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.830 
just press e whenever I select my Nexus
mate<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.860> saving<00:01:41.189> me<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.340> whole<00:01:41.549> like<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.329> little

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
mate is saving me a whole like a little

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.899 
mate is saving me a whole like a little
bit<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.049> time<00:01:43.200> just<00:01:43.229> like<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.340> them<00:01:44.460> in

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
bit of time just like it's in them in

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.530 
bit of time just like it's in them in
the<00:01:45.240> milliseconds<00:01:45.930> really<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.340> can<00:01:48.299> create

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the milliseconds really so I can create

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.910 
the milliseconds really so I can create
a<00:01:48.600> control<00:01:48.960> group<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.380> what<00:01:49.500> i<00:01:49.560> use<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.710> lot

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
a control group this is what i use a lot

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.149 
a control group this is what i use a lot
i<00:01:50.220> usually<00:01:50.820> use<00:01:50.850> control<00:01:51.509> one<00:01:51.990> or<00:01:52.259> four<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:52.979> my

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
i usually use control one or four for my

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.819 
i usually use control one or four for my
probes<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:54.180> make<00:01:54.360> them<00:01:54.509> my<00:01:54.630> scout<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.259> i'm

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
probes to make them my scout so i'm

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.929 
probes to make them my scout so i'm
going<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.009> talk<00:01:56.130> about<00:01:56.280> scouting<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.790> little

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
going to talk about scouting a little

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.520 
going to talk about scouting a little
bit<00:01:57.030> afterwards<00:01:57.780> but<00:01:57.899> there<00:01:58.049> every<00:01:58.350> time<00:01:58.469> i

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
bit afterwards but there every time i

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.639 
bit afterwards but there every time i
press<00:01:58.829> one<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.280> select<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.750> little<00:02:01.409> probe

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
press one I select that one little probe

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.020 
press one I select that one little probe
that's<00:02:01.860> my<00:02:01.979> scanning<00:02:02.219> probe<00:02:02.399> but<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.640> i<00:02:02.729> double

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
that's my scanning probe but if i double

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.530 
that's my scanning probe but if i double
press<00:02:03.899> one<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.350> goes<00:02:04.920> directly<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.939> for

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
press one it goes directly to it and for

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.880 
press one it goes directly to it and for
my<00:02:06.659> nexus<00:02:07.140> i<00:02:07.350> always<00:02:08.929> always<00:02:09.929> Hawkin<00:02:10.410> my<00:02:10.500> nexus

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
my nexus i always always Hawkin my nexus

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.800 
my nexus i always always Hawkin my nexus
is<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:11.520> I<00:02:11.550> always<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.940> control<00:02:12.270> for<00:02:12.480> them<00:02:12.569> for

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
is so I always do control for them for

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.120 
is so I always do control for them for
my<00:02:12.900> neck

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
my neck

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.980 
my neck
this<00:02:13.250> is<00:02:13.370> so<00:02:13.520> whenever<00:02:13.820> I<00:02:13.910> double<00:02:14.420> press<00:02:14.600> one<00:02:14.810> I

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
this is so whenever I double press one I

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.990 
this is so whenever I double press one I
I<00:02:15.020> see<00:02:15.260> my<00:02:15.380> cigar<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.800> then<00:02:16.280> back<00:02:16.580> to<00:02:16.730> my<00:02:16.820> base

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
I see my cigar and then back to my base

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.400 
I see my cigar and then back to my base
instantly<00:02:17.960> very<00:02:18.680> fast<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.510> something<00:02:20.510> people

lot of Protoss players not doing this is

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.790 
lot of Protoss players not doing this is

a<00:02:35.270> waste<00:02:35.480> like<00:02:36.020> that<00:02:36.320> is<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.470> free<00:02:37.040> ability<00:02:37.490> to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
a waste like that is a free ability to

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.510 
a waste like that is a free ability to
use<00:02:37.850> and<00:02:38.120> it's<00:02:38.660> so<00:02:39.200> much<00:02:39.500> better<00:02:39.680> so<00:02:39.950> I'm<00:02:40.310> just

there's hotkeys basically for you and
then<00:02:45.920> let's<00:02:46.190> see<00:02:46.310> them<00:02:46.400> our<00:02:46.550> probes<00:02:46.790> right

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
then let's see them our probes right

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.520 
then let's see them our probes right
here<00:02:47.120> I'm<00:02:47.330> gonna<00:02:47.480> talk<00:02:47.660> about<00:02:47.780> scouting<00:02:48.170> just

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
here I'm gonna talk about scouting just

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.800 
here I'm gonna talk about scouting just
a<00:02:48.650> moment<00:02:48.950> so<00:02:49.520> I<00:02:49.790> want<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.210> build<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.420> simulator

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
a moment so I want to build a simulator

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.140 
a moment so I want to build a simulator
and<00:02:51.080> I<00:02:51.590> see<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.190> lot<00:02:52.370> of<00:02:52.400> Protoss<00:02:52.760> players<00:02:52.970> do

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
and I see a lot of Protoss players do

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.640 
and I see a lot of Protoss players do
this<00:02:53.300> they<00:02:53.480> just<00:02:53.510> leave<00:02:54.020> their<00:02:54.230> probe<00:02:54.470> there

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
this they just leave their probe there

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.140 
this they just leave their probe there
for<00:02:54.830> building<00:02:55.130> and<00:02:55.250> it's<00:02:55.340> like<00:02:55.490> hey<00:02:55.970> this

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
for building and it's like hey this

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.610 
for building and it's like hey this
probe<00:02:56.390> can<00:02:56.540> be<00:02:56.720> doing<00:02:57.140> something<00:02:57.380> because

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
probe can be doing something because

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.320 
probe can be doing something because
probes<00:02:58.160> don't<00:02:58.310> need<00:02:58.490> to<00:02:58.550> be<00:02:58.670> there<00:02:58.700> when<00:02:58.970> when

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
probes don't need to be there when when

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.380 
probes don't need to be there when when
it's<00:02:59.450> building<00:02:59.720> so<00:02:59.920> usually<00:03:00.920> what<00:03:01.010> I<00:03:01.070> do<00:03:01.220> is<00:03:01.670> ok

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
it's building so usually what I do is ok

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.000 
it's building so usually what I do is ok
I<00:03:02.420> want<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.630> build<00:03:02.840> an<00:03:03.080> ax<00:03:03.200> simulator<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.800> then

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
I want to build an ax simulator and then

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.350 
I want to build an ax simulator and then
I'll<00:03:04.100> shift<00:03:04.340> right<00:03:04.490> click<00:03:04.550> on<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.850> mineral<00:03:05.210> note

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
I'll shift right click on a mineral note

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.170 
I'll shift right click on a mineral note
and<00:03:05.570> I<00:03:05.750> don't<00:03:06.050> have<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.260> worry<00:03:06.380> about<00:03:06.500> it<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.800> can

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
and I don't have to worry about it I can

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.060 
and I don't have to worry about it I can
just<00:03:08.180> leave<00:03:08.480> and<00:03:08.780> he's<00:03:09.590> are<00:03:09.710> going<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.890> be<00:03:09.980> on

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
just leave and he's are going to be on

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.050 
just leave and he's are going to be on
the<00:03:10.130> minerals<00:03:10.400> I<00:03:10.460> don't<00:03:10.610> have<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.820> worry<00:03:10.970> about

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
the minerals I don't have to worry about

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.830 
the minerals I don't have to worry about
anything<00:03:11.540> at<00:03:11.780> all<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.640> could<00:03:14.450> also<00:03:14.660> do

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
anything at all so you could also do

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.500 
anything at all so you could also do
that<00:03:14.930> with<00:03:14.990> buildings<00:03:15.440> like<00:03:15.590> shifts<00:03:16.510> shift

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
that with buildings like shifts shift

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.840 
that with buildings like shifts shift
buildings<00:03:17.960> and<00:03:18.140> stuff<00:03:18.340> so<00:03:19.340> I<00:03:19.370> just<00:03:19.640> need<00:03:19.760> more

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
buildings and stuff so I just need more

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.580 
buildings and stuff so I just need more
pylons<00:03:20.240> so<00:03:20.540> I<00:03:20.780> could<00:03:20.990> build<00:03:21.140> two<00:03:21.260> pylons

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
pylons so I could build two pylons

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.650 
pylons so I could build two pylons
holding<00:03:21.890> shift<00:03:22.100> and<00:03:22.190> then<00:03:22.850> right<00:03:23.300> clicking<00:03:23.510> on

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
holding shift and then right clicking on

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.700 
holding shift and then right clicking on
my<00:03:23.780> mineral<00:03:23.960> line<00:03:24.170> so<00:03:24.290> he's<00:03:24.410> going<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.560> do

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
my mineral line so he's going to do

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.410 
my mineral line so he's going to do
those<00:03:24.920> two<00:03:25.100> pylons<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.610> he's<00:03:25.820> going<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.000> come

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
those two pylons and he's going to come

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.780 
those two pylons and he's going to come
back<00:03:26.600> and<00:03:26.660> rollin<00:03:27.200> now<00:03:27.550> talking<00:03:28.550> about

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
back and rollin now talking about

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.230 
back and rollin now talking about
scouting<00:03:29.480> scouting<00:03:30.380> is<00:03:30.500> very<00:03:31.100> important<00:03:31.700> to

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
scouting scouting is very important to

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.870 
scouting scouting is very important to
know<00:03:32.600> add<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.590> ability<00:03:33.710> to<00:03:34.100> know<00:03:34.340> what<00:03:34.700> your

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
know add the ability to know what your

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.390 
know add the ability to know what your
opponent<00:03:35.390> is<00:03:35.690> building<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.320> what<00:03:36.860> he's<00:03:37.070> doing

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
opponent is building and what he's doing

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.530 
opponent is building and what he's doing
is<00:03:38.980> worth<00:03:39.980> more<00:03:40.250> than<00:03:40.400> a<00:03:40.670> huge<00:03:41.000> army<00:03:41.180> because

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
is worth more than a huge army because

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.440 
is worth more than a huge army because
he's<00:03:42.380> building<00:03:42.830> all<00:03:42.980> void<00:03:43.220> rays<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:43.760> you're

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
he's building all void rays and you're

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.810 
he's building all void rays and you're
building<00:03:44.810> only<00:03:44.959> solids<00:03:45.550> yeah<00:03:46.550> you<00:03:46.610> pretty

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
building only solids yeah you pretty

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.040 
building only solids yeah you pretty
much<00:03:46.940> lost<00:03:47.270> the<00:03:47.390> game<00:03:47.510> even<00:03:47.750> though<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:47.900> have

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
much lost the game even though you have

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.600 
much lost the game even though you have
more<00:03:48.170> results<00:03:48.500> than<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.680> mean<00:03:48.830> never<00:03:49.190> gonna<00:03:49.400> win

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
more results than I mean never gonna win

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:52.449 
more results than I mean never gonna win
that<00:03:49.670> game<00:03:50.140> not<00:03:51.140> until<00:03:51.350> zealots<00:03:51.709> fly<00:03:51.890> of

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
that game not until zealots fly of

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.910 
that game not until zealots fly of
course<00:03:52.790> so<00:03:53.720> just<00:03:54.290> building<00:03:54.560> another<00:03:54.709> gateway

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
course so just building another gateway

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.190 
course so just building another gateway
but<00:03:55.160> scouting<00:03:55.520> it's<00:03:55.700> so<00:03:56.150> important<00:03:57.050> I<00:03:57.140> think

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
but scouting it's so important I think

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.600 
but scouting it's so important I think
people<00:03:57.680> should<00:03:57.709> do<00:03:57.950> all<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.190> time<00:03:58.430> because

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
people should do all the time because

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.420 
people should do all the time because
you<00:03:58.910> find<00:03:59.480> out<00:03:59.630> what<00:03:59.810> they're<00:04:00.050> doing<00:04:00.380> if<00:04:00.560> you

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
you find out what they're doing if you

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.610 
you find out what they're doing if you
see<00:04:01.640> there<00:04:01.850> are<00:04:02.030> two<00:04:03.130> barracks<00:04:04.130> I<00:04:04.520> or<00:04:05.090> barracks

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
see there are two barracks I or barracks

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.410 
see there are two barracks I or barracks
with<00:04:06.620> reactors<00:04:07.340> then<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:08.150> know<00:04:08.300> he's

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
with reactors then you know he's

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.670 
with reactors then you know he's
probably<00:04:08.660> going<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:08.959> be<00:04:09.080> doing<00:04:09.200> just<00:04:09.530> all

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
probably going to be doing just all

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.920 
probably going to be doing just all
marine<00:04:10.310> ball<00:04:10.550> right<00:04:11.180> because<00:04:11.540> he<00:04:11.660> has<00:04:11.750> two

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
marine ball right because he has two

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.470 
marine ball right because he has two
reactors<00:04:12.380> on<00:04:12.530> to<00:04:12.680> barracks<00:04:13.490> so<00:04:13.670> he's<00:04:14.060> only

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
reactors on to barracks so he's only

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.090 
reactors on to barracks so he's only
going<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.870> be<00:04:14.930> able<00:04:15.140> to<00:04:15.410> make<00:04:15.440> marine<00:04:15.740> so<00:04:15.950> the

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:16.100 
going to be able to make marine so the

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.300 
going to be able to make marine so the
only<00:04:17.000> choice<00:04:17.239> he<00:04:17.420> has<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.470> make<00:04:18.560> his<00:04:18.770> marine<00:04:19.100> so

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
only choice he has to make his marine so

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.090 
only choice he has to make his marine so
you're<00:04:19.609> going<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.790> have<00:04:19.880> to<00:04:20.030> counter<00:04:20.330> that<00:04:21.100> so

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
you're going to have to counter that so

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.550 
you're going to have to counter that so
a<00:04:22.460> good<00:04:22.700> way<00:04:22.760> to<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:23.540> know<00:04:23.660> kill<00:04:23.960> Marines<00:04:24.290> is

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
a good way to you know kill Marines is

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.060 
a good way to you know kill Marines is
you

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
you

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.440 
you
high<00:04:25.250> templar<00:04:25.700> but<00:04:25.850> you<00:04:25.940> don't<00:04:26.090> want<00:04:26.210> to<00:04:26.300> take

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
high templar but you don't want to take

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.760 
high templar but you don't want to take
the<00:04:26.600> high<00:04:26.690> templar<00:04:27.110> because<00:04:27.440> it's<00:04:27.620> too<00:04:27.740> early

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
the high templar because it's too early

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.530 
the high templar because it's too early
in<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.100> game<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.910> you're<00:04:29.060> going<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.240> want<00:04:29.330> to

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
in the game so you're going to want to

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.630 
in the game so you're going to want to
go<00:04:29.570> with<00:04:29.810> units<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:30.560> just<00:04:30.740> eat<00:04:31.010> up<00:04:31.220> Marines

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
go with units that just eat up Marines

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.390 
go with units that just eat up Marines
um<00:04:31.880> I<00:04:32.150> think<00:04:32.980> stalkers<00:04:33.980> do<00:04:34.130> a<00:04:34.160> good<00:04:34.340> job

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
um I think stalkers do a good job

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.020 
um I think stalkers do a good job
stalker<00:04:35.120> zealots<00:04:35.570> though<00:04:35.810> it's<00:04:36.140> a<00:04:36.260> good<00:04:36.410> are

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
stalker zealots though it's a good are

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.250 
stalker zealots though it's a good are
centuries<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.420> if<00:04:38.540> you<00:04:38.630> want<00:04:38.780> to<00:04:38.870> group<00:04:39.110> them

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
centuries to if you want to group them

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.170 
centuries to if you want to group them
out<00:04:39.380> and<00:04:39.590> spread<00:04:39.920> them<00:04:40.040> out<00:04:40.130> that's<00:04:40.790> always<00:04:41.150> a

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
out and spread them out that's always a

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.690 
out and spread them out that's always a
good<00:04:41.420> choice<00:04:41.480> as<00:04:41.840> well<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:42.500> I'm<00:04:42.980> behind<00:04:43.520> here

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
your opponent has is like an amazing

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.690 
your opponent has is like an amazing
kind<00:05:04.520> of<00:05:05.200> ability<00:05:06.200> you<00:05:06.770> know<00:05:06.890> just<00:05:07.310> scouting

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
kind of ability you know just scouting

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.640 
kind of ability you know just scouting
there<00:05:07.940> just<00:05:08.090> with<00:05:08.180> a<00:05:08.240> simple<00:05:08.330> probe<00:05:08.840> like<00:05:09.050> hey

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
there just with a simple probe like hey

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.370 
there just with a simple probe like hey
he<00:05:10.520> went<00:05:10.700> for<00:05:10.880> two<00:05:11.150> refineries<00:05:11.450> pretty<00:05:12.050> early

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
he went for two refineries pretty early

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.260 
he went for two refineries pretty early
huh<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:13.340> seems<00:05:13.550> like<00:05:13.670> he's<00:05:13.790> going<00:05:13.880> to<00:05:13.940> be<00:05:14.060> doing

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
huh it seems like he's going to be doing

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:15.930 
huh it seems like he's going to be doing
something<00:05:14.750> investing<00:05:15.260> gas<00:05:15.410> probably

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
something investing gas probably

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.800 
something investing gas probably
something<00:05:16.940> that<00:05:16.970> uses<00:05:17.270> that's<00:05:17.570> been<00:05:17.690> guess

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
something that uses that's been guess

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.140 
something that uses that's been guess
probably<00:05:17.960> like<00:05:18.200> a<00:05:18.440> mech<00:05:18.770> build<00:05:19.040> or<00:05:19.280> an<00:05:19.820> early

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
probably like a mech build or an early

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.120 
probably like a mech build or an early
mech<00:05:20.300> build<00:05:20.510> or<00:05:20.750> just<00:05:21.410> a<00:05:21.590> whole<00:05:21.800> bunch<00:05:21.830> of

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
mech build or just a whole bunch of

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.100 
mech build or just a whole bunch of
marauders<00:05:22.510> or<00:05:23.510> he's<00:05:23.690> just<00:05:23.810> doing<00:05:24.080> that

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
marauders or he's just doing that

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.190 
marauders or he's just doing that
because<00:05:24.230> he<00:05:24.890> wants<00:05:25.130> to<00:05:25.190> refineries<00:05:26.180> so<00:05:27.110> you

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
because he wants to refineries so you

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.530 
because he wants to refineries so you
just<00:05:27.530> got<00:05:27.680> to<00:05:27.830> find<00:05:28.130> what<00:05:28.760> he's<00:05:28.970> making<00:05:29.180> and

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:29.540 
just got to find what he's making and

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.050 
just got to find what he's making and
exploit<00:05:30.230> it<00:05:30.340> exploit<00:05:31.340> it<00:05:31.460> for<00:05:31.490> all<00:05:31.760> it's<00:05:31.970> worth

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:32.060 
exploit it exploit it for all it's worth

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.630 
exploit it exploit it for all it's worth
if<00:05:32.390> he's<00:05:32.540> just<00:05:32.690> making<00:05:33.050> a<00:05:33.260> ground<00:05:33.920> army<00:05:34.220> you

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
if he's just making a ground army you

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.660 
if he's just making a ground army you
can<00:05:34.790> control<00:05:35.180> the<00:05:35.390> air<00:05:35.630> it's<00:05:36.500> not<00:05:36.770> all<00:05:37.100> rock

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:37.670 
can control the air it's not all rock

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.790 
can control the air it's not all rock
paper<00:05:37.940> scissors<00:05:38.390> like<00:05:38.600> that<00:05:38.750> he's<00:05:39.380> making<00:05:39.710> a

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 
paper scissors like that he's making a

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.960 
paper scissors like that he's making a
really<00:05:40.130> slow<00:05:40.460> you<00:05:40.520> know<00:05:41.410> siege<00:05:42.460> army<00:05:43.460> then<00:05:43.640> you

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:43.970 
really slow you know siege army then you

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.390 
really slow you know siege army then you
should<00:05:44.150> go<00:05:44.360> like<00:05:44.630> some<00:05:45.110> stalkers<00:05:45.980> with<00:05:46.160> link

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 
should go like some stalkers with link

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.730 
should go like some stalkers with link
to<00:05:46.550> get<00:05:46.700> around<00:05:47.090> those<00:05:47.360> siege<00:05:47.600> tanks<00:05:47.990> and<00:05:48.110> just

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
to get around those siege tanks and just

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.780 
to get around those siege tanks and just
go<00:05:48.890> waltz<00:05:49.400> into<00:05:49.550> his<00:05:49.790> base<00:05:49.970> or<00:05:50.560> you<00:05:51.560> know

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:51.790 
go waltz into his base or you know

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.010 
go waltz into his base or you know
mobility<00:05:52.790> is<00:05:52.940> also<00:05:53.360> a<00:05:53.390> factor<00:05:53.720> it's<00:05:53.870> not<00:05:53.990> a

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
mobility is also a factor it's not a

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.230 
mobility is also a factor it's not a
just<00:05:54.590> a<00:05:54.800> rock-paper-scissors<00:05:55.130> effect<00:05:56.090> in

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
just a rock-paper-scissors effect in

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.090 
just a rock-paper-scissors effect in
this<00:05:56.390> game<00:05:56.570> it's<00:05:56.780> not<00:05:56.900> like<00:05:57.080> oh<00:05:57.200> this<00:05:57.350> unique

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
this game it's not like oh this unique

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.560 
this game it's not like oh this unique

oh<00:06:01.660> this<00:06:02.660> is<00:06:02.810> not<00:06:02.930> good<00:06:03.460> because<00:06:04.460> I<00:06:04.940> don't<00:06:05.240> have

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
oh this is not good because I don't have

oh this is not good because I don't have
enough<00:06:05.569> units<00:06:05.870> and<00:06:06.080> I<00:06:06.110> don't<00:06:06.259> want<00:06:06.380> to<00:06:06.470> botch

my Nexus here and why do I do that

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:28.900 
my Nexus here and why do I do that
because<00:06:27.500> I'm<00:06:27.740> constantly<00:06:27.860> making<00:06:28.400> probes<00:06:28.729> I

because I'm constantly making probes I

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:32.740 
because I'm constantly making probes I
see<00:06:29.680> lots<00:06:30.680> of<00:06:30.860> players<00:06:31.099> Terrans<00:06:32.090> urge<00:06:32.389> every

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.990 
know it's just really bad okay if you
don't<00:06:47.690> have<00:06:48.020> those<00:06:48.349> probes<00:06:48.949> just<00:06:49.250> constantly

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
don't have those probes just constantly

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.820 
don't have those probes just constantly
flowing<00:06:50.509> in<00:06:50.659> until<00:06:51.020> everything<00:06:51.500> is<00:06:51.530> fully

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830 
flowing in until everything is fully

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.950 
flowing in until everything is fully
saturated<00:06:52.099> then<00:06:53.090> it's<00:06:53.389> a<00:06:53.509> waste<00:06:53.780> those

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
saturated then it's a waste those

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.499 
saturated then it's a waste those
minerals<00:06:54.319> aren't<00:06:54.590> being<00:06:54.740> mined<00:06:55.069> you<00:06:55.789> know<00:06:55.940> we

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:56.509 
minerals aren't being mined you know we

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:59.080 
minerals aren't being mined you know we
need<00:06:56.539> to<00:06:56.960> have<00:06:57.169> this<00:06:57.470> fully<00:06:58.190> saturated<00:06:58.789> if<00:06:58.970> you

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 
need to have this fully saturated if you

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.600 
need to have this fully saturated if you
want<00:06:59.270> every<00:06:59.630> single<00:06:59.960> possible<00:07:00.889> mineral<00:07:01.460> as

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
want every single possible mineral as

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.490 
want every single possible mineral as
fast<00:07:01.909> as<00:07:02.150> you<00:07:02.270> can<00:07:02.479> because<00:07:03.020> then<00:07:03.319> you're<00:07:03.470> just

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
fast as you can because then you're just

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.550 
fast as you can because then you're just
going<00:07:03.740> to<00:07:03.830> be<00:07:03.949> behind<00:07:04.659> so<00:07:05.659> always<00:07:06.110> constantly

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 
going to be behind so always constantly

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.060 
going to be behind so always constantly
be<00:07:06.830> making<00:07:07.190> probes<00:07:07.909> I<00:07:08.180> a<00:07:08.990> good<00:07:09.469> way<00:07:09.620> to<00:07:09.650> do<00:07:09.949> this

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:10.070 
be making probes I a good way to do this

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:11.980 
be making probes I a good way to do this
is<00:07:10.130> just<00:07:10.280> making<00:07:11.090> one<00:07:11.210> probe<00:07:11.419> at<00:07:11.570> a<00:07:11.599> time<00:07:11.810> once

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:11.990 
is just making one probe at a time once

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.390 
is just making one probe at a time once
that<00:07:12.139> probe<00:07:12.320> finish<00:07:12.590> this<00:07:12.680> quickly<00:07:12.979> select

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
that probe finish this quickly select
