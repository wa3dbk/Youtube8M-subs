00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.320 
that's not a good thing of it because
you<00:05:51.930> never<00:05:52.110> see<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.620> length<00:05:52.889> of<00:05:53.130> your<00:05:53.790> hair<00:05:53.850> in

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
you never see the length of your hair in

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.460 
you never see the length of your hair in
its<00:05:54.630> natural<00:05:54.720> state<00:05:56.840> you<00:05:57.840> know<00:05:57.990> what<00:05:58.139> I<00:05:58.169> think

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
its natural state you know what I think

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.279 
its natural state you know what I think
about<00:05:58.620> literally<00:05:59.490> how<00:05:59.669> long<00:05:59.910> my<00:06:00.150> hair<00:06:00.449> or<00:06:00.690> is<00:06:00.930> I

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:01.289 
about literally how long my hair or is I

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:03.260 
about literally how long my hair or is I
think<00:06:01.710> about<00:06:02.250> what<00:06:02.490> it<00:06:02.580> would<00:06:02.610> look<00:06:02.820> like<00:06:02.880> if

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
think about what it would look like if

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.090 
think about what it would look like if
it<00:06:03.419> were<00:06:03.539> straightened<00:06:04.199> really<00:06:04.560> really<00:06:04.889> well

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
it were straightened really really well

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.590 
it were straightened really really well
so<00:06:06.590> if<00:06:07.590> my<00:06:07.889> hair<00:06:08.070> was<00:06:08.100> straightened<00:06:08.760> most<00:06:09.389> of

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
so if my hair was straightened most of

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.110 
so if my hair was straightened most of
my<00:06:09.720> hair<00:06:10.020> would<00:06:10.169> be<00:06:10.199> like<00:06:10.620> off<00:06:10.830> here<00:06:11.400> and<00:06:11.580> then

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
my hair would be like off here and then

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.909 
my hair would be like off here and then
in<00:06:12.300> the<00:06:12.419> back<00:06:12.720> and<00:06:13.139> be<00:06:13.289> a<00:06:13.320> little<00:06:13.560> bit<00:06:13.710> lower

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919
