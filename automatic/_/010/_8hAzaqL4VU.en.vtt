00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
kingpin quickly comes to realize that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.870 
kingpin quickly comes to realize that
this<00:01:35.280> object<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:36.119> far<00:01:36.570> too<00:01:36.810> powerful<00:01:37.049> for<00:01:37.380> any

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
this object is far too powerful for any

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.140 
this object is far too powerful for any
human<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:40.250> he<00:01:41.250> quickly<00:01:41.549> realizes

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
human to have like he quickly realizes

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.999 
human to have like he quickly realizes
this<00:01:42.450> considering<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.560> rated

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
this considering it but it's rated

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.069 
this considering it but it's rated
everything<00:01:45.000> around<00:01:45.210> him<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.600> about<00:01:45.810> two

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
everything around him in about two

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.530 
everything around him in about two
seconds<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.280> yeah<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.000> figure<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
seconds so yeah I figure that's the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.210 
seconds so yeah I figure that's the
first<00:01:48.750> time<00:01:48.930> kingpin<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.470> actually<00:01:49.860> learnt

first time kingpin is actually learnt
his<00:01:50.430> lesson<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.259> he's<00:01:52.259> actually<00:01:52.409> scared<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
his lesson and he's actually scared of

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.780 
his lesson and he's actually scared of
something<00:01:53.899> anyway<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.140> after<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.219> quite

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790

Mysterio<00:04:00.959> it's<00:04:01.140> like<00:04:01.260> an<00:04:01.379> avatar<00:04:01.650> it's<00:04:02.010> like<00:04:02.099> a

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
Mysterio it's like an avatar it's like a

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.059 
Mysterio it's like an avatar it's like a
robot<00:04:02.689> so<00:04:03.689> I<00:04:04.049> would<00:04:04.319> probably<00:04:04.500> say<00:04:04.769> that<00:04:04.920> he

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
robot so I would probably say that he

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.020 
robot so I would probably say that he
was<00:04:05.220> lucky<00:04:05.459> there<00:04:05.819> but<00:04:06.569> yes<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.700> he's<00:04:08.700> asking

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
was lucky there but yes so he's asking

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.970 
was lucky there but yes so he's asking
for<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.239> artifact<00:04:09.659> back<00:04:09.959> and<00:04:10.319> she's

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
for the artifact back and she's

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.619 
for the artifact back and she's
basically<00:04:11.129> wants<00:04:11.640> to<00:04:11.700> know<00:04:11.849> what<00:04:12.090> he<00:04:12.269> wants<00:04:12.510> to

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
basically wants to know what he wants to

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:13.910 
basically wants to know what he wants to
do<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:12.989> he's<00:04:13.080> talked<00:04:13.260> about<00:04:13.470> how<00:04:13.590> he<00:04:13.650> wants<00:04:13.860> to

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
do and he's talked about how he wants to

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.969 
do and he's talked about how he wants to
rearrange<00:04:14.519> things<00:04:14.879> and<00:04:15.209> obviously<00:04:16.169> when<00:04:16.859> an

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
rearrange things and obviously when an

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.039 
rearrange things and obviously when an
evil<00:04:17.190> villain<00:04:17.489> wants<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.239> rearrange<00:04:18.570> things

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
they probably mean rearrange them in

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.190 
they probably mean rearrange them in
their<00:04:21.239> image<00:04:21.660> so<00:04:22.049> like

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
there with the artifact and she's just

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:18.750 
there with the artifact and she's just
surrounded<00:05:17.170> by<00:05:17.410> nothing<00:05:17.800> like<00:05:18.280> everything

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
surrounded by nothing like everything

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.540 
surrounded by nothing like everything
has<00:05:18.850> been<00:05:18.970> flattened<00:05:19.630> and<00:05:19.870> it's<00:05:20.410> just<00:05:20.590> awesome

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
has been flattened and it's just awesome

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.350 
has been flattened and it's just awesome
now<00:05:22.440> this<00:05:23.440> is<00:05:23.650> where<00:05:23.800> she<00:05:24.010> realizes<00:05:24.220> what<00:05:24.670> true

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
now this is where she realizes what true

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.470 
now this is where she realizes what true
power<00:05:25.990> she<00:05:26.320> has<00:05:26.470> now<00:05:27.090> obviously<00:05:28.090> she<00:05:28.240> didn't

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
power she has now obviously she didn't

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.150 
power she has now obviously she didn't
mean<00:05:28.720> to<00:05:28.870> do<00:05:29.050> that<00:05:29.230> she<00:05:29.380> can't<00:05:29.590> control<00:05:29.890> it

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
mean to do that she can't control it

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.770 
mean to do that she can't control it
when<00:05:30.580> you're<00:05:30.760> holding<00:05:30.940> this<00:05:31.210> artifact<00:05:31.720> you

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
when you're holding this artifact you

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.170 
when you're holding this artifact you
have<00:05:32.020> to<00:05:32.170> keep<00:05:32.350> a<00:05:32.500> clear<00:05:32.860> head<00:05:32.890> anything<00:05:33.850> you

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
have to keep a clear head anything you

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.990 
have to keep a clear head anything you
think<00:05:34.480> by<00:05:35.290> for<00:05:36.190> example<00:05:36.580> the<00:05:36.700> Ghostbusters

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.000 
think by for example the Ghostbusters

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.870 
think by for example the Ghostbusters
movie<00:05:37.480> when<00:05:38.230> I<00:05:38.920> can't<00:05:39.400> remember<00:05:39.520> his<00:05:39.700> name<00:05:39.760> but

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
movie when I can't remember his name but

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.180 
movie when I can't remember his name but
he<00:05:40.060> thought<00:05:40.300> about<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:40.690> marshmallow<00:05:41.170> man<00:05:41.500> but

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
he thought about the marshmallow man but

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.220 
he thought about the marshmallow man but
you<00:05:42.670> can't<00:05:42.910> technically<00:05:43.450> keep<00:05:43.750> a<00:05:43.870> clear<00:05:44.200> head

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
you can't technically keep a clear head

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.590 
you can't technically keep a clear head
can<00:05:44.680> you<00:05:44.710> so<00:05:45.430> it's<00:05:45.790> whatever<00:05:46.120> you<00:05:46.300> think

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
can you so it's whatever you think

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.660 
can you so it's whatever you think
happens<00:05:47.050> and<00:05:47.260> of<00:05:47.710> course<00:05:47.920> by<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.130> time<00:05:48.250> Iron

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:48.670 
happens and of course by the time Iron

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.430 
happens and of course by the time Iron
Man<00:05:48.820> and<00:05:48.940> spider-man<00:05:49.060> get<00:05:49.600> there<00:05:49.840> it's

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
Man and spider-man get there it's

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.840 
Man and spider-man get there it's
already<00:05:50.710> too<00:05:50.980> late<00:05:51.010> and<00:05:52.170> boom<00:05:53.170> the<00:05:54.100> issue<00:05:54.250> ends

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
already too late and boom the issue ends

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.640 
already too late and boom the issue ends
with<00:05:55.330> a<00:05:55.360> giant<00:05:55.810> explosion<00:05:56.290> and<00:05:56.860> it<00:05:57.490> is<00:05:57.670> awesome

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
with a giant explosion and it is awesome

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.920 
with a giant explosion and it is awesome
now<00:06:00.090> obviously<00:06:01.090> this<00:06:01.270> is<00:06:01.330> the<00:06:01.480> death<00:06:01.780> of

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
now obviously this is the death of

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.380 
now obviously this is the death of
spider-man<00:06:02.320> free<00:06:02.770> loot<00:06:02.980> so<00:06:03.190> the<00:06:03.760> official

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
spider-man free loot so the official

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:05.850 
spider-man free loot so the official
death<00:06:04.540> of<00:06:04.720> spider-man<00:06:05.110> I<00:06:05.290> think<00:06:05.650> actually

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
death of spider-man I think actually

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.950 
death of spider-man I think actually
starts<00:06:06.460> in<00:06:06.580> issue<00:06:07.710> 156<00:06:08.710> or<00:06:08.920> 157<00:06:09.880> so<00:06:10.420> once<00:06:10.810> we

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
starts in issue 156 or 157 so once we

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.420 
starts in issue 156 or 157 so once we
get<00:06:11.080> to<00:06:11.200> there<00:06:11.380> that's<00:06:11.620> when<00:06:11.800> everything<00:06:12.340> will

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:12.430 
get to there that's when everything will

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.040 
get to there that's when everything will
start<00:06:12.670> kicking<00:06:12.970> off<00:06:13.090> and<00:06:13.330> it<00:06:13.450> will<00:06:13.510> be<00:06:13.570> so<00:06:14.020> much

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
start kicking off and it will be so much

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.140 
start kicking off and it will be so much
more<00:06:14.680> cruelly<00:06:15.250> awesome<00:06:15.610> e<00:06:15.700> stuff

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
more cruelly awesome e stuff

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.540
