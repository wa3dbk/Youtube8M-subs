I<00:01:36.349> the<00:01:36.649> reason<00:01:36.919> I<00:01:37.069> think<00:01:37.249> this<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.490> best

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
I the reason I think this is the best

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.459 
I the reason I think this is the best
version<00:01:37.969> is<00:01:38.299> it<00:01:38.450> doesn't<00:01:38.779> sound<00:01:38.899> compressed

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
version is it doesn't sound compressed

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.409 
version is it doesn't sound compressed
like<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.919> new<00:01:40.099> one<00:01:40.340> sounds<00:01:41.060> like<00:01:41.149> really

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:41.419 
like the new one sounds like really

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:43.839 
like the new one sounds like really
alive<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:41.959> open<00:01:42.319> and<00:01:42.499> full<00:01:42.859> and<00:01:43.069> its<00:01:43.520> really

00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:43.849 
alive and open and full and its really

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:45.459
