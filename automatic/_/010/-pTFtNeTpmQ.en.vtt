no fingers land and roll away having a

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.240 
no fingers land and roll away having a
good<00:01:10.750> pop<00:01:10.930> shuvit<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.380> super<00:01:11.800> important<00:01:12.220> for

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
good pop shuvit is super important for

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.130 
good pop shuvit is super important for
learning<00:01:12.580> the<00:01:12.670> inward<00:01:12.910> heel<00:01:13.030> flip<00:01:13.270> instead<00:01:14.050> of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
learning the inward heel flip instead of

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.630 
learning the inward heel flip instead of
keeping<00:01:14.380> your<00:01:14.470> front<00:01:14.680> finger<00:01:15.010> flat<00:01:15.340> as<00:01:15.580> it

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
keeping your front finger flat as it

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.550 
keeping your front finger flat as it
hits<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.180> nose<00:01:16.360> you<00:01:16.870> want<00:01:17.050> to<00:01:17.140> curl<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:17.500> a

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
hits the nose you want to curl it a

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.660 
hits the nose you want to curl it a
little<00:01:17.740> bit<00:01:17.920> like<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.160> would<00:01:18.280> for<00:01:18.460> a<00:01:18.490> heel

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
little bit like you would for a heel

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:19.050 
little bit like you would for a heel
flip

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
flip

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.120 
flip
so<00:01:19.420> while<00:01:19.630> does<00:01:19.870> its<00:01:20.020> shuvit<00:01:20.320> rotation<00:01:20.890> it

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
so while does its shuvit rotation it

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.560 
so while does its shuvit rotation it
also<00:01:21.280> begins<00:01:21.580> heel<00:01:21.790> popping<00:01:22.090> away<00:01:22.180> from<00:01:22.450> you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
also begins heel popping away from you

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.450 
also begins heel popping away from you
remember<00:01:23.260> when<00:01:23.410> you<00:01:23.500> go<00:01:23.620> to<00:01:23.680> do<00:01:23.830> a<00:01:23.860> pop<00:01:24.130> shuvit

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
remember when you go to do a pop shuvit

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.220 
remember when you go to do a pop shuvit
your<00:01:25.030> front<00:01:25.300> finger<00:01:25.510> catches<00:01:25.870> on<00:01:25.960> the<00:01:25.990> nose

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:26.230 
your front finger catches on the nose

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.870 
your front finger catches on the nose
and<00:01:26.470> then<00:01:26.650> your<00:01:26.770> whole<00:01:26.950> hand<00:01:27.100> peels<00:01:27.400> back<00:01:27.640> and

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
and then your whole hand peels back and

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.490 
and then your whole hand peels back and
gets<00:01:28.030> out<00:01:28.120> of<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.300> way<00:01:28.450> but<00:01:29.050> on<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.200> inward

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
gets out of the way but on the inward

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.080 
gets out of the way but on the inward
heel<00:01:29.650> if<00:01:29.950> your<00:01:30.100> front<00:01:30.250> finger<00:01:30.550> catches<00:01:30.940> on<00:01:31.060> the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
heel if your front finger catches on the

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.090 
heel if your front finger catches on the
nose<00:01:31.300> you<00:01:31.720> curl<00:01:31.990> your<00:01:32.140> finger<00:01:32.440> and<00:01:32.590> throw<00:01:32.950> it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
nose you curl your finger and throw it

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.070 
nose you curl your finger and throw it
backwards<00:01:33.340> to<00:01:33.700> really<00:01:34.000> get<00:01:34.150> it<00:01:34.300> heel<00:01:34.690> flipping

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
backwards to really get it heel flipping

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.390 
backwards to really get it heel flipping
and<00:01:35.320> turning<00:01:35.500> away<00:01:35.800> from<00:01:35.920> you

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
and turning away from you

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.890 
and turning away from you
when<00:01:36.700> you<00:01:36.790> go<00:01:36.909> to<00:01:36.940> do<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.210> energy<00:01:37.480> lip<00:01:37.780> I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
when you go to do the energy lip I

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.540 
when you go to do the energy lip I
recommend<00:01:38.290> turning<00:01:38.500> inwards<00:01:39.070> towards<00:01:39.460> the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
recommend turning inwards towards the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.160 
recommend turning inwards towards the
table<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:39.909> little<00:01:40.000> bit<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.780> can<00:01:40.870> get<00:01:41.050> your

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
table a little bit you can get your

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.899 
table a little bit you can get your
hands<00:01:41.380> a<00:01:41.530> right<00:01:41.710> angle<00:01:42.100> to<00:01:42.280> really<00:01:42.430> throw<00:01:42.760> it
