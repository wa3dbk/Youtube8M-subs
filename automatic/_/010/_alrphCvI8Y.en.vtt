00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:08.740
 but let's see in the work that we 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.019
 has prepared our companion 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.810
 how it transforms even foot on 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:16.530
 all of a dancer 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.530
 they have not heard 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.189
 this morning we have sneaked to see 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.010
 a classic dance class an art that 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.310
 gives full prominence to the feet from 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.500
 then the feet suffer and suffer a lot 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.120
 and well, especially at work 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.230
 of the tips of the boys of the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.570
 girls forgive the effort the pain to 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.820
 Sometimes especially at the beginning it is 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.949
 quite painful are three foot in one 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.410
 ballerina dancer has got that 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:50.040
 express also and it has to be ductile 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.530
 you have to feel it and if it's too much 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.239
 too thick the protection that you 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.269
 put on the foot does not feel on the feet 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.210
 just like every dancer has his trick this 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:02.949
 It is a tape that has here 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.549
 adhesive and I put it for the 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.290
 chafing with pointed shoes 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.810
 so that I do not get so many sores or 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.180
 that they do not reach zero they heal more 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.360
 more quickly discipline a lot 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.340
 sacrifice and rehearse again and again every 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.619
 how long are you like this in this position 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.690
 in this class then in this class that 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.180
 lasts one hour 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.950
 the whole time we usually stay if we have 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.710
 go down to gain momentum and go back to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.770
 climb but we spent the class in 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.870
 tips is more vulnerable the foot of the 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.180
 girl man the day of the girl 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.420
 apart from the musculature of the girl who 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.550
 it is always much more subtle I do not know is 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.220
 less strong the musculature of a woman 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.290
 that of a man, of course, is more 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.040
 vulnerable because working there on top of 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.040
 the tip then 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.720
 It's different because look at all the 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.630
 weight of your body on the fingers not the 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.390
 ankle because the ideal thing is half an hour 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.310
 before at eight thirty in the morning and 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.310
 start heating soon after 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.000
 more important yes because to dance then 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.800
 we use the soil and it's all the 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.660
 Contact we have with the sun 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.090
 the more work we give the feet more 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.660
 we must take care of them something that we all should 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.660
 remember
