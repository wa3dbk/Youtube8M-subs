when<00:01:45.899> pop<00:01:46.200> rocks<00:01:46.470> are<00:01:46.590> made<00:01:46.770> what<00:01:47.130> they<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.280> is

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
when pop rocks are made what they do is

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.340 
when pop rocks are made what they do is
they<00:01:47.520> heat<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.970> sugar<00:01:48.119> in<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.869> chamber<00:01:49.079> that

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
they heat up the sugar in a chamber that

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.139 
they heat up the sugar in a chamber that
has<00:01:49.470> lots<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.890> carbon<00:01:50.130> dioxide<00:01:50.159> gas<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.060> they

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
has lots of carbon dioxide gas and they

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.969 
has lots of carbon dioxide gas and they
cool<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.509> sugar<00:01:51.689> traps<00:01:52.049> little<00:01:52.320> bubbles<00:01:52.710> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
cool the sugar traps little bubbles of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.649 
cool the sugar traps little bubbles of
co2<00:01:53.250> okay<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.030> why<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.180> explodes<00:01:54.540> in<00:01:54.630> your

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
co2 okay that's why it explodes in your

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.130 
co2 okay that's why it explodes in your
mouth<00:01:55.549> but<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.850> pop<00:01:57.060> rocks<00:01:57.360> don't<00:01:57.750> really

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
mouth but the pop rocks don't really

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.810 
mouth but the pop rocks don't really
have<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.560> rough<00:01:58.799> surface<00:01:59.280> on<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> outside

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
have that rough surface on the outside

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.499 
have that rough surface on the outside
to<00:02:00.770> release<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.799> lot<00:02:02.070> of<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.219> gas<00:02:02.369> like<00:02:02.700> Mentos

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
to release a lot of the gas like Mentos

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.230 
to release a lot of the gas like Mentos
oh<00:02:03.719> no<00:02:03.930> oh<00:02:04.259> no<00:02:04.380> Mentos<00:02:05.250> on<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.579> outside<00:02:05.939> they

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
oh no oh no Mentos on the outside they

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.760 
oh no oh no Mentos on the outside they
have<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:06.780> cure<00:02:07.049> let<00:02:07.320> me<00:02:07.380> give<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.560> some<00:02:07.680> of

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
have a very cure let me give you some of

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.070 
have a very cure let me give you some of
these<00:02:07.829> they<00:02:08.280> have<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.700> rough<00:02:09.060> surface<00:02:09.090> with

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
these they have a rough surface with

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.140 
these they have a rough surface with
that<00:02:10.229> if<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.920> were<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.280> drop<00:02:11.430> into<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.849> Pepsi

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
that if this were to drop into the Pepsi

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.520 
that if this were to drop into the Pepsi
we<00:02:12.480> could<00:02:12.629> release<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:12.989> lot<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.290> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
we could release a lot of the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.340 
we could release a lot of the
co2<00:02:13.800> gas<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.880> Pepsi<00:02:15.060> now<00:02:15.810> I'm<00:02:16.110> not

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
co2 gas that is in the Pepsi now I'm not

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.080 
co2 gas that is in the Pepsi now I'm not
suggesting<00:02:16.620> you're<00:02:17.490> thinking<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:17.910> right

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
suggesting you're thinking this right

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.490 
suggesting you're thinking this right
that<00:02:18.270> you're<00:02:18.390> gonna<00:02:18.510> chug<00:02:18.870> some<00:02:19.020> Pepsi<00:02:19.380> and

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
that you're gonna chug some Pepsi and

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.960 
that you're gonna chug some Pepsi and
then<00:02:19.620> eat<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.950> mentos<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:20.580> yeah<00:02:20.880> that

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
then eat the mentos and then yeah that

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.160 
then eat the mentos and then yeah that
would<00:02:21.090> probably<00:02:21.390> be<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> bad<00:02:21.600> idea<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:22.140> not

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
would probably be a bad idea it's not

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.080 
would probably be a bad idea it's not
gonna<00:02:22.410> work<00:02:22.620> once<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.490> put<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> Mentos<00:02:23.970> in

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
gonna work once you put the Mentos in

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.250 
gonna work once you put the Mentos in
your<00:02:24.209> mouth<00:02:24.330> you<00:02:24.540> remove<00:02:24.900> some<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.200> those

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
your mouth you remove some of those

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.020 
your mouth you remove some of those
nucleation<00:02:25.680> sites<00:02:26.040> okay<00:02:26.340> kind<00:02:26.580> of<00:02:26.640> smooth<00:02:26.940> it

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
nucleation sites okay kind of smooth it

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.550 
nucleation sites okay kind of smooth it
out<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.300> doesn't<00:02:27.360> work<00:02:27.630> so<00:02:27.780> well<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.230> it's

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
out it doesn't work so well and it's

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.020 
out it doesn't work so well and it's
really<00:02:28.800> hard<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.040> get<00:02:29.130> all<00:02:29.280> this<00:02:29.430> Pepsi<00:02:29.760> into

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
really hard to get all this Pepsi into

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.850 
really hard to get all this Pepsi into
your<00:02:30.150> stomach<00:02:30.330> without<00:02:30.569> burping<00:02:31.440> or<00:02:31.590> losing

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
your stomach without burping or losing

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.250 
your stomach without burping or losing
some<00:02:32.010> gas<00:02:32.160> so<00:02:32.730> all<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.270> could<00:02:33.450> do<00:02:33.690> is<00:02:33.870> we<00:02:34.080> could

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
some gas so all you could do is we could

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.140 
some gas so all you could do is we could
take<00:02:34.560> another<00:02:34.830> bottle<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.459> we<00:02:35.910> could<00:02:36.030> have

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
a really cool thing you can do outside

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.080 
a really cool thing you can do outside
yeah<00:02:42.720> outside<00:02:43.530> notice<00:02:43.860> we're<00:02:43.980> inside<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.880> can

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
yeah outside notice we're inside you can

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.830 
yeah outside notice we're inside you can
drop<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.050> carpets<00:02:46.440> clean<00:02:46.680> -<00:02:47.120> okay<00:02:48.120> you

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
drop in the carpets clean - okay you

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.020 
drop in the carpets clean - okay you
could<00:02:49.050> do<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.320> with<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.820> yeah

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
could do it with this yeah

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.509 
could do it with this yeah
but<00:02:51.209> I<00:02:51.239> thought<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.720> would<00:02:51.870> be<00:02:51.989> better<00:02:52.519> if

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
but I thought it would be better if

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.640 
but I thought it would be better if
instead<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:54.150> that<00:02:54.269> we<00:02:54.600> do<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:54.900> well<00:02:55.320> that's

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
instead of that we do like well that's

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.259 
instead of that we do like well that's
okay<00:02:55.920> we've<00:02:56.160> got<00:02:56.340> protection<00:02:56.519> on<00:02:56.940> the<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.209> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
okay we've got protection on the on the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.000 
okay we've got protection on the on the
ground<00:02:57.450> that's<00:02:57.570> okay<00:02:57.840> let's<00:02:58.410> do<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:58.709> you<00:02:58.950> know

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
ground that's okay let's do it you know

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.430 
ground that's okay let's do it you know
a<00:02:59.250> two-liter<00:02:59.970> mop<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.569> the<00:03:00.780> idea<00:03:01.170> here<00:03:01.230> is

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
a two-liter mop so the idea here is

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.890 
a two-liter mop so the idea here is
Mentos<00:03:02.310> have<00:03:02.550> nucleation<00:03:03.000> sites<00:03:03.360> Ross<00:03:03.720> is

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
Mentos have nucleation sites Ross is

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.460 
Mentos have nucleation sites Ross is
going<00:03:04.080> for<00:03:04.290> cover<00:03:05.150> and<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.420> candy<00:03:06.810> drops<00:03:07.170> into

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
going for cover and the candy drops into

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.250 
going for cover and the candy drops into
the<00:03:07.590> seat<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.100> cola<00:03:08.819> with<00:03:09.030> co2<00:03:09.330> yeah<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.930> lot<00:03:10.170> of

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
the seat the cola with co2 yeah a lot of

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
the seat the cola with co2 yeah a lot of
that's<00:03:10.380> gonna<00:03:10.470> come<00:03:10.739> shooting<00:03:10.950> us<00:03:11.069> so<00:03:11.160> if<00:03:11.220> you

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
that's gonna come shooting us so if you

can drop all five in at once at once

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.890 
can drop all five in at once at once
