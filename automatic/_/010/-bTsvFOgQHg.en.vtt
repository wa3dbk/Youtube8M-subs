00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.680
 today we are going to show you our system 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 dynamic of pallets vito the special 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.000
 this system is that the pallets from the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.070
 side of the shelf entrance is 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.350
 transport on rollers in a way 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.600
 independent towards the exit side of 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.090
 the shelf 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:35.160
 this means that the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:39.980
 fixed principle first in first out what 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.980
 special today is the new retainer 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.900
 Y 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.930
 this channel the dynamic shelf of 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.300
 pallets is completely full 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.440
 at the top we have 16 tons of 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.230
 we are going to teach you now how 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.800
 a wheelbarrow takes out the first pallet without 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.960
 any pressure this means that the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.540
 wheelbarrow extracts the first pallet and only 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.340
 then it is when the retainer stops 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.340
 and the rest of the pallets continue 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.230
 we are going to teach you now three cases that 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.700
 may occur in the withdrawal of 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.670
 pallets 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.619
 here our retainer presents advantages 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.969
 decisive with respect to existing 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:46.130
 to date the first case 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.219
 extra trolley the channel pallet and 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.229
 re-enter it in the channel with the 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.550
 flow stop type retainer system 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:57.120
 it's possible 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:02:00.230
 the retainer is not damaged and you do not have 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.230
 repair costs 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.650
 the second case 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.900
 what also happens with quite 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.490
 often in warehouses is that the 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.650
 driver of the wheelbarrow wants 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.820
 remove the pallet but another comes 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.820
 conductor in perpendicular direction 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.710
 the driver who removes the pallet only 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.480
 have a chance have to go back to 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.790
 focus the pallet on the channel 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.580
 as a consequence in usual systems 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.690
 of retainers the retainer breaks down 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.940
 the third case 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.870
 the driver of the truck lifts the 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.290
 pallet but it comes back down it is not damaged 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.290
 the flag 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.650
 no no 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.960
 the flow retainer this is simply 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.990
 unbreakable 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.600
 I thank you for your attention and in 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.310
