out

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
out

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.760 
out
but<00:00:18.539> anyways<00:00:18.810> yes<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> Halo<00:00:19.680> Reach

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
but anyways yes this is the Halo Reach

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.130 
but anyways yes this is the Halo Reach
and<00:00:20.160> I<00:00:20.279> am<00:00:20.460> playing<00:00:20.670> SWAT<00:00:21.150> if<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.779> don't<00:00:21.960> know

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
and I am playing SWAT if you don't know

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.509 
and I am playing SWAT if you don't know
what<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.350> means<00:00:22.650> that<00:00:22.800> means<00:00:22.920> there's<00:00:23.340> no

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
what that means that means there's no

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.210 
what that means that means there's no
shields<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:25.050> means<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.500> headshot<00:00:25.980> is

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
shields and that means one headshot is

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.779 
shields and that means one headshot is
one<00:00:26.670> kill<00:00:26.970> so<00:00:27.599> what<00:00:27.840> this<00:00:28.019> does<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.670> sort<00:00:29.670> of

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
one kill so what this does is sort of

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.500 
one kill so what this does is sort of
turn<00:00:30.150> Halo<00:00:30.990> Reach<00:00:31.590> into<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> twitch<00:00:32.910> shooter<00:00:33.149> a

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
turn Halo Reach into a twitch shooter a

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.000 
turn Halo Reach into a twitch shooter a
twitch<00:00:33.989> order<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.469> sort<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.710> like<00:00:34.800> Call<00:00:34.980> of

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
twitch order is sort of like Call of

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.119 
twitch order is sort of like Call of
Duty<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.760> like<00:00:36.469> the<00:00:37.469> first<00:00:37.649> one<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> shoot

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
Duty it's like the first one I shoot

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.790 
Duty it's like the first one I shoot
basically<00:00:38.640> wins<00:00:38.960> which<00:00:39.960> is<00:00:40.079> not<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.379> halo<00:00:40.649> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
basically wins which is not what halo is

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.069 
basically wins which is not what halo is
halo<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.460> usually<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.030> it<00:00:42.270> takes<00:00:42.600> five<00:00:42.780> shots

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
halo is usually like it takes five shots

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.020 
halo is usually like it takes five shots
for<00:00:43.350> each<00:00:43.440> person<00:00:43.860> if<00:00:43.980> you're<00:00:44.100> both<00:00:44.280> using<00:00:44.579> DMR

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
for each person if you're both using DMR

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.110 
for each person if you're both using DMR
so<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.739> speeds<00:00:46.739> up<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.190> gameplay<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.879> little

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
so this speeds up the gameplay a little

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.760 
so this speeds up the gameplay a little
bit<00:00:48.210> I<00:00:48.360> kind<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.690> like<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.230> makes<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> game

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
bit I kind of like it it makes the game

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
bit I kind of like it it makes the game
a<00:00:50.070> little<00:00:50.250> bit<00:00:50.489> easier<00:00:51.770> but<00:00:52.770> also<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:54.329> keeps

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
a little bit easier but also it it keeps

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.830 
a little bit easier but also it it keeps
that<00:00:54.780> level<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.350> skill<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.399> game<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.879> not

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
that level of skill in the game it's not

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240 
that level of skill in the game it's not
that<00:00:58.050> bad<00:00:58.230> you<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.859> me<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.070> way<00:00:59.160> there

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that bad you see me that way there

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.889 
that bad you see me that way there
getting<00:00:59.550> shot<00:00:59.730> it's<00:01:00.030> kind<00:01:00.239> of<00:01:00.359> difficult<00:01:00.870> to

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
getting shot it's kind of difficult to

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.349 
getting shot it's kind of difficult to
go<00:01:01.020> behind<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> head<00:01:01.590> but<00:01:02.399> yeah<00:01:02.579> that's<00:01:03.120> what

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
go behind the head but yeah that's what

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.210 
go behind the head but yeah that's what
it<00:01:03.510> sort<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.750> does<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:03.960> Call<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.500> Duty<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.949> sort

short<00:01:24.200> I<00:01:26.299> basically<00:01:27.799> a<00:01:28.799> pretty<00:01:29.430> good<00:01:29.579> strategy

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
short I basically a pretty good strategy

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.240 
short I basically a pretty good strategy
in<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.390> basically<00:01:30.869> if<00:01:31.710> your<00:01:31.979> team's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
in this is basically if your team's

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.800 
in this is basically if your team's
going<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> right<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.509> go<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.659> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
going to the right you can go to the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.929 
going to the right you can go to the
left<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.500> can<00:01:34.710> run<00:01:35.250> all<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.610> way<00:01:35.700> around
