00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.039
 hello in this video I show you 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.990
 how to save time to cut out a 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.950
 pepper so whatever its color 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.180
 the method is the same 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.310
 you're going to tell me it's not necessarily 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.289
 there we lose the most time it is not so 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.340
 complicated that that's true but you 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.080
 go see with this method we're going 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.789
 really save time 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.890
 it's super simple and it's winning 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.929
 little minutes here and there that we 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.550
 ends up winning a lot of freedom 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.380
 in our life was going to look on 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.030
 start with this peppers I would have just 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.040
 need a knife from a stand that does not 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.940
 do not scratch and pepper the 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.990
 first thing is we are going 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:47.030
 cut both ends of the pepper up 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.230
 here is here then our peppers we 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.920
 let's just do a 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:58.340
 cut on one of the sailing sides and 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:01:03.140
 we open the pepper and we have 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:06.020
 more than just look good 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.420
 remove all the white part that 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.770
 is not good 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.150
 that's it and you now have a 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.640
 slat plays slices of peppers he 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.930
 only left to cut 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.380
 so if you want to do some 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.380
 thin slats 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.010
 hop little reminder when you cut out 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.050
 like that, do not forget to put your fingers 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.670
 like that especially no fingers like that 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.050
 like that because obviously we can 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.800
 cut out while fingers like that 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.220
 will guide the knife and can not 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.340
 to cut oneself off could go back a bit 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.180
 as you go and if you 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.000
 prefer the small squares 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.850
 operate all your slats and that's it 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.160
 After you choose the size you 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.960
 do what you want like that 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.700
 please and that's this method is 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.650
 definitely what is created two more 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.930
 fast to cut out with just a 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.190
 knife a pepper we find ourselves very
