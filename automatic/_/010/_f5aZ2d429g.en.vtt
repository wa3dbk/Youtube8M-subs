00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
whitening my teeth what I do is I find

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.490 
whitening my teeth what I do is I find
that<00:02:53.079> it<00:02:53.260> lasts<00:02:53.500> about<00:02:54.220> six<00:02:54.400> months<00:02:55.169> well<00:02:56.169> and

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
that it lasts about six months well and

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.259 
that it lasts about six months well and
so<00:02:57.340> you<00:02:57.400> don't<00:02:57.760> want<00:02:57.909> to<00:02:58.000> do<00:02:58.090> this

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
so you don't want to do this

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.690 
so you don't want to do this
continuously<00:02:58.739> every<00:02:59.739> single<00:03:00.069> day<00:03:00.250> for<00:03:00.579> a<00:03:00.609> year

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
continuously every single day for a year

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.000 
continuously every single day for a year
that<00:03:01.120> would<00:03:01.359> completely<00:03:02.319> ruin<00:03:02.590> your<00:03:02.829> teeth

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010

if<00:04:05.889> it<00:04:06.129> actually<00:04:06.159> does<00:04:06.699> that<00:04:06.870> but<00:04:07.870> because<00:04:08.680> I

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:08.859 
if it actually does that but because I

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.890 
if it actually does that but because I
used<00:04:09.159> it<00:04:09.370> kind<00:04:09.519> of<00:04:09.639> in<00:04:09.819> conjunction<00:04:10.389> with<00:04:10.540> this

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
used it kind of in conjunction with this

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.159 
used it kind of in conjunction with this
but<00:04:11.379> I<00:04:11.409> feel<00:04:11.709> like<00:04:11.739> if<00:04:12.099> my<00:04:12.340> teeth<00:04:13.169> continuously

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.169 
but I feel like if my teeth continuously

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:15.960 
but I feel like if my teeth continuously
stay<00:04:14.530> light<00:04:14.829> without<00:04:15.040> using<00:04:15.400> the<00:04:15.609> whitening

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
stay light without using the whitening

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.879 
stay light without using the whitening
strips<00:04:16.239> then<00:04:16.690> maybe<00:04:16.959> this<00:04:17.229> works<00:04:17.500> really<00:04:17.769> well

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:17.889 
strips then maybe this works really well

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.659 
strips then maybe this works really well
too<00:04:18.329> but<00:04:19.329> I<00:04:19.389> can<00:04:19.719> say<00:04:20.139> that<00:04:20.169> my<00:04:20.650> team<00:04:20.950> don't

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
too but I can say that my team don't

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.470 
too but I can say that my team don't
look<00:04:21.820> like<00:04:21.969> they<00:04:22.180> have

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
look like they have

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.030 
look like they have
stains<00:04:22.840> on<00:04:23.080> it<00:04:23.110> that<00:04:23.410> could<00:04:23.620> be<00:04:23.740> from<00:04:23.890> the

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
stains on it that could be from the

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.040 
stains on it that could be from the
whitening<00:04:24.370> strips<00:04:24.610> for<00:04:24.820> this<00:04:25.150> but<00:04:25.690> they<00:04:25.810> just

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
whitening strips for this but they just

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.960 
whitening strips for this but they just
look<00:04:26.230> whiter<00:04:26.740> than<00:04:26.980> they've<00:04:27.190> been<00:04:27.220> in<00:04:27.430> a<00:04:27.700> long

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
look whiter than they've been in a long

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.840 
look whiter than they've been in a long
time<00:04:28.300> besides<00:04:29.140> that<00:04:29.380> I<00:04:29.800> would<00:04:30.220> still<00:04:30.490> rebuy

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
time besides that I would still rebuy

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.880 
time besides that I would still rebuy
this<00:04:31.060> because<00:04:31.570> it's<00:04:31.960> a<00:04:32.050> good<00:04:32.170> toothpaste<00:04:32.650> I

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
this because it's a good toothpaste I

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.240 
this because it's a good toothpaste I
feel<00:04:33.700> like<00:04:34.090> it<00:04:34.420> gets<00:04:34.630> really<00:04:35.200> really<00:04:35.560> foamy

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
feel like it gets really really foamy

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.830 
feel like it gets really really foamy
which<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.670> like<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:37.060> know<00:04:37.120> that<00:04:37.360> sounds<00:04:37.600> kind<00:04:37.720> of

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
which I like I know that sounds kind of

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.540 
which I like I know that sounds kind of
weird<00:04:37.900> but<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.320> like<00:04:38.560> it<00:04:38.770> because<00:04:38.860> it<00:04:39.070> makes<00:04:39.220> it

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
weird but I like it because it makes it

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.130 
weird but I like it because it makes it
feel<00:04:39.760> like<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:40.150> kind<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.360> gets<00:04:40.510> all<00:04:40.720> over<00:04:40.750> in<00:04:41.020> my
