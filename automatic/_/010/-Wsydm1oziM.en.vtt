00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.719
 lighten your hair without stripping as 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.110
 rinse dark hair to get 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.690
 one color is blonde blonde blond blond 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.420
 clear depends on the height of your 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.550
 natural hair 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.880
 what we are going to need is going to be 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.390
 peroxide 30 or peroxide 40 and the 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.100
 dye of your preference

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.730
 [Applause] 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:42.840
 as this dye does not have ash I'm going to 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.600
 add an ash or in a concealer 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.680
 blue concealer 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.400
 nothing more a pinch 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.320
 [Music] 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.460
 Now I'm going to add a few 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.350
 argan oil and a quarter of a 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.890
 ph ampule 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.890
 Y 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.810
 i 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.100
 it does not prevent 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.610
 ie since I saw 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.590
 I go there 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.890
 Now I'm going to divide my hair into four 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.890
 sections 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.990
 [Applause] 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.270
 [Music] 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.700
 You can use this procedure if 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.159
 you if you already have blond hair and 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.439
 you have growth you can apply it 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.140
 starting from growth and then in 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.320
 long or if you have your virgin hair what 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.570
 you can apply in the even you can 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.110
 apply is starting in growth 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.810
 and going to the or if you have the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.270
 clear growth and long parts and 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.340
 dark you can start long if at 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.780
 last growth 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.650
 I in my case first I will start in 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.320
 growth 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.320
 and I'm going to start from back to front 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.399
 all right 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.450
 I did not come 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.970
 that is, since I found out 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.350

 since growing application what 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.040
 let stand 15 to 20 minutes and 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.200
 there you spend long but if your hair 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.900
 in the part of the lengths it is already clear 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.270
 uses the next of 20 or 30 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.910
 depending on the texture of the hair or 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.290
 vice versa if you apply test first with 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:14.730
 Peroxide 40 in long you apply in 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.310
 growth as is a virgin area 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.200
 apply with next of 20 or 30 in 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.850
 growth since the time of 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.960
 exposure in growth now I 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.960

 so that it is distributed better we can 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.439
 use a comb and stick each strand 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.450
