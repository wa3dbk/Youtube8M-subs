00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.049 
definitely up to something here if he
takes<00:00:37.980> down<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.520> hatchery<00:00:38.879> at<00:00:38.969> the

takes down that one hatchery at the
front<00:00:39.300> that'll<00:00:39.540> definitely<00:00:39.690> chip<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.230> too

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410

thanks<00:00:41.340> gotta<00:00:41.730> lose<00:00:42.000> another<00:00:42.510> shuttle<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.770> I

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
thanks gotta lose another shuttle and I

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.200 
thanks gotta lose another shuttle and I
think<00:00:44.070> there<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.280> something<00:00:44.640> very<00:00:44.670> expensive

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
think there was something very expensive

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.750 
think there was something very expensive
in<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.780> shuttle<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.739> 0<00:00:47.010> is<00:00:47.100> clawing<00:00:47.489> his<00:00:47.730> way

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
in that shuttle so 0 is clawing his way

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.090 
in that shuttle so 0 is clawing his way
back<00:00:48.239> up<00:00:48.510> into<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.989> game<00:00:49.260> movie<00:00:49.680> he's<00:00:49.829> got<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
back up into this game movie he's got to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.799 
back up into this game movie he's got to
be<00:00:50.190> sweating<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> even<00:00:51.090> though<00:00:51.149> he's<00:00:51.180> doubled

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
be sweating it even though he's doubled

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.410 
be sweating it even though he's doubled
expanding<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.070> risky<00:00:53.399> from<00:00:54.149> movie

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
expanding this is so risky from movie

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.029 
expanding this is so risky from movie
especially<00:00:54.600> since<00:00:55.079> he<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.199> lost<00:00:55.590> what<00:00:56.010> I

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
especially since he just lost what I

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.819 
especially since he just lost what I
think<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:56.969> two<00:00:57.239> rivers<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.899> shuttle<00:00:58.170> all

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
think was two rivers in that shuttle all

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.670 
think was two rivers in that shuttle all
de<00:00:59.190> filers<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.670> ultra<00:01:00.390> lyst<00:01:00.600> coming<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.050> 40

at<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.240> choke<00:01:48.450> points<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.960> still<00:01:49.500> think

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
at one of the choke points I still think

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.350 
at one of the choke points I still think
he's<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> little<00:01:49.920> bit<00:01:50.130> indecisive<00:01:50.640> about<00:01:50.970> which

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
he's a little bit indecisive about which

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.960 
he's a little bit indecisive about which
choke<00:01:51.630> point<00:01:51.869> he<00:01:52.020> wants<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.320> attack<00:01:52.970> finding

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
choke point he wants to attack finding

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.940 
choke point he wants to attack finding
the<00:01:54.090> mutis<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.810> middle<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.170> nice<00:01:55.439> splash

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the mutis in the middle of nice splash

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.310 
the mutis in the middle of nice splash
on<00:01:56.340> those<00:01:56.549> muniz<00:01:56.969> taking<00:01:57.630> them<00:01:57.750> down<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.079> very

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
on those muniz taking them down to very

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.590 
on those muniz taking them down to very
very<00:01:58.380> low<00:01:58.740> health<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.130> think<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.579> finally<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
very low health I think and finally the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.789 
very low health I think and finally the
sixth<00:02:00.840> of<00:02:00.930> all<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.110> might<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.409> able<00:02:01.469> to<00:02:01.619> come<00:02:01.740> up

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
sixth of all it might be able to come up

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.380 
sixth of all it might be able to come up
since<00:02:02.340> there<00:02:02.520> are<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> ton<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.790> cannons<00:02:03.210> down

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
since there are a ton of cannons down

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.700 
since there are a ton of cannons down
there<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.930> should<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.320> able<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.560> protect

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
there that should be able to protect

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.160 
there that should be able to protect
protect<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.460> face<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.210> 8<00:02:06.360> o'clocks<00:02:06.719> mining

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
protect that face the 8 o'clocks mining

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.919 
protect that face the 8 o'clocks mining
comfortably<00:02:07.860> now<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.310> while<00:02:08.580> movie<00:02:09.060> has<00:02:09.450> more

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
comfortably now so while movie has more

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.320 
comfortably now so while movie has more
bases<00:02:10.470> than<00:02:10.500> zero<00:02:10.890> more<00:02:11.250> mining<00:02:11.640> bases<00:02:12.060> at

bases than zero more mining bases at

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.730 
bases than zero more mining bases at
this<00:02:12.780> point<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.260> that

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
this point and that

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.670 
this point and that
is<00:02:13.830> not<00:02:14.100> good<00:02:14.400> even<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.210> ultras<00:02:15.660> against<00:02:16.470> a

many cannons of course cannons aren't

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.510 
many cannons of course cannons aren't
going<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.450> do<00:02:30.540> much<00:02:30.720> against<00:02:31.050> dark<00:02:31.350> swarm<00:02:31.770> but

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
going to do much against dark swarm but

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.220 
going to do much against dark swarm but
we'll<00:02:33.120> see<00:02:33.300> what<00:02:33.420> movie<00:02:33.570> is<00:02:33.750> capable<00:02:34.080> of

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
we'll see what movie is capable of

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.510 
we'll see what movie is capable of
finally<00:02:34.590> coming<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:34.890> with<00:02:35.010> another<00:02:35.190> shuttle

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
lost the second shuttle but maybe can

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.540 
lost the second shuttle but maybe can
protect<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:39.780> one<00:02:39.990> may<00:02:40.650> be<00:02:40.680> coming<00:02:41.040> in<00:02:41.250> with

don't know what movies think he going

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.510 
don't know what movies think he going
through<00:02:48.390> all<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.600> these<00:02:48.960> sunken<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.920> the

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
through all of these sunken and the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.210 
through all of these sunken and the
ultra<00:02:51.000> list<00:02:51.210> but<00:02:51.420> I<00:02:51.450> think<00:02:51.870> Oh<00:02:51.990> van<00:02:52.710> movies

ultra list but I think Oh van movies
going<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.550> be<00:02:53.670> able<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.940> do<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.300> loses<00:02:55.110> a

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
going to be able to do this loses a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.600 
going to be able to do this loses a
Reaper<00:02:55.620> I<00:02:55.650> think<00:02:55.980> he<00:02:56.040> might<00:02:56.190> have<00:02:56.250> lost<00:02:56.430> a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
Reaper I think he might have lost a

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.090 
Reaper I think he might have lost a
second<00:02:56.880> Reaper<00:02:57.150> too<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:58.560> now<00:02:58.680> he's<00:02:58.830> in<00:02:58.950> here

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
second Reaper too and now he's in here

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.430 
second Reaper too and now he's in here
with<00:02:59.130> some<00:02:59.550> all<00:02:59.790> high<00:02:59.870> templar<00:03:00.870> storming<00:03:01.320> all

with some all high templar storming all
over<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.830> ultras<00:03:02.130> that's<00:03:02.310> going<00:03:02.460> to<00:03:02.520> weaken

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
over the ultras that's going to weaken

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.580 
over the ultras that's going to weaken
the<00:03:02.820> ultra<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.240> then<00:03:03.420> go<00:03:03.570> down<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.230> splash
