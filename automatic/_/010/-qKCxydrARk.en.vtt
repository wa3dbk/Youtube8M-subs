00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
think bazillions is a real number but

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.350 
think bazillions is a real number but
anyway<00:00:49.920> yeah<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.340> are<00:00:50.430> loads<00:00:50.760> of<00:00:50.969> guns<00:00:51.180> in

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360

anyway yeah there are loads of guns in
Borderlands<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.410> most<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> variation

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
Borderlands but most of the variation

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.680 
Borderlands but most of the variation
comes<00:00:53.399> from<00:00:53.579> slight<00:00:53.910> differences<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.510> things

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
comes from slight differences to things

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.750 
comes from slight differences to things
like<00:00:54.750> damage<00:00:55.320> reload<00:00:55.800> speed<00:00:56.160> rate<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.550> fire
