00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.340 
better you hold it up so as you can see
it<00:02:43.090> hangs<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.420> little<00:02:43.660> bit<00:02:43.750> longer<00:02:44.020> on<00:02:44.170> the

it hangs a little bit longer on the
right<00:02:44.500> hand<00:02:44.709> side<00:02:44.860> and<00:02:45.570> like<00:02:46.570> it's<00:02:47.080> kind<00:02:47.320> of

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
right hand side and like it's kind of

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.800 
right hand side and like it's kind of
like<00:02:47.500> new<00:02:48.370> twirl<00:02:48.700> it's<00:02:49.330> gonna<00:02:49.480> fan<00:02:49.780> out

because that way I'm not really good at
explaining<00:02:53.830> things<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.930> um<00:02:56.250> probably<00:02:57.810> it's<00:02:58.810> a

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
explaining things so um probably it's a
