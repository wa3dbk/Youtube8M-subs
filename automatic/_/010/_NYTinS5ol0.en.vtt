00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:03.439 

okay<00:00:01.589> here's<00:00:01.949> my<00:00:02.070> two<00:00:02.639> gear<00:00:02.879> automatic

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
okay here's my two gear automatic

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.039 
okay here's my two gear automatic
shifting<00:00:04.020> gear<00:00:04.350> box<00:00:04.819> so<00:00:05.819> that<00:00:05.850> it<00:00:06.359> shifts<00:00:06.629> two

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
shifting gear box so that it shifts two

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.780 
shifting gear box so that it shifts two
gears<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.680> automatically<00:00:08.280> does<00:00:08.580> it

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
gears and it automatically does it

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.330 
gears and it automatically does it
depending<00:00:09.450> on<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.660> pressure<00:00:09.870> on<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.500> tires<00:00:10.860> I

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
depending on the pressure on the tires I

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.700 
depending on the pressure on the tires I
was<00:00:12.120> going<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.330> put<00:00:12.450> this<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> car<00:00:13.110> but<00:00:13.500> it

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
was going to put this in the car but it

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.070 
was going to put this in the car but it
didn't<00:00:13.980> work<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.280> because<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:14.759> Mina<00:00:15.360> its<00:00:15.660> first

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
didn't work out because I Mina its first

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.140 
didn't work out because I Mina its first
off<00:00:16.320> its<00:00:16.500> its<00:00:16.980> size<00:00:17.340> was<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:18.420> too<00:00:18.600> big<00:00:18.630> and

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
off its its size was just too big and

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.429 
off its its size was just too big and
when<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.480> other<00:00:21.600> problem<00:00:21.990> was<00:00:22.109> when<00:00:22.320> you

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
when the other problem was when you

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.390 
when the other problem was when you
shift<00:00:22.800> gears<00:00:23.420> it's<00:00:24.420> these<00:00:25.109> gears<00:00:25.500> move<00:00:25.890> which

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
shift gears it's these gears move which

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.500 
shift gears it's these gears move which
causes<00:00:27.269> it<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.480> these<00:00:28.519> clashes<00:00:29.519> these<00:00:30.240> two

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
causes it to these clashes these two

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.330 
causes it to these clashes these two
years<00:00:30.869> touch<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.529> these<00:00:31.650> two<00:00:31.890> gears<00:00:32.099> touch

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
years touch and these two gears touch

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.720 
years touch and these two gears touch
and<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:32.910> wouldn't<00:00:33.360> work<00:00:33.420> at<00:00:34.320> all<00:00:34.730> after

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
and it just wouldn't work at all after

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.340 
and it just wouldn't work at all after
that<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.270> that's<00:00:36.510> after<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.320> couple

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
that and that's after just a couple

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.459 
that and that's after just a couple
shifts<00:00:37.950> or<00:00:38.370> if<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:38.940> shift<00:00:39.270> shifted<00:00:40.230> for<00:00:40.440> a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
shifts or if it's shift shifted for a

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.360 
shifts or if it's shift shifted for a
long<00:00:40.649> time<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:42.020> those<00:00:43.020> two<00:00:43.290> problem<00:00:43.739> those<00:00:44.160> two

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
long time so those two problem those two

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.160 
long time so those two problem those two
problems<00:00:44.760> stop<00:00:45.030> me<00:00:45.270> for<00:00:45.450> actually<00:00:45.600> putting<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
problems stop me for actually putting it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
problems stop me for actually putting it
in<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.320> car<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.950> i'll<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.100> show<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.850> this

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
in the car so i'll just show you it this

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.470 
in the car so i'll just show you it this
way<00:00:48.780> before<00:00:48.840> i<00:00:49.230> break<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.500> down<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.480> basically

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
way before i break it down so basically

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.709 
way before i break it down so basically
it<00:00:51.809> has<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.260> XL<00:00:52.649> motor<00:00:52.890> one<00:00:53.670> battery<00:00:54.120> box<00:00:54.360> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
it has one XL motor one battery box and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.299 
it has one XL motor one battery box and
one<00:00:55.260> wheel<00:00:56.219> attached<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:58.160> when<00:00:59.160> it's

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
one wheel attached to it and when it's

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.580 
one wheel attached to it and when it's
in<00:00:59.460> reverse<00:00:59.850> which<00:01:00.239> would<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.960> way<00:01:01.199> it

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
in reverse which would be this way it

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.630 
in reverse which would be this way it
does<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.760> shift<00:01:03.239> at<00:01:03.629> all<00:01:04.010> when<00:01:05.010> pressure<00:01:05.280> put

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
does not shift at all when pressure put

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.090 
does not shift at all when pressure put
on<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.960> but<00:01:06.960> when<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.500> forward<00:01:07.979> to

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
on it but when it's in forward to

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.550 
on it but when it's in forward to
actually<00:01:08.250> have<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> two<00:01:09.030> gear<00:01:09.560> capabilities

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
actually have the two gear capabilities

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.910 
actually have the two gear capabilities
so<00:01:10.920> basically<00:01:11.640> here's<00:01:12.510> it<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.560> the

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
so basically here's it going in in the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.130 
so basically here's it going in in the
fastest<00:01:14.369> gear<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.909> when<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.330> put<00:01:15.659> stress<00:01:16.080> on

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
fastest gear and when you put stress on

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.670 
fastest gear and when you put stress on
it<00:01:16.560> oh<00:01:17.130> sorry<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.420> put<00:01:18.600> stress<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it oh sorry and put stress on it it

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.770 
it oh sorry and put stress on it it
switches<00:01:20.189> gears<00:01:20.700> in<00:01:21.000> order<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:22.549> keep<00:01:23.549> going<00:01:24.299> so

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
switches gears in order to keep going so

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.280 
switches gears in order to keep going so
it<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.200> keep<00:01:25.470> moving<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> just<00:01:26.430> switches

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
it can keep moving and it just switches

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.929 
it can keep moving and it just switches
so<00:01:28.290> that's<00:01:28.950> when<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> doesn't<00:01:29.549> have<00:01:29.729> enough

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
so that's when it doesn't have enough

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.120 
so that's when it doesn't have enough
power<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.570> doesn't<00:01:30.869> stress<00:01:31.140> out<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.500> motor<00:01:31.770> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
power it doesn't stress out the motor it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.060 
power it doesn't stress out the motor it
just<00:01:32.369> uses<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.850> higher<00:01:33.180> torque<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.799> through

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
just uses a higher torque to get through

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.249 
just uses a higher torque to get through
so<00:01:35.369> that's<00:01:35.520> like<00:01:35.700> going<00:01:35.970> up<00:01:36.210> hills<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.020> stuff

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so that's like going up hills and stuff

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.380 
so that's like going up hills and stuff
like<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:38.150> there<00:01:39.150> they<00:01:39.390> go<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.750> last<00:01:40.020> time

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
like that there they go the last time

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.679 
like that there they go the last time
and<00:01:42.390> yeah<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.590> works<00:01:43.979> well<00:01:44.430> it's<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:45.119> like

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and yeah so it works well it's just like

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.539 
and yeah so it works well it's just like
I<00:01:45.899> said<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.439> see<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:46.979> happening<00:01:47.369> right

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
I said you can see this happening right

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.700 
I said you can see this happening right
now<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:48.119> little<00:01:48.840> gap<00:01:49.079> right<00:01:49.350> there<00:01:49.409> and

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
now a little gap right there and

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.069 
now a little gap right there and
eventually<00:01:49.920> these<00:01:50.520> two<00:01:50.850> views<00:01:51.149> all<00:01:51.540> four<00:01:51.869> will

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
eventually these two views all four will

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.929 
eventually these two views all four will
touch<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.710> it's<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.130> not<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.880> second<00:01:55.250> so<00:01:56.250> yeah

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
touch and it's just not a second so yeah

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.510 
touch and it's just not a second so yeah
I<00:01:56.969> mean<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.630> works<00:01:57.930> but<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.950> know<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.430> would

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
I mean it works but you know it would

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.340 
I mean it works but you know it would
need<00:01:59.729> improvements<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.719> actually<00:02:01.079> be<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.229> a

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
need improvements to actually be in a

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.600 
need improvements to actually be in a
car<00:02:01.619> based<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.549> size<00:02:02.909> and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
car based on size and

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.419 
car based on size and
whatever<00:02:04.000> but<00:02:04.300> one<00:02:04.660> last<00:02:04.900> time<00:02:07.860> such<00:02:08.860> as<00:02:09.100> gears

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
whatever but one last time such as gears

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.510
