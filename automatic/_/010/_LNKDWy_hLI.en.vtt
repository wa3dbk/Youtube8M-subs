00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
issues at that side that after i had

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.010 
issues at that side that after i had
pulled<00:04:10.250> this<00:04:10.340> apart<00:04:10.700> um<00:04:10.910> i<00:04:11.180> did<00:04:11.660> want<00:04:11.840> to<00:04:11.900> go

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:12.020 
pulled this apart um i did want to go

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.670 
pulled this apart um i did want to go
ahead<00:04:12.110> and<00:04:12.500> show<00:04:12.800> you<00:04:12.830> what<00:04:13.580> this<00:04:13.760> screen<00:04:14.680> or

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
ahead and show you what this screen or

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
screen the front a protective cover for

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.690 
screen the front a protective cover for
your<00:04:20.030> screen<00:04:20.830> actually<00:04:21.830> looks<00:04:22.340> like<00:04:22.520> without

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
your screen actually looks like without

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.760 
your screen actually looks like without
that<00:04:22.910> in<00:04:23.240> there<00:04:23.450> I<00:04:23.690> think<00:04:24.320> you<00:04:24.410> can<00:04:24.560> get<00:04:24.740> a

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
that in there I think you can get a

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.600 
that in there I think you can get a
better<00:04:24.950> idea<00:04:25.070> of<00:04:26.440> how<00:04:27.440> well<00:04:27.650> it's<00:04:27.860> been<00:04:28.070> sealed

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:28.610 
better idea of how well it's been sealed

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.290 
better idea of how well it's been sealed
around<00:04:29.169> these<00:04:30.169> this<00:04:30.469> is<00:04:30.620> actually<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.520> second

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
around these this is actually the second
