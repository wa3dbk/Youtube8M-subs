00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.850
 Hi everyone, today I'm going to leave you a 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.399
 recycled box with a lot of relief and 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.860
 very easy to do as you see I have 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:59.239
 Pieces of fabric can be any fabric 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:02.120
 that they do not use more I am going to cut strips of 5 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.220
 centimeters more or less in width and between 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.220
 15 and 20 centimeters long 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.300
 in a bowl I will mix with the biblical 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:19.060
 with a little water and I'm going to get wet 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.060
 well my strips that I already have cut 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.729
 as they see like that I'm going to go rolling up 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.049
 to build a flower with my hands them 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.049
 I'm going to give forms 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.640
 so the flower has to look 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.630
 How beautiful the rose is now the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.630
 let's put to dry 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.930
 when I have the amount that I am going to 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.450
 I want to put them for my paintings 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.520
 on a plastic and I'm going to leave them 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.210
 Dry very well until they are well 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.210
 hard 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.900
 as I see I have a piece of wood 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.480
 I did some reliefs with a 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.869
 syringe and noise mixed with cola 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.410
 vinyl then I painted it all color 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.410
 White 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.020
 Here I have some dry twigs that I put together and 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.430
 so I put them on the wood and I go 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.430
 putting together the design 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:35.290
 As you can see I have all the twigs 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.290
 stuck and my flowers are very dry and hard 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.220
 and so I'm going to start sticking the flowers 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.420
 on my twigs I use the pistol of 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.420
 silicone to paste 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:59.129
 when we already have everything well stuck 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:01.769
 let's grab our spray the one 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:05.690
 I chose is gold color you do it 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.690
 of the color that best suits you 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.390
 and we started painting I did not paint it 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.840
 complete only the complete flowers and 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.840
 twigs 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:25.190
 you can see that only the twigs and 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.760
 the flowers are painted on their 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:31.330
 whole the background just splash it with 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.330
 aerosol 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.020
 and so we will be finished, I hope 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.870
 they liked it is a simple job 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.870
 and very cute and decorative 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.920
 Y 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.200
 do not stop watching my next video I'm going 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.760
 to teach how to make this lady juana in 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.760
