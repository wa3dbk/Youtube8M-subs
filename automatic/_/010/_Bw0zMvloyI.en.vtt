are able to twist this so in case some
reason<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:32.870> have<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.470> need<00:03:34.340> to<00:03:34.370> angle<00:03:34.940> it<00:03:35.030> to

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
reason you have a need to angle it to

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.190 
reason you have a need to angle it to
the<00:03:35.420> back<00:03:35.629> you<00:03:35.930> can<00:03:36.049> do<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:38.720> just<00:03:39.049> for

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
the back you can do that and just for

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.750 
the back you can do that and just for
comparison<00:03:39.319> or<00:03:39.920> now<00:03:40.069> have<00:03:40.310> it<00:03:40.459> attached<00:03:40.730> to

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
comparison or now have it attached to

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.539

camcorders

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:20.230 

now<00:04:07.050> here<00:04:07.379> a<00:04:07.409> 20-degree<00:04:08.010> sitting

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:20.240

practically<00:04:21.240> in<00:04:21.360> microphone

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.520 

here's<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.590> wind<00:04:31.890> noise<00:04:32.100> test<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.970> HC<00:04:33.630> 96<00:04:34.320> is

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
here's a wind noise test the HC 96 is

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:41.000 
here's a wind noise test the HC 96 is
front-facing<00:04:35.400> built-in<00:04:36.180> microphone

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.830 

this<00:04:42.010> is<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.370> external<00:04:42.820> microphone<00:04:43.000> without

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
this is the external microphone without

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:51.650 
this is the external microphone without
the<00:04:44.230> windsock<00:04:44.770> in<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.190> 90<00:04:45.520> degrees

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.720 

and<00:04:52.020> this<00:04:52.260> is<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.560> external<00:04:52.860> microphone<00:04:53.460> with

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
and this is the external microphone with

00:04:53.730 --> 00:05:03.600 
and this is the external microphone with
the<00:04:53.940> winsome<00:04:54.470> 92<00:04:55.470> reset

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.730 

just<00:05:04.610> removed<00:05:05.000> inside

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.469 

and<00:05:09.860> back<00:05:10.639> to<00:05:10.850> the<00:05:10.970> billion<00:05:11.360> microphone<00:05:13.479> this

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
and back to the billion microphone this

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.870 
and back to the billion microphone this
is<00:05:14.539> not<00:05:14.900> a<00:05:14.930> cheap<00:05:15.350> microphone<00:05:15.680> brand<00:05:16.430> new<00:05:16.639> they

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
is not a cheap microphone brand new they

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.210 
is not a cheap microphone brand new they
cost<00:05:17.180> around<00:05:17.440> 120<00:05:18.970> $230<00:05:19.970> I<00:05:20.470> got<00:05:21.470> this<00:05:21.620> one<00:05:21.860> used

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:22.220 
cost around 120 $230 I got this one used

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.450 
cost around 120 $230 I got this one used
for<00:05:22.610> less<00:05:22.880> than<00:05:23.060> half<00:05:23.240> that<00:05:23.300> price<00:05:23.570> so

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:24.460 
for less than half that price so

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.469 
for less than half that price so
hopefully<00:05:25.460> this<00:05:25.610> video<00:05:25.820> will<00:05:26.150> help<00:05:26.210> you

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
hopefully this video will help you

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.270 
hopefully this video will help you
decide<00:05:26.930> whether<00:05:27.259> or<00:05:27.350> not<00:05:27.530> it's<00:05:27.889> worth<00:05:28.100> the

money<00:05:28.310> so<00:05:29.060> that's<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:29.449> sony<00:05:29.750> ECM<00:05:30.500> HST<00:05:31.310> 1

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
money so that's the sony ECM HST 1

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:34.629 
money so that's the sony ECM HST 1
stereo<00:05:32.300> microphone<00:05:32.979> for<00:05:33.979> the<00:05:34.220> active
