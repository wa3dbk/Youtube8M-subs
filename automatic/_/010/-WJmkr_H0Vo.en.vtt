00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
good color to do this yeah we were using

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.400 
good color to do this yeah we were using
you<00:02:42.590> faucet<00:02:43.070> flies<00:02:43.310> for<00:02:44.120> resident<00:02:44.660> coho<00:02:45.140> and

you faucet flies for resident coho and

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.590 
you faucet flies for resident coho and
we<00:02:46.070> did<00:02:46.220> really<00:02:46.400> well<00:02:46.519> with<00:02:46.910> them<00:02:47.120> in<00:02:47.390> white

we did really well with them in white
yeah<00:02:48.500> whites<00:02:48.920> they<00:02:49.489> seem<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:50.120> white<00:02:50.450> I

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
yeah whites they seem to like white I

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.410 
yeah whites they seem to like white I
think<00:02:50.930> white<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.560> lot<00:02:52.010> of<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.480> shrimp<00:02:53.480> type

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
think white a lot of the shrimp type

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.440 
think white a lot of the shrimp type
crustaceans<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.570> they<00:02:56.840> like<00:02:57.140> seem<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.590> be<00:02:57.769> a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
crustaceans that they like seem to be a

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.420 
crustaceans that they like seem to be a
kind<00:02:59.450> of<00:02:59.600> a<00:02:59.660> semi-transparent<00:03:00.410> I<00:03:01.040> think<00:03:01.250> their

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
kind of a semi-transparent I think their

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.720 
kind of a semi-transparent I think their
colors<00:03:01.790> kind<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.180> change<00:03:02.480> throughout<00:03:02.959> the<00:03:03.730> I'm

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
colors kind of change throughout the I'm

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.490 
colors kind of change throughout the I'm
going<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:04.970> tie<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.180> little<00:03:05.569> bit<00:03:05.810> of<00:03:05.930> orange

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
going to tie a little bit of orange

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.400 
going to tie a little bit of orange
crystal<00:03:07.100> flash<00:03:07.400> on<00:03:07.700> it<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.090> turn<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.989> give

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
crystal flash on it and turn that give

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.030 
crystal flash on it and turn that give
it<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:09.590> little<00:03:09.739> bit<00:03:09.980> of<00:03:10.100> flash<00:03:11.769> now<00:03:12.769> what<00:03:12.950> I'm

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
it a little bit of flash now what I'm

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.259 
it a little bit of flash now what I'm
going<00:03:13.130> to<00:03:13.220> do<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.519> come<00:03:13.760> down<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.120> make<00:03:14.239> a

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
going to do is come down and make a

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.229 
going to do is come down and make a
dubbing<00:03:14.720> loop<00:03:15.160> which<00:03:16.160> will<00:03:16.430> tie<00:03:16.730> on<00:03:16.940> right

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
dubbing loop which will tie on right

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.449 
dubbing loop which will tie on right
there<00:03:18.220> wrap<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.250> forward<00:03:21.100> we'll<00:03:22.100> put<00:03:22.310> on<00:03:22.430> our

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
there wrap that forward we'll put on our

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.810 
there wrap that forward we'll put on our
dubbing<00:03:23.060> twister<00:03:23.239> on<00:03:23.810> here<00:03:24.320> and<00:03:24.579> here's<00:03:25.579> some

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
dubbing twister on here and here's some

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.060 
dubbing twister on here and here's some
of<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:29.079> dubbing<00:03:30.079> that<00:03:30.200> I've<00:03:30.320> mixed<00:03:30.560> up<00:03:30.799> from

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
of the dubbing that I've mixed up from

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.930 
of the dubbing that I've mixed up from
the<00:03:31.220> fur<00:03:31.489> well<00:03:32.480> do<00:03:32.900> is<00:03:33.320> all<00:03:33.650> I<00:03:33.950> kind<00:03:34.459> of<00:03:34.549> roll<00:03:34.760> it

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
the fur well do is all I kind of roll it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.180 
the fur well do is all I kind of roll it
into<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.329> a<00:03:38.110> length<00:03:39.110> so<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.500> it's<00:03:39.769> more<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
into a a length so that it's more of the

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.530 
into a a length so that it's more of the
shape<00:03:40.489> that<00:03:40.519> I<00:03:40.760> want<00:03:40.790> it<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.150> go<00:03:41.390> on<00:03:43.209> we'll<00:03:44.209> slip

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
shape that I want it to go on we'll slip

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.420 
shape that I want it to go on we'll slip
it<00:03:44.750> between<00:03:45.670> the<00:03:46.670> loop

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.810 

yeah<00:03:52.430> spin<00:03:53.390> it<00:03:53.420> on<00:03:53.660> here<00:03:54.110> that<00:03:54.580> might<00:03:55.580> be<00:03:55.790> a

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
yeah spin it on here that might be a

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.180 
yeah spin it on here that might be a
little<00:03:56.120> bit<00:03:56.390> too<00:03:56.660> much<00:03:56.840> but<00:03:57.010> we'll<00:03:58.010> worry

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
little bit too much but we'll worry

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.010 
little bit too much but we'll worry

carapace a small shell back on this with
another<00:05:37.650> thousand<00:05:38.250> now<00:05:39.150> I'm<00:05:39.360> going<00:05:39.539> to<00:05:39.630> do

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
approximately well about the same way

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.760 
approximately well about the same way
but<00:05:44.610> because<00:05:45.120> I'm<00:05:45.270> going<00:05:45.539> to<00:05:45.690> be<00:05:45.900> because<00:05:46.350> of

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
but because I'm going to be because of

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.400 
but because I'm going to be because of
the<00:05:46.860> fact<00:05:47.070> that<00:05:47.220> this<00:05:47.460> stem<00:05:48.210> is<00:05:48.419> oval<00:05:48.900> I'm

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
the fact that this stem is oval I'm

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.980 
the fact that this stem is oval I'm
going<00:05:49.650> to<00:05:49.710> want<00:05:50.669> to<00:05:50.789> flatten<00:05:51.150> it<00:05:51.449> so<00:05:51.690> that<00:05:51.870> it

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
going to want to flatten it so that it

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:58.640 
going to want to flatten it so that it
will<00:05:52.139> stay<00:05:55.759> flat<00:05:56.759> on<00:05:57.030> top<00:05:57.060> of<00:05:57.509> that<00:05:57.720> so<00:05:58.470> I'm

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
will stay flat on top of that so I'm

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.100 
will stay flat on top of that so I'm
pinching<00:05:59.610> it<00:05:59.789> and<00:06:00.030> squeezing<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.780> with<00:06:00.930> my

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.110

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
thumb so I can get it flat on top now we

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.210 
thumb so I can get it flat on top now we
can<00:06:05.039> hold<00:06:05.340> that<00:06:05.610> on<00:06:05.759> the<00:06:05.789> top<00:06:06.449> of<00:06:06.479> that<00:06:07.220> bring
