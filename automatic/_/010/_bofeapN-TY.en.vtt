 minecraft a very very handy so 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.980
 first of all so once you have 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.210

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:51.050
 percentage to ppda theo percentage 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.640

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.210
 you must have at least started this morning 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.730
 once so it is with forging a 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:03.829
 learned mix had installed a z in 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:08.960
 config and you open with our no 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.240
 plus plus file m my tracks here 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:15.170
 will be for later 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:20.149
 then you have to open the file 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:22.939
 resources mode the streaming file 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.460

 just and so has your music 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.679
 it has to be a format 

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:35.719
 I have so I advise you 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.990
 to use the software called the 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:42.590
 qca chuck that I have to find the 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:49.280
 so hoist that very versatile so we 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:53.889
 for example I say it to record 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.889
 my screen so the green con 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.810
 I do not know I think so 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:10.670
 that's for sure so I'll do video 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:18.080
 converter so here i 'm going to go in 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:22.800
 auger and I will go to my music 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:25.130
 to search for music what is what 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.130
 could well 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:37.970
 matt the black so I'm sliding this file to 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:45.850
 wrestler tubes so that's after I 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.850
 do I'm going to change 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.890
 at the end of the day I'm going to be all 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.800
 ic 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.870
 So here and you convert 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.840
 we can see ti 6th files been created 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:15.630
 it's not over yet a little bit 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.880
 wait and so I wanted to you 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.820
 thank because I'm starting to have 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.820
 more and more subscribers and so that's me 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.710
 it motivates me to see videos there like 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.100
 this one I find him a port and the 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.890
 fight I'm me I 'm going to present 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.810
 so now it's over 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.910
 you will move this file from your 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.170
 or copy it as you want but 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.790
 after that I'm no longer useful because I 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.820
 am in mp3 which I know place 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:45.570
 direct streaming video 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.630
 then I advise you to copy his 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:54.390
 six faster and like that so 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:56.060
 then you go here so that's when 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.030
 you will have if you are a few teeth 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.070
 so then you go in his movie he 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.900
 have to put it's very important it takes 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.200
 put exactly the name of your 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.770
 file that you want 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.600

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.910
 So these high lands that is why 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.220

 at the foot of the lighthouse 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.250
 so the 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.250
