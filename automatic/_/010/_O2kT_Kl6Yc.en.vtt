00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.610 

alright<00:00:00.750> so<00:00:00.870> now<00:00:00.930> I'm<00:00:01.020> going<00:00:01.170> to<00:00:01.230> make<00:00:01.319> the

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
alright so now I'm going to make the

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.409 
alright so now I'm going to make the
third<00:00:02.070> thing<00:00:02.340> that<00:00:02.399> we<00:00:02.550> commonly<00:00:03.000> uses

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
third thing that we commonly uses

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.900 
third thing that we commonly uses
blendtec<00:00:03.780> for<00:00:04.049> and<00:00:04.259> that<00:00:04.440> is<00:00:04.830> almond<00:00:05.430> butter

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
blendtec for and that is almond butter

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.299 
blendtec for and that is almond butter
what<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.569> really<00:00:06.810> like<00:00:06.930> about<00:00:06.960> this<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:08.099> mean

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
what I really like about this is I mean

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.919 
what I really like about this is I mean
turned<00:00:08.519> into<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:09.000> own<00:00:09.210> water<00:00:09.420> at<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.690> store

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
turned into my own water at the store

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.870 
turned into my own water at the store
but<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.040> cheaper<00:00:11.400> way<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.519> do<00:00:11.759> it

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
but this is a cheaper way to do it

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.549 
but this is a cheaper way to do it
because<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.389> can<00:00:12.420> get<00:00:12.599> almost<00:00:12.780> for<00:00:12.929> about<00:00:13.049> six

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
because you can get almost for about six

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.400 
because you can get almost for about six
dollars<00:00:13.860> an<00:00:13.950> ounce<00:00:14.099> of<00:00:14.280> punch<00:00:14.490> versus<00:00:15.410> ten

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
dollars an ounce of punch versus ten

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.890 
dollars an ounce of punch versus ten
dollars<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.710> pound<00:00:16.830> for<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.100> jar<00:00:17.369> of<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.609> and<00:00:18.180> you

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
dollars a pound for a jar of it and you

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.330 
dollars a pound for a jar of it and you
can<00:00:19.020> make<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.140> raw<00:00:19.350> which<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.859> really<00:00:20.160> don't

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
can make it raw which you really don't

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.090 
can make it raw which you really don't
find<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.760> often<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.840> stores<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.320> these<00:00:22.859> fish

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
find you often in stores so these fish

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:32.450 
find you often in stores so these fish
cold<00:00:23.460> raw<00:00:23.670> almonds<00:00:25.189> about<00:00:26.189> two<00:00:26.369> cups<00:00:31.460> and

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
cold raw almonds about two cups and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.100 
cold raw almonds about two cups and
that's<00:00:32.759> really<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.090> only<00:00:33.149> ingredient<00:00:33.989> you

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that's really the only ingredient you

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.190 
that's really the only ingredient you
necessarily<00:00:34.770> need<00:00:34.920> sometimes<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.790> gonna

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
necessarily need sometimes it's gonna

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.000 
necessarily need sometimes it's gonna
jam<00:00:37.200> up<00:00:37.380> a<00:00:37.440> little<00:00:37.590> bit<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.860> when<00:00:37.950> that

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
jam up a little bit and when that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.049 
jam up a little bit and when that
happens<00:00:38.340> I<00:00:38.399> need<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.610> add<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> little<00:00:38.850> bit<00:00:38.969> of

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
happens I need to add a little bit of

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.090 
happens I need to add a little bit of
oil<00:00:39.210> so<00:00:39.510> here<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.050> have<00:00:40.110> grapeseed<00:00:40.590> oil

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
oil so here I have grapeseed oil

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.369 
oil so here I have grapeseed oil
if<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.399> use<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.879> la<00:00:42.300> minute<00:00:42.360> I'll<00:00:42.719> use<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.110> but

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
if I use a la minute I'll use that but

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.520 
if I use a la minute I'll use that but
in<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:43.829> case<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.160> grape<00:00:44.340> seed<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.379> you

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
in this case it's grape seed so this you

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.270 
in this case it's grape seed so this you
just<00:00:46.649> need<00:00:47.129> one<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:48.180> one<00:00:49.110> cycle<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:50.100> like

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
just need one for one cycle just like

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:07.660 
just need one for one cycle just like
this

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.920 

all<00:01:08.670> right<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> next<00:01:09.120> few<00:01:09.510> want<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.780> let

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
all right so the next few want to let

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.020 
all right so the next few want to let
you<00:01:09.990> do<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.350> knock<00:01:10.890> down<00:01:11.160> setting<00:01:11.940> this

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
you do this knock down setting this

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.140 
you do this knock down setting this
stuff<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.360> sides<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:13.310> can<00:01:14.310> paint<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
stuff on the sides you can paint the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.930 
stuff on the sides you can paint the
speed<00:01:15.360> up<00:01:15.480> high<00:01:15.660> or<00:01:15.900> anything<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.320> starts<00:01:16.680> to

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
speed up high or anything that starts to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.120 
speed up high or anything that starts to
butter<00:01:18.110> also<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> can<00:01:19.350> add<00:01:19.500> quick<00:01:19.770> maple

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
butter also you can add quick maple

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.130 
butter also you can add quick maple
syrup<00:01:20.490> or<00:01:20.760> some<00:01:21.240> sea<00:01:21.420> solid<00:01:21.750> which<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.930> what<00:01:22.080> I

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
syrup or some sea solid which is what I

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.680 
syrup or some sea solid which is what I
have<00:01:22.260> here<00:01:22.560> I'm<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.580> big<00:01:23.760> tendency<00:01:23.940> salt<00:01:24.390> over

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
have here I'm a big tendency salt over

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:55.850 
have here I'm a big tendency salt over
it<00:01:27.380> now<00:01:28.380> okay<00:01:28.770> five

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.170 

all<00:01:56.860> right<00:01:56.980> so<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.160> can<00:01:57.280> see<00:01:57.430> that<00:01:57.610> some

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
all right so you can see that some

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.580 
all right so you can see that some
butter<00:01:58.390> is<00:01:58.540> starting<00:01:58.870> to<00:01:58.960> form<00:01:59.230> at<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.470> bottom

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
butter is starting to form at the bottom

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.730 
butter is starting to form at the bottom
there<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:01.060> all<00:02:01.180> you<00:02:01.270> really<00:02:01.300> do<00:02:01.540> now<00:02:01.720> is<00:02:02.020> keep

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
there so all you really do now is keep

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.080 
there so all you really do now is keep
knocking<00:02:03.040> down<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.220> sides<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:03.760> keep<00:02:03.880> reading

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
knocking down the sides and keep reading

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.990 
knocking down the sides and keep reading
it<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:04.330> screen<00:02:04.480> 5<00:02:05.040> until<00:02:08.580> so<00:02:09.580> usually<00:02:09.850> takes

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
it on screen 5 until so usually takes

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.470 
it on screen 5 until so usually takes
about<00:02:10.470> 5<00:02:11.470> 6<00:02:11.800> 20<00:02:11.980> sometimes<00:02:12.400> maybe<00:02:12.640> 10<00:02:13.000> cycles

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
about 5 6 20 sometimes maybe 10 cycles

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.790 
about 5 6 20 sometimes maybe 10 cycles
like<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.080> it<00:02:14.170> does<00:02:14.290> take<00:02:14.500> a<00:02:14.530> little<00:02:14.680> while

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
like that so it does take a little while

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.410 
like that so it does take a little while
but<00:02:15.610> it's<00:02:16.000> really<00:02:16.120> not<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.800> I'm<00:02:17.920> gonna<00:02:18.420> I'll

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
but it's really not so I'm gonna I'll

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:27.570 
but it's really not so I'm gonna I'll
show<00:02:19.570> you<00:02:20.070> all<00:02:25.680> right<00:02:26.680> so<00:02:26.860> let's<00:02:27.010> open<00:02:27.130> this<00:02:27.370> up

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
show you all right so let's open this up

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.230 
show you all right so let's open this up
this<00:02:27.850> has<00:02:28.000> been<00:02:28.180> about<00:02:28.510> 8<00:02:29.110> cycles<00:02:29.560> or<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.240> so

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
this has been about 8 cycles or so so

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.970 
this has been about 8 cycles or so so
you<00:02:31.270> can<00:02:31.600> see<00:02:31.780> that<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:31.990> consistency<00:02:32.530> out<00:02:32.650> now

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
you can see that the consistency out now

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.430 
you can see that the consistency out now
is<00:02:33.520> this<00:02:34.060> really<00:02:34.330> nice<00:02:34.510> stuff<00:02:34.780> it's<00:02:34.990> uh<00:02:35.140> it's

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
is this really nice stuff it's uh it's

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.050 
is this really nice stuff it's uh it's
not<00:02:35.590> like<00:02:35.770> peanut<00:02:36.400> butter<00:02:36.459> consistency<00:02:37.030> I

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
not like peanut butter consistency I

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.400 
not like peanut butter consistency I
mean<00:02:37.240> almond<00:02:37.480> butter<00:02:37.660> in<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.840> store<00:02:38.140> is

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
mean almond butter in a store is

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.290 
mean almond butter in a store is
generally<00:02:38.709> gonna<00:02:38.830> be<00:02:39.010> kind<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.850> runny<00:02:40.090> but

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
generally gonna be kind of runny but

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.430 
generally gonna be kind of runny but
I'll<00:02:40.360> actually<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:40.750> this<00:02:40.900> because<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.260> turns

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
I'll actually like this because it turns

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.830 
I'll actually like this because it turns
out<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.620> little<00:02:41.890> bit<00:02:41.980> creamier<00:02:42.570> doesn't<00:02:43.570> run<00:02:43.690> so

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
out a little bit creamier doesn't run so

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.990 
out a little bit creamier doesn't run so
much
