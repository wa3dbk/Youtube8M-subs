00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.150 

let's<00:00:20.320> talk<00:00:20.560> a<00:00:20.590> little<00:00:20.710> bit<00:00:20.920> about<00:00:21.160> hammers

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.670 

the<00:00:27.160> hammer<00:00:27.430> itself<00:00:30.029> cannot<00:00:31.029> be<00:00:31.349> harder<00:00:32.349> than

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
the hammer itself cannot be harder than

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.790 
the hammer itself cannot be harder than
the<00:00:32.830> tools<00:00:33.070> that<00:00:33.250> you're<00:00:33.489> going<00:00:33.550> to<00:00:33.820> strike

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
the tools that you're going to strike

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.650 
the tools that you're going to strike
there's<00:00:35.800> a<00:00:35.949> balance<00:00:36.400> in<00:00:36.580> the<00:00:37.150> rockwell

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
there's a balance in the rockwell

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.840 
there's a balance in the rockwell
hardness<00:00:37.989> of<00:00:38.290> the<00:00:38.410> hammer<00:00:38.650> it<00:00:39.309> needs<00:00:39.550> to<00:00:39.699> be

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
hardness of the hammer it needs to be

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.070 
hardness of the hammer it needs to be
maintained<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.980> around<00:00:42.309> 54<00:00:43.150> rockwell<00:00:43.720> with

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
maintained it's around 54 rockwell with

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.549 
maintained it's around 54 rockwell with
a<00:00:44.320> hammer<00:00:44.920> made<00:00:45.220> out<00:00:45.400> of<00:00:45.580> 41<00:00:46.090> 40<00:00:46.570> I<00:00:49.260> don't<00:00:50.260> want

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
a hammer made out of 41 40 I don't want

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.729 
a hammer made out of 41 40 I don't want
them<00:00:51.430> any<00:00:52.120> impressions<00:00:52.870> to<00:00:53.019> be<00:00:53.140> made<00:00:53.350> in<00:00:53.589> the

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
them any impressions to be made in the

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.299 
them any impressions to be made in the
hammer<00:00:54.809> if<00:00:55.809> I<00:00:56.019> do<00:00:56.080> get<00:00:56.440> an<00:00:56.559> impression<00:00:56.890> in<00:00:57.220> the

hammer if I do get an impression in the

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.600 
hammer if I do get an impression in the
Hammers<00:00:57.670> probably<00:00:58.360> either<00:00:58.809> my<00:00:59.199> tools<00:00:59.530> are<00:00:59.890> too

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
Hammers probably either my tools are too

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.670 
Hammers probably either my tools are too
hard<00:01:03.150> or<00:01:04.150> my<00:01:04.479> hammer<00:01:04.720> is<00:01:04.900> just<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.199> scare<00:01:05.470> a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
hard or my hammer is just a scare a

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.460 
hard or my hammer is just a scare a
little<00:01:05.890> bit<00:01:06.159> soft<00:01:06.460> but<00:01:06.820> if<00:01:07.479> I<00:01:07.600> can<00:01:07.810> attain<00:01:08.229> that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
little bit soft but if I can attain that

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.310 
little bit soft but if I can attain that
54<00:01:09.130> rockwell<00:01:09.670> on<00:01:09.850> my<00:01:10.000> hammer<00:01:10.270> it<00:01:11.020> should

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
54 rockwell on my hammer it should

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.270 
54 rockwell on my hammer it should
maintain<00:01:11.729> no<00:01:12.729> matter<00:01:12.940> what<00:01:13.210> I'm<00:01:13.330> striking<00:01:14.280> if

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
maintain no matter what I'm striking if

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.390 
maintain no matter what I'm striking if
this<00:01:15.549> goes<00:01:15.760> up<00:01:16.000> if<00:01:16.900> that<00:01:17.110> number<00:01:17.650> goes<00:01:17.890> up<00:01:18.130> and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
this goes up if that number goes up and

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.070 
this goes up if that number goes up and
that<00:01:18.460> this<00:01:18.670> gets<00:01:18.850> harder<00:01:19.330> and<00:01:19.510> harder<00:01:19.570> and

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
that this gets harder and harder and

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.830 
that this gets harder and harder and
harder<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:21.460> we<00:01:21.610> get<00:01:21.760> up<00:01:21.909> into<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.270> 50s<00:01:22.420> and

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
harder and we get up into the 50s and

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.599 
harder and we get up into the 50s and
the<00:01:23.320> 60s<00:01:24.719> now<00:01:25.719> we're<00:01:26.049> way<00:01:26.829> harder<00:01:27.280> than<00:01:27.490> our

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:27.609 
the 60s now we're way harder than our

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.380 
the 60s now we're way harder than our
tool<00:01:27.939> and<00:01:29.399> we're<00:01:30.399> dealing<00:01:30.759> with<00:01:30.939> some<00:01:31.149> mass

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
tool and we're dealing with some mass

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.959 
tool and we're dealing with some mass
here<00:01:32.939> now<00:01:33.939> the<00:01:34.000> hammer<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:36.189> going<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.640> strike

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
here now the hammer is going to strike

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.359 
here now the hammer is going to strike
this<00:01:37.270> small<00:01:37.659> tool<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:40.329> tool<00:01:40.359> is

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
this small tool and the tool is

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.889 
this small tool and the tool is
compressed<00:01:42.369> between<00:01:42.609> the<00:01:43.060> anvil<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:43.719> this

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
compressed between the anvil and this

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.800 
compressed between the anvil and this
hammer<00:01:44.170> when<00:01:44.500> it's<00:01:44.649> struck<00:01:45.329> so<00:01:46.329> if<00:01:46.479> this<00:01:46.659> is

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
hammer when it's struck so if this is

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.489 
hammer when it's struck so if this is
extremely<00:01:47.289> hard<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:48.359> I<00:01:49.359> hit<00:01:49.689> that<00:01:49.960> with<00:01:50.320> the

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
extremely hard and I hit that with the

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.239 
extremely hard and I hit that with the
force<00:01:50.770> necessary<00:01:51.039> to<00:01:51.579> make<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:52.060> tool<00:01:52.299> work

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
force necessary to make that tool work

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.709 
force necessary to make that tool work
what's<00:01:54.249> probably<00:01:54.729> going<00:01:54.969> to<00:01:55.060> happen<00:01:55.149> is<00:01:55.570> I'm

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719 
what's probably going to happen is I'm

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.410 
what's probably going to happen is I'm
going<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.079> blow<00:01:56.350> this<00:01:56.590> tool<00:01:56.890> up<00:01:57.299> because<00:01:58.299> I'm

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
going to blow this tool up because I'm

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.300 
going to blow this tool up because I'm
not<00:01:58.570> getting<00:01:58.780> any<00:01:59.049> absorption<00:01:59.829> into<00:02:00.070> my

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
not getting any absorption into my

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.179 
not getting any absorption into my
hammer<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.990> I<00:02:02.109> want<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.469> certain<00:02:02.740> amount<00:02:02.859> of

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
hammer and I want a certain amount of

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.059 
hammer and I want a certain amount of
that<00:02:03.399> I<00:02:03.640> want<00:02:04.090> it<00:02:04.240> to<00:02:04.270> absorb<00:02:04.749> a<00:02:05.469> little<00:02:05.649> bit<00:02:05.950> of

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
that I want it to absorb a little bit of

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.950 
that I want it to absorb a little bit of
that<00:02:06.159> blow<00:02:06.490> into<00:02:06.759> my<00:02:07.030> tool<00:02:09.390> so<00:02:10.390> that's<00:02:10.600> that's

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
that blow into my tool so that's that's

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:14.220 
that blow into my tool so that's that's
just<00:02:11.319> it<00:02:11.500> you<00:02:11.850> just<00:02:12.850> can't<00:02:13.060> let<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.510> get<00:02:14.020> that

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
just it you just can't let this get that

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.309 
just it you just can't let this get that
hard<00:02:14.670> if<00:02:15.670> you're<00:02:15.850> blowing<00:02:16.360> up<00:02:16.450> tools<00:02:16.780> there's

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
hard if you're blowing up tools there's

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.890 
hard if you're blowing up tools there's
a<00:02:17.410> pretty<00:02:17.620> good<00:02:17.800> chance<00:02:18.120> your<00:02:19.120> hammer<00:02:19.390> is<00:02:19.690> too

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
a pretty good chance your hammer is too

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.170 
a pretty good chance your hammer is too
hard

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.640 

so<00:02:26.180> as<00:02:26.390> you<00:02:26.540> work<00:02:26.750> with<00:02:26.780> your<00:02:26.990> hammer<00:02:27.350> and

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
so as you work with your hammer and

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.750 
so as you work with your hammer and
you'll<00:02:28.010> work<00:02:28.220> on<00:02:28.430> your<00:02:28.610> anvil<00:02:29.890> any<00:02:30.890> impression

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
you'll work on your anvil any impression

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.730 
you'll work on your anvil any impression
that's<00:02:31.940> that's<00:02:32.300> been<00:02:32.690> pushed<00:02:33.380> into<00:02:33.620> your

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
that's that's been pushed into your

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.790 
that's that's been pushed into your
hammer<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:35.560> dent<00:02:36.560> or<00:02:36.830> a<00:02:36.950> cut<00:02:37.880> line<00:02:38.180> or<00:02:38.800> anything

on that on that or on this surface here

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.300 
on that on that or on this surface here
as<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:45.230> work<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.710> piece<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.190> material

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
as you work that piece of material

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.200 
as you work that piece of material
through<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.120> that<00:02:48.020> impression<00:02:48.800> there<00:02:49.700> there

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
through that that impression there there

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.540 
through that that impression there there
wherever<00:02:50.480> it<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:50.960> is<00:02:51.200> going<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.890> show<00:02:52.160> up<00:02:52.340> in

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
wherever it is is going to show up in

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.510 
wherever it is is going to show up in
your<00:02:52.760> work<00:02:52.940> in<00:02:53.120> your<00:02:53.300> steel<00:02:53.630> in<00:02:53.870> your<00:02:53.930> work<00:02:54.520> so
