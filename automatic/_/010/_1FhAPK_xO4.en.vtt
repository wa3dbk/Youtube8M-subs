00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
little motor concept top you can't

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.670 
little motor concept top you can't
really<00:03:11.010> see<00:03:11.100> well<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.519> this<00:03:11.610> camera<00:03:12.500> let<00:03:13.500> let's

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
really see well on this camera let let's

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.190 
really see well on this camera let let's
have<00:03:13.830> to<00:03:13.950> dip<00:03:15.950> it's<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:17.100> flop<00:03:17.870> which<00:03:18.870> you<00:03:19.019> can

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
have to dip it's a flop which you can

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.820 
have to dip it's a flop which you can
have<00:03:19.940> timer<00:03:22.070> stopwatch<00:03:23.480> yeah<00:03:24.480> bullocks<00:03:25.350> alarm

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
have timer stopwatch yeah bullocks alarm

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.240 
have timer stopwatch yeah bullocks alarm
clocks<00:03:26.720> but<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.780> have<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.170> top<00:03:28.739> bar<00:03:28.980> there

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
clocks but you have on top bar there

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.979 
clocks but you have on top bar there
that<00:03:29.580> will<00:03:29.700> just<00:03:29.910> say<00:03:30.000> what<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.269> time<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.510> and

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
that will just say what the time is and

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.150 
that will just say what the time is and
then<00:03:31.110> factory<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.130> what<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.060> thought<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:34.890> have

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
then factory and what I thought you have

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.490 
then factory and what I thought you have
the<00:03:35.459> calculator<00:03:35.970> just<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> go<00:03:37.050> basic

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
the calculator just like a go basic

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.370 
the calculator just like a go basic
calculator<00:03:37.980> if<00:03:38.820> you<00:03:38.910> twist<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.360> goes<00:03:40.110> into<00:03:40.320> a

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
calculator if you twist it goes into a

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.020 
calculator if you twist it goes into a
scientific<00:03:40.920> calculator<00:03:42.800> and<00:03:43.800> as<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.670> can<00:03:45.000> see

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
scientific calculator and as you can see

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.699 
scientific calculator and as you can see
there<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:46.040> youtube<00:03:47.480> but<00:03:48.480> cosas<00:03:48.750> safari
