00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.570
 new video this time on word 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.310
 flaw so 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380
 so in fact it's just a small 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.810
 video already to tell you that I 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.660
 resumed ward fight there is of that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.189
 now four or five days since 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.740
 I went on vacation I spent 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.199
 a great holiday I hope that 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.750
 my past a good vacation so you 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.850
 so so good bah here is in fact 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.340
 it was a video to announce that I 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 recruited no I will tell you the 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:45.649
 characteristics was waiting for them 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.649
 amputations period 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:56.460
 so here is so that's the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.010
 presentation of the server I'm going 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.719
 start with that actually 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.940
 so here we have changed spawn since 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.650
 the exact server since world of oil 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.570
 fneser excuse me did a pub shot 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.939
 simply so 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.950
 So here we go, we have tarki ore 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.400
 a brand new ore so that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.930
 manufactures by doing 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.010
 I'll show you this after I 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.070
 will go to the leaning bar I believe that 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.380
 it is there that is manufactured enough 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.840
 finally for example for a pickaxe he 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.500
 must draw a pick 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.820
 in sapphire rugby finally up to 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.710
 left finally and it's me I you 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.579
 will show so the rate because 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.859
 that you know the ca do the same 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.109
 so here's a new spawn I know 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:41.670
 not who created it or anything I 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:41.670
 did not know about that 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.290
 so we 're not that much 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.150
 it's pretty boring for the pvp 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.040
 while you return to this server 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.210
 because they are running ya more loppsi p 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.830
 table that was put for a moment 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.570
 but it was not very very cool so good 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.430
 this is the shock that is being 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.010
 created and finally the presentation wall e 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.030
 shop 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.190
 so here is so I invite you to come 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.330
 on this server me it's on the server 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.710
 which I'm playing right now I have a 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.150
 little bit stop the project of 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.240
 montserrat me I put it aside a game 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.040
 finally I put aside relieved not the envy 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.040
 I lack of means etc 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.840
 I put it aside so I have 40 sign 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.770
 will evolve without singing something after no 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.810
 that's ore ton 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.180
 bow bender excuse me I had 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.920
 deceived not to make a dark and finally 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.150
 for example a sword in dark it takes 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.770
 do it like that so it's hard enough 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.000
 so this is the best ore that is 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.580
 a little faster and than others but 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.940
 good lot late too now he 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.310
 is winnable by voting so I believe I 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.720
 also invite you to vote so like that 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.790
 we do that and for example 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.590
 armed we go there we put the feet here the 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.600
 feet there feet there feet there that 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.740
 give after finally here is when you 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.740
 understand me so here I have a pickaxe 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.760
 in dark that looks like obsidian 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.810
 but hey it's not the same as loppsi 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.610
 so that's it so I'm not going to show you 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.860
 my perso finally for now I'm 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.050
 cooked with rick an infamous old date 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.200
 that one who is nice enough we make 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.670
 small particles csa believed and that's 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.739
 so bah now i'm going to move to the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.280
 recruitment period because I'm 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.810
 than blablater in quotation marks so 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.370
 So here I am, I'll tell you everything 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.870
 so the criteria for getting into 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.800
 the action is already to have more than 13 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.660
 years and I will put you all in the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.730
 comments do not worry about having 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.040
 more traits in the bottom of 13 yrs yes 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.840
 of course 13 years old have a microphone of 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.150
 good quality so I made a little one a 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.209
 little notepad that's why I 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.130
 move over there there to see a microphone of 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.470
 good quality have skype and teamspeak 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.130
 necessarily otherwise it's you 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.920
 can drop 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.690
 to have a grade is already a grade 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.120
 obligatorily and a preference kit 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.980
 So not a step framework grade 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.530
 apprentice is talking about graz warrior 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:47.150
 legendary deity assassin be mature 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.590
 so be able to play on weekdays at least 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.760
 two hours a day and weekend 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.049
 able to play at least five hours per 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.280
 day 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.840
 so after knowing how to write can not 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.790
 make 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.540
 two faults all the evils and not written 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.129
 in mode that will cost lol no where is 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.530
 finally ready rage and I access but not 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.090
 swim like a big pig had left the 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.400
 team speak or do stuff like that to 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.569
 whenever we have given stack 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.129
 of obsidian on arrival low for 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:10.750
 can build an info but after 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.459
 that's if you can not pass very 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.920
 serious to be able to build a big 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:16.840
 iphone over because there i have no the 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.970
 wildlife for the moment so have a man 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.560
 because there is no common stuff in 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.660
 part in the reforms that will be created 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.470
 soon then after bah I'll you 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.180
 let you introduce in the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.490
 comments so I would like to know 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.260
 your age your microphone your voice one has to 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.650
 you see very seduced serious acute very 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.750
 serious 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.820
 your mouse name your keyboard name 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.860
 how many fps are you running which server 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.919
 did you do in which class you 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.300
 are you and if you here you are 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.889
 you can spend for allopass 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.190
 the faction or to buy you kits 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:46.030
 what sport do you do how long 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.470
 how much time do you play at 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.910
 minecraft and how much time you 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.070
 are on launcher plus faction 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.810
 especially so after I would like 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.490
 know your level out of ten at pvp and 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.740
 your level out of 10 to the use of 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.560
 potions your strong point in minecraft 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.820
 for me such is the pvp ago 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.460
 in others, that architecture 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:06.190
 potions the reigns looting in 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.810
 mango tells me all this so after you me 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.599
 also say why you want to return 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.520
 in the faction fr 404 what does 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.260
 you can finally bring back that's if you 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.530
 say I'll bring back the mood 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.680
 Finally, this is not too much that could 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.050
 bring back but good so after that it's 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.120
 no no it's because I mean 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.530
 it's not finally if you put that 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.660
 maybe it's true but it's not 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.030
 very justifying so that would like 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:35.010
 nothing finally ready there is everyone who 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.300
 will put that so that's what's it 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.860
 so after if you can if you play 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.720
 to other games or other consoles 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.479
 so for example me play the xbox 360 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.490
 or the 360 ​​and I play a lot on steam 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:47.260
 on pc so counter strike global 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.660
 offensive right now 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.560
 league of legend also you tell me 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.800
 all this in the comments 

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.180
 so if so which ones do you play so 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.670
 after I let you introduce yourself 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.960
 as I said before and also at 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.340
 passage if play a request for 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.230
 regulation that makes three four lines 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.790
 or that filled with faults I will even take 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:06.370
 not worth reading and answering 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:08.380
 certainly totally nothing and so if the 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.320

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.810
