update<00:02:47.209> a<00:02:47.450> lot<00:02:47.690> of<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:47.840> guys<00:02:47.959> know<00:02:48.230> you<00:02:48.290> were

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
update a lot of you guys know you were

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.470 
update a lot of you guys know you were
able<00:02:48.770> to<00:02:48.890> trade<00:02:49.100> your<00:02:49.250> Santa<00:02:49.580> coins<00:02:49.910> in<00:02:50.090> for<00:02:50.450> a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
able to trade your Santa coins in for a

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.780 
able to trade your Santa coins in for a
chance<00:02:50.840> to<00:02:50.959> win<00:02:51.170> donut<00:02:51.590> or<00:02:51.890> reindeer<00:02:52.190> which

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
chance to win donut or reindeer which

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.690 
chance to win donut or reindeer which
were<00:02:52.940> premium<00:02:53.300> items<00:02:53.660> so<00:02:54.560> I'm<00:02:54.860> guessing<00:02:55.670> that

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
were premium items so I'm guessing that

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.340 
were premium items so I'm guessing that
maybe<00:02:56.000> in<00:02:56.180> the<00:02:56.209> next<00:02:56.540> holiday<00:02:56.720> update<00:02:57.200> you'll

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
maybe in the next holiday update you'll

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.960 
maybe in the next holiday update you'll
be<00:02:57.470> able<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.709> do<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:57.980> because<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.580> kind<00:02:58.910> of

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
be able to do that because it kind of

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.449 
be able to do that because it kind of
alternates<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.650> kind<00:03:00.650> of<00:03:00.680> alternates<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.220> guess

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
alternates it kind of alternates I guess

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.760 
alternates it kind of alternates I guess
so<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.239> see<00:03:02.630> that's<00:03:02.810> another<00:03:02.989> good<00:03:03.350> way<00:03:03.500> to<00:03:03.530> get

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770

so I see that's another good way to get
free<00:03:04.040> donuts<00:03:16.330> another<00:03:17.330> good<00:03:17.570> way<00:03:17.750> is<00:03:18.080> by
