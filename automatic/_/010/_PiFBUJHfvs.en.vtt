00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:07.379
 yes there a dozen wreck difficult ready 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:11.070
 strained 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.349
 head tightened valve adjusted 2 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.190
 hour close the valve cover step 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.350
 checked the nuts turned what you need 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.810
 obvious defects and some such straight 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.340
 related not identified wear on 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:29.310
 Cams, in principle, there is no 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:32.000
 the fists only rubbed exactly on 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.850
 as much as necessary 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.050
 actually polished still fine 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:42.840
 worked all right 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:46.250
 look cover native or not yes native 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.390
 thereâ€™s an icon or two on it 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.460
 automotive electrical equipment 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.350
 this here on the back of long-term construction 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.739
 the case of the Bauman Institute was a factory 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.640
 automotive electrical equipment 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.320
 it is better that we had as they say 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.619
 so the rotor is also normal 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:09.560
 contact on this field is more or less fresh 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.560
 we are now ashamed to see them, I myself 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.729
 too small for just slide on the cams 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:22.040
 You can ask to pull the handle forward 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.770
 just till the soil yes she is very slightly 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:32.150
 than ignition 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:33.680
 pretty trap but happened to remember 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.009
 for a moment in the life of a wonderful 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.070
 car namely the demolition of the disastrous 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:42.530
 Soviet heritage in the form of two 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.300
 kilogram homemade electric 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.950
 harnesses and a half kilograms of non-ferrous metal 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.050
 scientifically secret block giving a lot 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.270
 spark continuity burning 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.050
 probably made according to the drawings of the magazine 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.149
 behind the wheel 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.179
 all this finally gave the opportunity 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.860
 the engine is quietly spinning and now with 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:04.429
 returning a regular contact 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.850
 ignition with distributor p 118 we 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:11.769
 will achieve laid by the manufacturer 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.769
 launchers this ksk technical parameters
