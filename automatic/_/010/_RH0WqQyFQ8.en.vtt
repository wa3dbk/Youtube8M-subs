you might slide around if you're wearing

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.550 
you might slide around if you're wearing
these<00:02:45.090> in<00:02:45.300> like<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.930> something<00:02:46.590> um<00:02:48.350> but<00:02:49.350> yeah

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
these in like I something um but yeah

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.340 
these in like I something um but yeah
generally<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.940> better<00:02:51.450> made<00:02:51.750> than<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.140> thought

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
generally the better made than I thought

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.770 
generally the better made than I thought
they<00:02:52.530> were<00:02:52.590> going<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.769> be<00:02:52.950> very<00:02:53.820> very<00:02:54.239> good<00:02:54.480> do

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
they were going to be very very good do

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.030 
they were going to be very very good do
for<00:02:55.320> the<00:02:56.160> hellraisers<00:02:56.959> I<00:02:57.959> don't<00:02:58.440> know<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.560> can't

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
for the hellraisers I don't know I can't

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.340 
for the hellraisers I don't know I can't
seem<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.670> get<00:02:59.790> these<00:03:00.060> like<00:03:00.900> when<00:03:01.050> you<00:03:01.140> take

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
seem to get these like when you take

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.750 
seem to get these like when you take
pictures<00:03:01.590> of<00:03:01.769> him<00:03:01.980> it's<00:03:02.100> really<00:03:02.190> really<00:03:02.610> hard

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
pictures of him it's really really hard

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.920 
pictures of him it's really really hard
to<00:03:03.000> get<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.569> proper<00:03:03.959> effect<00:03:05.600> like<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.690> think

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
to get the proper effect like I think

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.809 
to get the proper effect like I think
that<00:03:07.200> probably<00:03:07.560> shows<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.069> best<00:03:08.370> like<00:03:08.670> how

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
that probably shows you best like how

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.490 
that probably shows you best like how
many<00:03:09.030> spikes<00:03:09.300> they<00:03:09.569> are<00:03:09.690> and<00:03:09.870> how<00:03:09.959> prominent

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
many spikes they are and how prominent

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.430 
many spikes they are and how prominent
they<00:03:10.620> are<00:03:10.769> and<00:03:11.160> just<00:03:11.720> yeah<00:03:12.720> I've<00:03:13.110> had<00:03:13.230> quite<00:03:13.350> a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
they are and just yeah I've had quite a

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.809 
they are and just yeah I've had quite a
few<00:03:13.560> comments<00:03:13.950> on<00:03:14.010> these<00:03:14.160> just<00:03:14.430> from<00:03:14.610> wearing

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
few comments on these just from wearing

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.800 
few comments on these just from wearing
in<00:03:15.000> one<00:03:15.150> time<00:03:15.390> um<00:03:15.830> as<00:03:16.830> for<00:03:17.160> them<00:03:17.280> Robin<00:03:17.810> have

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
in one time um as for them Robin have

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.199 
in one time um as for them Robin have
robbed<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.440> little<00:03:19.860> bit<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.720> slightly<00:03:21.720> up<00:03:22.470> here

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
robbed a little bit and slightly up here

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.000 
robbed a little bit and slightly up here
but<00:03:24.209> I<00:03:24.239> put<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.480> plaster<00:03:24.900> on<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.380> then<00:03:25.860> they

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
but I put a plaster on and then they

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.440 
but I put a plaster on and then they
didn't<00:03:26.340> cause<00:03:26.489> me<00:03:26.670> any<00:03:26.790> trouble<00:03:26.880> um<00:03:28.430> so<00:03:29.450> yeah

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
didn't cause me any trouble um so yeah

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.810 
didn't cause me any trouble um so yeah
that<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.900> one<00:03:31.170> pair<00:03:31.500> they<00:03:31.950> will<00:03:32.130> link<00:03:32.340> these<00:03:32.549> in

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
that is one pair they will link these in

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.259 
that is one pair they will link these in
the<00:03:33.000> downbar<00:03:34.310> thing<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.820> can<00:03:35.850> have<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.090> look

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
the downbar thing so you can have a look

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.539 
the downbar thing so you can have a look
at<00:03:36.420> him<00:03:36.769> then<00:03:37.769> we<00:03:37.829> have<00:03:38.209> these<00:03:39.209> ones<00:03:39.630> i<00:03:40.549> haven't

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
at him then we have these ones i haven't

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.060 
at him then we have these ones i haven't
worn<00:03:41.820> these<00:03:42.000> out<00:03:42.299> yet<00:03:42.600> but<00:03:42.769> I've<00:03:43.769> on<00:03:43.920> them

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
worn these out yet but I've on them

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:46.539 
worn these out yet but I've on them
around<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.459> house<00:03:44.720> they<00:03:45.720> are<00:03:45.840> these<00:03:46.049> ones

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
around the house they are these ones

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.240 
around the house they are these ones
I've<00:03:47.549> shown<00:03:47.730> these<00:03:47.910> in<00:03:48.060> another<00:03:48.359> video<00:03:49.250> these

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
I've shown these in another video these

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.530 
I've shown these in another video these
are<00:03:50.579> I<00:03:51.030> know<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.570> um<00:03:52.019> own<00:03:52.859> if<00:03:53.100> unif<00:03:53.910> moon<00:03:54.420> if

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
are I know that um own if unif moon if

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.580 
are I know that um own if unif moon if
whatever<00:03:54.989> they're<00:03:55.230> called<00:03:55.410> actually<00:03:56.370> do<00:03:56.609> this

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
whatever they're called actually do this

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.330 
whatever they're called actually do this
style<00:03:58.850> this<00:03:59.850> pattern<00:04:00.709> yeah<00:04:01.709> if<00:04:01.859> you<00:04:01.980> want<00:04:02.160> in

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
style this pattern yeah if you want in

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.090 
style this pattern yeah if you want in
something<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.180> know<00:04:03.390> is<00:04:03.739> like<00:04:04.739> pretty

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
something that you know is like pretty

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.039 
something that you know is like pretty
much<00:04:05.280> identical<00:04:05.489> for<00:04:06.420> a<00:04:06.450> fraction<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.930> the

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
much identical for a fraction of the

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.259 
much identical for a fraction of the
cost<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.620> these<00:04:08.549> probably<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:09.150> good<00:04:09.840> bet<00:04:11.269> again

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
cost and these probably a good bet again

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.170 
cost and these probably a good bet again
these<00:04:12.660> ones<00:04:12.900> are<00:04:13.140> sort<00:04:13.380> of<00:04:13.470> like<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:14.150> sort<00:04:15.150> of

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
these ones are sort of like the sort of

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.270 
these ones are sort of like the sort of
horsehair<00:04:15.720> effect<00:04:16.169> they're<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:16.979> ones<00:04:17.130> are

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
horsehair effect they're the ones are

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.979 
horsehair effect they're the ones are
like<00:04:17.359> PVC<00:04:18.650> um<00:04:19.820> quite<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:21.060> lot<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.390> emotion<00:04:21.840> in

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
like PVC um quite a lot of emotion in

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.200 
like PVC um quite a lot of emotion in
them<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:22.770> again<00:04:23.250> they've<00:04:23.520> got<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.789> little

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
them and again they've got the little

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.740 
them and again they've got the little
heel<00:04:24.510> on<00:04:24.690> them

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
heel on them

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.710 
heel on them
and<00:04:25.920> yeah<00:04:26.920> i'm<00:04:27.310> gonna<00:04:27.520> show<00:04:28.090> you<00:04:28.120> what<00:04:28.570> they

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
and yeah i'm gonna show you what they

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.170 
and yeah i'm gonna show you what they
look<00:04:28.750> like<00:04:28.930> on<00:04:29.260> so<00:04:29.590> you<00:04:29.680> can<00:04:29.740> decide<00:04:30.640> if<00:04:31.090> you
