00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.099
 and hello everyone with you save the phoenix 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.110
 but also the most spark and here I am back 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:13.710
 I want to note that I have not shot for a long time 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.609
 all sorts of videos and here on recently and in 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.600
 the internet came across a very interesting 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:24.150
 collection of mods minecraft 1 5 2 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.099
 in which, well, in general, all run on 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:33.750
 The main functions of this assembly pile 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:42.350
 added new weapons and armor here 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:45.170
 very many many weapons here are grenades and 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.350
 additional mystical all sorts 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:55.890
 prikolchiki type here such a hammer 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:58.489
 here and deed genetic from the river there foot 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:10.439
 so you can throw objects and 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:14.659
 kill various mobs so added 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:21.479
 new creatures because it is an assembly 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:25.799
 chorus mod zombies and weapons like this example 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.909
 I took here all sorts of iron crab 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.750
 here are people who are taught or crab here 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.600
 by the way 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:38.369
 hold demonstrate so take here 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.530
 so we can do it 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.990
 leads now all sorts of nasty 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:57.990
 mobs 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 what else to say and now 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.359
 probably everyone knows the game alien vs 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:07.569
 predator where people need to fight 

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:10.869
 aliens here in this fashion there 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:11.500
 all that is in this game, that is 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.299
 corsa 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.760
 hammer armor from there and naturally 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:22.450
 monsters 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:26.650
 I can even show these monsters so 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:33.780
 we and those who do it well, so there are 5 Th 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.780
 do and ah-pad not 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.959
 but still looks like some bard 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:58.860
 Now now, but here's what's funny 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.930
 in this more so this is sound 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:07.980
 accompanying these little ones here 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:11.910
 the monsters are very funny further in the same 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.829
 assembly of crack and by the way can 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.099
 be here 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:19.620
 fotoryukzaki is like wearing everything between 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.750
 a chest then choose one backpack 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:28.829
 even though I think that's just below the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:33.840
 such items are closed 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:38.819
 time with yourself so here just the same and 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:42.000
 bunker if you want to download this map from 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.150

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:52.639
