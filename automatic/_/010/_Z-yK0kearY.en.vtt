issues<00:00:43.649> or<00:00:44.280> hiccups<00:00:44.489> while<00:00:44.879> navigating<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
issues or hiccups while navigating the

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.010 
issues or hiccups while navigating the
menus<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> again<00:00:48.239> this<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:48.809> neat<00:00:48.989> I

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
menus so again this is this is neat I

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.529 
menus so again this is this is neat I
mean<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.350> around<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.920> PSP<00:00:50.489> PS<00:00:51.270> go
