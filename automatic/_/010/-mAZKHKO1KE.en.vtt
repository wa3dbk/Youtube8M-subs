00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.730
 formula to gain muscle mass 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.660
 healthy muscle 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.469
 Here are some tips to gain muscle mass from a 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.739
 relatively easy way 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:14.769
 keep in mind that the main key of all this 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.029
 will be the constant and that this is a long-term plan do not wait 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:21.699
 gains from one week to the next 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.759
 The first thing to keep in mind when it comes to mass increase 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:30.249
 Moscow has a balance in the daily intake of nutrients 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:34.800
 It is also important to know that there is not a single nutrient that is 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.120
 completely responsible for a biological process without the participation of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.970
 other substances 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.520
 the three midwives teeth 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.460
 the three macro nutrients that give us food are proteins 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.030
 carbohydrates and fats 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.620
 all of them are necessary in the diet since they provide the calories for the 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.690
 physical and metabolic activities 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.460
 one calories a unit of heat that the body converts into energy from 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.860
 proteins we get 4 calories per gram are also four calories 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.460
 calories we get from each gram of carbohydrates and 9 calories per each 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.260
 gram of fat 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.250
 the diet for volume 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.040
 the diet for muscle volume should be high in calories to allow for new 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.150
 acquisition of tissue but not so high because the body could not 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.150
 seize and store them as body fat 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.960
 as a general idea it is considered a balanced diet is composed of a 55 a 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.460
 60 percent carbohydrate 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.530
 25 to 30% protein and 10 to 15 percent fat 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.740
 the proportion between these nutrients depends on the metabolism of each 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.300
 individual 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.620
 in terms of calories you should try to get 60 calories per kilo 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.570
 of body weight in some cases this figure can rise to 70 or 80 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.780
 depending on the metabolism of each 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.280
 as an example a man of 70 kilos of body weight should get 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.020
 daily 4 thousand 200 calories 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.160
 of those 2520 calories should be carbohydrates that translated to grams 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.250
 they are 630 grams of carbohydrates or 260 calories of protein that translated into 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.130
 grams are 315 grams of protein and 420 calories of fat that translated into 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.189
 grams a 46 grams of fat 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:33.699
 in average terms you have to divide all this into five or six meals throughout 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:34.919
 all day 

00:02:34.919 --> 00:02:40.169
 maybe you're thinking that to get 4 thousand 200 calories you have to eat a lot 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:44.519
 and you're right you'll also think that it's not very practical if you make a 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.659
 normal work or school day 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.909
 consume five or six meals 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.809
 you are also right 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:54.099
 but this is when the accessories come into action 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.579
 the supplements are a great help to raise the protein coefficient 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.159
 and calories
