00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:06.270
 Good day my ladies and gentlemen today 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.880
 I would like to discuss these with you 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.389
 very important topic and entertained 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.860
 although over the wide position on the cello 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.299
 You've heard that before 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.210
 it grabbed different violins 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.550
 There are kinds of cello and there are just 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.310
 two handles a close location and one 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.740
 more camps around the gaps 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.289
 the cello so the distances of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.900
 individual semitones to each other yes 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.380
 it's pretty far apart 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.770
 not so easy a long way 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.230
 So be a very typical in the first 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.270
 and second finger to accomplish so 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.649
 puzzled years have been times we have 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.969
 always said yes it is now very 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.239
 you have a big hand, too 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.370
 playing the cello is a thing that 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.600
 Can you make a statement today? 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.699
 of course also can sign 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.410
 Of course you can handle a big hand 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.980
 playing cello is not that easy 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.840
 question but it is correct 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.219
 just for a normal player 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.920
 possible and if you look like 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.210
 Many people today play cello then 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.439
 are not they really just those 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.150
 extremely big hands 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.180
 no, there is really a way and that 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.140
 I want to show you today if you can 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.320
 First of all, I explain them once 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.110
 the close and the further position the close 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.840
 lay on the cello means that you are between 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.290
 the fingers each a half tone 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.180
 So you have the distance 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.180
 empty page to grab a really great 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:42.380
 so four fingers at equal intervals 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.540
 but they can not do that 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.340
 all because they tap between a 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.370
 empty page and have the next 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.350
 there is something missing and this gap 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.000
 we close with the so-called wide 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.240
 this is about showing now 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.630
 I give them that once that's better 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.150
 see 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.790
 it's about being the first one now 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.580
 finger finds it pushing backwards 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.550
 and now a half-tone distance to the 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.899
 build empty page 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.399
 that brings with it the distance 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.560
 between first and second finger now 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.630
 a great one and the other two 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.710
 fingers stay on their same 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.050
 stand 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.950
 that's what you call the long long me 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.950
 I want you to do that once 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.090
 also play that means these three fingers 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.910
 the second the third of the quarter 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.440
 stay in your place just stand up 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.730
 the first has changed its position 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.930
 to see some things 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.840
 that's what they are 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.090
 8 cm could be said then between the 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.350
 first and second finger if you can 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.170
 that can accomplish 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.630
 This is done first of all as follows 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:55.130
 please ask the hand please 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.380
 so that your fingers are not in the right 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.620
 angle to the side but that they are 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.860
 stand vertically in the room or better 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.780
 said perpendicular or you call that yes 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.570
 that is basically taken 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.630
 Orders are looking like 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.850
 Each finger would be one step higher 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.020
 stand as the next sensi that way 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.820
 can they, too, so a small 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.739
 imagine stairs like the sloping 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.330
 fingerboard the fourth is at its lowest 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.950
 this position results from the fact that 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.660
 they do with hand 1 that they 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:31.220
 namely the hand in the very easy 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:33.310
 turn the direction they would take 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:38.750
 to look at the clock, for example 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.850
 So this is the place you have 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.900
 now the possibility of the 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:47.390
 distances between the fingers 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.820
 to control because they are now 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.940
 on the lifting movement of the fingers for the 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.040
 use distances 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.560
 can do that and now I'll take 1 now 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.570
 I bend my elbow slightly forward 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.040
 and stretch my first finger outside 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.980
 Then I come to my position 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.160
 that is a situation that something 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.540
 getting used to is admittedly 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.760
 The movement is still in Berlin 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.430
 I easily follow the elbow 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.769
 in front and stick my finger out of the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.380
 remaining fingers stay in their place 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.640
 and especially the thumb touches 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.550
 please do not worry 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.980
 that must be the position under the second 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.240
 keep finger 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.610
 we can try it with you 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.230
 hand this position of this 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.520
 keep fingering gaps while doing so 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.990
 bringing the thumb back to it 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.730
 you notice there is a tension in the 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:41.040
 which is simply bigger than if that 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.080
 It's here that's the reason 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.840
 why please in this broad location 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.020
 only the finger and not the 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.670
 thumb goes somewhere else thumb 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.250
 is under the second finger so 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.620
 again the movement of the elbows goes 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:59.010
 forward and at the same time I stretch 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.970
 my first finger and so if 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.160
 they exercise that 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.510
 you too will be with your normal hand 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.230
 I myself do not have that right now either 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:09.270
 the biggest handcuffs 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.680
 you'll be able to do away with that 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.680
 can really master 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:20.070
 to repeat it again 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:24.100
 the fingers so that the fingers 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:27.670
 practically always in stages one above the other 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:32.200
 this is due to the fact that they are 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:34.810
 turn the hand inwards as if they were 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.430
 look at the clock now stand the 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.830
 fingers automatically on the fingerboard 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.680
 the next move is you go 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.930
 with the elbow slightly forward and 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.720
 the finger extends and now 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:48.340
 the index finger is the first 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.960
 finger is now on the side 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.690
 the fact that there is no longer with the 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.280
 front group on the side like that 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.950
 Fire was rather rather lies on 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.900
 on the side and thereby you can 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.940
 this great distance to the first and 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.310
 really reach the second finger 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.310
 what else is seriously difficult 

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:13.100
 and fortunately it is so 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.290
 Chernoff there are these two had attacked 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:17.630
 and now if you hand on 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:19.130
 move different positions and 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.710
 always make these handle types 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.270
 then they can lay everything down 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:25.790
 pick up what you need there 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.190
 just these two positions and the 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.040
 you have to train the angels first 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.050
 ag and the wide situation and thank you 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.150
 I'm up for watching today 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.390
 again , all culture is first 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.390
 once
