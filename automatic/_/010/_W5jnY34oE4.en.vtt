 inverter the serum uses a screen to 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.910
 retain the grains 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.130
 they can be used for 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:23.560
 cheese making 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.380
 after all have excess serum 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.540
 been removed put a desolator through 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:36.790
 over a colander and a college 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:39.309
 curd confirm the curd twisting 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:47.650
 the top of the screen and start 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:49.930
 tighten the dough continue to tighten until the 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.960
 elimination of excess contained crying 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.960
 in the square and then place the dough in the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.570
 shape and continue to tighten until the 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.230
 that the curd be very dry and not 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:04.809
 is leaking serum 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:11.320
 open the desolator and break the dough with the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:13.780
 fingertips with whole dough 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:17.229
 add square plus broken 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.360
 filling the shape again tighten with the 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.360
 to continue to eliminate serum 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.510
 the desolator must be twisted again 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:35.049
 on the top to assist the 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:37.620
 continue to tighten the 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.770
 until no more whey is 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.600
 [Music] 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.880
 now the pain defender can be removed 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.819
 to accommodate only the mass in the form 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.429
 of the cheese that already accepts being handled 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.170
 without breaking 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.229
 repeat the operation with the rest of the 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.229
 pasta 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:06.520
 after all the cheeses informed 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:09.650
 they should be washed with water and the 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:19.220
 cheeses and wash on the other side 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:19.220
 [Music] 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.790
 for this operation must be used 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.320
 treated water but with serum removed for 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.959
 do not change the taste 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.180
 [Music] 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.930
 then must be spread thick salt 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.030
 for human consumption over and above what 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.639
 it is necessary to put a very 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.280
 thick but it should cover the entire 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:57.720
 cheese surface 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:03:00.280
 [Music] 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.230
 keep salt on this side of the cheese for 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.280
 a six-hour period for him to 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.130
 penetrate well 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.920
 [Music] 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.300
 the passing of time in the early evening 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.440
 remove the salt 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.440
 it can be reused 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.390
 turn the cheese and spread the other balance 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.910
 as the layer of the same thickness as the 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.710
 previously placed 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.710
 [Music] 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.150
 now place the bucket to collect the 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.060
 evening 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.910
 in this period the cheese releases the cry 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.400
 slowly dripping in the bucket 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.560
 this clear serum that is released during 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.010
 night is best suited to be 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.140
 used in the manufacture of cheese 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.670
 keep the cheese salting and collecting the 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.670
 for a period of 12 hours
