00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.080
 when I go to the cage it 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.840
 looking around enjoying 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.939
 moment this is the reason I'm so 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.790
 worked hard this moment by which 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:23.880
 always dreamed and this is what i love 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.829
 do be inside the cell hear 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.099
 as the crowd roars emotional 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.750
 arousal suggestive arena is amazing 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.300
 if you enter this arena and you donâ€™t 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.670
 woke up then you have a problem so 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.829
 at the time of the battle I am ready to work and that 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.390
 what this great show is her all 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.570
 you can't afford to fool 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.410
 the fool was the moment I was hit 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.390
 leg with all his might 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.989
 my foot I just destroyed 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.410
 felt cruz in it and so god that 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.010
 it was me I would think so to myself 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.460
 moving around thinking hockey okay i 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.110
 I can move let's continue to work 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.900
 my leg was in a kirov state after 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.770
 I sing the fight but there was a moment where this ok ok well 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.380
 in order 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.570
 let's work my knee okay i 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.420
 I can stand on my feet and I can not drive 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.420
 well enough but I have a chance more than that 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.960
 part of this sport so you get used 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.300
 to her and blocking and keep going 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.980
 forward actually you focus on 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.690
 the task on what you 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.610
 need to do to get out of this 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.540
 provisions whether control of the hand or 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:39.720
 stand up or get out 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.940

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.050

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.880

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.280
 while trying to get to him 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.010

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.510

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.200
 everywhere i just have faith in myself 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.510
 that I have all the necessary tools 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.120

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.830
 his problems if he is at a distance 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.880
 he has a chance because i need 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.860
