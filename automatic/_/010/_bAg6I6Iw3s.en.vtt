00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.999 

playing<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.659> sloppy<00:01:39.960> blacks<00:01:40.289> black

playing it in sloppy blacks black

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.120 
playing it in sloppy blacks black
sabbath's<00:01:41.430> style<00:01:42.259> all<00:01:43.259> right<00:01:43.289> so<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.979> first

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
sabbath's style all right so the first

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.709 
sabbath's style all right so the first
thing<00:01:44.280> is<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> power<00:01:44.729> chord<00:01:45.060> right<00:01:45.240> here<00:01:45.299> at<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
thing is a power chord right here at the

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:51.639 
thing is a power chord right here at the
e<00:01:45.750> which<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.469> seventh<00:01:46.799> fret<00:01:47.070> here<00:01:49.640> okay

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
e which is the seventh fret here okay

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:58.490 
e which is the seventh fret here okay
and<00:01:56.119> if<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.270> listen<00:01:57.539> to<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.720> recording<00:01:58.289> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
and if you listen to the recording the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.789 
and if you listen to the recording the
very<00:01:59.460> first<00:01:59.789> time<00:02:00.030> he<00:02:00.299> attempts<00:02:01.110> this<00:02:01.289> lick<00:02:01.619> he

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
very first time he attempts this lick he

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.149 
very first time he attempts this lick he
actually<00:02:02.189> messes<00:02:02.579> up<00:02:02.789> but<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.179> sounds<00:02:03.479> fine

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
actually messes up but it sounds fine

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.559 
actually messes up but it sounds fine
because<00:02:05.159> he<00:02:05.640> doesn't<00:02:05.789> do<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.030> anyplace<00:02:06.240> else

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:06.569 
because he doesn't do it anyplace else

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.180 
because he doesn't do it anyplace else
in<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.840> song<00:02:07.049> so<00:02:07.200> I'm<00:02:07.259> assuming<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.799> it's

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
in the song so I'm assuming that it's

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.190 
in the song so I'm assuming that it's
not<00:02:08.489> it's<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.149> intentional<00:02:09.750> but<00:02:09.780> they<00:02:09.989> set

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
not it's not intentional but they set

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.410 
not it's not intentional but they set
out<00:02:10.229> just<00:02:10.500> keep<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.769> sounds<00:02:11.009> great

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
out just keep it sounds great

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.069 
out just keep it sounds great
my<00:02:12.420> theory<00:02:13.099> so<00:02:14.099> instead<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.700> playing<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.180> lick

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.210 

like<00:02:19.079> he<00:02:19.170> does<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.440> rest<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.739> this<00:02:19.799> song<00:02:20.040> he

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
like he does the rest of this song he

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.370 
like he does the rest of this song he
goes<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:24.239> very<00:02:24.480> first<00:02:24.750> one<00:02:24.930> if<00:02:25.019> you<00:02:25.079> listen<00:02:25.349> to

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
goes the very first one if you listen to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.230 
goes the very first one if you listen to
it<00:02:25.470> he<00:02:25.560> goes

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.160 

of<00:02:28.900> us

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.350
