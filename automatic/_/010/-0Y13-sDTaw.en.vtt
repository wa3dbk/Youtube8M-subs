00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.300
 [Music] 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.170
 [Applause] 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:38.829
 [Applause] 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:57.000
 [Applause] 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.849
 [Applause] 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.799
 because 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.180
 [Applause] 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.180
 the public 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.600
 [Applause] 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.300
 Look who's talking about the issue too. 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:20.170
 of this tic victory itself. 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.940
 while if and when you lose it is not who 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.490
 go to the game itself 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.920
 the final detail and and when you see 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.319
 same way without knowing what's coming and maybe 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.050
 because it loses the case and is irritated with 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.420
 the defenses is not the only emotional situation 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.530
 it is important the need for the result 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.720
 club the pressure that ends up playing and 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.390
 to absorb repression and transform 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.700
 in a good football and the joy of the Lord 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.519
 you could say that international is the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.070
 intention is for that race to return to 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.780
 aunt giving catholic 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.500
 field goalkeeper 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:03:01.269
 opponent at 45 the second time 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.700
 Inter recovered this canard had two 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.900
 games that is what their problem 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.630
 involving an extremely 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.540
 intense that was not the face of our team 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:14.019
 the game against the cruise and it was this game 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.150
 against the Basque and with the copies 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.709
 aware that the group did not have 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.709
 awareness 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.320
 he had the directive command he had 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.850
 technical name he had in consciousness 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:30.700
 professional who could not be that 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:32.890
 ball and how to avoid it also said it is not 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.040
 structuring you are growing it 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.569
 will too 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.849
 there will have to react upon 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.340
 Criciuma situations won the rudder that 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:43.010
 remembers here a few weeks ago that 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.959
 emblematic victory over sao paulo 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.549
 when we believed that the 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.379
 would be to give a sequence of 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:50.030
 important in Brazil but there was 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:52.220
 turbulence on the way today 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.230
 another emblematic victory teachers of 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.439
 need to know why the inter- 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.730
 He won because Inter won the media 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:00.409
 have a composition of their own 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.370
 midfield with two articulators two 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.639
 flyers 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.319
 commanding the central part of the lawn 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.389
 the alternatives that had an opponent and 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.510
 put three attackers after the game 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:13.909
 came prepared and filmed there to 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.919
 make a composition of 24 from 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.329
 of this expansion 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.780
 knew in some way that the opponent 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.810
 go look for me 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.590
 the game but volume and his wife to 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.560
 to expose 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.630
 Because of its characteristic, I do not 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.669
 interval started by pressing the thigh 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.280
 because he lives with defeat as 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.470
 we had it just knocking and 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.150
 emotional but is well structured 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.610
 vehicles in the team 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.960
 I do not want to repeat but it's fact we 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.240
 we must farm players 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.490
 important factors that have made the 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.180
 crisis in the transition from the 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.730
 attack 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:52.630
 this has given a tactical imbalance of 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:54.490
 team and she got away with the 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.750
 which should compose their recycling have 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.730
 inspired to absorb it or work 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.380
 against arbitration not because they 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.110
 they wanted but because they reported 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.730
 which are human beings but so war 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.860
 as one's own way says 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.169
 clear that it was even asking for a 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.800
 and I considered that in the 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.020
 the attention of people from 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.479
 immelt was even hers who now turned 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.280
 and signaled today that the building had 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.630
 given a router the lady will expel 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.530
 and that he told me that he had warned 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.660
 which has not been very much 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.460
 prejudiced by arbitration 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:32.470
 I remember the game against the saints here. 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.720
 it did not justify that all of you 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.060
 said that the bid was irregular and we 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.250
 we will stay with them and I will 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.140
 athletes who are there but we had the 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.320
 game against the Basque was 1 to 0 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.990
 a clear penalty bid new 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:50.740
 company but there comes a point where 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:53.530
 comes to the last was the goal 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.300
 goalkeeper was real and will goes with 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.070
 need to build just to make 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.070
 a basic is complicated
