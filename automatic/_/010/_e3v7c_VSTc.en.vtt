00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
-When you use your imagination for something you love,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.500
you just can't have limits

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.000
So our imagination keeps lingering.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.000
I would like to grow old together and go as far as we can,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
besides the easiest things become difficult

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and sometimes the most difficult things
become very very simple.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
- The collaboration with Margaritis Drift Team

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.000
started in 2010 at a track day including Italian cars

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500
that I think the brand was Afisti,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and because it was by chance

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.000
that we shared the same passion for italian cars

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.000
and I saw what he can do on the track it was the reason

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.000
to say that with this man and this team

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.000
I really want to work with.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.000
Working on this team together with

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.000
these guys is the best thing that could happend

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.000
because they love what they do.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.000
-There were quiet enough intense moments

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.000
either moments of happiness or sadness,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.000
and more importantly what we experience

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.000
with Margaritis generally intensed.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.000
- There is one memory though

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.000
that is stronger than the others,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.000
when the Team at Serres Track

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.000
won the 1st place at the tournament

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.000
called "King of Europe",

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that is when the team

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.000
had its moments of greatness

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.000
and much hapiness!

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.000
I think it's the best thing

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.000
for a company like Drift Innovation to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.000
have such a good advertisment like that.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.000
- I met Margaritis one night when he had

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.000
just bought his first brand new Alfa romeo 75

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.000
and he was trying to make it start,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.000
thus I helped him. After that

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.000
we went for a ride and he told me

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.000
his thoughts about participating in

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.000
a local tournament. We went to the tournament

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.000
and the people crowd was shouting two things:

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.000
"get the Alfa romeo out of the track"

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.000
"who is driving the Alfa Romeo?"

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.000
After his accomplisments he participated

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.000
in more tournaments and started to be

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.000
more and more experienced with

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
what his car is able to do.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.500

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.000
Thus,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.000
Me, Lazaros and Margaritis started this Team.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.000
Here you can see a 3lt V6 engine

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.000
with 24 valves from an Alfa romeo 164

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.000
and we installed a bi-turbo,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.000
we used an Link Engine managment ECU.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.000
All the Drift-cars are dealing

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.000
with the same problems

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.000
cooling,inflexibility and weight,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.000
thus we transfered the cooler at the back

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.000
of the car so the front part

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.000
can have the ability to cool more easily

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.000
the three important parts such as

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.000
the intercooler,oil cooler, steering cooler.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.000
When the Water cooler,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.000
the oil cooler,the intercooler

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.000
and the steering cooler was all

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.000
in the same part of the car

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.000
the temperature was rising dramatically!

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.000
-Margariti, tell us

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.000
-Come all to pull out the car

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.000
I will get back again.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.500
The accident made us

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.500
concern more about safety issues

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.500
thus we rebuilt the car from the ground zero.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.500
We adjusted again the frame

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.500
according to our needs

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.500
concerning weight loss and safety.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.500
We built a new reinforced roll cage

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.500
that has more than 6 point-bolt

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.500
with more X bindings,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.500
also we worked more

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.500
on the matter of fire safety

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.500
concerning the integrity of the car

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.000
and myself as well.
