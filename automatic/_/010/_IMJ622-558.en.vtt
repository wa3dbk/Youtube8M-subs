two different colors as you can see the
key<00:01:20.640> changes<00:01:21.770> and<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.369> then<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:23.640> can

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
key changes and you can then you can

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.350 
key changes and you can then you can
also<00:01:23.850> set<00:01:24.180> three<00:01:24.450> regions<00:01:24.950> should<00:01:26.360> pretty

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
also set three regions should pretty

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120 
also set three regions should pretty
much<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.720> use<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.290> I<00:01:28.320> use<00:01:28.560> most<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> time

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
much I use what I use most of the time

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.620 
much I use what I use most of the time
just<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:29.610> normal<00:01:29.909> mode<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.270> got<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.509> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.380 
just go normal mode and you got you to
three<00:01:30.840> different<00:01:30.990> regions<00:01:31.439> then<00:01:32.180> yeah<00:01:33.180> that's

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
three different regions then yeah that's

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.870 
three different regions then yeah that's
pretty<00:01:34.229> much<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.860> mean<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> keyboard<00:01:35.549> if<00:01:35.729> we

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
pretty much it I mean a keyboard if we

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.550 
pretty much it I mean a keyboard if we
come<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.600> closer<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.110> have<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> look<00:01:37.439> at<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
come in closer and have a look at the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.980 
come in closer and have a look at the
keyboard<00:01:37.740> itself<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.180> keys<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.810> see

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
keyboard itself the keys as you can see

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.630 
keyboard itself the keys as you can see
are<00:01:40.079> quite<00:01:40.290> nice<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.310> like<00:01:41.460> them
