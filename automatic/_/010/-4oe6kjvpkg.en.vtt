area again just demonstrating that even
with<00:02:57.600> 18-inch<00:02:58.049> barrel<00:02:58.170> cylinder<00:02:58.980> choke<00:02:59.630> you

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
with 18-inch barrel cylinder choke you

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.210 
with 18-inch barrel cylinder choke you
know<00:03:00.690> you're<00:03:00.930> essentially<00:03:01.709> shooting<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.069> rifle

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
know you're essentially shooting a rifle

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.870 
know you're essentially shooting a rifle
when<00:03:02.549> you're<00:03:02.700> talking<00:03:03.090> 10<00:03:03.269> 15<00:03:03.750> feet<00:03:03.959> okay

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
when you're talking 10 15 feet okay

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.640 
when you're talking 10 15 feet okay
hopefully<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.180> kind<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.560> demonstrates<00:03:07.560> a

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
hopefully that kind of demonstrates a

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.460 
hopefully that kind of demonstrates a
little<00:03:07.859> more<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.310> little<00:03:08.579> bit<00:03:08.700> more<00:03:08.970> thoroughly

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
little more a little bit more thoroughly

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.990 
little more a little bit more thoroughly
what<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.500> shotgun<00:03:10.799> will<00:03:11.130> do<00:03:11.280> because<00:03:11.639> we've<00:03:11.819> got

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
what a shotgun will do because we've got

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.670 
what a shotgun will do because we've got
the<00:03:12.269> different<00:03:12.690> size<00:03:12.989> shot<00:03:13.319> here<00:03:13.590> we

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
the different size shot here we

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.530 
the different size shot here we
demonstrated<00:03:14.310> different<00:03:14.850> barrel<00:03:15.209> lengths

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
demonstrated different barrel lengths

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.960 
demonstrated different barrel lengths
and<00:03:15.780> probably<00:03:16.200> even<00:03:16.260> different<00:03:16.620> chokes<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.639> I

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
and probably even different chokes so I

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.819 
and probably even different chokes so I
don't<00:03:18.930> know<00:03:19.049> if<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.260> could<00:03:19.410> really<00:03:19.560> have<00:03:19.799> a

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
don't know if you could really have a

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.660 
don't know if you could really have a
shotgun<00:03:20.190> that's<00:03:21.180> not<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.480> class<00:03:21.810> 3<00:03:22.670> firearm

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
shotgun that's not a class 3 firearm

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.300 
shotgun that's not a class 3 firearm
that<00:03:24.239> would<00:03:24.389> have<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.569> more<00:03:24.840> open<00:03:25.109> choke<00:03:25.859> you

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
that would have a more open choke you

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.069 
that would have a more open choke you
know<00:03:26.430> then<00:03:26.700> what<00:03:27.180> I'm<00:03:27.299> carrying<00:03:27.660> right<00:03:27.690> here

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
know then what I'm carrying right here

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:30.620 
know then what I'm carrying right here
in<00:03:28.319> a<00:03:28.440> in<00:03:28.920> 18<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.639> I<00:03:29.880> think<00:03:30.060> about<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.269> quarter

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
in a in 18 and I think about a quarter

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.360 
in a in 18 and I think about a quarter
inch<00:03:30.660> barrel<00:03:31.049> and

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
inch barrel and

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.020 
inch barrel and
those<00:03:32.580> businesses<00:03:33.090> that's<00:03:33.629> what<00:03:33.930> it<00:03:34.080> does<00:03:34.590> so

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
those businesses that's what it does so

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.330 
those businesses that's what it does so
talk<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.150> y'all<00:03:36.300> later
