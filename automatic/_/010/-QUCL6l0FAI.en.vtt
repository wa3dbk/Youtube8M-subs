00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.900
 I'll show you right before it starts 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.669
 the work goes first checked the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.500
 state of advice name and you play 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:26.689
 look at the neighboring ones too 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.669
 Suspension parts such as the bearing or wear 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:36.829
 can and then you screwed the wheel 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:38.690
 From the moment of removal of the fire it is quite 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.010
 important to make sure that the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.590
 brake hose not kinked or 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.510
 it is twisted with a tool eg 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.520
 one of Switzerland to a stepped it 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.590
 is bent may be a solution 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.120
 He is hanged on the suspension error 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.250
 the calipers with hose over it 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.149
 laid the removal of the fire is 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.149
 then rather a children's game 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.400
 then the joint of the 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:08.729
 querdenkers solved do not pay attention 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.350
 to widen the slit of the Achschenschenkel 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.700
 if we are there for the classic stocks 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.240
 in every well-stocked one 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.280
 Hobby workshop is to be found in the expansion 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.009
 the drive shaft can be problematic 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.600
 These are now glued to 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.080
 So he does not come a special tool 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.600
 around 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.030
 The drive shaft is thus easy 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.009
 the wheel hub pressed this special 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.569
 you can deduct yourself in all abo 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.729
 Borrow regional broadcasts 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.450
 The removal of the drive shaft makes it so 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.450
 easily possible 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.869
 Attention, you have to do it again 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.520
 be careful so that you have the 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.500
 electrical connection from wheel turned 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.030
 sensor not damaged but then 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.950
 you need now on the special stream 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.079
 solve with the right special tools 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.079
 and you can remove unit from stock 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.960
 have advised against new 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.240
 fixing screws staupe 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.750
 drive shafts nut and fuses 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.370
 sprint delivered when installing the new 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.920
 Radler unit is now in 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.940
 reverse order 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.050
 But do not forget the heat shield 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.330
 to assemble again 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.820
 the new screws will be in three 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.760
 stepped tightened until 90 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.680
 newtonmeter then with 30 degrees one last 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.680
 screwed on at 15 degrees 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.290
 Now you are plugged in the electric one 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.610
 connect and set the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.610
 drive shafts re - enrolls 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.060
 The next step is the installation of the 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.130
 handlebars in the evening fits the dust 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.120
 cuff the tradings on this 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.310
 not damaged 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.450
 the cross bolt will be 100 newton meters 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.550
 tightened 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.630
 when inserting the intervertebral disc are then 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.630
 70 meters sufficient 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.420
 By the way, it's important, of course 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.520
 also that the dismantled parts before the 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.840
 to be cleaned with it 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.110
 you contribute significantly to the preservation of 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.030
 components bray during installation of the 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.380
 caliper pulls the embedded 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.460
 guide bolt with eight and twenty 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.460
 newton meter stuck 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.570
 you will gladly forget the dust 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.820
 to replace the protective caps 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.990
 so remember then is the 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.990
 Old feather pushed on 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.680
 at the final assembly, the wheel is first 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.510
 put back on the wheel bolts 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.510
 110 newton meters are tightened 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:21.730
 Last built is the included new one 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.740
 akw's mother's on the drive shaft 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.570
 screwed is also here it comes 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.990
 back to the right torque 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.300
 then release 120 newton meters and then 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:35.160
 put on again with 20 newton meters and 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.160
 last tighten with 90 degrees 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.790
 finally, the fuse is sprinting 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.790
 used 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.430
 I wish you a good trip 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.430
 with macro car parts
