00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
163 and yv or anything and then that is

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.370 
163 and yv or anything and then that is
minus<00:01:54.680> 387<00:01:55.969> not<00:01:56.969> too<00:01:57.149> far<00:01:57.390> from<00:01:57.420> spawn<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
minus 387 not too far from spawn and

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.050 
minus 387 not too far from spawn and
obviously<00:01:58.710> I'm<00:01:58.829> going<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.040> be<00:01:59.130> floating<00:01:59.969> away

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
obviously I'm going to be floating away

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.880 
obviously I'm going to be floating away
for<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.360> water<00:02:00.540> load<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.439> should<00:02:01.619> spawn

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
for the water load and it should spawn

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.800 
for the water load and it should spawn
hopefully<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:02.969> we're<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.240> school<00:02:03.540> but<00:02:03.719> when

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
all loaded come on there we go she's

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.160 
all loaded come on there we go she's
hopefully<00:02:11.580> comes<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.180> Phillip<00:02:12.420> andheri

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
hopefully comes to Phillip andheri
