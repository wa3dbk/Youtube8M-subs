 of facebook already installed we are going to 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.320
 open it my facebook page 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.290
 will be the download link here we are 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.600
 in version 0 point 12.1 in fact 0.12 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.780
 point 1 alpha wild 1 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.760
 let's play we create a new world in 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.380
 clear creative is and well this is the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.380
 first approach I'm on my bike the 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:52.580
 amount x and then to see how it looks 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.590
 subject to see here we put difficulty 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.370
 has several levels of difficulty what 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.360
 which 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.920
 it's interesting here we remove this the 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.490
 brightness the rendering we follow a 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.040
 a little more 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.230
 well here in the middle is fine 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.670
 in my opinion not so that in the aspect and 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:12.560
 others we go back to the game and in fact they are 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.230
 here the new controls as they can 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.180
 realize are the new controls 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.370
 this is to jump 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.020
 this if we give it twice is for 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.610
 duck we're going to get into third 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.910
 person 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.970
 here we would be crouching we give two 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:30.560
 Sometimes there it is and with this we jump 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.690
 this interesting in fact I did not like 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.170
 how it looked and still does not like how 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.340
 it looks but the truth is very practical 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.530
 this is very good and now we are going to 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.090
 see here our inventory as a little 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.650
 As we can see, we already have many 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.770
 More little things, I'm nervous about 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.039
 God 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.429
 here we have mom, what are the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.880
 laws the expenses we have here all the 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:02:00.840
 weapons and armor we have here the 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.819
 expulsions and we also have wow the 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.670
 table charms this table 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.799
 enchantments as I told you the ok the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.289

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.629

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.500
 enchantments is not there is not is not 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:19.510
 critical eye that peak my god is not in 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.890
 in what the windows 10 version as 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.020
 I write for my previous videos 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.910
 of transform are in the description and 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.850
 here would be the epic table 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.310
 enchantments great we can up 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.890
 expose an expense there is gas a 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.440
 I will also be there so nothing 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.500
 nothing else is a quick video for 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.450
 show them later and they had a 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.720
 full review of this new version 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.720
 here we will be what it is that I think that 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.490
 you can not see in our face to see 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.420
 we put to what options third view 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:55.660
 person sophisticated graphics skies 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.489
 beautiful and others to hide interface 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.490
 of the game sensitivity controls 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.180
 divided 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.250
 swap Danish compass nicki also the course 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.860
 of the control automatically skip it 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.980
 we can activate or deactivate very well 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.540
 here is to flip it over here they would be 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.780
 then these controls and I leave them like this 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.820
 we can change them here with this we 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.580
 we can crouch I think it's more 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.350
 convenient even in the other mode to 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.940
 see if we change it 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:29.670
 here is this and very well, if it would be 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.620
 more comfortable from my point of view and already 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.300
 not also with this we jump and we 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.530
 we can also put creative this 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.480
 way 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.480
 Well, it's really great, the truth is 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.720
 It surprised that they wanted to take 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:46.019
 already right now which is incredible is 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.409
 great the truth thank you very much to those of 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.629
 moyano who thought of us to see 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:54.750
 here if I want to remove this there is 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:57.060
 then because he put on is this view 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.040
 to put it in some way so nothing 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.230
 I really hope you liked the 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.890
 I'm really very happy because I already 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:08.519
 we can have everything we expected 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.590
 here it would be and nothing else is a video 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.420
 I tell you, the download will be in 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.180
 facebook so nothing we see in a 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.120
 next video see you later 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.690
 now I can say goodbye, crouched down and 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.690
 jumping great
