the course of this review I noticed that

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.509 
the course of this review I noticed that
both<00:03:30.629> crashes<00:03:31.260> had<00:03:31.530> really<00:03:32.010> nice<00:03:32.159> balance

musically interesting overtones and

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.899 
musically interesting overtones and
because<00:03:37.829> they're<00:03:37.979> hand<00:03:38.220> hammered<00:03:38.579> Turkish

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:38.909
