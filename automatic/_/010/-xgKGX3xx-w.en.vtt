00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.610
 all good guys here we are finally 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:17.699
 come back with a new video of the super 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.030
 hostile infernal sky we are in company 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:24.960
 chip pages ragazzuoli heston 106 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:33.870
 first you know of zaro from the raga plays 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:36.690
 alien then where five is a mini video 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.090
 presentation of the map only 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.270
 to explain a moment how 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.000
 it will work and what we will do and then 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.250
 we will leave with videos on three days 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.930
 be ready that we finally leave with 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.930
 the new series has now finally said 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.030
 then 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.870
 nothing parliamentary for a moment what it is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.860
 where you are 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.810
 yes yes yes art taiba explains we are in 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:09.290
 infernal sky and vice versa explain 18 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.119
 the third map made by beck 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.790
 practically here we already have a wall with 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:19.369
 all instructions to complete the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.810
 honest map honestly yes definitely 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.420
 seeing it is quite disturbing 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.210
 we will die so many times not there 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.430
 it will be tomorrow and we will also do it 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.270
 since he goes from qatar he touched a 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.550
 sore button 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.310
 let's say we leave you in the description a 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.310
 link where you will have to vote 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.039
 or if you let us use the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.140
 keep inventory or not we leave you the 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:46.770
 survey link all in 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.750
 description then I chip and sama links 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.210
 from the same course then tell us 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.039
 if we can, if we can, it was 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.160
 felt in glass and also because as 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.990
 it is a world practically made of islands yes 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.860
 flies by dropping into the void like 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.600
 see from above die seen see 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.150
 also that they are all these islets 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.890
 also ships made of wood etc. 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.769
 and since we are very difficult we ask you 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.970
 if you think it is taken as a quote 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.650
 therefore anyway it grants us the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.150
 possibility to make team inventory for 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.470
 whoever does not know it serves to save 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.810
 the inventory when you die 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.780
 so if you allow us to use it e 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.480
 obviously for our boys' convenience 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.630
 we tell you quietly we will use 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.280
 however the pp then at least the 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.200
 we will teleport between us 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.510
 because they are boys it is really almost 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.180
 impossible to make this move of the case 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:41.730
 never because even hard videos in a 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.950
 lot what reaches us from saint 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.930
 however the map you see is made of 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.130
 various islets are called infernal 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.109
 sky because loyal we don't show 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.110
 too many things kids are then the larvae e 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.970
 obviously 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.240
 around here you see the map then the 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.510
 you will see as we play in 12 reals 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.670

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.780
