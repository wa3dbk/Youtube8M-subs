00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
makeup looks in that movie that I just

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.830 
makeup looks in that movie that I just
had<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.520> create<00:01:00.180> myself<00:01:01.080> so<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.879> no<00:01:03.420> way<00:01:03.600> shape

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
had to create myself so in no way shape

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.950 
had to create myself so in no way shape
or<00:01:04.020> form<00:01:04.080> or<00:01:04.470> any<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:04.949> makeups<00:01:05.960> really

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
or form or any of these makeups really

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
or form or any of these makeups really
done<00:01:07.440> very<00:01:08.240> precisely<00:01:09.410> however<00:01:10.410> this<00:01:11.010> movie

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
done very precisely however this movie

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.060 
done very precisely however this movie
is<00:01:11.460> set<00:01:11.729> in<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.000> post-apocalyptic<00:01:12.290> world<00:01:13.290> so

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
is set in a post-apocalyptic world so

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.810 
is set in a post-apocalyptic world so
thus<00:01:15.060> it<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.630> my<00:01:16.050> friend<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.800> know<00:01:17.610> their

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
thus it is my friend in that know their

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.630 
thus it is my friend in that know their
makeups<00:01:18.240> are<00:01:18.570> ever<00:01:18.869> perfect<00:01:19.380> always<00:01:20.009> changing

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
makeups are ever perfect always changing

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.660 
makeups are ever perfect always changing
always<00:01:21.110> different<00:01:22.110> so<00:01:22.440> this<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.190> just<00:01:23.340> kind<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
always different so this is just kind of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.350 
always different so this is just kind of
like<00:01:23.850> my<00:01:24.149> take<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:25.580> decided<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.790> try<00:01:27.270> out

into<00:01:43.140> furiosa<00:01:43.649> so<00:01:44.160> I<00:01:44.369> hope<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.240> guys<00:01:45.390> don't

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
into furiosa so I hope you guys don't

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.690 
into furiosa so I hope you guys don't
mind<00:01:45.690> but<00:01:46.319> I<00:01:46.590> did<00:01:46.830> not<00:01:47.009> talk<00:01:47.220> during<00:01:47.459> these

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
mind but I did not talk during these

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.600 
mind but I did not talk during these
tutorials<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.289> I<00:01:49.319> could<00:01:49.470> focus<00:01:49.800> more<00:01:50.250> on

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
tutorials just so I could focus more on

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.880 
tutorials just so I could focus more on
the<00:01:50.880> makeup<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:52.050> I'll<00:01:52.350> hopefully<00:01:52.560> just

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
the makeup and then I'll hopefully just

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.160 
the makeup and then I'll hopefully just
do<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.130> little<00:01:53.280> voice<00:01:53.520> over<00:01:53.940> and<00:01:54.209> I<00:01:54.810> hope<00:01:55.020> that's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
do a little voice over and I hope that's

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.169 
do a little voice over and I hope that's
not<00:01:55.319> a<00:01:55.410> huge<00:01:55.649> deal<00:01:55.830> I<00:01:56.190> know<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.850> may<00:01:56.970> not<00:01:57.119> be

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 
not a huge deal I know it may not be

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.210 
not a huge deal I know it may not be
exactly<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:58.050> most<00:01:58.229> helpful<00:01:58.590> tutorial

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
exactly the most helpful tutorial

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.669 
exactly the most helpful tutorial
because<00:01:59.520> some<00:01:59.850> of<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.090> may<00:02:00.240> not<00:02:00.420> even<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:01.500> your

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
because some of you may not even in your

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.249 
because some of you may not even in your
wildest<00:02:02.130> dreams<00:02:02.630> imagine<00:02:03.630> going<00:02:03.929> out<00:02:04.020> like

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
wildest dreams imagine going out like

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.870 
wildest dreams imagine going out like
this<00:02:04.440> however<00:02:05.039> I<00:02:06.080> think<00:02:07.080> for<00:02:07.709> the<00:02:08.039> first<00:02:08.429> in

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
this however I think for the first in

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.540 
this however I think for the first in
the<00:02:09.000> last<00:02:09.240> tutorial<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:10.099> probably<00:02:11.099> go<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.310> at

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
the last tutorial I probably go to at

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.100 
the last tutorial I probably go to at
least<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> punk<00:02:12.300> show<00:02:12.420> wearing<00:02:12.780> this

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
least like a punk show wearing this

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.309 
least like a punk show wearing this
makeup<00:02:13.380> I<00:02:13.650> think<00:02:13.890> it's<00:02:14.040> really<00:02:14.250> rad<00:02:14.580> so<00:02:15.420> yeah

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
makeup I think it's really rad so yeah

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.610 
makeup I think it's really rad so yeah

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
so I'm gonna be starting off by priming

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.410 
so I'm gonna be starting off by priming
my<00:02:22.050> eyelid<00:02:22.650> as<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.099> should<00:02:23.340> for<00:02:23.670> any<00:02:24.060> look

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
my eyelid as you should for any look

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.230 
my eyelid as you should for any look
really<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.020> have<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.349> good<00:02:25.590> base<00:02:25.980> down<00:02:26.610> first

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
so that nothing budges throughout the

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.910 
so that nothing budges throughout the
day<00:02:29.310> using<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.390> really<00:02:30.660> fluffy<00:02:30.990> shadow<00:02:31.590> brush
