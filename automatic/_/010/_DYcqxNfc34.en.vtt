00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:12.170
 wow that looks the discounts sharply 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.030
 that's pretty good 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.610
 it is the third part of the crysis 3 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.400
 Kremser from frankfurt developer crytek 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.740
 and they have a lot of power 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.480
 no matter what the optics were there 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.309
 Gods are like that looks like 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.989
 they had the opportunity to be pcs 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:33.270
 to send longer 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.329
 and there it is a really great one 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.250
 shooter with small but fine 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.690
 Innovations One of them can be seen here 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.130
 one possibility with his 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.690
 suit things to hack 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.550
 in the case is minefield or too 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.750
 protected movies or something like that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.460
 tactical gameplay so a bit 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.290
 meets and then almost the 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.860
 objects displayed on the screen 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.660
 by indicating the season anyway the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.760
 one later used to adversaries 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.170
 mark weapons to find or so that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.730
 but is purely optional that is one 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.090
 bit helps in the stealth gameplay 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.090
 little 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.240
 so moderate effect is also quite 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.270
 nice the luzie himself on the ps3 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.729
 the stories 20 years after crysis 2 man 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.700
 you are playing profit yourself and will benefit from that 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.950
 old colleague syco this is this one 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.150
 freed from captivity and you 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.800
 ever knows first not what's going on 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.270
 and that alcohol has sooner too 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.369
 a suit worn about no more what 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.550
 is there happened is the name program 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.960
 or that was his, the water in the fight 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.100
 By now, soldiers are an old man 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:42.910
 broken man earlier was therefore up 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:45.420
 broken now and now it's only time 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.420
 once given 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.180
 a bow of the mambo lets him greet me 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.830
 Wish you said that you too 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.470
 few innovations one of them is just 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.420
 a bow and everyone thinks so too 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.820
 main character by the way clearly and 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.500
 But arch has become really cool 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.119
 So I was as surprised as I am great 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.200
 that i play because the bow has the 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.240
 property that turin out of 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.620
 can shoot invisibility with it 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.300
 you will do again as soon as you 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.000
 you are visible that is with the shoots 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.530
 Things are not so completely and completely silent 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.930
 just the resourceful reader will show here 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.310
 but then I'm completely overpowering 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.080
 But it's not like that because you only have 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.910
 limited arrow selection so that 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.610
 maximum new normal arrows and three 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:35.130
 from the special case and other conclusion 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:36.300
 after that would have really borders and so on 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.790
 By the way, it looks like when you look at yourself 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.510
 so the effects are so 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.680
 just great 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.230
 this is an intermediate sequence 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.610
 but also in ingame graphics is 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.870
 so the game is always through 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.580
 very quite atmospheric sequences 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.030
 continued incredibly beautiful like that 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.620
 looks 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.760
 So I have to say that I'm all 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.080
 two minutes and has stopped 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.570
 Just looked around because of this 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.269
 landscape of this portal rotted new 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.320
 York are covered with jungle 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:03.180
 Everything about growth will be valoren there 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.680
 Of course, according to fat bosses opponents 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.930
 because the man once fought against sehar 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.209
 soldiers that is one a human 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.250
 corporation the world is doing 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.620
 wants to tear, so to speak, and within 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.600
 New york, there is the sap alliance that 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.090
 these creatures are here all the loss 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.830
 so funny what the hell is so new 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.340
 york happened that does not look like 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.030
 New York to keep out of control 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.400
 often end the botany in old 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.080
 In any case, it is also pretty frightening 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.489
 giant snakes already powerful in part 3 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.709
 it does not really matter because you get 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.239
 partly alien weapons gift what me 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.920
 looks at the same time and they make soups and 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.019
 they are there with the 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.900
 technology of overpowering 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.980
 extra-terrestrial equipped quite exactly 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.720
 who are with us will be there too 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.100
 is and then ammo but but 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.890
 Simply tear everything to pieces as you equal 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.470
 By the way, by the way, that will happen anyway 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.120
 did not tell of the power 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.739
 a lot of fun it is one 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.200
 component are'll need but 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.790
 Not 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.340
 Do you see the opponents on the map? 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.080
 what make it easier ? 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:10.050
 By the way, the fights are sailing against sl 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:15.370
 soldiers and love pain with emma 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:17.380
 there is not much left anyone can 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.840
 These elian weapons use or exist 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.400
 because any restrictions so one 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.250
 has seen so much in movies earlier 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.620
 You have to have one in hand for a living 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.860
 to be able to leave 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.350
 because the protagonist is wearing a suit 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.910
 which is supplied with alien technology 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.700
 this is the explanation for no one else 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.290
 By the way , it can be more awesome 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.300
 such railshooter deposits as here 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.729
 Fortunately, there are relatively rare 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.830
 quite nicely staged a bit 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.430
 cozy as stop after all, ego 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.040
 shooting games 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.020
 but fits if so synonymous sequences 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.970
 come where you are pushed 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.960
 otherwise you are free has a lot 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.880
 freedom more like someone for example 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.080
 There is rarely a vehicle 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:01.210
 Deposits so until half life change 2 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.680
 they are cool so you have one 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.240
 Great freedom wherever you go 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.220
 already limited but it is still 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.870
 far more pleasant than say mine 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.879
 Corrections can do a lot 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.919
 comes from a to b and back there 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.990
 is it really matter 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:15.610
 I think that's great now we have 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:21.069
 still a graphic comparison behind it 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:23.650
 packed to show how crysis 3 works 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:25.930
 the xbox on the ps3 and on the pc 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:29.349
 looks like this is now the xbox variant 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:32.530
 which is similar to the ps3 variant 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:34.690
 that does not mean high resolution only 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.669
 720 p, for example, no directx 11 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.500
 logically, but still looks 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:39.389
 pretty good we have to have one 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.110
 really say 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.110
 silence of the pc 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.070
 yes, that's close 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.100
 yes, this is mainly cracked textures 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.870
 as I said the x11 effects 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.460
 Particle effects tessellation the whole 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.670
 feed to whom he needs when she needs too 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.610
 lead a corresponding chains pc 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:04.250
 but you can see clearly why 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.420
 new consoles need the ps3 finds 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.460
 is still doing very well 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.050
 just a little bit weaker textures 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.820
 and a trainer has many effects and 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.940
 she is amazingly of the three 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:17.620
 versions the worst one yes 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:19.970
 shake little micro latent and 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.590
 creates and creates the blurred 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.330
 version one sees that one directly in the 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.330
 Comparison as she is at the same time the pc 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:28.400
 version is completely explosion which has 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.040
 these volumetric where metric 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.810
 particle effects here you see it when we 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.190
 yes, they happen on the consoles 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:39.770
 not just a bit smoke as 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.530
 conclusion must say it is still 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:44.900
 one of the best beautiful games on 

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.060
 So you really should console yourself 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.110
 at the end of this console can calm the 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.660
 It has become really great 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.790
 shooter relatively short unfortunately with an ok 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.830
 in story but it looks really bombastic 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:59.380
 from so I am often completely blown 

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.380
 gone was thunder weather 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:07.759
 yes you can see it already pc is here but 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:09.439
 the consoles well they still hold 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:10.099
 with we wait for the next one 

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:12.679
 generation 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:17.229
 then it is the same for the 

00:07:12.679 --> 00:07:17.229
 moment get crysis 3
