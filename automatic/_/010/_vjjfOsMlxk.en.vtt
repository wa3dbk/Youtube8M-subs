00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.720
 Good Morning 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.610
 evolution of fertilizer through 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.260
 doctrines in the football world cardboard 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.550
 or Colombian is already a custom without 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.840
 But as they are thinking of 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.400
 rates currently buying the 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.689
 unesco nuclear is not balanced is 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.950
 true or commitment loyalty of 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.000
 a part of our players for 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.470
 end that incoherence we have 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.420
 decided to adjust the cost of some of 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.420
 headlines 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.730
 1100 the month to square one thousand 311 thousand six 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.100
 21 thousand months 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.300
 but what a face then, that is, the 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.960
 players we do not see that they come to me 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.019
 asking for days to pay with their 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:10.650
 dogs like that you start from scratch and they just 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.650
 fuck once again this is amazing 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.550
 what the fuck are you thinking about beds 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.990
 when he makes these kinds of changes 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:28.520
 yes because there are players who do not have 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.520
 money but that was 700 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.420
 a m or a 1.1 that I imagine they are going to 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.750
 be around 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.159
 this is awesome more and more expensive 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.840
 the nieces 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.140
 the players are going back son 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.150
 in the subscription or 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.000
 what the hell are just as with 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.659
 this kind of changes and we get bored in 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.659
 the long 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.650
 no no 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.810
 pitiful that we keep going up a lot 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.810
 but they keep going up 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.890
 god if there are players complaining 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.780
 complaining 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.130
 give the multi- worshiped accounts of each 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.630
 harder time to abandon 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.160
 previously or nothing 80 ends 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.620
 bj 8 million beds per person 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.690
 I sent a point and then ask for 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.690
 What is going people may think 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.930
 that we make us float out of the air 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.120
 of internet that people are going 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:48.319
 against good games does not cast them either 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.420
 the fault or buttons flips why 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.310
 a person who receives orders for 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.049
 which evolves two orders another type of 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.120
 people equal to the order to others 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.560
 people and then this personality order 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.629
 other people to make other 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.450
 people of other people 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:07.909
 one person another player then 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.709
 the culprit to actually get out 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:15.159
 with this that we retire from the game 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:15.159
 of another game or it may be 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.780
 but I do not think alike are already happening 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.780
 when it houses children 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:30.060
 pathetic 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.440
 of bancada 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.520
 first to beautify the grains 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.470
 they went up 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.470
 a lot of water and now 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.190
 Fuck everybody we buy for a 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.190
