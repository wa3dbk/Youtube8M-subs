00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:06.290
 Hello, how are you ? 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:09.260
 Dermatologist of Lima Peru editor of the 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.990
 weapon peru.com website today 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.209
 let's make a demonstration about what 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.490
 type of sunscreens we have in 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.500
 Today we have always 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.510
 asked if at any time when 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.760
 still I was not a dermatologist and neither 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.070
 doctor was pretty young he said that 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.900
 sunscreen will fall to me if I go 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.250
 to use a cream product a 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.320
 gel product 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.570
 those will exist in those moments 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.670
 there are currently a lot of 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.960
 presentations that we are going to see now 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.000
 we have sunscreen spray 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.890
 we have sunscreens that are 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.560
 transparent sunscreens 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.540
 fluid sunscreen cream and 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.970
 sunscreens in compact as 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.070
 let's see now let's start with 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.770
 this first so that you can see 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.480
 This sunscreen can be used 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.250
 there are some presentations on the face and 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.649
 other bodily presentation but 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.719
 I really find it quite cosmetic 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.299
 let's see here the demonstration we see 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.740
 here that you practically do not notice the 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.630
 sunscreen 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.939
 We thank our assistant that we 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.240
 is helping to see the 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:16.939
 consistencies of sunscreens 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.740
 now let's see the one that is fluid that 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.259
 I like it a lot, for example when 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.820
 patient has a lot of hair and can 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.700
 Apply on the arms on the legs 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.750
 we see here and we see that you can also 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.369
 quickly dilute to make the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.899
 sunscreen if we had a 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.299
 patient with much more hair then 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.729
 obviously this would be enough 

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.549
 quite adequate we will also see here 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.420
 a product with fluid that is a little 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.850
 milky is a product of which 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.530
 could he use for hands for faces not 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.060
 we forget that currently the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.610
 sunscreens not only 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.619
 protect now the new trends are 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.440
 that the sunscreens are going to 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.830
 use or are including within your 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:03.140
 formula products moisturizing products 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.689
 antioxidants hyaluronic acid 5 biloba 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.429
 et cetera if you want to see what the 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.530
 sunscreen that best dance for 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.300
 his skin suggest we make a small 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.950
 investment and visit a topic tone 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.100
 here we have a pediatric presentation 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.740
 in which the formula really is a 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.470
 a little more compact because the child 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.420
 you need better protection is not that 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.670
 is leaving the skin white but in 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.400
 its moment we have to dilute little 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.890
 to little and as you see are products 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.670
 medicated that basically are not going to let 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:37.460
 no presence but if they are 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.230
 protecting against the sun or radiation 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.740
 ultraviolet we already want our last 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.990
 which is a cream product that in 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.720
 general we indicate it more than everything for 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.069
 patients who are having a skin 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.530
 dry yes 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:55.620
 but then you can dilute it and be able to see 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.019
 that is going to protect us against 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.939
 ultraviolet radiation and finally the 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.129
 another more interesting presentation is a 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:04.469
 compact truth that has its also 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.819
 has its mirror so that the girls or in 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:08.909
 In any case, also men who can 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.819
 want to have a sunscreen can 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.010
 do it more easily then 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.780
 we already have the presentations we have 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.599
 fluid presentations presentations in 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.249
 gel cream presentations 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.500
 presentations with products 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:24.810
 transparent and also some in 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.150
 compact to apply but as 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.489
 one sponge I'm the other the one here 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.829
