you've noticed how undergraduate
enrollment<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.430> up<00:00:23.460> since<00:00:23.910> I've<00:00:24.090> taken<00:00:24.359> over

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
isn't total enrollment down that is just

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.140 
isn't total enrollment down that is just
due<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.779> softening<00:00:28.470> graduate<00:00:28.920> enrollment<00:00:29.580> so

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
due to softening graduate enrollment so

undergraduate enrollment is up less than
one<00:00:32.279> standard<00:00:32.669> deviation<00:00:32.850> from<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.570> mean<00:00:33.600> for

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
one standard deviation from the mean for

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.139 
one standard deviation from the mean for
the<00:00:34.079> last<00:00:34.290> ten<00:00:34.620> years<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.340> graduate

the last ten years and graduate

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.819 
the last ten years and graduate
enrollment<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.809> down<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.350> much<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.710> is

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
enrollment is down so much it is

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.680 
enrollment is down so much it is
actually<00:00:38.280> bringing<00:00:38.640> total<00:00:38.820> enrollment<00:00:39.480> down

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
actually bringing total enrollment down

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.500 
actually bringing total enrollment down
and<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.410> think<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> good<00:00:41.160> thing

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
and you think this is a good thing
