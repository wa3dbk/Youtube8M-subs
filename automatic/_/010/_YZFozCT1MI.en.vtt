00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
diagonal tnt cannon which I thought was

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.189 
diagonal tnt cannon which I thought was
pretty<00:00:27.119> cool<00:00:27.269> because<00:00:27.539> I've<00:00:27.750> never<00:00:27.779> looked

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
pretty cool because I've never looked

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.529 
pretty cool because I've never looked
for<00:00:28.349> one<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:28.800> I've<00:00:28.920> never<00:00:29.099> heard<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.460> one

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
for one but I've never heard of one

for one but I've never heard of one
which<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.570> friggin<00:00:30.990> awesome<00:00:31.109> because<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.710> you

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
which is friggin awesome because if you

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650 
which is friggin awesome because if you
have<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.070> neighbors<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:33.090> know<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.390> live

have like neighbors you know that live
diagonal<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.590> instead<00:00:34.890> of<00:00:35.040> like<00:00:35.219> north

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
diagonal of you instead of like north

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.970 
diagonal of you instead of like north
south<00:00:35.760> east<00:00:35.940> west<00:00:36.059> now<00:00:37.050> you're<00:00:37.469> able<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
south east west now you're able to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.819 
south east west now you're able to
destroy<00:00:38.520> them<00:00:38.760> if<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.300> wish<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.899> only<00:00:40.620> put

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
destroy them if you so wish I only put

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.950 
destroy them if you so wish I only put
another<00:00:40.980> tick<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.570> but<00:00:42.570> yeah<00:00:42.690> basically

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
another tick on that but yeah basically

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.619 
another tick on that but yeah basically
you<00:00:43.440> know<00:00:43.670> Northwest<00:00:44.670> ah<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.510> not

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
you know Northwest ah it's not

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.979 
you know Northwest ah it's not
directional<00:00:46.170> by<00:00:46.260> any<00:00:46.410> means<00:00:47.420> there<00:00:48.420> goes<00:00:48.660> it

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
directional by any means there goes it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.100 
directional by any means there goes it
goes<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:50.219> it<00:00:50.879> kind<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.180> probably<00:00:51.510> blew<00:00:51.809> up<00:00:51.960> in

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
goes and it kind of probably blew up in

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.540 
goes and it kind of probably blew up in
midair<00:00:52.230> ah<00:00:53.120> let<00:00:54.120> me<00:00:54.239> put<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.809> little<00:00:54.899> bit<00:00:55.379> of<00:00:55.550> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
midair ah let me put a little bit of the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.670 
midair ah let me put a little bit of the
cap<00:00:56.789> here<00:00:57.149> see<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.629> shoots<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.109> forward<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
cap here see if it shoots it forward I

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.900 
cap here see if it shoots it forward I
mean<00:00:59.129> it's<00:00:59.309> TT<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.000> pretty<00:01:00.390> unpredictable

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
mean it's TT it's pretty unpredictable

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.100 
mean it's TT it's pretty unpredictable
what<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:02.940> wanted<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.300> do<00:01:03.480> right<00:01:03.660> now<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.989> was

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
what I wanted to do right now that was

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.740 
what I wanted to do right now that was
actually<00:01:04.939> blow<00:01:05.939> up<00:01:06.060> when<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.330> hits<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.720> ground

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
actually blow up when it hits the ground

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
actually blow up when it hits the ground
as<00:01:07.740> opposed<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.189> like<00:01:08.310> blowing<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.790> in<00:01:08.970> midair

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
as opposed to like blowing up in midair

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.070 
as opposed to like blowing up in midair
there<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> go<00:01:11.540> there<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.570> go<00:01:12.689> perfect

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
there you go there you go perfect

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.859 
there you go there you go perfect
perfect<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.790> yeah<00:01:14.939> we<00:01:15.060> put<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.780> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
perfect so yeah we put this so that it

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.830 
perfect so yeah we put this so that it
doesn't<00:01:16.049> go<00:01:16.229> just<00:01:16.470> completely<00:01:16.830> skyward<00:01:17.840> but

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
doesn't go just completely skyward but

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.810 
doesn't go just completely skyward but
yeah<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.350> let's<00:01:19.530> build<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.250> we'll<00:01:20.460> put<00:01:20.670> this

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
yeah so let's build it so we'll put this

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.219 
yeah so let's build it so we'll put this
block<00:01:21.119> here<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.689> where<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.930> button<00:01:22.200> is

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
block here this is where the button is

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.320 
block here this is where the button is
going<00:01:22.439> to<00:01:22.530> go<00:01:22.680> from<00:01:23.460> here<00:01:23.610> on<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> water<00:01:24.119> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
going to go from here on the water is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.649 
going to go from here on the water is
going<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:24.720> here<00:01:26.119> so<00:01:27.119> let's<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.450> put<00:01:27.630> this

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
going to go here so let's just put this

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.880 
going to go here so let's just put this
around<00:01:27.869> here<00:01:28.259> water<00:01:28.560> goes<00:01:28.799> here<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.390> TNT<00:01:30.890> eight

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
around here water goes here so TNT eight

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.060 
around here water goes here so TNT eight
of<00:01:32.159> them<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.680> then<00:01:34.680> we'll<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.979> uh

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
of them like so and then we'll just uh

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.590 
of them like so and then we'll just uh
actually<00:01:35.790> let's<00:01:35.939> put<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.150> water<00:01:36.299> because<00:01:36.540> I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
actually let's put the water because I

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.700 
actually let's put the water because I
don't<00:01:36.750> forget<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.350> everything<00:01:37.619> it's

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
don't forget it and everything it's

don't forget it and everything it's
going<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.890> blow<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:39.119> right<00:01:39.270> surrounded

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
going to blow up all right surrounded

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.190 
going to blow up all right surrounded
and<00:01:39.900> blocks<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.270> like<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
and blocks like so like that like that

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080 
and blocks like so like that like that
you'll<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.250> didn't<00:01:44.579> do<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.670> right<00:01:44.820> of

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
you'll know you didn't do it right of

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.789 
you'll know you didn't do it right of
the<00:01:45.210> TNT<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.990> not<00:01:46.110> able<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.500> go<00:01:46.619> over

the TNT is just not able to go over

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.550 
the TNT is just not able to go over
every<00:01:47.100> single<00:01:47.390> I<00:01:48.390> mean<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.170> desk<00:01:49.380> isn't

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.660 
just like that all right and we don't
really<00:01:56.820> need<00:01:56.969> this<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.450> or<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.619> one<00:01:58.680> but

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
really need this one or this one but

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.249 
really need this one or this one but
they're<00:01:59.790> good<00:01:59.939> because<00:02:00.210> we<00:02:00.630> need<00:02:00.810> those<00:02:00.990> to

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
they're good because we need those to

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.109 
they're good because we need those to
kind<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.680> hold<00:02:01.890> back<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.310> T&amp;T<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> water

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
kind of hold back the T&amp;T in the water

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.690 
kind of hold back the T&amp;T in the water
when<00:02:03.329> it<00:02:03.420> flows<00:02:03.630> out<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.649> where<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.979> like

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
when it flows out this is where the like

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.789 
when it flows out this is where the like
bullet<00:02:06.119> team<00:02:06.299> t<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.869> go<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.710> we'll

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
bullet team t is going to go then we'll

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.780 
bullet team t is going to go then we'll
place<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.009> block<00:02:08.310> here<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:08.819> do<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:10.790> 488

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
place a block here what do I have 488

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.550 
place a block here what do I have 488
repeaters<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.840> four<00:02:13.140> and<00:02:13.290> then

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
repeaters on four and then

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.040 
repeaters on four and then
repeater<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:14.099> on<00:02:15.290> too<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.890> let's<00:02:17.099> do<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.340> one

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
repeater on on too so let's do that one

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.460 
repeater on on too so let's do that one
two<00:02:19.050> three<00:02:19.470> four<00:02:19.830> all<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.370> these<00:02:20.489> on<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:21.470> now

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
two three four all of these on for now

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.080 
two three four all of these on for now
again<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.920> timing<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.520> like<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.880> bullet

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
again the timing on like the bullet

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.550 
again the timing on like the bullet
which<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.480> what<00:02:24.599> I<00:02:24.630> want<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.870> refer<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:25.440> on

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
which is what I want to refer to it on

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.820 
which is what I want to refer to it on
that<00:02:25.800> one<00:02:25.950> it's<00:02:26.099> kind<00:02:26.340> of<00:02:26.400> up<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.700> guys

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
that one it's kind of up to you guys

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.900 
that one it's kind of up to you guys
depending<00:02:28.830> on<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.160> wanted<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.489> blow<00:02:29.640> up<00:02:29.790> in

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
depending on if you wanted to blow up in

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.220 
depending on if you wanted to blow up in
midair<00:02:30.120> or<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:31.019> know<00:02:31.220> as<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.400> hits<00:02:32.550> the<00:02:32.640> ground

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
midair or you know as it hits the ground

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.420 
midair or you know as it hits the ground
basically<00:02:34.230> make<00:02:34.380> adjustments<00:02:34.980> on<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.099> tix

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
basically make adjustments on the tix

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.470 
basically make adjustments on the tix
here<00:02:36.769> and<00:02:37.769> also<00:02:38.010> if<00:02:38.700> you<00:02:38.819> want<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.150> be<00:02:39.269> more

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
here and also if you want it to be more

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.740 
here and also if you want it to be more
streamlined<00:02:40.220> than<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.370> know<00:02:41.519> make<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.420> like

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
streamlined than you know make the like

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.190 
streamlined than you know make the like
cap<00:02:43.200> kind<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.860> thing<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.250> bit<00:02:44.430> lower<00:02:44.910> as<00:02:45.209> well<00:02:45.450> so

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
cap kind of thing a bit lower as well so

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.500 
cap kind of thing a bit lower as well so
right<00:02:46.380> now<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.560> think<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.950> have<00:02:47.100> that<00:02:47.130> one<00:02:47.510> like

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
right now I think I have that one like

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.300 
right now I think I have that one like
so<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.850> get<00:02:50.850> rid<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.090> these<00:02:51.239> ones<00:02:52.310> actually

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
so and get rid of these ones actually

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
you know there's a two-block separation

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.550 
you know there's a two-block separation
between<00:03:01.980> that<00:03:02.420> so<00:03:03.420> all<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.930> team<00:03:04.110> t<00:03:04.380> are
