here<00:00:00.750> I<00:00:00.810> have<00:00:00.900> a<00:00:01.020> turnigy<00:00:01.380> multi-star<00:00:02.129> 490<00:00:02.879> kv

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
here I have a turnigy multi-star 490 kv

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.619 
here I have a turnigy multi-star 490 kv
motor<00:00:04.160> for<00:00:05.160> I'm<00:00:05.850> going<00:00:06.000> to<00:00:06.060> get<00:00:06.150> in<00:00:06.240> for<00:00:06.450> them

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
motor for I'm going to get in for them

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.860 
motor for I'm going to get in for them
for<00:00:06.779> our<00:00:06.899> new<00:00:07.020> quadcopter<00:00:07.680> I'm<00:00:07.740> you're<00:00:07.980> making

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.870 
for our new quadcopter I'm you're making

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:16.160 
for our new quadcopter I'm you're making
this<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.530> controller<00:00:12.500> hobbyking<00:00:14.389> and<00:00:15.389> 40

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
this is the controller hobbyking and 40

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.500 
this is the controller hobbyking and 40
amp<00:00:16.379> one<00:00:16.859> its<00:00:17.369> way<00:00:17.520> overkill<00:00:17.940> for<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.270> motor

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
amp one its way overkill for this motor

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.220 
amp one its way overkill for this motor
but<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:19.730> was<00:00:20.730> actually<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.090> lighter<00:00:21.449> than<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
but I was actually a lighter than the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.750 
but I was actually a lighter than the
other<00:00:22.350> one<00:00:22.529> which<00:00:22.859> was<00:00:23.070> less<00:00:23.279> amperage<00:00:23.730> that

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
other one which was less amperage that

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.970 
other one which was less amperage that
had<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.150> mind<00:00:24.390> Plus<00:00:25.050> this<00:00:25.170> one<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.800> the

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
had in mind Plus this one is not the

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.189 
had in mind Plus this one is not the
other<00:00:26.160> one<00:00:26.279> was<00:00:26.430> just<00:00:26.580> some<00:00:27.060> no-name<00:00:27.869> brand

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
other one was just some no-name brand

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.410 
other one was just some no-name brand
kind<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.830> didn't<00:00:29.070> trust<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:30.619> the

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
kind of one so I didn't trust it the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.750 
kind of one so I didn't trust it the
batteries<00:00:33.420> right<00:00:33.660> over<00:00:33.930> here<00:00:34.579> it's<00:00:35.579> gonna

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
batteries right over here it's gonna

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:45.709 
batteries right over here it's gonna
unhook<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.329> from<00:00:36.360> the<00:00:36.630> charges<00:00:44.600> that's<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
unhook it from the charges that's the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:55.350 
unhook it from the charges that's the
charge<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.230> complaining

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.940 

so<00:00:56.360> right<00:00:56.540> now<00:00:56.570> for<00:00:56.900> control<00:00:57.260> I<00:00:57.290> just<00:00:57.650> have<00:00:57.830> an

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
so right now for control I just have an

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.260 
so right now for control I just have an
Arduino<00:00:58.510> hooked<00:00:59.510> up<00:01:00.550> right<00:01:01.550> there<00:01:01.790> Arduino

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
Arduino hooked up right there Arduino

waveform on the scope a one millisecond

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.330 
waveform on the scope a one millisecond
pulse<00:01:20.930> is<00:01:21.140> zero<00:01:21.440> throttle<00:01:21.980> to

sub-millisecond pulses at full throttle

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.750 
sub-millisecond pulses at full throttle
I'm<00:01:24.500> just<00:01:25.370> doing<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:25.730> every<00:01:26.770> like<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:27.800> 20

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:28.760 
I'm just doing that every like a 20

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:45.649 
I'm just doing that every like a 20
milliseconds<00:01:29.360> or<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:29.540> civil<00:01:29.990> 50<00:01:30.290> Hertz<00:01:33.760> yeah

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.910 

that<00:01:46.659> last<00:01:46.930> knows<00:01:47.140> their<00:01:47.409> means<00:01:47.619> that<00:01:47.799> it's

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
that last knows their means that it's

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.889 
that last knows their means that it's
ready<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.250> sin<00:01:48.640> working<00:01:49.149> mode<00:01:49.360> as<00:01:49.570> they<00:01:49.689> call

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
ready and sin working mode as they call

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.990 
ready and sin working mode as they call
it<00:01:49.930> I<00:01:50.229> don't<00:01:51.159> know<00:01:51.220> it<00:01:51.430> just<00:01:51.460> started<00:01:51.909> doing

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
it I don't know it just started doing

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.270 
it I don't know it just started doing
those<00:01:52.270> five<00:01:53.049> beats<00:01:53.439> at<00:01:53.649> the<00:01:53.740> start<00:01:54.009> when<00:01:54.130> I<00:01:54.189> was

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
those five beats at the start when I was

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.620 
those five beats at the start when I was
messing<00:01:54.460> around<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.820> settings<00:01:55.210> I<00:01:55.450> don't

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
messing around the settings I don't

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.090 
messing around the settings I don't
think<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:55.840> change<00:01:56.110> anything<00:01:56.409> to<00:01:56.619> have<00:01:56.710> no<00:01:56.860> idea

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
think I change anything to have no idea

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.460 
think I change anything to have no idea
why<00:01:57.250> people<00:01:57.580> beeps<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:59.020> really<00:01:59.289> find

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
why people beeps can really find

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.169 
why people beeps can really find
anything<00:01:59.710> I'm<00:01:59.920> on<00:02:00.100> seven<00:02:00.429> though<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:00.820> seems<00:02:01.030> to

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
anything I'm on seven though it seems to

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:10.499 
anything I'm on seven though it seems to
work<00:02:01.360> fine<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.610> this<00:02:04.000> hapless<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:09.610> uses

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
work fine so this hapless is uses

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:23.760 
work fine so this hapless is uses
screwdriver<00:02:11.080> here<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.440> turn<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:11.739> pot

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.320 

oh<00:02:23.830> it's<00:02:24.520> just<00:02:24.700> like<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.880> little<00:02:25.060> piece<00:02:25.300> of

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
oh it's just like a little piece of

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.970 
oh it's just like a little piece of
metal<00:02:25.630> that<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.870> have<00:02:26.110> on<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.440> thing<00:02:26.680> not<00:02:26.950> a

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
metal that I have on the thing not a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.190 
metal that I have on the thing not a
real<00:02:27.220> blade<00:02:27.490> this<00:02:27.760> for<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.030> load<00:02:28.330> testing<00:02:29.020> I've

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
real blade this for a load testing I've

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.180 
real blade this for a load testing I've
gotten<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.590> blade<00:02:29.800> yet<00:02:31.560> let's<00:02:32.560> crank<00:02:32.800> up<00:02:32.980> the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
gotten the blade yet let's crank up the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:45.289 
gotten the blade yet let's crank up the
throttle<00:02:33.610> here

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.369 

so<00:02:46.299> I<00:02:46.390> was<00:02:46.540> about<00:02:46.689> sixty-five<00:02:47.200> percent

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
so I was about sixty-five percent

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.140 
so I was about sixty-five percent
throttle<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.010> don't<00:02:48.159> really<00:02:48.250> like<00:02:48.459> pushing<00:02:48.970> any

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
throttle I don't really like pushing any

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.339 
throttle I don't really like pushing any
more<00:02:49.329> than<00:02:49.450> that<00:02:49.510> because<00:02:49.629> it<00:02:49.870> kind<00:02:50.019> of<00:02:50.079> scares

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
more than that because it kind of scares

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.259 
more than that because it kind of scares
me<00:02:51.569> so<00:02:52.569> I<00:02:52.629> try<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:52.840> keep<00:02:53.019> it<00:02:53.170> below<00:02:53.319> that<00:02:53.620> and

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
me so I try to keep it below that and

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.449 
me so I try to keep it below that and
I'm<00:02:55.269> testings<00:02:55.750> and<00:02:55.959> maybe<00:02:56.620> when<00:02:56.799> I<00:02:56.860> get<00:02:56.920> a<00:02:57.040> real

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
I'm testings and maybe when I get a real

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.220 
I'm testings and maybe when I get a real
blade<00:02:57.730> I<00:02:57.760> was<00:02:58.030> back<00:02:58.329> up<00:02:58.540> some<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:58.930> control

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
blade I was back up some and control

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.410 
blade I was back up some and control
further<00:02:59.739> away<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.250> then<00:03:00.340> test<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.390> a

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
further away and then test it to a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.000 
further away and then test it to a
higher<00:03:01.629> throttle<00:03:02.049> setting<00:03:02.349> but<00:03:03.239> yeah<00:03:04.829> so<00:03:05.829> that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
higher throttle setting but yeah so that

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.130 
higher throttle setting but yeah so that
it<00:03:06.209> seems<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.329> work<00:03:07.420> pretty<00:03:07.569> good<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:07.989> have

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
it seems to work pretty good and I have

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.869 
it seems to work pretty good and I have
figured<00:03:08.620> of<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.739> controlling<00:03:09.370> scheme<00:03:09.670> at

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
figured of the controlling scheme at

this<00:03:10.000> Danish<00:03:10.299> from<00:03:10.450> searching<00:03:10.780> online<00:03:10.959> and

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
this Danish from searching online and

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.330 
this Danish from searching online and
messing<00:03:12.519> around<00:03:12.609> and<00:03:12.819> see<00:03:12.970> what<00:03:13.120> works<00:03:13.709> no<00:03:14.709> he

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
messing around and see what works no he

was<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.549> battery<00:03:15.849> here<00:03:16.030> 8am<00:03:16.390> power<00:03:16.980> 6-cell

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.349 

nanotech<00:03:21.010> battery<00:03:21.549> really<00:03:22.000> nice<00:03:22.150> one

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
nanotech battery really nice one

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.530 
nanotech battery really nice one
actually<00:03:23.340> they'll<00:03:24.340> end<00:03:24.549> up<00:03:24.700> apparently<00:03:25.239> from

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
actually they'll end up apparently from

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.750 
actually they'll end up apparently from
a<00:03:25.659> calculator<00:03:26.109> i<00:03:26.200> used<00:03:26.500> at<00:03:26.829> all<00:03:26.859> four<00:03:27.519> of<00:03:27.549> them

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
a calculator i used at all four of them

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.580 
a calculator i used at all four of them
at<00:03:27.909> full<00:03:28.120> throttle<00:03:28.389> last<00:03:28.780> foot<00:03:28.989> seven<00:03:29.319> minutes

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
at full throttle last foot seven minutes

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.009 
at full throttle last foot seven minutes
on<00:03:29.709> this<00:03:29.799> battery<00:03:30.250> that's<00:03:31.090> how<00:03:31.209> full<00:03:31.659> throttle

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
on this battery that's how full throttle

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:33.410 
on this battery that's how full throttle
of<00:03:32.109> course<00:03:32.319> what<00:03:32.470> you<00:03:32.560> don't<00:03:32.739> usually<00:03:32.859> need

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
of course what you don't usually need

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.899 
of course what you don't usually need
however<00:03:34.420> i<00:03:34.480> think<00:03:34.510> i<00:03:34.720> was<00:03:34.810> about<00:03:34.900> 22<00:03:35.260> minutes

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
however i think i was about 22 minutes

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.260 
however i think i was about 22 minutes
it<00:03:36.909> should<00:03:37.120> work<00:03:37.359> pretty<00:03:37.540> good<00:03:37.690> thanks
