00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
your shoulders and your arms most people

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.979 
your shoulders and your arms most people
cause<00:00:56.879> an<00:00:57.059> injury<00:00:57.270> if<00:00:57.449> they<00:00:57.539> keeps<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.899> in

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
that way and most importantly it's a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.750 
that way and most importantly it's a
safety<00:01:01.350> risk<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:01.859> if<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.039> let<00:01:02.250> go<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> string

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
safety risk so if I let go of the string

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.090 
safety risk so if I let go of the string
in<00:01:02.940> this<00:01:03.059> position<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:04.229> arrow<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.710> just<00:01:04.739> going

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
in this position the arrow is just going

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.719 
in this position the arrow is just going
to<00:01:05.189> disappear<00:01:05.930> hundreds<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.020> meters<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.729> best

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
to disappear hundreds of meters so best

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.149 
to disappear hundreds of meters so best
to<00:01:08.820> keep<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.150> hands<00:01:09.450> flat<00:01:09.930> both<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.950> them<00:01:11.070> at

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
to keep the hands flat both of them at

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:11.980 
to keep the hands flat both of them at
same<00:01:11.430> height

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990

draw up aim at the target and take your

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.890 
draw up aim at the target and take your

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
shot also talking about high draw it's

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.170 
shot also talking about high draw it's
also<00:01:19.080> almost<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.830> it's<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.490> safe<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.970> do<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
also almost just it's it's safe to do it

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.980 
also almost just it's it's safe to do it
to<00:01:21.840> point<00:01:22.110> at<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.259> ground<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.830> then<00:01:23.520> draw<00:01:23.729> up

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
to point at the ground and then draw up

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.300 
to point at the ground and then draw up
but<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.110> put<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> lot<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.860> load<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.220> your

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
but you put a lot of load on your

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.370 
but you put a lot of load on your
shoulder<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.479> see<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> lot<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> people<00:01:28.110> with

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
shoulder and we see a lot of people with

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.649

damaged<00:01:28.820> damage<00:01:29.820> left<00:01:30.000> shoulders<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.540> it's

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
damaged damage left shoulders so it's

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.749 
damaged damage left shoulders so it's
much<00:01:30.840> best<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> keep<00:01:31.350> their<00:01:31.530> hands<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:32.520> above

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
