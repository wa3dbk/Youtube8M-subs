00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
mining so I've already found some

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.929 
mining so I've already found some
diamonds<00:00:16.500> let's<00:00:16.770> get<00:00:17.070> oh<00:00:18.050> I<00:00:19.279> guess<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.760> was

just a buck or something a glitch I

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.960 
just a buck or something a glitch I
guess

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
guess

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.210 
guess
oh<00:00:24.019> there's<00:00:25.019> more<00:00:25.260> diamonds<00:00:25.500> let's<00:00:26.010> get<00:00:26.189> them

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
oh there's more diamonds let's get them

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.659 
oh there's more diamonds let's get them
what<00:00:29.220> oh<00:00:30.740> I<00:00:31.740> guess<00:00:31.949> you're<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.250> unlucky

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
what oh I guess you're just unlucky

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:44.799 
what oh I guess you're just unlucky
today<00:00:36.320> what<00:00:38.149> what<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.300> this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.110> joke

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.440 

alright<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.379> I'm<00:00:46.770> pretty<00:00:47.100> bad<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.489> acting<00:00:47.850> but

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
alright so I'm pretty bad at acting but

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.420 
alright so I'm pretty bad at acting but
you<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.930> idea<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:49.829> I've<00:00:49.950> created<00:00:50.160> in

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
you get the idea so what I've created in

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.049 
you get the idea so what I've created in
Minecraft<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.410> diamonds<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:53.190> disappear

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
Minecraft is diamonds that disappear

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.139 
Minecraft is diamonds that disappear
when<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.300> get<00:00:54.539> too<00:00:54.750> close<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> them<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
when you get too close to them and

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.560 
when you get too close to them and
reappear<00:00:57.149> when<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.690> walk<00:00:57.870> away<00:00:58.020> from<00:00:58.199> them<00:00:59.570> so

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
reappear when you walk away from them so

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.410 
reappear when you walk away from them so
it<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.379> pretty<00:01:01.770> simple<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.670> now<00:01:03.000> let's<00:01:03.210> take<00:01:03.359> a

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
it is pretty simple and now let's take a

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.530 
it is pretty simple and now let's take a
look<00:01:03.539> at<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.809> redstone<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.299> one

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
look at the redstone so we have a one

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.870 
look at the redstone so we have a one
sec<00:01:06.780> walk<00:01:07.140> which<00:01:07.470> goes<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:08.010> tsutsu<00:01:08.490> command

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
sec walk which goes in tsutsu command

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.820 
sec walk which goes in tsutsu command
box<00:01:09.060> they<00:01:09.630> are<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.930> same<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
box they are the same just the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.570 
box they are the same just the
parameters<00:01:11.369> are<00:01:11.610> different<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.310> one

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
parameters are different so in this one

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.080 
parameters are different so in this one
we<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:15.119> tests<00:01:15.630> for<00:01:15.950> which<00:01:16.950> checks<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:17.549> all

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
we have tests for which checks for all

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.859 
we have tests for which checks for all
players<00:01:18.479> who<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.560> near<00:01:20.130> those<00:01:20.430> courage

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
players who are near those courage

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.149 
players who are near those courage
coordinates<00:01:21.869> within<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.530> radius<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.890> six<00:01:25.159> so

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
coordinates within the radius of six so

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.050 
coordinates within the radius of six so
I<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.430> actually<00:01:26.580> demonstrate<00:01:26.880> it<00:01:27.330> right<00:01:27.479> now

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.740 

so<00:01:33.060> look<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> comparator<00:01:35.329> so<00:01:36.329> right<00:01:36.509> now

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
so look at the comparator so right now

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.190 
so look at the comparator so right now
the<00:01:36.810> comparator<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:38.479> the<00:01:39.479> diamonds<00:01:39.990> are

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the comparator is on the diamonds are

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.420 
the comparator is on the diamonds are
missing<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:42.270> we<00:01:42.600> walk<00:01:42.840> away<00:01:42.869> or<00:01:43.439> far<00:01:44.310> away

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
missing and if we walk away or far away

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.929 
missing and if we walk away or far away
actually

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
actually

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539 
actually
The<00:01:45.149> Diamonds<00:01:45.329> appear<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.860> comparator

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
The Diamonds appear and the comparator

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.840 
The Diamonds appear and the comparator
turns<00:01:48.240> off<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.799> that's<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:52.850> what

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
turns off so that's that and what

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.870 
turns off so that's that and what
happens<00:01:54.210> next<00:01:54.479> is<00:01:54.840> those<00:01:55.560> free<00:01:56.189> command<00:01:56.670> box

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
happens next is those free command box

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.899 
happens next is those free command box
this<00:01:57.659> one<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.990> not<00:01:58.140> used<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.820> other

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
this one is not used and in the other

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.100 
this one is not used and in the other
case<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.869> for<00:02:01.560> command<00:02:01.920> box<00:02:02.600> each<00:02:03.600> command

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
case the for command box each command

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.260 
case the for command box each command
box<00:02:04.380> is<00:02:04.759> for<00:02:05.759> one<00:02:06.540> diamond<00:02:07.099> so<00:02:08.099> basically<00:02:09.060> what

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
box is for one diamond so basically what

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.809 
box is for one diamond so basically what
happens<00:02:09.569> here<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.709> we're<00:02:11.099> using<00:02:11.129> the<00:02:11.580> cell

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
happens here is we're using the cell

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.140 
happens here is we're using the cell
block

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
block

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.240 
block
command<00:02:12.629> to<00:02:13.110> set<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.680> diamond<00:02:14.159> to<00:02:14.900> stone<00:02:16.250> so

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
command to set the diamond to stone so

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.309 
command to set the diamond to stone so
those<00:02:17.610> are<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.940> coordinates<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.930> diamond

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
those are the coordinates of the diamond

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.960 
those are the coordinates of the diamond
ore<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:19.980> idea<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.060> stone<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:21.900> fun<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.970> we

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
ore and the idea of stone is fun and we

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.759 
ore and the idea of stone is fun and we
have<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.540> same<00:02:24.780> command<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.349> all<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.650> those

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
have the same command in all of those

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.119 
have the same command in all of those
command<00:02:26.190> blocks<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:27.440> now<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.500> have<00:02:28.860> a

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
command blocks and now you have a

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:34.789 
command blocks and now you have a
redstone<00:02:29.459> torch<00:02:29.900> which<00:02:30.900> goes<00:02:31.170> insert<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:33.799> so

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
redstone torch which goes insert this so

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.190 
redstone torch which goes insert this so
again<00:02:35.159> the<00:02:35.909> same<00:02:36.150> command<00:02:36.599> box<00:02:36.810> same

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
again the same command box same

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.339 
again the same command box same
coordinates<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.610> daddy<00:02:38.909> is<00:02:39.299> different<00:02:39.810> so

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
coordinates just daddy is different so

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.300 
coordinates just daddy is different so
now<00:02:40.680> we<00:02:41.040> set<00:02:41.489> them<00:02:41.849> stone<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:43.170> diamonds<00:02:43.560> so

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
now we set them stone to diamonds so

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.599 
now we set them stone to diamonds so
that's<00:02:44.549> pretty<00:02:44.730> simple<00:02:45.799> so<00:02:46.799> right<00:02:47.010> now<00:02:47.250> since

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:47.609 
that's pretty simple so right now since

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:50.000 
that's pretty simple so right now since
we're<00:02:47.849> not<00:02:48.030> within<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.959> radius<00:02:49.079> this<00:02:49.829> is

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
we're not within the radius this is

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.550 
we're not within the radius this is
activated<00:02:50.519> but<00:02:51.239> when<00:02:51.510> we<00:02:51.690> get<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.170> close<00:02:54.379> it<00:02:55.379> is

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
activated but when we get so close it is

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.979 
activated but when we get so close it is
