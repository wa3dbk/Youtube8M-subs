creatine there's a lot of talk out there
that<00:00:22.230> uh<00:00:22.260> if<00:00:22.740> you<00:00:23.160> consume<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:24.090> know<00:00:24.240> caffeine

that uh if you consume you know caffeine

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.630 
that uh if you consume you know caffeine
with<00:00:25.170> creatine<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.949> it's<00:00:26.519> gonna<00:00:26.960> lessen<00:00:28.640> the

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
with creatine that it's gonna lessen the

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.440 
with creatine that it's gonna lessen the
effects<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> creatine<00:00:31.040> now<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.520> did<00:00:33.090> some

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
effects of the creatine now I did some

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.500 
effects of the creatine now I did some
research<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.170> myself<00:00:34.710> you<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.520> finding

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
research on this myself you know finding

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.819 
research on this myself you know finding
studies<00:00:36.899> reading<00:00:37.079> up<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:37.380> stuff<00:00:37.620> on

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
studies reading up on stuff on

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.069 
studies reading up on stuff on
bodybuilding.com<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:39.000> wherever<00:00:39.809> there<00:00:39.960> was

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
bodybuilding.com and wherever there was

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.830 
bodybuilding.com and wherever there was
information<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.980> took<00:00:41.219> all<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.520> in<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.969> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
information and I took all that in and I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.619 
information and I took all that in and I
think<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.440> study<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.920> was<00:00:44.190> conducted<00:00:44.629> that

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
think the study that was conducted that

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.330 
think the study that was conducted that
shows<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.410> caffeine<00:00:46.860> has<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.160> negative

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
shows that caffeine has a negative

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.240 
shows that caffeine has a negative
effect<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.879> creatine<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.739> think<00:00:49.739> it's<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.950> flawed

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
effect on creatine I think it's a flawed

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.729 
effect on creatine I think it's a flawed
study<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:51.030> don't<00:00:51.870> know<00:00:52.079> how<00:00:52.289> much<00:00:52.440> caffeine

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
study I don't know how much caffeine

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.709 
study I don't know how much caffeine
these<00:00:53.070> people<00:00:53.430> are<00:00:53.489> drinking<00:00:54.149> while<00:00:54.539> he<00:00:54.629> was

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
these people are drinking while he was

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.400 
these people are drinking while he was
taking<00:00:54.840> creatine<00:00:55.140> but<00:00:55.699> caffeine<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:57.199> it<00:00:58.199> can

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
taking creatine but caffeine it it can

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.650 
taking creatine but caffeine it it can
be<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:58.559> diuretic<00:00:59.070> which<00:00:59.430> means<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.329> will<00:01:00.449> make

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
be a diuretic which means it will make

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.280 
be a diuretic which means it will make
you<00:01:00.780> excrete<00:01:01.170> more<00:01:01.289> water<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:03.049> think<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.140> got

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
you excrete more water I think you got

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.560 
you excrete more water I think you got
to<00:01:04.409> drink<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.710> whole<00:01:04.949> lot<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.369> caffeine<00:01:05.790> to

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
to drink a whole lot of caffeine to

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.219 
to drink a whole lot of caffeine to
become<00:01:07.350> dehydrated<00:01:08.030> but<00:01:09.030> that's<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:10.020> makes

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
become dehydrated but that's what makes

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.310 
become dehydrated but that's what makes
creatine<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:10.979> effective<00:01:11.520> creatine<00:01:12.299> once<00:01:13.229> you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
creatine so effective creatine once you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320 
creatine so effective creatine once you
get<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> saturate<00:01:14.100> into<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.430> muscle<00:01:14.820> what<00:01:15.240> it

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
get it saturate into the muscle what it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.770 
get it saturate into the muscle what it
does<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:16.189> it<00:01:17.189> brings<00:01:17.490> water<00:01:17.909> into<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> muscle

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
does is it brings water into the muscle

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.460 
does is it brings water into the muscle
which<00:01:19.530> increases<00:01:20.460> your<00:01:20.490> available<00:01:21.360> energy<00:01:21.869> in

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
which increases your available energy in

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.840 
which increases your available energy in
that<00:01:22.680> muscle<00:01:22.920> ATP<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.409> that<00:01:25.409> new<00:01:26.100> energy<00:01:26.400> that

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
that muscle ATP and that new energy that

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.340 
that muscle ATP and that new energy that
you<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.210> because<00:01:27.570> they're<00:01:27.720> cretins<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.259> your

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you have because they're cretins in your

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
you have because they're cretins in your
muscle<00:01:28.650> helps<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.189> lift<00:01:29.400> more<00:01:29.579> weight<00:01:29.790> do

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
muscle helps you lift more weight do

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.069 
muscle helps you lift more weight do
more<00:01:30.780> reps<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.920> study<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.720> kind<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.810> says

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
more reps and this study is kind of says

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.880 
more reps and this study is kind of says
that<00:01:34.409> well<00:01:34.740> caffeine<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.670> makes<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.650> as<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that well caffeine it makes you as a

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.429 
that well caffeine it makes you as a
diuretic<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.909> pushes<00:01:39.329> water<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.170> and

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
diuretic and it pushes water out and

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.929 
diuretic and it pushes water out and
when<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> does<00:01:41.189> that<00:01:41.400> you're<00:01:41.579> pushing<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
when it does that you're pushing the

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.170 
when it does that you're pushing the
creatine<00:01:42.329> out<00:01:42.509> with<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:43.159> now<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.820> all<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
creatine out with it now in all the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.850 
creatine out with it now in all the
years<00:01:45.240> I've<00:01:45.540> been<00:01:45.689> taking<00:01:45.990> creatine<00:01:46.200> not<00:01:46.619> I

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
years I've been taking creatine not I

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.210 
years I've been taking creatine not I
got<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.399> thing<00:01:47.700> for<00:01:47.729> dr.<00:01:48.600> cup<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:49.020> drink<00:01:49.470> it's

negative<00:02:00.570> effects<00:02:00.899> from<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.200> caffeine<00:02:01.759> as

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
negative effects from the caffeine as

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.940 
negative effects from the caffeine as
far<00:02:03.060> as<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.390> getting<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> creatine<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.860> my

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
that caffeine that's in that blackout

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.430 
that caffeine that's in that blackout
the<00:02:22.790> creatine<00:02:23.210> that<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.510> taste<00:02:23.750> take

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
the creatine that you taste take

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.560 
the creatine that you taste take
post-workout<00:02:25.040> first<00:02:25.820> of<00:02:25.940> all<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.060> don't<00:02:26.240> take

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
post-workout first of all I don't take

post-workout first of all I don't take
Jack<00:02:26.780> three<00:02:27.080> for<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.470> caffeine<00:02:27.860> content<00:02:28.070> I

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
Jack three for the caffeine content I

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.850 
Jack three for the caffeine content I
think<00:02:29.030> taking<00:02:29.420> creatine<00:02:30.050> before<00:02:30.350> you<00:02:30.560> workout

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
think taking creatine before you workout

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.160 
think taking creatine before you workout
as<00:02:31.070> a<00:02:31.100> waste<00:02:31.370> for<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.060> creatine<00:02:32.540> content<00:02:33.050> we

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
as a waste for the creatine content we

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.390 
as a waste for the creatine content we
don't<00:02:33.320> drink<00:02:33.470> jack<00:02:33.770> for<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.040> creatine

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
don't drink jack for the creatine

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.890 
don't drink jack for the creatine
content<00:02:34.880> right<00:02:35.030> we<00:02:35.330> take<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:35.690> for<00:02:35.840> the

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
content right we take it for the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.490 
content right we take it for the
stimulation

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
stimulation

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.090 
stimulation
yeah<00:02:36.740> so<00:02:37.070> I<00:02:37.310> take<00:02:38.060> my<00:02:38.090> creatine<00:02:38.720> product<00:02:39.320> post

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
yeah so I take my creatine product post

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.580 
yeah so I take my creatine product post
right<00:02:40.760> because<00:02:41.660> that's<00:02:41.780> when<00:02:41.990> your<00:02:42.140> muscles

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
right because that's when your muscles

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.780 
right because that's when your muscles
are<00:02:42.650> more<00:02:42.770> likely<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.160> absorb<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.760> right<00:02:44.000> and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
are more likely to absorb it right and

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.490 
are more likely to absorb it right and
use<00:02:46.790> it<00:02:47.030> as<00:02:47.120> about<00:02:47.360> an<00:02:47.480> hour<00:02:47.630> hour<00:02:47.960> and<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.320> half

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
use it as about an hour hour and a half

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.560 
use it as about an hour hour and a half
between<00:02:48.860> that<00:02:49.190> time<00:02:49.430> between<00:02:49.730> I've<00:02:50.030> taken<00:02:50.330> the

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
between that time between I've taken the

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.230 
between that time between I've taken the
jack<00:02:50.960> which<00:02:51.650> has<00:02:51.890> caffeine<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.370> it<00:02:52.610> too<00:02:53.060> when<00:02:53.180> I

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
jack which has caffeine in it too when I

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.330 
jack which has caffeine in it too when I
take<00:02:53.450> my<00:02:53.480> post-workout<00:02:53.870> and<00:02:54.410> I<00:02:54.920> haven't<00:02:55.190> had

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
take my post-workout and I haven't had

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.820 
take my post-workout and I haven't had
any<00:02:55.550> negative<00:02:55.730> effect<00:02:56.300> so<00:02:56.600> if<00:02:57.110> you<00:02:57.560> want<00:02:57.740> to

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
can do more reps in if more weight each

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.360 
can do more reps in if more weight each
and<00:03:07.880> every<00:03:08.030> time<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.210> cycle<00:03:08.660> on<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:08.990> off

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
only time that creatine is that could be

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.230 
only time that creatine is that could be
effective<00:03:14.480> is<00:03:15.050> if<00:03:15.260> your<00:03:15.470> body<00:03:15.710> is<00:03:15.890> dehydrated
