 as with every new call of duty and 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.660
 what they expected they will be 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.760
 served very proud that we propose a 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.400
 adventure at two eras in the years 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.960
 80 where we follow alex mason hero of the 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.670
 previous strand in the throes of the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.590
 cold war and in the future we 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 let's find David his son who will have strong 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.730
 to do with an ultra- tight atmosphere 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.930
 between two powers that are the states 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.579
 united and china 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.770
 you will also find the famous 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.870
 now indispensable zombie fashion which 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.579
 will reserve you some novelties there 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.230
 of course those who will hate this 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.270
 new call of duty and they have there too 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.830
 what to comment about the levels are from 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.420
 very uneven visual quality 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.580
 the artificial intelligence of the enemies 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.890
 is often non-existent and the gameplay 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.270
 does not bring big novelty it's 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.220
 so a certainty that lov duty black 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.570
 ops not leave anyone indifferent 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.580
 if you want to get an idea 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.710
 more accurate do not miss our test 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.350
 complete and we are waiting for your opinion on the game 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:27.149
 in the comments under the video he 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.950
 had sworn that crysis 3 would mark the 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.720
 end of a saga but it would seem good 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.520
 that the crytek studio is decided to 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.530
 continue to benefit from the success of his 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 fps for a few more years 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.729
 crysis 3 which will be released in February 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.679
 next to forget about 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.209
 the second episode a little disappointing 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.009
 they announce themselves excellent and we 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:45.690
 will help to find the progression in 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.319
 open world as on the first 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.810
 episode 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.789
 crytek is highly anticipated at the turning point 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.349
 the studio intends to continue to 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.360
 to make live his franchise the most 

00:01:52.349 --> 00:01:56.399
 prolific but we are warned he does not 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.869
 will not be a fourth episode can 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.250
 to be a spin off or an adventure 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.830
 parallel where we could find 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.580
 nomads what all the fans hope for in 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.990
 secret

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.020
 the moment set for February 2013 where we 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.910
 will discover new york buried under a 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:16.010
 dangerous young man and the adventurist 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.010
 will run on pc ps3 and xbox 360 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.290

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.140

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.160
 indispensable to allow a great 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.080

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.000
