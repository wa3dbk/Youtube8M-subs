show you I'm amazed this works and this

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.779 
show you I'm amazed this works and this
exists<00:00:18.859> so<00:00:19.859> what<00:00:20.130> we<00:00:20.279> have<00:00:20.460> today<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:21.230> vanilla

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
exists so what we have today is vanilla

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.330 
exists so what we have today is vanilla
nano<00:00:23.789> blocks<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:25.980> really

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
nano blocks and this is really really

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.929 
nano blocks and this is really really
cool

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
cool

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.370 
cool
so<00:00:27.570> over<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.529> we<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:29.179> Steve<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.630> I've

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
so over here we have Steve and I've

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.580 
so over here we have Steve and I've
built<00:00:31.949> him<00:00:32.420> to<00:00:33.420> kind<00:00:33.780> of<00:00:33.809> showcase<00:00:34.020> showcase

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
built him to kind of showcase showcase

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.040 
built him to kind of showcase showcase
this<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.520> kind<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.790> give<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.000> kind<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
this and to kind of give you kind of a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.100 
this and to kind of give you kind of a
comparison<00:00:37.590> from<00:00:38.579> what<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.910> normal<00:00:39.239> structure

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
comparison from what a normal structure

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.020 
comparison from what a normal structure
looks<00:00:40.350> like<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.980> nano<00:00:41.250> block<00:00:41.579> structure

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
looks like and a nano block structure

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.760 
looks like and a nano block structure
looks<00:00:42.180> like<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.690> when<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> further<00:00:43.379> adieu<00:00:43.620> let

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
looks like so when I further adieu let

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:53.660 
looks like so when I further adieu let
me<00:00:43.920> show<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.300> nano<00:00:45.660> blocks<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.860> here<00:00:53.460> is

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
me show you the nano blocks so here is

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.119 
me show you the nano blocks so here is
normal<00:00:54.329> see<00:00:54.480> if<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.899> nano<00:00:55.379> Steve<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.070> we

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
normal see if here is nano Steve so we

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
normal see if here is nano Steve so we
can<00:00:56.309> sort<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.550> okay<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> bit<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.989> we<00:00:58.050> can

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
can sort of okay I know a bit and we can

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.900 
can sort of okay I know a bit and we can
give<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.850> 360<00:00:59.850> it's<00:01:00.629> right<00:01:00.840> here<00:01:01.109> that's<00:01:01.910> see

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
give a 360 it's right here that's see

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.980 
give a 360 it's right here that's see
over<00:01:03.120> there<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:05.000> that<00:01:06.000> is<00:01:06.180> nano<00:01:06.390> Steve<00:01:06.689> these

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
over there and that is nano Steve these

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.910 
over there and that is nano Steve these
are<00:01:07.290> nano<00:01:07.500> blocks

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
are nano blocks

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.310 
are nano blocks
kind<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.280> give<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> comparison<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.390> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
kind of give you a comparison of the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:18.200 
kind of give you a comparison of the
size<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.040> person<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.640> as<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:17.939> they

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
size of a person so as you can see they

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.789 
size of a person so as you can see they
are<00:01:19.040> very<00:01:20.040> very<00:01:20.250> small<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:21.119> comparison<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
are very very small in comparison to

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.730 
are very very small in comparison to
regular<00:01:22.799> blocks<00:01:23.189> they're<00:01:23.430> actually<00:01:24.560> 1/16<00:01:25.560> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
regular blocks they're actually 1/16 the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.270 
regular blocks they're actually 1/16 the
size<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.460> regular<00:01:27.240> block<00:01:27.420> that's<00:01:28.320> nano

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
size or a regular block that's nano

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.289 
size or a regular block that's nano
blocks<00:01:29.990> so<00:01:31.009> how<00:01:32.009> do<00:01:32.070> these<00:01:32.220> work<00:01:32.280> because<00:01:33.060> it's

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
blocks so how do these work because it's

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.179 
blocks so how do these work because it's
actually<00:01:33.930> very<00:01:34.530> very<00:01:34.650> simple

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
actually very very simple

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.700 
actually very very simple
um<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.540> could<00:01:36.689> show<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.869> how<00:01:36.960> they<00:01:37.110> work<00:01:37.259> by

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
um and I could show you how they work by

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.920 
um and I could show you how they work by
going<00:01:37.860> into<00:01:38.159> game<00:01:38.310> mode<00:01:38.340> 3<00:01:41.360> so<00:01:42.360> as<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.750> can<00:01:42.869> see

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
going into game mode 3 so as you can see

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.080 
going into game mode 3 so as you can see
faintly<00:01:44.720> this<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.409> villager<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.579> baby

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
faintly this is a villager a baby

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.999 
faintly this is a villager a baby
villager<00:01:48.600> with<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.259> block<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.470> its<00:01:49.680> head<00:01:49.829> it's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
villager with a block on its head it's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.649 
villager with a block on its head it's
quite<00:01:50.460> simply<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.630> so<00:01:52.590> um<00:01:53.000> in<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.540> of

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
quite simply just that so um in one of

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.480 
quite simply just that so um in one of
the<00:01:54.840> recent<00:01:55.020> snapshots<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:58.619> blocks<00:01:59.040> can<00:01:59.280> now

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the recent snapshots the blocks can now

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.920 
the recent snapshots the blocks can now
be<00:01:59.579> placed<00:01:59.729> on<00:02:00.710> mob<00:02:01.710> heads<00:02:02.060> via<00:02:03.060> replace<00:02:03.509> item

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
be placed on mob heads via replace item

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.169 
be placed on mob heads via replace item
and<00:02:04.579> as<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:06.719> happens<00:02:07.819> blocks<00:02:08.819> can<00:02:09.119> be

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and as it so happens blocks can be

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.059 
and as it so happens blocks can be
placed<00:02:09.390> on<00:02:09.539> villagers<00:02:09.929> heads<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.830> because

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
placed on villagers heads and because

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.860 
placed on villagers heads and because
villages<00:02:11.459> have<00:02:11.670> baby<00:02:11.879> villages

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
villages have baby villages

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.690 
villages have baby villages
you<00:02:13.019> can<00:02:13.140> place<00:02:13.290> blocks<00:02:13.409> in<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.709> heads<00:02:13.950> for

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
you can place blocks in the heads for

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.309 
you can place blocks in the heads for
some<00:02:14.849> reason<00:02:15.180> they<00:02:15.360> scale<00:02:15.750> down<00:02:16.049> they<00:02:16.230> don't

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
some reason they scale down they don't

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.750 
some reason they scale down they don't
scale<00:02:16.590> down<00:02:16.769> on<00:02:16.920> things<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.129> baby<00:02:17.340> zombies

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
scale down on things like baby zombies

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.430 
scale down on things like baby zombies
but<00:02:17.940> some<00:02:18.150> reason<00:02:18.269> they<00:02:18.480> spout<00:02:18.720> down<00:02:18.930> on<00:02:19.200> baby

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
but some reason they spout down on baby

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.130 
but some reason they spout down on baby
villages<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.069> we<00:02:20.790> get<00:02:21.000> these<00:02:21.299> tiny<00:02:21.989> little

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
villages and we get these tiny little

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.729 
villages and we get these tiny little
nano<00:02:22.920> blocks<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> actually<00:02:25.349> get<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.680> to

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
nano blocks so to actually get it to

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.130 
nano blocks so to actually get it to
work<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.819> still<00:02:26.940> quite<00:02:27.299> simple<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:27.870> there

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
work it's still quite simple but there

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.479 
work it's still quite simple but there
are<00:02:28.290> some<00:02:28.560> things<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.920> need<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.129> take<00:02:29.310> into

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
are some things you need to take into

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.460 
are some things you need to take into
mind<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:30.030> first<00:02:30.390> off<00:02:30.629> we<00:02:30.930> need<00:02:31.049> to<00:02:31.140> do<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.349> you

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
mind so first off we need to do is you

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.589 
mind so first off we need to do is you
need<00:02:31.620> to<00:02:31.680> obviously<00:02:31.769> summon<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
need to obviously summon the the

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.569 
need to obviously summon the the
villager<00:02:33.959> each<00:02:34.440> needs<00:02:34.709> some<00:02:34.890> own<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.159> villager

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
villager each needs some own a villager

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.170 
villager each needs some own a villager
it<00:02:35.760> needs<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.150> be<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.629> baby<00:02:37.440> villager<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.190> needs

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
it needs to be a baby villager and needs

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.420 
it needs to be a baby villager and needs
to<00:02:39.209> be<00:02:39.269> invulnerable<00:02:39.690> just<00:02:40.290> for<00:02:40.440> things<00:02:40.650> and

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
to be invulnerable just for things and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.460 
to be invulnerable just for things and
it<00:02:41.700> should<00:02:41.819> also<00:02:42.000> be<00:02:42.150> riding<00:02:42.690> a<00:02:42.870> wither<00:02:43.110> skull

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
it should also be riding a wither skull

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.890 
it should also be riding a wither skull
now<00:02:44.190> he's<00:02:44.849> riding<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.239> wither<00:02:45.420> skull<00:02:45.720> for

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
now he's riding a wither skull for

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.170 
now he's riding a wither skull for
various<00:02:46.170> reasons<00:02:46.590> one<00:02:47.489> of<00:02:47.519> those<00:02:47.700> things<00:02:47.910> is

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
various reasons one of those things is

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.460 
various reasons one of those things is
so<00:02:48.359> that<00:02:48.480> he<00:02:48.540> doesn't<00:02:48.750> run<00:02:48.840> around<00:02:49.970> but<00:02:51.470> once

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
so that he doesn't run around but once

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.599 
so that he doesn't run around but once
you've<00:02:52.560> summoned<00:02:52.769> him<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.220> want<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.489> just

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
you've summoned him you want to just

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.729 
you've summoned him you want to just
give<00:02:53.819> him<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.390> block<00:02:55.170> that<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.440> want<00:02:55.590> to

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
give him the block that you want to

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.399 
give him the block that you want to
miniaturize<00:02:57.140> via<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.379> base<00:02:59.340> item<00:02:59.579> command

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:00.409 
miniaturize via the base item command

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.899 
miniaturize via the base item command
but<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.470> thing<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.650> is<00:03:02.069> that<00:03:02.129> even<00:03:02.609> if<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.790> do

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:02.909 
but the thing is is that even if you do

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:05.720 
but the thing is is that even if you do
all<00:03:03.030> these<00:03:03.590> villages<00:03:04.590> or<00:03:04.890> any<00:03:05.159> entity<00:03:05.370> really

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
all these villages or any entity really

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.979 
all these villages or any entity really
has<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.209> annoying<00:03:08.120> habit<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.299> turning

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
has this annoying habit of turning

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.140 
has this annoying habit of turning
around<00:03:10.319> so<00:03:10.920> you<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.280> actually<00:03:11.370> immobilize

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
around so you can actually immobilize

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.819 
around so you can actually immobilize
them<00:03:12.359> but<00:03:12.510> they'll<00:03:12.629> still<00:03:12.780> turn<00:03:13.049> on<00:03:13.200> spot<00:03:13.530> turn

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
them but they'll still turn on spot turn

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.250 
them but they'll still turn on spot turn
ahead<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.659> that's<00:03:15.659> not<00:03:15.870> what<00:03:15.989> we<00:03:16.079> want

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
ahead and that's not what we want

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.720 
ahead and that's not what we want
because<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.560> needs<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.799> look<00:03:17.069> like<00:03:17.280> a<00:03:17.310> static

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
because it needs to look like a static

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.080 
because it needs to look like a static
block<00:03:18.319> so<00:03:19.319> just<00:03:20.069> stop<00:03:20.340> them<00:03:20.639> from<00:03:20.730> looking

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
block so just stop them from looking

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.449 
block so just stop them from looking
around<00:03:21.180> all<00:03:21.599> you<00:03:21.690> have<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.900> do<00:03:22.099> is<00:03:23.099> you<00:03:23.280> have<00:03:23.430> to

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
around all you have to do is you have to

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.569 
around all you have to do is you have to
teleport<00:03:24.120> them<00:03:24.359> about<00:03:25.169> 100<00:03:25.560> blocks<00:03:25.769> in<00:03:26.220> a

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
teleport them about 100 blocks in a

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.490 
teleport them about 100 blocks in a
direction<00:03:27.000> so<00:03:27.150> I'm<00:03:27.269> using<00:03:27.419> a<00:03:27.870> hundred

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
direction so I'm using a hundred

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.900 
direction so I'm using a hundred
positive<00:03:29.280> X<00:03:29.629> so<00:03:30.769> use<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.919> command<00:03:32.160> on<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.489> very

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
positive X so use that command on a very

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.050 
positive X so use that command on a very
very<00:03:33.090> fast<00:03:33.329> clock<00:03:33.599> so<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> fill<00:03:34.440> clock<00:03:34.739> or<00:03:35.040> a<00:03:35.099> set

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
very fast clock so a fill clock or a set

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.069 
very fast clock so a fill clock or a set
block<00:03:36.209> look<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:38.660> basically<00:03:39.660> that<00:03:39.900> will

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
block look and basically that will

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.229 
block look and basically that will
prevent<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.829> entity<00:03:41.190> from<00:03:41.519> moving<00:03:41.940> its<00:03:42.060> head

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
prevent the entity from moving its head

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.240 
prevent the entity from moving its head
spinning<00:03:43.079> around<00:03:43.139> and<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:43.680> will<00:03:43.769> just<00:03:43.919> look

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
spinning around and it will just look

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.089 
spinning around and it will just look
straight<00:03:45.000> on<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.480> just<00:03:45.780> act<00:03:46.230> it<00:03:46.500> as<00:03:46.680> if<00:03:46.949> it's

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 
straight on and just act it as if it's

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:50.420 
straight on and just act it as if it's
frozen<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.780> really<00:03:49.169> that's<00:03:49.319> all<00:03:49.739> there<00:03:50.099> is<00:03:50.129> to

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
frozen and really that's all there is to

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.710 
frozen and really that's all there is to
it<00:03:50.579> it's<00:03:50.760> really<00:03:51.389> really<00:03:51.629> really<00:03:52.169> simple<00:03:52.489> and

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
it it's really really really simple and

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.330 
it it's really really really simple and
it<00:03:54.720> was<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.199> was<00:03:55.230> not<00:03:55.530> possible<00:03:55.709> before

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
it was it was not possible before

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.819 
it was it was not possible before
baby<00:03:57.090> villagers<00:03:57.510> had<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:58.410> ability<00:03:58.590> to

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
baby villagers had the the ability to

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.250 
baby villagers had the the ability to
wear<00:03:59.699> blocks<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.090> head<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:00.449> it's<00:04:00.900> pretty<00:04:01.019> no

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
wear blocks and a head so it's pretty no

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.439 
wear blocks and a head so it's pretty no
it's<00:04:01.410> pretty<00:04:01.650> cool<00:04:02.000> there<00:04:03.000> are<00:04:03.120> actually<00:04:03.359> some

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
it's pretty cool there are actually some

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:05.330 
it's pretty cool there are actually some
things<00:04:03.510> I<00:04:03.810> need<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:03.959> mention<00:04:04.199> though<00:04:04.319> so<00:04:04.739> there

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
things I need to mention though so there

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.470 
things I need to mention though so there
is<00:04:05.430> actually<00:04:05.639> a<00:04:05.819> little<00:04:06.000> bit<00:04:06.239> of<00:04:06.269> an<00:04:06.359> issue

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
is actually a little bit of an issue

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.780 
is actually a little bit of an issue
with<00:04:06.930> double<00:04:07.739> planing<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.430> believe<00:04:08.639> it's

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
with double planing I believe it's

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.610 
with double planing I believe it's
called<00:04:08.940> so<00:04:09.209> as<00:04:09.269> you<00:04:09.329> can<00:04:09.419> see<00:04:09.660> if<00:04:10.019> I<00:04:10.139> get<00:04:10.319> really

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
called so as you can see if I get really

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.110 
called so as you can see if I get really
close<00:04:10.829> you<00:04:10.889> can<00:04:11.160> see<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.579> some<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:12.030> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
close you can see that some of the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.039 
close you can see that some of the
blocks<00:04:12.329> actually<00:04:13.190> overlap<00:04:14.190> one<00:04:14.430> another<00:04:15.049> and

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
blocks actually overlap one another and

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.140 
blocks actually overlap one another and
the<00:04:17.010> reason<00:04:17.400> that's<00:04:17.489> happening<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.120> because

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
the reason that's happening is because

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:21.020 
the reason that's happening is because
ever<00:04:18.630> mentioned<00:04:19.049> they<00:04:19.139> are<00:04:19.579> 1/16<00:04:20.579> of<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.849> size

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
ever mentioned they are 1/16 of the size

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:23.180 
ever mentioned they are 1/16 of the size
of<00:04:21.090> a<00:04:21.180> block<00:04:21.390> but<00:04:21.810> they're<00:04:22.019> not<00:04:22.500> quite<00:04:22.950> they're

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
of a block but they're not quite they're

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.710 
of a block but they're not quite they're
a<00:04:23.219> little<00:04:23.430> bit<00:04:23.669> bigger<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.150> because<00:04:24.599> of<00:04:24.630> that

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
a little bit bigger and because of that

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.580 
a little bit bigger and because of that
you<00:04:25.930> get<00:04:26.110> this<00:04:26.230> painting<00:04:26.530> issue<00:04:26.770> so<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.990> when

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
you get this painting issue so and when

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.530 
you get this painting issue so and when
you<00:04:29.680> use<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:30.010> on<00:04:30.130> blocks<00:04:30.790> off<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.150> same<00:04:31.330> type

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
you use it on blocks off the same type

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.060 
you use it on blocks off the same type
or<00:04:31.750> similar<00:04:32.020> color<00:04:32.170> you<00:04:32.320> can't<00:04:32.560> really<00:04:32.800> see

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
or similar color you can't really see

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.670 
or similar color you can't really see
her<00:04:33.220> till<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:33.670> get<00:04:34.240> really<00:04:34.480> really<00:04:34.570> close<00:04:34.870> but

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
her till you get really really close but

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.800 
her till you get really really close but
you<00:04:36.160> know<00:04:36.280> on<00:04:36.460> blocks<00:04:36.760> that<00:04:37.000> contrast<00:04:37.540> so

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
you know on blocks that contrast so

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.470 
you know on blocks that contrast so
black<00:04:38.140> like<00:04:39.070> pink<00:04:39.370> and<00:04:39.490> white<00:04:39.700> you<00:04:40.210> can<00:04:40.240> kind

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
black like pink and white you can kind

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.720 
black like pink and white you can kind
of<00:04:40.570> see<00:04:40.750> it<00:04:40.840> quite<00:04:41.080> obviously<00:04:41.710> so<00:04:42.070> take<00:04:42.550> that

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
of see it quite obviously so take that

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.200 
of see it quite obviously so take that
into<00:04:43.060> into<00:04:43.750> consideration<00:04:44.350> and<00:04:44.530> again<00:04:45.370> these

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
into into consideration and again these

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.030 
into into consideration and again these
are<00:04:46.510> entities<00:04:46.660> so<00:04:47.170> if<00:04:47.230> I<00:04:47.290> press<00:04:47.380> f3<00:04:47.680> you<00:04:47.920> can

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:48.040 
are entities so if I press f3 you can

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.520 
are entities so if I press f3 you can
see<00:04:48.190> I<00:04:48.220> actually<00:04:48.400> have<00:04:48.810> 240<00:04:49.810> entities<00:04:50.200> on<00:04:50.440> the

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530
