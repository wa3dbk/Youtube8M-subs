00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.720
 I will play all this slowly 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.720
 from measure 7 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.320
 e 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.560
 m 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.560
 or 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 we 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.670
 or 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.820
 my 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.670
 1 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.100
 there we see the last measure that I have 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:54.260
 played so measure 18 there is a written 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.930
 on it and that the 1 to say to say that 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.730
 this is the first time I pass I 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.200
 so play this measure after I have the 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:07.670
 two signs of repetition that means 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:09.320
 that after that I come back here what it takes 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.380
 be careful this is exactly what 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.210
 passage after the 1 so I think of you 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.360
 watch I play the rope empty 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.280
 alas if I remove the nuts in place and 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.280
 already here I'm doing 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.670
 but I have two men in fact nantes 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.510
 empty where I can move 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.330
 Yes 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.660
 you train like that 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.660
 and then 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.130
 and again when I ask watch 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.850
 I already want to put his two fingers in 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.570
 okay I do not need to ask 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.710
 the first one I have a little more time 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.530
 but there you see after the cry mallet 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.780
 2 and the 2 actually means that the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.490
 second time once I repeated 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:05.110
 once that manage that and that I come to 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.939
 measure 17 instead of passing my the 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.939
 number one I do not pass the number 2 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:18.890
 so here I pushed my 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:25.300
 pushes on the 3rd hoist to the second 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.300
 and on the first shoot sprout 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:34.269
 if you decide to start with here 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.230
 inches but a little problem because of 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.840
 anyway once you have 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.370
 practiced a lot you alternate 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.989
 so if you start with m after that 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.400
 you tarnished with who you can 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.230
 practice just like that it's by 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:48.960
 example east of port david if I play 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.590
 or 6 inches tempo 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.490
 just like that 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.300
 we 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.300
 or 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.939
 okay and after there is the second 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.769
 thing too when you play for example 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:04.250
 on the 3rd string series here so I 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:08.689
 starts the third string and second 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.290
 body and who could even think that 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.290
 can take each 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.719
 measures like bag look a little bit 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.659
 right hand and just practice the hand 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:20.640
 right very good practices and I hope 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:24.079
 that you can the toy has a good 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.079
 speed then started like that 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.510
 and we do with a metronome you 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:36.260
 increase little by little and maybe the 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:38.480
 good speed I'm reading a very thing 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.530
 important to actually is the melody 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.580
 yes the mi6 the bed must be very very 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.580
 sweet look it's not 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.010
 because the melody is there 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:08.639
 yesterday that it's from nantes I 'm doing them 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:08.639
 gently thing here 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.960
 dance 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.209
 thank you 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.880
 we do not know 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.000
 there we understand more where is the melody 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.770
 okay it's really important so 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.889
 the important thing now is not 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.789
 exaggerate not make any effort that but 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.789
 very sweet there 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.260
 and plays very very slowly but that 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.930
 it's a little hard but with the usual 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.730
 you will see it will come very well and 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.250
 another thing too is to try 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:55.050
 sometimes water actually increased volume 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.350
 and so if I start off largely I 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.350
 down 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.360
 more interesting stone if I play 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.360
 always 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:07.679
 godmother by so played to the world 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.790
 people from here 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.680
 sometimes I go up a little bit at last 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.140
 go down in that's your choice in 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.970
 done but it's really important it's 

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.410
 all ours makes us with whom she 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.370
 to do them gently and that's why 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.690
 that it's very good to practice until 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.690
 a place for example 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.150
 if you do 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.260
 emma 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.530
 no now I have to do very 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.530
 slowly 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.100
 you exaggerate even if you can not hear anything 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.080
 it does not matter 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.060
 do not be scared you are going to ride two 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.320
 others not 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.050
 until it's really 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.400
 perfect 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.400
 ah good practices
