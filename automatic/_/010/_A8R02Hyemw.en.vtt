00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.910 
like better and some advantages and
disadvantages<00:00:18.090> over<00:00:18.449> each<00:00:18.570> other<00:00:18.810> first<00:00:19.740> time

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
disadvantages over each other first time

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.230 
disadvantages over each other first time
I<00:00:19.949> started<00:00:20.250> talking<00:00:20.580> about<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> otterbox

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
I started talking about the otterbox

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.880 
I started talking about the otterbox
armor<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.779> price<00:00:21.990> point<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.500> otterbox

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
armor the price point of the otterbox

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.130 
armor the price point of the otterbox
armor<00:00:23.130> is<00:00:23.519> about<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> hundred<00:00:24.240> dollars<00:00:24.900> that's

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
armor is about a hundred dollars that's

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.519 
armor is about a hundred dollars that's
retail<00:00:25.680> onion<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.849> at<00:00:27.029> eighty<00:00:27.480> or<00:00:28.050> their

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
retail onion get it at eighty or their

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.380 
retail onion get it at eighty or their
website<00:00:29.039> like<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.699> said<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.119> hundred

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
website like I said for a hundred

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.540 
website like I said for a hundred
dollars<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.289> crush<00:00:31.740> proof<00:00:32.040> waterproof

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
dollars this is a crush proof waterproof

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.690 
dollars this is a crush proof waterproof
dustproof<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.960> dirt<00:00:34.350> proof<00:00:34.590> case<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.550> the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
dustproof and dirt proof case so the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.389 
dustproof and dirt proof case so the
crush<00:00:35.910> proof<00:00:36.149> feature<00:00:36.450> adds<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.170> extra<00:00:37.399> let's

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
crush proof feature adds the extra let's

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.209 
crush proof feature adds the extra let's
see<00:00:38.780> twenty<00:00:39.780> dollars<00:00:40.170> compared<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.770> lifeproof

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
see twenty dollars compared to lifeproof

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.709 
see twenty dollars compared to lifeproof
which<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.579> eighty<00:00:41.790> dollars<00:00:42.149> I'll<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.690> that

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
which is eighty dollars I'll get to that

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.770 
which is eighty dollars I'll get to that
later<00:00:42.950> um<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> otterbox<00:00:45.030> armor<00:00:45.239> comes<00:00:45.629> in

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
later um so the otterbox armor comes in

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.810 
later um so the otterbox armor comes in
three<00:00:46.050> different<00:00:46.079> colors<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:47.370> is<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> white

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
three different colors this is the white

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
three different colors this is the white
and<00:00:48.000> blue<00:00:48.210> version<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.350> there's<00:00:49.620> a

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and blue version and then there's a

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.350 
and blue version and then there's a
black<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.430> orange<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.090> there's<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
black and orange and then there's a

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060 
black and orange and then there's a
black<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.750> green<00:00:51.960> which<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.680> nice<00:00:52.860> because

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
black and green which is nice because

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.770 
black and green which is nice because
there's<00:00:53.340> some<00:00:53.489> variety<00:00:53.969> instead<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.539> one

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
there's some variety instead of just one

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.340 
there's some variety instead of just one
color<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:56.039> might<00:00:56.399> not<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:57.199> so<00:00:58.199> that's

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
color that you might not like so that's

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.830 
color that you might not like so that's
really<00:00:58.680> nice<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.129> then<00:00:59.579> also<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.449> very

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
really nice and then also it's a very

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.209 
really nice and then also it's a very
bulky<00:01:01.199> case<00:01:01.559> that's<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.129> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
bulky case that's one of the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.299 
bulky case that's one of the
disadvantages<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.860> if<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.100> don't<00:01:05.189> like

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
disadvantages to it so if you don't like

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
disadvantages to it so if you don't like
vulc<00:01:05.700> you're<00:01:06.240> definitely<00:01:06.510> not<00:01:06.750> going<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.020> like

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
vulc you're definitely not going to like

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
vulc you're definitely not going to like
this<00:01:07.320> case<00:01:07.590> because<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.549> makes<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:08.850> phone

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
this case because it it makes your phone

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.030 
this case because it it makes your phone
probably<00:01:09.420> way<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> don't<00:01:10.020> know<00:01:10.140> three<00:01:10.830> times

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
probably way I don't know three times

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.310 
probably way I don't know three times
heavier<00:01:11.280> than<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.909> when<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:13.200> by

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
heavier than it is when it's just by

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.140 
heavier than it is when it's just by
itself<00:01:13.650> or<00:01:13.920> maybe<00:01:14.189> even<00:01:14.310> more<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:14.820> not<00:01:15.000> really

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
itself or maybe even more I'm not really

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300 
itself or maybe even more I'm not really
sure<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.750> never<00:01:15.990> carry<00:01:16.710> my<00:01:16.890> phone<00:01:17.070> by

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
sure because I never carry my phone by

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.940 
sure because I never carry my phone by
itself<00:01:17.549> I<00:01:17.759> always<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> case<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.950> but

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
itself I always have a case on it but

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.800 
itself I always have a case on it but
it's<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.280> nice<00:01:20.460> case<00:01:20.820> i'm<00:01:21.119> like<00:01:21.540> i<00:01:21.630> said

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
it's a really nice case i'm like i said

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.810 
it's a really nice case i'm like i said
is<00:01:21.900> waterproof<00:01:22.259> so<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.490> nice<00:01:23.610> feature

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
is waterproof so that's a nice feature

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.789 
is waterproof so that's a nice feature
crushproof<00:01:24.270> also<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.470> if<00:01:25.530> you're<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
crushproof also so if you're in the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.080 
crushproof also so if you're in the
construction<00:01:26.220> business<00:01:26.400> if<00:01:26.939> you're<00:01:27.060> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
construction business if you're a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.609 
construction business if you're a
construction<00:01:27.689> worker<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.140> would<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.409> nice

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
construction worker this would be a nice

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.039 
construction worker this would be a nice
case<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.700> case<00:01:29.729> like<00:01:30.150> something<00:01:30.720> ran<00:01:30.869> it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
case just in case like something ran it

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.260 
case just in case like something ran it
over<00:01:31.170> like<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> truck<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> construction

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
over like a truck or a construction

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
over like a truck or a construction
thing<00:01:33.509> because<00:01:34.350> it's<00:01:34.500> probably<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:34.950> be

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
thing because it's probably going to be

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.710 
thing because it's probably going to be
working<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.430> dirt<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.939> it'll<00:01:36.060> be<00:01:36.090> like<00:01:36.180> kind<00:01:36.689> of

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
working on dirt so it'll be like kind of

probably two times skinnier this is two
times<00:02:38.810> thicker<00:02:39.050> so<00:02:39.950> that's<00:02:40.130> really<00:02:40.250> nice<00:02:40.489> it
