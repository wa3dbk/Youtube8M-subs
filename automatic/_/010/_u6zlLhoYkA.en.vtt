00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
anyway on the back here pi clip

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.800 
anyway on the back here pi clip
the<00:02:30.110> pocket<00:02:30.740> clip<00:02:30.890> is<00:02:31.130> not<00:02:31.520> reversible<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.690> is

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
the pocket clip is not reversible it is

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.780 
the pocket clip is not reversible it is

only right side right hand carry tip

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.780 
only right side right hand carry tip
down<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.470> it<00:02:39.740> doesn't<00:02:39.770> give<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.250> much<00:02:40.280> options

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
down so it doesn't give you much options

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.140

to relocate the pocket clip has to stay

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.540 
to relocate the pocket clip has to stay
right<00:02:46.640> there<00:02:47.500> even<00:02:48.500> though<00:02:48.620> that<00:02:48.920> is

that<00:03:53.989> I<00:03:54.230> have<00:03:55.130> mine<00:03:55.340> sep<00:03:55.670> so<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.269> has<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.690> little

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
that I have mine sep so it has a little

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.190 
that I have mine sep so it has a little
bit<00:03:57.050> of<00:03:57.110> resistance<00:03:57.940> so<00:03:58.940> it's<00:03:59.090> not<00:03:59.480> overly

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
bit of resistance so it's not overly

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.460 
bit of resistance so it's not overly
smooth<00:04:00.910> and<00:04:01.910> that's<00:04:02.570> just<00:04:02.810> my<00:04:02.900> preference<00:04:03.170> for

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
smooth and that's just my preference for

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.240 
smooth and that's just my preference for
this<00:04:03.620> specific<00:04:04.220> knife<00:04:05.080> but<00:04:06.080> you<00:04:06.380> can<00:04:06.590> adjust

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
this specific knife but you can adjust

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.650 
this specific knife but you can adjust
it<00:04:07.430> if<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.610> wanted<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:09.340> there<00:04:10.340> is<00:04:10.519> a<00:04:10.790> back

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
it if you wanted to there is a back

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.240 
it if you wanted to there is a back
spacer<00:04:12.049> here<00:04:12.340> plastic<00:04:13.340> or<00:04:13.489> FRN<00:04:13.850> backspacer<00:04:15.250> it

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
spacer here plastic or FRN backspacer it

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:17.830 
spacer here plastic or FRN backspacer it
would<00:04:16.430> have<00:04:16.519> been<00:04:16.580> nice<00:04:16.790> if<00:04:17.060> they<00:04:17.180> may<00:04:17.479> made<00:04:17.720> it

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
would have been nice if they may made it

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.860

a<00:04:20.989> little<00:04:21.500> easier<00:04:21.830> clean<00:04:22.840> but<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.229> overall

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
a little easier clean but the overall

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.810 
a little easier clean but the overall
look<00:04:24.770> with<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.610> spacer<00:04:26.030> is<00:04:26.990> pretty<00:04:27.320> good<00:04:27.820> it
