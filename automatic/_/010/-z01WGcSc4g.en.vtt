00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.740 
four singles 3v3 and I'm also going to
be<00:01:19.920> doing<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.159> single<00:01:20.490> 6v6<00:01:20.790> option<00:01:21.390> for<00:01:21.570> those

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
be doing a single 6v6 option for those

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.080 
be doing a single 6v6 option for those
you<00:01:21.930> guys<00:01:22.049> who<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.320> 66<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.670> rotation

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
you guys who like 66 and I like rotation

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.850 
you guys who like 66 and I like rotation
battles<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.869> if<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.080> want<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.350> rotation

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
battles so if you want to do rotation

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.910 
battles so if you want to do rotation
i'm<00:01:26.009> thinking<00:01:26.670> maybe<00:01:27.570> four<00:01:27.990> before<00:01:28.140> rotations

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
i'm thinking maybe four before rotations

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.760 
i'm thinking maybe four before rotations
baby<00:01:29.310> like<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.970> think<00:01:30.540> 6v6<00:01:31.049> might<00:01:31.409> be<00:01:31.500> too<00:01:31.650> long

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
baby like I think 6v6 might be too long

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
baby like I think 6v6 might be too long
because<00:01:31.950> there's<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.189> like<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.490> lot<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
because there's just like a lot of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.550 
because there's just like a lot of
craziness<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.540> with<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.869> so<00:01:34.320> maybe<00:01:34.470> for

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
craziness going on with it so maybe for

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.350 
craziness going on with it so maybe for
view<00:01:34.829> for<00:01:34.979> rotation<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.820> submit<00:01:36.119> all

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360
