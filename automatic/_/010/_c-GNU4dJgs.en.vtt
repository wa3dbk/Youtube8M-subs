with<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> modern<00:01:21.659> game<00:01:21.810> play<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> this<00:01:23.100> is

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
with the modern game play and this is

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.609 
with the modern game play and this is
pretty<00:01:23.549> much<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:24.119> except<00:01:25.049> even<00:01:25.320> better

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
pretty much it except even better

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.890

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
Leon is obviously going to protect the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.760 
Leon is obviously going to protect the
president's<00:02:19.160> daughter<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:20.110> Chris<00:02:21.110> seems<00:02:21.470> to

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
president's daughter and Chris seems to

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.020 
president's daughter and Chris seems to
hate<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.220> president's<00:02:22.790> daughter<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:25.030> looks

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
hate the president's daughter so I looks

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.880 
hate the president's daughter so I looks
like<00:02:26.120> all-american<00:02:26.480> man's<00:02:27.410> going<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.770> go

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
like all-american man's going to go

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.400 
like all-american man's going to go
after<00:02:28.510> emo<00:02:29.510> boy<00:02:29.720> guess<00:02:29.960> you<00:02:30.050> could<00:02:30.200> call<00:02:30.350> them

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
after emo boy guess you could call them

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.990 
after emo boy guess you could call them
so<00:02:30.890> it's<00:02:31.040> going<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.220> be<00:02:31.370> awesome<00:02:31.550> if<00:02:31.850> they

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
so it's going to be awesome if they

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.150 
so it's going to be awesome if they
actually<00:02:32.150> do<00:02:32.480> fight<00:02:32.750> now<00:02:33.080> I'm<00:02:33.500> hoping<00:02:33.830> Leon

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
actually do fight now I'm hoping Leon

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.580 
actually do fight now I'm hoping Leon
doesn't<00:02:34.340> lose<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.510> think<00:02:36.200> they'll<00:02:36.380> end<00:02:36.500> up

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
doesn't lose but I think they'll end up

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.050 
doesn't lose but I think they'll end up
working<00:02:36.800> together<00:02:37.010> because<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.850> would<00:02:37.940> be

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
working together because that would be

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.550 
working together because that would be
stupid<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:38.630> they<00:02:38.690> fought<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.200> killed<00:02:39.350> each

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
stupid if they fought and killed each

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.010 
stupid if they fought and killed each
other<00:02:39.710> you<00:02:39.950> know<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:41.480> hopefully<00:02:41.810> we'll<00:02:41.960> see

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
other you know so hopefully we'll see

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.960 
other you know so hopefully we'll see
some<00:02:42.200> other<00:02:42.530> familiar<00:02:42.800> faces<00:02:43.070> I'm<00:02:43.940> guessing

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
some other familiar faces I'm guessing

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.910 
some other familiar faces I'm guessing
Ada<00:02:44.480> Wong<00:02:44.630> is<00:02:45.020> gonna<00:02:45.200> be<00:02:45.290> back<00:02:45.470> as<00:02:45.650> well

Ada Wong is gonna be back as well

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.060 
Ada Wong is gonna be back as well

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
because wherever Leon is she is their

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.280 
because wherever Leon is she is their
kind<00:02:49.250> of<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.760> know<00:02:49.790> they<00:02:50.510> kind<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:50.960> like<00:02:51.110> each

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
is going to be in it I don't know who

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.500 
is going to be in it I don't know who
that<00:03:48.290> is<00:03:48.470> at<00:03:48.739> first<00:03:48.860> I<00:03:49.070> thought<00:03:49.280> Wesker<00:03:50.239> was<00:03:50.390> in

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
that is at first I thought Wesker was in

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.110 
that is at first I thought Wesker was in
the<00:03:50.630> game<00:03:51.430> because<00:03:52.430> of<00:03:52.459> the<00:03:52.700> guy<00:03:52.850> with<00:03:53.090> the

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
the game because of the guy with the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.610 
the game because of the guy with the
glasses<00:03:53.269> he<00:03:53.690> was<00:03:53.720> actually<00:03:53.930> the<00:03:54.140> president

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
glasses he was actually the president

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.530 
glasses he was actually the president
and<00:03:54.769> then<00:03:54.950> now<00:03:55.250> I'm<00:03:55.519> thinking<00:03:55.940> maybe<00:03:56.060> this<00:03:56.360> is

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540
