00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.560
 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:19.869
 I'll teach you to make caramel sweets if 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.970
 You liked the idea and continue 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.300
 watching the video 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:30.930
 then for us to do the caramel gives 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:36.640
 The recipe is a body of water 250 ml 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:40.120
 two cups of sugar crystal day 250 ml 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.420
 and 3 tablespoons white vinegar 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.670
 I'll put it in the pan and I'll 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.719
 after I put it on the fire I do not 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:48.719
 I can move more 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.870
 Good now, you already fucking booed me. 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.850
 on high heat and the vinegar I'll leave 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.220
 to put it last when the syrup has already 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.550
 have close 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.800
 Now the sugar will boil in the fire. 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:20.580
 tall until the tail thickens 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.790
 Let's wait when the syrup starts to 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.670
 thicken yes it's time for us to stay 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.040
 Your eye is on, she's going to get a 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.880
 I'll play there guarana 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.200
 there was nothing 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.720
 So stay tuned to the tail. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.750
 staying in guaranÃ¡ street 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.750
 so it's time for me to throw the vinegar 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.200
 now it is already in the color of guarana already 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:58.280
 I was in amaralina so I'll delete the 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.280
 fire to wash the balls do to 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:05.299
 to 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.390

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.610
 O 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:15.690
 now I'm going to take the excess because 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.550
 sometimes it is that was not 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:22.290
 access to the city is fine, neither is it 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:25.410
 I was in excess of what I wanted to say 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.069
 also that you have to return the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:32.550
 model with oil is to remove the excess 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:34.700
 you put everything like this is 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.700

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.970

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.769

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.079

 I'll use the data is 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:30.260
 from here it is transparent that is the 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:30.260
 ideal is the one that generates more conflict 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.210

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.760
