thereby<00:00:54.899> obviating<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.770> need<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.789> scalpel

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
thereby obviating the need for a scalpel

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.220 
thereby obviating the need for a scalpel
because<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.530> radiation<00:00:58.890> treatment<00:00:59.489> is

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
because the radiation treatment is

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.609 
because the radiation treatment is
administered<00:01:01.230> with<00:01:01.440> submillimeter<00:01:02.190> accuracy

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
tissue is significantly reduced and so

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.730 
tissue is significantly reduced and so
many<00:01:11.700> instances<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.960> treatment<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.590> be
