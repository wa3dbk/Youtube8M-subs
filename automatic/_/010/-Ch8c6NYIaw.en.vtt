00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
under ten shipped so I think this is

so<00:02:23.790> I'm<00:02:23.969> really<00:02:24.120> excited<00:02:24.239> about<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:24.599> i<00:02:24.840> think

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
so I'm really excited about this i think

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.959 
so I'm really excited about this i think
this<00:02:25.140> one<00:02:25.200> cost<00:02:26.629> maybe<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:28.109> little<00:02:29.010> under<00:02:29.340> 4<00:02:29.639> and

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969 
this one cost maybe a little under 4 and

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:32.089 
this one cost maybe a little under 4 and
the<00:02:30.329> barbie<00:02:30.599> thing<00:02:30.780> cost<00:02:31.019> under<00:02:31.290> two<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.920> then

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
the barbie thing cost under two and then

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.920 
the barbie thing cost under two and then
the<00:02:32.219> next<00:02:32.340> things<00:02:32.609> cost<00:02:32.879> a<00:02:33.030> little<00:02:33.180> over<00:02:33.359> three

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
the next things cost a little over three

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.470 
the next things cost a little over three
so<00:02:34.530> hopefully<00:02:34.920> that<00:02:35.069> mass<00:02:35.280> worked<00:02:35.579> out<00:02:35.879> but

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
so hopefully that mass worked out but

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.780 
so hopefully that mass worked out but
yeah<00:02:36.719> very<00:02:37.109> excited<00:02:37.620> about<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:38.069> because<00:02:38.340> if

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
picking out for three so it's actually a

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:43.429 
picking out for three so it's actually a

time so I actually picked up two of them

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.839 
time so I actually picked up two of them
because<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.239> do<00:03:48.449> remember<00:03:48.720> as<00:03:49.169> a<00:03:49.199> kid<00:03:49.409> I<00:03:49.769> had<00:03:50.639> so
