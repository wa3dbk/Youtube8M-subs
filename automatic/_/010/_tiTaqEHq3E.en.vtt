it you know the Players Association
we've<00:04:21.900> talked<00:04:22.830> about<00:04:22.980> so<00:04:23.280> much<00:04:23.490> you<00:04:23.910> know<00:04:24.030> and

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.820 
we've talked about so much you know and
I<00:04:24.330> think<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.870> most<00:04:25.050> important<00:04:25.470> thing<00:04:25.590> in<00:04:25.680> it

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
I think the most important thing in it

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.010 
I think the most important thing in it
we<00:04:26.460> understand<00:04:26.940> is<00:04:27.060> that<00:04:27.090> Adam<00:04:27.419> silver<00:04:27.840> is

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
we understand is that Adam silver is

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.950 
we understand is that Adam silver is
moving<00:04:28.560> forward<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:29.570> you<00:04:30.570> know<00:04:30.660> he's<00:04:30.810> not

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
moving forward and you know he's not

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.390 
moving forward and you know he's not
just<00:04:31.260> for<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.560> owners<00:04:31.800> he's<00:04:31.950> for<00:04:32.100> the<00:04:32.130> players

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
just for the owners he's for the players

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.310 
just for the owners he's for the players
as<00:04:32.580> whaling<00:04:33.030> in<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.660> direction<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.140> they're

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
as whaling in the direction that they're

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.860 
as whaling in the direction that they're
going<00:04:34.650> in<00:04:34.830> we're<00:04:35.100> all<00:04:35.220> for<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:35.840> you<00:04:36.840> know

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
going in we're all for it and you know

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.390 
going in we're all for it and you know
so<00:04:37.050> we<00:04:37.169> look<00:04:37.350> forward<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.770> next<00:04:37.890> step<00:04:38.190> and

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
so we look forward to the next step and

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.290 
so we look forward to the next step and
we<00:04:38.669> go<00:04:38.820> from<00:04:38.940> there

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
we go from there

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.730 
we go from there
is<00:04:39.450> there<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:39.660> point<00:04:40.020> where<00:04:40.380> you<00:04:40.410> feel<00:04:40.530> like

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
is there a point where you feel like

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.409 
is there a point where you feel like
boycott<00:04:41.340> could<00:04:41.580> be<00:04:41.700> an<00:04:41.790> effective<00:04:42.180> tool<00:04:42.390> for

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:42.419 
boycott could be an effective tool for

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.600 
boycott could be an effective tool for
players<00:04:42.780> well<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.080> think<00:04:43.140> at<00:04:43.410> this<00:04:43.530> point<00:04:43.740> the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
players well I think at this point the

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.340 
players well I think at this point the
direction<00:04:44.940> of<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.360> de<00:04:45.419> Miz<00:04:45.630> going<00:04:45.870> in<00:04:45.990> India<00:04:46.290> is

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
direction of a de Miz going in India is

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.659 
direction of a de Miz going in India is
going<00:04:46.710> I<00:04:46.830> don't<00:04:46.950> think<00:04:47.100> there<00:04:47.280> should<00:04:47.310> be<00:04:47.640> a

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
going I don't think there should be a

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:50.030 
going I don't think there should be a
need<00:04:47.940> for<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:48.360> you<00:04:49.290> know<00:04:49.380> we<00:04:49.560> trust<00:04:49.830> those<00:04:49.979> guys
