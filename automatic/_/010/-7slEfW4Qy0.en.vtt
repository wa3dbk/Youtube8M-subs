00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hi everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.750
 this new video in which a lot 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.340
 quickly, however, the ios 7.0 topic 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.309
 point 4 and jailbreak 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.690
 ok but first I want to sum it all up well 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:18.180
 the matter so as to give one 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:20.640
 reorganization make a point of the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.189
 situation on the ios 7 jailbreak in 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:29.060
 general therefore the versions of ios seven 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:32.940
 releases so far are 7.0 7.0.1 7.0.2 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.190
 7.0.3 and the new arrival at 7.0 point 4 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.730
 exit yesterday precisely four of 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.860
 these firmware therefore all excluded ios 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.329
 7.0.1 support tethered jailbreak 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.820
 on iphone 4 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.440
 using the gx tool no whose 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.250
 developer are among other things 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.590
 really me 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.539
 while on the far more important the 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.100
 untethered jailbreak on all 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.770
 devices including new ones 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.079
 generation like iphone 5 and iphone 5 c 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.899
 ipad air and ipad mini 2 etc. 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.609
 the hacker team is thinking about it 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.049
 most important jailbreakers in the world is 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.339
 i bad horses 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.530
 this means that the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.930
 it 7's untethered jailbreak is still 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.220
 under development but soon 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.170
 time will see the light 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.970
 whenever apple releases a new one 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.070
 software update all lovers 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.560
 of the jailbreak prove to be a little bit 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.520
 skeptical not knowing how to update or 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.500
 give up 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.689
 eh already because an apple update 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.220
 may contain files that you don't 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.799
 were present in the old version 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.509
 that as the sole purpose is that of 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.009
 complicate life in seeing oneself 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.320
 hindering their project of 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.850
 jailbreak and yesterday of course it happened 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.640
 the same thing as apple has 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.619
 released I s 7.0 point 4 ho 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.659
 published a video in which we provide the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.420
 download link and a brief guide on 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.520
 how to update but if you remember well 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.399
 I had also spent two words on this 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.130
 to the jailbreak telling itself how we don't know 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.590
 still if this new 7.0 point 4 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.210
 contains changes that block the 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.250
 jailbreak being developed by 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.799
 see yourself not updating 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.380
 until I give you further news and 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.360
 the new good news comes on its own 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.450
 in this video in fact at the gate snow 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.640
 a very important hacker communicated 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.820
 on his official twitter profile that 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.290
 ios and 7.0 point 4 does not interfere in 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.420
 no way with the jailbreak 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.710
 in fact these are two of his tweets 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.440
 official 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.200
 the first says wheels of being sayed ios 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.860
 six po around pine for men of security 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.840
 changes ie ios 7.0 point 4 not to gods 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.700
 changes from the point of view of 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.770
 security therefore does not interfere 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.990
 absolutely with the jailbreak that 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.820
 they are creating the see themselves so yes 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.530
 guys even if you can't wait to 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.130
 untethered ios jailbreak 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:47.890
 7 rest assured because you can as well 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.810
 update to ios 7.0 point 4 that you are 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.640
 demonstrated a harmless firmware for the 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.200
 so hackers won't be sure of him 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.930
 therefore block the jailbreak 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.370
 rest assured and update 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.110
 having said that, the boys are left with us 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.700
