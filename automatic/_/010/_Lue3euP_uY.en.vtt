00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
piece here a little lines there on the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.529 
piece here a little lines there on the
face<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:27.199> those<00:00:28.199> down<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:29.089> line<00:00:30.089> around<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
face and those down here line around the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.470 
face and those down here line around the
edge<00:00:30.720> there<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.880> put<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> filter<00:00:33.210> assembly

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
edge there and put the filter assembly

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.520 
edge there and put the filter assembly
thing<00:00:33.990> in<00:00:34.200> there<00:00:34.440> and<00:00:36.050> then<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> just<00:00:37.320> cleaned

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
thing in there and then I just cleaned

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.430 
thing in there and then I just cleaned
up<00:00:37.739> some<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.160> lines<00:00:38.780> smooth<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:39.960> all<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
up some of the lines smooth out all the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.700 
up some of the lines smooth out all the
underneath<00:00:40.829> side<00:00:41.930> there<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.230> make<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.559> nice

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
underneath side there to make it nice

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.470 
underneath side there to make it nice
for<00:00:43.739> molding<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:46.730> I<00:00:47.730> think<00:00:48.120> that's<00:00:48.300> pretty

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
for molding and I think that's pretty

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.680 
for molding and I think that's pretty
much<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> let's<00:00:50.969> looking<00:00:51.270> pretty<00:00:51.510> good<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
much it so let's looking pretty good and

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.990 
much it so let's looking pretty good and
I've<00:00:54.690> done<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.370> so<00:00:56.370> I'm<00:00:56.550> gonna<00:00:56.670> probably<00:00:56.850> go

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
I've done with so I'm gonna probably go

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.959 
I've done with so I'm gonna probably go
ahead<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.600> start<00:00:57.750> molding<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.230> today<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.969> don't

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
ahead and start molding it today I don't

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.410 
ahead and start molding it today I don't
know<00:01:00.030> how<00:01:00.090> far<00:01:00.359> I'll<00:01:00.510> get<00:01:00.719> with<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.039> but<00:01:02.420> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
know how far I'll get with it but you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.479 
know how far I'll get with it but you
know<00:01:03.449> might<00:01:03.660> as<00:01:03.690> well<00:01:03.870> start<00:01:04.110> today<00:01:04.410> and<00:01:04.590> I'm

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
know might as well start today and I'm

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.620 
know might as well start today and I'm
going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> try<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.880> take<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.210> little<00:01:06.420> bit<00:01:06.570> of

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
going to try to take a little bit of

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.410 
going to try to take a little bit of
video<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:07.140> me<00:01:07.320> molding<00:01:07.710> it<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:09.150> kind<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
video of me molding it so I can kind of

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.620 
video of me molding it so I can kind of
make<00:01:09.509> a<00:01:09.570> new<00:01:09.860> molding<00:01:10.860> tutorial<00:01:11.450> using<00:01:12.450> some

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
make a new molding tutorial using some

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.679 
make a new molding tutorial using some
of<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.780> new<00:01:12.900> techniques<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:14.000> materials<00:01:15.000> that

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
of the new techniques and materials that

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.859 
of the new techniques and materials that
I've<00:01:15.810> been<00:01:15.990> using<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:18.420> know<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.570> thought<00:01:18.780> it

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
I've been using you know I thought it

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.460 
I've been using you know I thought it
might<00:01:18.900> help<00:01:19.140> out<00:01:19.350> some<00:01:19.560> people<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:21.479> go<00:01:22.409> ahead

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
might help out some people so go ahead

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.690 
might help out some people so go ahead
and<00:01:22.560> do<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:23.070> i<00:01:23.100> thought<00:01:23.280> i'd<00:01:23.400> make<00:01:23.520> this

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and do that but i thought i'd make this

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.670 
and do that but i thought i'd make this
last<00:01:23.909> video<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.659> show<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.350> guys<00:01:25.439> what

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
last video here and show you guys what

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.219 
last video here and show you guys what
it<00:01:25.740> looks<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:26.009> finished<00:01:26.430> i'm<00:01:27.170> pretty<00:01:28.170> happy

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
it looks like finished i'm pretty happy

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.370 
it looks like finished i'm pretty happy
with<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.530> way<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.710> came<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.130> far<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:31.350> know

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
with the way it came out so far you know

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.870 
with the way it came out so far you know
hopefully<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.860> gas<00:01:32.070> will<00:01:32.310> turn<00:01:32.520> out<00:01:32.670> awesome

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
hopefully the gas will turn out awesome

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.450 
hopefully the gas will turn out awesome
and<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.619> painting<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:35.250> and

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
and I can get one painting up and

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.929 
and I can get one painting up and
finished<00:01:35.790> up<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.320> wicked<00:01:37.320> cool<00:01:37.909> but<00:01:38.909> I

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
finished up and the wicked cool but I

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.670 
finished up and the wicked cool but I
think<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.450> be<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.840> hundred<00:01:40.470> times

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
think it's going to be a hundred times

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.330 
think it's going to be a hundred times
better<00:01:41.009> than<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.399> thing<00:01:41.810> which<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.350> lot<00:01:44.310> of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
better than this thing which a lot of

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.370 
better than this thing which a lot of
people<00:01:44.460> on<00:01:44.820> YouTube<00:01:45.210> apparently<00:01:46.020> like<00:01:46.170> this

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
people on YouTube apparently like this

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.700 
people on YouTube apparently like this
one<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.840> hopefully<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.259> one's<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.560> lot

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
one so hopefully if that one's a lot

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.649 
one so hopefully if that one's a lot
better<00:01:49.860> than<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.909> know<00:01:51.060> people<00:01:51.390> like<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
better than you know people like that

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.639 
better than you know people like that
one<00:01:51.960> too<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:53.180> we'll<00:01:54.180> see<00:01:54.390> but<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.619> it

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
one too so we'll see but I like it

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.850 
one too so we'll see but I like it
that's<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.310> matters<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:58.409> that's<00:01:58.710> it
