00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
goes off to the side now the attractor

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.240 
goes off to the side now the attractor
itself<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.550> quite<00:00:29.849> nice<00:00:30.769> it<00:00:31.769> rolls<00:00:32.009> very

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
itself it's quite nice it rolls very

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.010 
itself it's quite nice it rolls very
well<00:00:34.370> you<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.430> it's<00:00:36.090> quite<00:00:36.329> solid

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
well you know it's quite solid

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.260 
well you know it's quite solid
nothing<00:00:37.770> really<00:00:38.100> shifts<00:00:38.730> under<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.030> pressure

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
nothing really shifts under the pressure

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.000 
nothing really shifts under the pressure
of<00:00:39.450> holding<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:42.559> hold<00:00:43.559> together<00:00:43.649> quite

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
of holding it and hold together quite

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
of holding it and hold together quite
well<00:00:44.329> it's<00:00:45.329> sturdy

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
it looks pretty accurate and I like it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.380 
it looks pretty accurate and I like it
roll<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.530> well<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.730> only<00:00:50.879> problem<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.239> have

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
roll as well the only problem I have

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.450 
roll as well the only problem I have
with<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.600> is<00:00:51.660> that's<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.050> little<00:00:52.440> bit<00:00:52.710> wide<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
with it is that's a little bit wide and

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
with it is that's a little bit wide and
that's<00:00:53.940> for<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> combined<00:00:54.930> mode<00:00:55.289> with<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that's for the combined mode with the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.670 
that's for the combined mode with the
trailer<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.309> even<00:00:57.090> as<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.989> chest<00:00:58.469> is

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
trailer and even as it is the chest is

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.200 
trailer and even as it is the chest is
still<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> little<00:00:59.399> bit<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.789> wide<00:01:00.090> enough<00:01:00.120> so

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
still a little bit not wide enough so

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.850 
still a little bit not wide enough so
this<00:01:03.210> figure<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.780> think<00:01:04.110> was<00:01:04.260> probably<00:01:04.439> sort<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
this figure I think was probably sort of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649 
this figure I think was probably sort of
a<00:01:04.920> balancing<00:01:05.369> game<00:01:05.549> for<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> designers

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
a balancing game for the designers

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.520 
a balancing game for the designers
because<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:07.770> hand<00:01:08.010> they<00:01:08.220> had<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:09.530> give

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
because on the one hand they had to give

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.560 
because on the one hand they had to give
it<00:01:10.650> big<00:01:10.799> beefy<00:01:11.100> arms<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.520> combined<00:01:11.850> mode<00:01:12.090> on

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
it big beefy arms in combined mode on

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.730 
it big beefy arms in combined mode on
the<00:01:12.720> other<00:01:12.810> hand<00:01:13.049> they<00:01:13.140> still<00:01:13.320> had<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> give

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the other hand they still had to give

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.140 
the other hand they still had to give
this<00:01:13.890> thing<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.430> serviceable<00:01:15.360> robot<00:01:15.720> mode<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
this thing a serviceable robot mode and

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.570 
this thing a serviceable robot mode and
considering<00:01:18.150> how<00:01:18.689> all<00:01:19.020> four<00:01:20.009> modes<00:01:20.220> work

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
considering how all four modes work

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.490

is<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> little<00:01:56.640> bit<00:01:56.759> odd<00:01:58.340> so<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.460> transform<00:01:59.729> it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
is a little bit odd so to transform it

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.109 
is a little bit odd so to transform it
you<00:02:00.810> will<00:02:00.930> pop<00:02:01.140> up<00:02:01.170> these<00:02:04.340> they<00:02:05.340> own<00:02:05.460> peg<00:02:05.790> from

little holes here and pull them out like

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.190 
little holes here and pull them out like
this

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.410 

bring<00:02:12.200> them<00:02:12.380> up<00:02:12.730> fold<00:02:13.730> them<00:02:13.910> in<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:16.209> PEG<00:02:17.209> them

bring them up fold them in and PEG them

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:27.610 
bring them up fold them in and PEG them
in<00:02:17.540> here<00:02:22.090> rotate<00:02:23.090> these<00:02:24.910> down<00:02:25.910> and<00:02:26.270> around<00:02:27.200> and

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
they will tab in here then you will take

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.580 
they will tab in here then you will take
the<00:02:33.170> legs<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:35.180> will<00:02:35.300> pop<00:02:35.570> them<00:02:35.810> free<00:02:36.260> of<00:02:36.410> the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
the legs you will pop them free of the

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.690 
the legs you will pop them free of the
tabs<00:02:37.489> in<00:02:37.790> here<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:38.830> you<00:02:39.830> will<00:02:39.980> rotate<00:02:40.489> them

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
tabs in here and you will rotate them

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.860 
tabs in here and you will rotate them
down<00:02:41.650> pop<00:02:42.650> free<00:02:42.980> outs<00:02:43.820> to<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.270> untap<00:02:44.600> from

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
down pop free outs to the untap from

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.550 
down pop free outs to the untap from
here<00:02:45.230> and<00:02:45.380> rotate<00:02:45.980> down<00:02:46.250> and<00:02:46.870> then<00:02:47.870> what<00:02:48.470> you

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
here and rotate down and then what you

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.949 
here and rotate down and then what you
will<00:02:48.650> do<00:02:48.800> is<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.130> will<00:02:49.600> keep<00:02:50.600> this<00:02:50.780> as

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
will do is you will keep this as

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.660 
will do is you will keep this as
straight<00:02:51.200> as<00:02:51.290> possible<00:02:51.350> so<00:02:51.890> that<00:02:51.920> these<00:02:52.220> tabs

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
straight as possible so that these tabs

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.070 
straight as possible so that these tabs
here<00:02:53.410> won't<00:02:54.410> bump<00:02:54.650> into<00:02:55.010> anything<00:02:55.190> and<00:02:56.080> then

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
here won't bump into anything and then

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.850 
here won't bump into anything and then
you'll<00:02:57.230> turn<00:02:57.860> it<00:02:58.720> you'll<00:02:59.720> push<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.110> up<00:03:00.260> and

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
you'll turn it you'll push it up and

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.650 
you'll turn it you'll push it up and
turn<00:03:01.220> it<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.880> will<00:03:02.030> lock<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.330> into<00:03:02.450> place

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
turn it and that will lock it into place

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:08.860 
turn it and that will lock it into place
without<00:03:03.019> causing<00:03:03.620> much<00:03:03.769> plastic<00:03:04.010> scrape<00:03:07.870> next

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
without causing much plastic scrape next

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.570 
without causing much plastic scrape next
what<00:03:08.989> we<00:03:09.110> will<00:03:09.170> do<00:03:09.350> is<00:03:09.470> we'll<00:03:09.650> take<00:03:09.890> these

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
what we will do is we'll take these

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.620 
what we will do is we'll take these
sides<00:03:10.910> here<00:03:11.269> pull<00:03:11.930> them<00:03:12.110> up<00:03:16.060> take<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.239> bottom

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
sides here pull them up take this bottom

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.140 
sides here pull them up take this bottom
panel<00:03:18.700> pull<00:03:19.700> it<00:03:19.850> up<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.180> detach<00:03:21.110> it<00:03:22.150> pull

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
panel pull it up and detach it pull

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.729 
panel pull it up and detach it pull
these<00:03:23.360> arms<00:03:24.040> out<00:03:25.040> which<00:03:25.700> allow<00:03:26.000> us<00:03:26.030> to<00:03:26.269> pull

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
these arms out which allow us to pull

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.080 
these arms out which allow us to pull
this<00:03:27.739> up<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:30.380> don't<00:03:31.190> pull<00:03:31.340> it<00:03:31.489> up<00:03:31.579> just<00:03:31.610> yet

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
this up and don't pull it up just yet

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.270 
this up and don't pull it up just yet
and<00:03:32.360> then<00:03:33.430> coming<00:03:34.430> back<00:03:34.459> to<00:03:34.610> the<00:03:34.820> front<00:03:35.060> we<00:03:35.690> can

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
and then coming back to the front we can

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.500 
and then coming back to the front we can
split<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.850> arms<00:03:38.290> which<00:03:39.290> will<00:03:40.060> cause<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.329> head

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
split the arms which will cause the head

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:50.350 
split the arms which will cause the head
to<00:03:41.660> spring<00:03:41.959> up<00:03:43.870> rotate<00:03:44.870> this<00:03:45.049> around<00:03:49.209> so<00:03:50.209> it's

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
to spring up rotate this around so it's

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.590 
to spring up rotate this around so it's
out<00:03:50.480> of<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.630> way<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.820> it<00:03:52.820> just<00:03:53.000> comes<00:03:53.239> out<00:03:53.390> on

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
out of the way and it just comes out on

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.090 
out of the way and it just comes out on
a<00:03:53.630> hinge<00:03:53.959> so<00:03:54.500> hinge<00:03:54.890> it<00:03:55.040> down<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:56.290> then<00:03:57.290> rotate

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
a hinge so hinge it down and then rotate

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.199 
a hinge so hinge it down and then rotate
it<00:03:58.160> over<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.640> above<00:03:59.320> and<00:04:00.820> it's<00:04:01.820> a<00:04:01.880> little<00:04:02.090> bit

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
it over and above and it's a little bit

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.360 
it over and above and it's a little bit
tricky<00:04:02.959> to<00:04:02.989> do<00:04:03.489> but<00:04:04.489> you<00:04:04.610> will<00:04:04.730> tab<00:04:05.980> these<00:04:06.980> tabs

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
tricky to do but you will tab these tabs

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.710 
tricky to do but you will tab these tabs
into<00:04:08.000> those<00:04:08.480> slots<00:04:08.810> in<00:04:09.049> there<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:10.450> then<00:04:11.450> this

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
into those slots in there and then this

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.300 
into those slots in there and then this
will<00:04:12.620> come<00:04:13.269> in<00:04:14.269> flat<00:04:14.540> over<00:04:14.870> there<00:04:15.220> rotate<00:04:16.220> the

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
will come in flat over there rotate the

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.529 
will come in flat over there rotate the
arms<00:04:16.820> around<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.930> arms<00:04:18.320> around<00:04:19.299> take<00:04:20.299> these

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
arms around the arms around take these

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.590 
arms around the arms around take these
shoulder<00:04:21.049> panels<00:04:21.530> and<00:04:21.979> lay<00:04:22.099> them<00:04:22.280> flat

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
shoulder panels and lay them flat

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.670 
shoulder panels and lay them flat
then<00:04:24.260> this<00:04:24.500> little<00:04:25.250> tab<00:04:25.460> into<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:25.940> back<00:04:26.120> and

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
then this little tab into the back and

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.750 
then this little tab into the back and
we<00:04:27.680> can<00:04:27.860> put<00:04:28.370> that<00:04:28.550> flat<00:04:33.070> open<00:04:34.070> up<00:04:34.190> these

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
we can put that flat open up these

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:44.040 
we can put that flat open up these
panels<00:04:35.330> here<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:36.370> slide<00:04:37.370> out<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.940> hands<00:04:42.370> and

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
panels here and slide out the hands and

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:51.670 
panels here and slide out the hands and
this<00:04:45.050> is<00:04:45.860> Optimus<00:04:46.370> Prime<00:04:47.620> in<00:04:48.940> robot<00:04:49.940> mode<00:04:50.680> it's

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
this is Optimus Prime in robot mode it's

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.570 
this is Optimus Prime in robot mode it's
quite<00:04:51.980> big

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.710 

despite<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.730> arms<00:04:56.120> fairly<00:04:56.570> well

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
despite the arms fairly well

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.380 
despite the arms fairly well
proportioned<00:04:57.050> like<00:04:57.410> the<00:04:57.860> arm<00:04:58.040> like<00:04:58.550> take<00:04:59.240> away

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
proportioned like the arm like take away

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.420 
proportioned like the arm like take away
the<00:04:59.450> arms<00:04:59.810> pretty<00:05:00.560> well<00:05:00.710> proportions<00:05:01.280> the

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
the arms pretty well proportions the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.570 
the arms pretty well proportions the
only<00:05:01.820> problem<00:05:02.360> is<00:05:02.510> is<00:05:02.840> that<00:05:03.250> these<00:05:04.250> sort<00:05:04.520> of

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
only problem is is that these sort of

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.840 
only problem is is that these sort of
muscle<00:05:05.000> bits<00:05:05.420> that<00:05:05.750> are<00:05:05.960> um<00:05:06.460> for<00:05:07.460> dark<00:05:07.670> of<00:05:07.790> the

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
muscle bits that are um for dark of the

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.820 
muscle bits that are um for dark of the
moon<00:05:08.030> haven't<00:05:08.600> added<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.050> Optimus<00:05:09.470> Prime

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
moon haven't added to the Optimus Prime

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
moon haven't added to the Optimus Prime
design<00:05:10.750> these<00:05:11.750> look<00:05:12.590> like<00:05:12.740> abdomen<00:05:13.370> pieces

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
design these look like abdomen pieces

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.080 
design these look like abdomen pieces
but<00:05:14.630> they<00:05:14.750> come<00:05:14.930> in<00:05:15.050> right<00:05:15.290> under<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.710> pecs<00:05:16.090> as

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
but they come in right under the pecs as

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.790 
but they come in right under the pecs as
opposed<00:05:17.510> to<00:05:17.570> being<00:05:17.720> right<00:05:17.960> where<00:05:18.110> the<00:05:18.230> abdomen

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.800 
opposed to being right where the abdomen

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.330 
opposed to being right where the abdomen
is<00:05:19.030> so<00:05:20.030> this<00:05:20.240> is<00:05:20.390> just<00:05:20.570> a<00:05:20.630> blank<00:05:20.810> spot<00:05:21.140> and<00:05:21.530> it

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
is so this is just a blank spot and it

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.890 
is so this is just a blank spot and it
looks<00:05:22.520> like<00:05:22.610> that's<00:05:23.000> all<00:05:23.270> his<00:05:23.450> chest<00:05:23.750> is

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
looks like that's all his chest is

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.180 
looks like that's all his chest is
supposed<00:05:24.170> to<00:05:24.200> be<00:05:24.320> and<00:05:24.440> then<00:05:24.620> right<00:05:24.950> here

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
supposed to be and then right here

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.150 
supposed to be and then right here
should<00:05:25.400> be<00:05:25.490> pelvis<00:05:25.970> so<00:05:26.720> because<00:05:27.380> these<00:05:27.650> are<00:05:27.980> up

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
should be pelvis so because these are up

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.750 
should be pelvis so because these are up
here<00:05:28.490> rather<00:05:28.880> than<00:05:29.090> down<00:05:29.300> here<00:05:30.520> this<00:05:31.520> does

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
here rather than down here this does

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.220 
here rather than down here this does
look<00:05:31.970> a<00:05:32.060> little<00:05:32.180> bit<00:05:32.360> too<00:05:32.510> long<00:05:32.690> if<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:33.080> were

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:33.230 
look a little bit too long if this were

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:35.530 
look a little bit too long if this were
down<00:05:33.410> here<00:05:33.710> and<00:05:33.860> they<00:05:33.920> want<00:05:34.100> the<00:05:34.330> movie<00:05:35.330> one

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
down here and they want the movie one

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.910 
down here and they want the movie one
and<00:05:35.690> two<00:05:35.810> designs<00:05:36.170> are<00:05:36.320> just<00:05:36.410> having<00:05:36.590> red

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
and two designs are just having red

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.280 
and two designs are just having red
slats<00:05:37.250> that<00:05:37.400> come<00:05:37.610> down<00:05:37.760> here<00:05:38.180> I<00:05:38.300> think<00:05:39.170> this

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:39.290 
slats that come down here I think this

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:44.290 
slats that come down here I think this
would<00:05:39.470> have<00:05:39.500> looked<00:05:39.710> a<00:05:40.010> lot<00:05:40.250> better<00:05:41.020> and<00:05:43.300> well

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.300 
would have looked a lot better and well

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.150 
would have looked a lot better and well
the<00:05:44.390> obvious<00:05:44.780> faults<00:05:44.990> are<00:05:45.230> obvious<00:05:45.620> like<00:05:45.650> the

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
the obvious faults are obvious like the

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.860 
the obvious faults are obvious like the
wheel<00:05:47.150> well<00:05:47.480> arms<00:05:48.400> but<00:05:49.810> considering<00:05:50.810> what

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
wheel well arms but considering what

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.300 
wheel well arms but considering what
these<00:05:51.080> have<00:05:51.290> to<00:05:51.410> do<00:05:51.530> in<00:05:51.620> the<00:05:51.710> combined<00:05:52.040> mode

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
these have to do in the combined mode

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.450 
these have to do in the combined mode
and<00:05:53.320> that<00:05:54.320> they're<00:05:54.470> not<00:05:54.590> that<00:05:54.800> big<00:05:55.100> of<00:05:55.220> a<00:05:55.250> deal

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
and that they're not that big of a deal

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.100 
and that they're not that big of a deal
their<00:05:56.090> kibble<00:05:56.330> but<00:05:56.570> they<00:05:56.660> don't<00:05:56.840> get<00:05:56.960> in<00:05:57.050> the

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
their kibble but they don't get in the

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.790 
their kibble but they don't get in the
way<00:05:57.320> of<00:05:57.560> what's<00:05:58.190> otherwise<00:05:58.580> a<00:05:58.640> very<00:05:58.970> fun<00:05:59.210> toy<00:05:59.480> I

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
way of what's otherwise a very fun toy I

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.980 
way of what's otherwise a very fun toy I
don't<00:06:00.800> mind<00:06:00.980> it

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:01.990 
don't mind it

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.630 
don't mind it
and<00:06:02.990> really<00:06:03.350> that's<00:06:03.500> the<00:06:03.680> sky's<00:06:03.980> strong<00:06:04.340> suit

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
and really that's the sky's strong suit

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:06.250 
and really that's the sky's strong suit
he<00:06:05.090> doesn't<00:06:05.450> look<00:06:05.600> as<00:06:05.780> good<00:06:05.810> as<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.140> other

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
he doesn't look as good as the other

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.650 
he doesn't look as good as the other
primes<00:06:06.560> but<00:06:07.190> he's<00:06:07.340> very<00:06:07.580> fun<00:06:07.910> he<00:06:08.150> has<00:06:08.240> a<00:06:08.270> solid

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
primes but he's very fun he has a solid

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.920 
primes but he's very fun he has a solid
alt<00:06:08.840> mode<00:06:09.050> a<00:06:09.460> fun<00:06:10.460> simple<00:06:11.390> and<00:06:11.540> easy

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
alt mode a fun simple and easy

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.900 
alt mode a fun simple and easy
transformation<00:06:12.620> and<00:06:13.480> a<00:06:14.530> solid<00:06:15.530> robot<00:06:15.830> mode<00:06:16.040> it

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
transformation and a solid robot mode it

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.190 
transformation and a solid robot mode it
has<00:06:16.940> everything<00:06:17.330> you<00:06:17.480> could<00:06:17.570> want<00:06:17.810> it<00:06:17.960> to<00:06:18.080> do

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
has everything you could want it to do

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.890 
has everything you could want it to do
except<00:06:19.070> look<00:06:20.060> exactly<00:06:20.420> right<00:06:20.840> I<00:06:20.870> suppose<00:06:22.900> it's

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:23.900 
except look exactly right I suppose it's

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.890 
except look exactly right I suppose it's
got<00:06:24.050> quite<00:06:24.200> a<00:06:24.290> bit<00:06:24.500> of<00:06:24.560> articulation<00:06:25.280> and

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
got quite a bit of articulation and

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.980 
got quite a bit of articulation and
overall<00:06:26.900> just<00:06:27.620> a<00:06:27.710> very<00:06:27.890> good<00:06:28.070> toy<00:06:28.220> in<00:06:29.060> this

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:29.990 
overall just a very good toy in this

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 
mood for articulation his head looks

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.580 
mood for articulation his head looks
left<00:06:32.120> and<00:06:32.419> right<00:06:34.060> shoulders<00:06:35.060> go<00:06:35.240> back<00:06:35.590> forth

don't<00:06:38.020> he's<00:06:39.020> uh<00:06:39.370> he<00:06:40.370> has<00:06:40.640> a<00:06:40.670> bicep<00:06:41.540> swivel<00:06:41.960> and

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:42.260 
don't he's uh he has a bicep swivel and

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.730 
don't he's uh he has a bicep swivel and
the<00:06:43.070> elbows<00:06:43.880> only<00:06:44.180> go<00:06:44.300> up<00:06:44.450> them<00:06:44.720> from<00:06:45.620> the

ninety<00:06:49.940> degrees<00:06:50.270> and<00:06:50.570> then<00:06:51.380> his<00:06:51.500> hands<00:06:51.770> can<00:06:52.040> go

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 
ninety degrees and then his hands can go

00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:00.190 
ninety degrees and then his hands can go
in<00:06:54.640> his<00:06:55.640> legs<00:06:55.880> go<00:06:56.090> back<00:06:56.540> forward<00:06:57.500> out<00:06:59.200> rotate

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
in his legs go back forward out rotate

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:03.070 
in his legs go back forward out rotate
above<00:07:00.620> the<00:07:01.130> knee<00:07:01.310> and<00:07:01.610> a<00:07:02.570> little<00:07:02.810> bit<00:07:02.930> more

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
above the knee and a little bit more

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.040 
above the knee and a little bit more
than<00:07:03.320> ninety<00:07:03.620> degrees<00:07:03.650> on<00:07:04.130> the<00:07:04.280> on<00:07:04.640> the<00:07:04.790> up

than ninety degrees on the on the up

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:11.920 
than ninety degrees on the on the up
knee<00:07:06.050> and<00:07:06.620> then<00:07:06.770> these<00:07:06.950> can<00:07:07.280> rotate<00:07:07.400> down<00:07:10.930> so

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
knee and then these can rotate down so

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:17.590 
knee and then these can rotate down so
the<00:07:12.140> only<00:07:12.260> annoying<00:07:12.530> things<00:07:12.860> are<00:07:13.100> that<00:07:16.240> um<00:07:17.240> the

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:17.600 
the only annoying things are that um the

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.420 
the only annoying things are that um the
hands<00:07:17.840> slide<00:07:18.140> in<00:07:18.290> from<00:07:18.530> time<00:07:18.710> to<00:07:18.890> time<00:07:18.920> and

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.430 
hands slide in from time to time and

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.780 
hands slide in from time to time and
these<00:07:20.180> panels<00:07:20.690> otherwise<00:07:21.620> he's<00:07:22.460> just<00:07:22.550> over

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:22.790 
these panels otherwise he's just over

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.880 
these panels otherwise he's just over
all<00:07:23.030> the<00:07:23.180> fun<00:07:23.360> toy<00:07:23.630> with<00:07:23.900> some<00:07:24.410> slightly<00:07:24.650> odd

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:24.890 
all the fun toy with some slightly odd

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:28.590 
all the fun toy with some slightly odd
proportions<00:07:26.620> and<00:07:27.620> I<00:07:27.740> like<00:07:27.890> them<00:07:28.040> quite<00:07:28.220> a<00:07:28.250> bit

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:28.600 
proportions and I like them quite a bit

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.700 
proportions and I like them quite a bit
those<00:07:29.600> are<00:07:29.750> my<00:07:29.840> thoughts<00:07:30.020> thank<00:07:30.470> you<00:07:30.560> for

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:30.710 
those are my thoughts thank you for

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:33.070 
those are my thoughts thank you for
