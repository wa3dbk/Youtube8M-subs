want to after that we're going to let
that<00:01:53.530> dry<00:01:53.979> and<00:01:54.280> then<00:01:54.399> we're<00:01:54.580> going<00:01:54.670> to<00:01:54.729> do

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
that dry and then we're going to do

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.540 
that dry and then we're going to do
three<00:01:55.750> coats<00:01:56.080> I'm<00:01:56.380> doing<00:01:56.800> three<00:01:57.069> you<00:01:57.220> can<00:01:57.399> do

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
three coats I'm doing three you can do

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.880 
three coats I'm doing three you can do
two<00:01:57.759> or<00:01:58.119> three<00:01:58.450> or<00:01:58.630> more<00:01:58.840> if<00:01:58.929> you<00:01:59.020> want<00:01:59.050> to<00:01:59.349> but

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
two or three or more if you want to but

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.440 
two or three or more if you want to but
I<00:01:59.950> found<00:02:00.220> that<00:02:00.310> three<00:02:00.640> was<00:02:01.000> really<00:02:01.300> really

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
I found that three was really really

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.389 
I found that three was really really
nice<00:02:01.660> because<00:02:01.959> it<00:02:02.259> gave<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:02.590> a<00:02:02.709> very<00:02:02.950> opaque

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399 
nice because it gave it a very opaque

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.059 
nice because it gave it a very opaque
look<00:02:03.849> and<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:04.539> this<00:02:04.750> is<00:02:04.899> what<00:02:05.200> three<00:02:05.679> coats

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
look and so this is what three coats

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.160 
look and so this is what three coats
look<00:02:06.489> like<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:07.000> as<00:02:07.119> you<00:02:07.209> can<00:02:07.330> see<00:02:07.360> it's<00:02:07.780> really

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
look like and as you can see it's really

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.440 
look like and as you can see it's really
really<00:02:08.530> nice<00:02:08.649> opaque<00:02:09.099> exactly<00:02:10.000> what<00:02:10.149> we<00:02:10.209> want

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
I would recommend using flowers are a

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.199 
I would recommend using flowers are a
little<00:04:11.799> bit<00:04:12.009> bigger<00:04:12.250> just<00:04:12.639> because<00:04:12.879> I<00:04:12.909> think

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
little bit bigger just because I think

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.140 
little bit bigger just because I think
it<00:04:13.359> gives<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.810> very<00:04:14.079> like<00:04:14.819> hippie<00:04:15.819> or

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
it gives that very like hippie or

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.270 
it gives that very like hippie or
bohemian<00:04:16.419> look<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.229> it<00:04:17.320> so<00:04:17.560> these<00:04:18.039> are<00:04:18.250> the

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
bohemian look to it so these are the

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.310 
bohemian look to it so these are the
color<00:04:18.549> schemes<00:04:18.909> I<00:04:19.060> chose<00:04:19.509> and<00:04:19.840> i'm<00:04:20.019> just<00:04:20.109> going

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.810 
hot glue gun one end to the back of the
antlers<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.140> then<00:05:12.320> I<00:05:12.500> put<00:05:12.920> double-sided<00:05:13.340> tape

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
antlers and then I put double-sided tape

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.360 
antlers and then I put double-sided tape
on<00:05:14.030> the<00:05:14.210> other<00:05:14.390> side<00:05:14.690> of<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:14.900> cup<00:05:15.110> and<00:05:15.290> tape<00:05:16.220> it

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
on the other side of the cup and tape it

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.330 
on the other side of the cup and tape it
to<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:16.640> wall<00:05:17.060> but<00:05:17.090> I<00:05:17.600> did<00:05:18.290> end<00:05:18.500> up<00:05:18.680> having<00:05:19.160> to

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
to the wall but I did end up having to

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.280 
to the wall but I did end up having to
nail<00:05:19.580> it<00:05:19.610> to<00:05:19.850> the<00:05:19.880> wall<00:05:19.970> because<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.690> tape

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
nail it to the wall because the tape

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.530 
nail it to the wall because the tape
wasn't<00:05:21.560> strong<00:05:22.190> enough<00:05:22.250> so<00:05:22.760> here<00:05:23.390> I'm<00:05:23.510> just

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
wasn't strong enough so here I'm just

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.600 
wasn't strong enough so here I'm just
going<00:05:23.780> to<00:05:23.810> go<00:05:23.870> ahead<00:05:23.990> and<00:05:24.140> put<00:05:25.040> it<00:05:25.160> on<00:05:25.310> my<00:05:25.340> wall

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
going to go ahead and put it on my wall

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.190 
going to go ahead and put it on my wall
wherever<00:05:25.880> I<00:05:26.030> want<00:05:26.270> to<00:05:26.450> wherever<00:05:26.630> you<00:05:26.900> want<00:05:27.140> to
