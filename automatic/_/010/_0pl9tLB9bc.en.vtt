00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
can't tell you right now they're using

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.910 
can't tell you right now they're using
Snapdragon<00:00:24.210> or<00:00:24.300> whatever<00:00:24.660> but<00:00:25.230> they<00:00:25.380> told<00:00:25.650> us

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
Snapdragon or whatever but they told us

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.019 
Snapdragon or whatever but they told us
it's<00:00:26.160> capable<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.760> running<00:00:27.830> HD<00:00:29.029> multimedia

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
it's capable of running HD multimedia

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.410 
it's capable of running HD multimedia
files<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.689> yeah<00:00:31.650> as<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.070> said<00:00:32.369> seven-inch<00:00:33.120> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
files and yeah as I said seven-inch it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.889 
files and yeah as I said seven-inch it
should<00:00:33.719> cost<00:00:34.130> 249<00:00:35.130> euros<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> think<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
should cost 249 euros so I think the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.150 
should cost 249 euros so I think the
price<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.410> US<00:00:37.620> market<00:00:37.770> should<00:00:38.100> be

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
price for the US market should be

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.790 
price for the US market should be
between<00:00:39.230> $249<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:41.000> $299<00:00:42.140> they<00:00:43.140> told<00:00:43.410> us<00:00:43.620> when

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
between $249 and $299 they told us when
