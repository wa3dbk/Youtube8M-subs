00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
have a go at something if it doesn't

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.580 
have a go at something if it doesn't
work<00:03:23.939> out<00:03:24.150> they'll<00:03:24.959> cover<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.290> lot<00:03:25.439> of<00:03:25.469> ground

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.709 
work out they'll cover a lot of ground
and<00:03:26.040> then<00:03:26.189> find<00:03:26.519> another<00:03:26.609> place<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.060> hide<00:03:27.269> and

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:27.719 
and then find another place to hide and

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:28.899 
and then find another place to hide and
and<00:03:27.989> wait

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
and wait

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:35.539 
and wait
they<00:03:29.909> masters<00:03:30.420> of<00:03:31.010> waiting<00:03:33.439> his<00:03:34.439> female<00:03:34.859> we

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
they masters of waiting his female we

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.229 
they masters of waiting his female we
saw<00:03:35.730> her<00:03:35.879> cub<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.510> little<00:03:36.930> while<00:03:37.680> ago<00:03:37.859> I<00:03:38.239> think

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
saw her cub a little while ago I think

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.750 
saw her cub a little while ago I think
this<00:03:39.540> adds<00:03:39.959> to<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.469> pressure<00:03:40.709> of<00:03:40.920> her<00:03:41.159> having

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
this adds to the pressure of her having

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:57.309 
this adds to the pressure of her having
to<00:03:41.969> be<00:03:42.090> successful<00:03:42.629> on<00:03:42.750> her<00:03:42.870> hands

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.380

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
it was a great afternoon we spent

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.590 
it was a great afternoon we spent
probably<00:04:02.209> 12<00:04:03.209> hours<00:04:03.420> with<00:04:03.810> this<00:04:03.959> leopard<00:04:05.600> cut

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600
