00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
bases and they might spend 50,000 gold

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.670 
bases and they might spend 50,000 gold
searching<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.600> they<00:01:12.659> can<00:01:12.810> barely<00:01:13.200> find<00:01:13.500> any

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
searching and they can barely find any

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.960 
searching and they can barely find any
bases<00:01:14.130> over<00:01:14.780> 150,000<00:01:15.780> gold<00:01:15.900> available<00:01:16.110> and

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
little bit of raiding you can see I

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.410 
little bit of raiding you can see I
found<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.740> pretty<00:01:31.920> good<00:01:32.070> base<00:01:32.250> here<00:01:32.579> as<00:01:32.700> well<00:01:33.299> as

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
found a pretty good base here as well as

found a pretty good base here as well as
I<00:01:33.540> found<00:01:33.810> some<00:01:34.020> other<00:01:34.140> pretty<00:01:34.409> good<00:01:34.530> bases

during this let's play series but I

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.670 
during this let's play series but I
think<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.600> definitely<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:37.079> noticeable<00:01:37.619> that

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680

think it definitely is noticeable that
I'm<00:01:37.950> having<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.369> search<00:01:38.640> more<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.150> find<00:01:39.360> good

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
before this before I showed this one but

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.249 
before this before I showed this one but
a<00:01:44.880> certain<00:01:45.119> raids<00:01:45.420> they<00:01:45.630> might<00:01:45.810> take<00:01:46.020> me

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
50,000 gold to find and obviously that's

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.460 
50,000 gold to find and obviously that's
not<00:01:49.590> very<00:01:49.770> fun<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.280> about<00:01:50.490> hot<00:01:51.030> maybe<00:01:51.470> 90

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
not very fun that's about hot maybe 90

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.889 
not very fun that's about hot maybe 90
80<00:01:52.829> or<00:01:53.130> 90<00:01:53.520> searches<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.270> find<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.570> good<00:01:54.720> base

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
80 or 90 searches to find a good base

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.630 
80 or 90 searches to find a good base
and<00:01:54.930> no<00:01:55.350> one<00:01:55.470> wants<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.829> sit<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.250> put<00:01:56.490> their

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and no one wants to sit and put their

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.550 
and no one wants to sit and put their
iPad<00:01:56.969> for<00:01:57.299> five<00:01:57.570> minutes<00:01:57.840> trying<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.290> find<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
iPad for five minutes trying to find a

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.770 
iPad for five minutes trying to find a
good<00:01:58.649> base<00:01:59.000> whereas<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.090> used<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.360> take<00:02:00.509> maybe

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
good base whereas it used to take maybe

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.469 
good base whereas it used to take maybe
one<00:02:01.110> or<00:02:01.680> two<00:02:01.710> minutes<00:02:02.130> for<00:02:02.310> me<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:03.060> obviously

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
one or two minutes for me so obviously

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.170 
one or two minutes for me so obviously
that's<00:02:03.810> not<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.649> good<00:02:04.799> but<00:02:05.340> keep<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.149> mind

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
that's not very good but keep in mind

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.910 
that's not very good but keep in mind
during<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> interview<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.290> Jonas<00:02:07.680> said

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
during the interview like Jonas said

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.859 
during the interview like Jonas said
this<00:02:08.160> is<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.340> change<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:09.060> it<00:02:09.450> makes<00:02:09.750> sense

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
this is a change that it makes sense

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.839 
this is a change that it makes sense
that<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.349> might<00:02:10.440> take<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.890> week<00:02:11.099> or<00:02:11.250> two<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
that it might take a week or two for the

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.280 
that it might take a week or two for the
changes<00:02:12.239> to<00:02:12.360> get<00:02:12.450> into<00:02:12.599> effect<00:02:12.930> as<00:02:13.110> more

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
changes to get into effect as more

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.820 
changes to get into effect as more
people<00:02:13.440> say

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
people say

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.260

mad<00:02:49.530> but<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.100> can<00:02:50.220> see<00:02:50.400> here<00:02:50.610> I'm<00:02:50.760> finding

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
mad but you can see here I'm finding

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.750 
mad but you can see here I'm finding
some<00:02:51.210> good<00:02:51.330> basis<00:02:51.750> for<00:02:52.250> 660,000<00:02:53.250> resources

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
some good basis for 660,000 resources

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.280 
some good basis for 660,000 resources
it's<00:02:54.330> just<00:02:54.570> some<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.840> time<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.140> people

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
it's just some of the time that people

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.080 
it's just some of the time that people
have<00:02:55.740> that<00:02:56.100> they<00:02:56.220> have<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.430> search<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.730> lot<00:02:56.880> or

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
have that they have to search a lot or

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.310 
have that they have to search a lot or
maybe<00:02:57.480> some<00:02:57.690> people<00:02:57.960> are<00:02:58.050> in<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.200> wrong

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
maybe some people are in the wrong

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.410 
maybe some people are in the wrong
trophy<00:02:58.710> range<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.130> I<00:02:59.700> wish<00:03:00.030> I<00:03:00.150> had<00:03:00.300> some

the loot system right now but if I find
like<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.330> sweet<00:03:06.660> spot<00:03:06.870> to<00:03:07.170> find<00:03:07.350> resources<00:03:08.070> I'll

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
like a sweet spot to find resources I'll

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.340 
like a sweet spot to find resources I'll
let<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.760> know<00:03:08.790> currently<00:03:09.540> right<00:03:09.750> now<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.930> sit

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
let you know currently right now I sit

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.740 
let you know currently right now I sit
around<00:03:10.490> 1,300<00:03:11.490> trophies<00:03:11.850> at<00:03:11.970> townhall<00:03:12.180> 8<00:03:12.510> it's

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
around 1,300 trophies at townhall 8 it's

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.450 
around 1,300 trophies at townhall 8 it's
worked<00:03:12.930> really<00:03:13.140> well<00:03:13.260> for<00:03:13.410> me<00:03:13.590> it<00:03:13.950> might<00:03:14.280> work

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
worked really well for me it might work

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.430 
worked really well for me it might work
pretty<00:03:14.670> well<00:03:14.760> for<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:15.180> but<00:03:16.020> you<00:03:16.080> sort<00:03:16.290> of<00:03:16.320> just

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
pretty well for you but you sort of just

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.770 
pretty well for you but you sort of just
have<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.680> take<00:03:16.890> around<00:03:17.160> and<00:03:17.460> see<00:03:17.730> what<00:03:18.540> works

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
have to take around and see what works

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.390 
have to take around and see what works
because<00:03:19.110> a<00:03:19.140> lot<00:03:19.320> of<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.500> time<00:03:19.680> yeah<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:19.980> do<00:03:20.160> have

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
because a lot of the time yeah I do have

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.949 
because a lot of the time yeah I do have
to<00:03:20.520> search<00:03:20.700> for<00:03:20.880> awhile<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.330> find<00:03:21.450> my<00:03:21.600> bases

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
to search for awhile to find my bases

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.810 
to search for awhile to find my bases
but<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.830> works<00:03:23.010> out<00:03:23.160> pretty<00:03:23.250> well<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.670> end

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
but it works out pretty well in the end

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.540 
but it works out pretty well in the end
and<00:03:24.030> I<00:03:24.090> see<00:03:24.270> a<00:03:24.300> pretty<00:03:24.540> big<00:03:24.750> profit<00:03:25.220> yeah<00:03:26.220> so<00:03:26.520> I

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
and I see a pretty big profit yeah so I

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:27.680 
and I see a pretty big profit yeah so I
guess<00:03:26.700> that's<00:03:26.820> it<00:03:26.970> for<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.239> lose<00:03:27.360> system

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
guess that's it for the lose system

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.300 
guess that's it for the lose system
today<00:03:27.900> I'll<00:03:28.080> probably<00:03:28.350> talk<00:03:28.620> more<00:03:28.650> about<00:03:28.980> it

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
today I'll probably talk more about it

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.040 
today I'll probably talk more about it
in<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.430> weeks<00:03:29.670> coming<00:03:30.000> up<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.330> I<00:03:30.750> can<00:03:30.900> make<00:03:31.020> a

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
in the weeks coming up and I can make a

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.710 
in the weeks coming up and I can make a
full<00:03:31.350> evaluation<00:03:31.760> if<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.940> stayed<00:03:33.239> how<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.600> is

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
full evaluation if it stayed how it is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.000 
full evaluation if it stayed how it is
right<00:03:33.959> now<00:03:34.110> I<00:03:34.140> guess<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.530> would<00:03:34.620> be<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.739> little

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
right now I guess I would be a little

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.590 
right now I guess I would be a little
bit<00:03:35.070> unhappy<00:03:35.400> because<00:03:35.790> I<00:03:35.970> thought<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.510> would

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
bit unhappy because I thought it would

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.540 
bit unhappy because I thought it would
sort<00:03:36.810> of<00:03:36.870> change<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.320> and<00:03:37.470> make<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.010> easier<00:03:38.430> to

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
sort of change it and make it easier to

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.040 
sort of change it and make it easier to
find<00:03:38.700> good<00:03:38.910> loot<00:03:39.090> whereas<00:03:39.390> it's<00:03:39.540> taken<00:03:39.870> a

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
find good loot whereas it's taken a

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.750 
find good loot whereas it's taken a
little<00:03:40.200> bit<00:03:40.290> more<00:03:40.470> effort<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.430> will<00:03:41.640> give

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
little bit more effort but I will give

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.430 
little bit more effort but I will give
you<00:03:41.880> guys<00:03:42.030> an<00:03:42.209> update<00:03:42.330> maybe<00:03:42.780> two<00:03:43.080> weeks<00:03:43.290> from

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.060 
now on my final thoughts and we can talk
about<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.350> see<00:03:46.530> if<00:03:46.620> there's<00:03:46.739> going<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.010> be

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
about it and see if there's going to be

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.860 
about it and see if there's going to be
any<00:03:47.280> changes<00:03:47.700> because<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.060> know<00:03:48.120> if<00:03:48.480> it<00:03:48.600> doesn't

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
any changes because I know if it doesn't

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.390 
any changes because I know if it doesn't
go<00:03:48.959> well<00:03:48.989> I've<00:03:49.350> talked<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.680> Jonas<00:03:50.010> I've<00:03:50.220> talked

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
go well I've talked to Jonas I've talked

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.310 
go well I've talked to Jonas I've talked
to<00:03:50.489> other<00:03:50.610> members<00:03:50.970> at<00:03:51.120> supercell<00:03:51.630> they<00:03:52.170> are

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
to other members at supercell they are

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.930 
to other members at supercell they are
willing<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.800> open<00:03:52.980> to<00:03:53.130> change<00:03:53.430> it<00:03:53.580> if<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.820> does

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
willing and open to change it if it does

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.760 
willing and open to change it if it does
not<00:03:54.090> work<00:03:54.330> the<00:03:54.600> point<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.140> update<00:03:55.470> was<00:03:55.650> to

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
not work the point of the update was to

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.680 
not work the point of the update was to
make<00:03:55.890> loot<00:03:56.130> better<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.580> if<00:03:57.150> it's<00:03:57.300> making<00:03:57.450> it

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
make loot better and if it's making it

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.690 
make loot better and if it's making it
worse<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:58.290> think<00:03:58.590> they<00:03:58.950> will<00:03:59.070> definitely<00:03:59.489> be

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
worse I think they will definitely be

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.240 
worse I think they will definitely be
very<00:04:00.000> open<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:01.020> changing<00:04:01.350> it<00:04:01.440> ok<00:04:01.980> so<00:04:02.040> that's

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
very open to changing it ok so that's

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.800 
very open to changing it ok so that's
enough<00:04:02.310> for<00:04:02.580> the<00:04:02.640> loose<00:04:02.760> system<00:04:03.090> looking<00:04:03.690> at

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
enough for the loose system looking at

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.150 
enough for the loose system looking at
the<00:04:03.870> rates<00:04:04.050> today<00:04:04.320> I've<00:04:04.500> been<00:04:04.590> using<00:04:04.800> a<00:04:04.950> little

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
the rates today I've been using a little

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.560 
the rates today I've been using a little
bit<00:04:05.280> of<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.430> Giant<00:04:05.700> Killer<00:04:05.790> strategy<00:04:06.330> I've

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
bit of the Giant Killer strategy I've

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:07.280 
bit of the Giant Killer strategy I've
really<00:04:06.840> enjoyed<00:04:06.930> it

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
really enjoyed it

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.949 
really enjoyed it
I<00:04:07.410> found<00:04:08.130> again<00:04:08.520> some<00:04:08.730> good<00:04:08.910> bases<00:04:09.360> and<00:04:09.690> most

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
I found again some good bases and most

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.420 
I found again some good bases and most
of<00:04:10.140> them<00:04:10.260> really<00:04:10.530> weren't<00:04:10.800> set<00:04:11.070> up<00:04:11.190> to<00:04:11.340> be

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
of them really weren't set up to be

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.430 
of them really weren't set up to be
attacked<00:04:11.730> by<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:11.880> giant<00:04:12.239> healer<00:04:12.510> like<00:04:13.260> this

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
attacked by the giant healer like this

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.190 
attacked by the giant healer like this
guy<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:13.620> think<00:04:13.800> he<00:04:14.070> had<00:04:14.220> level<00:04:14.550> like<00:04:15.120> for<00:04:15.390> level

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
guy I think he had level like for level

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.570 
guy I think he had level like for level
4<00:04:16.350> air<00:04:16.470> defence<00:04:16.769> in<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:16.980> center<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.280> his<00:04:17.370> base

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
4 air defence in the center of his base

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.070 
4 air defence in the center of his base
so<00:04:17.790> it<00:04:17.880> wasn't<00:04:18.120> a<00:04:18.180> great<00:04:18.330> base<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.540> attack<00:04:18.900> but

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
so it wasn't a great base to attack but

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.680 
so it wasn't a great base to attack but
I<00:04:19.109> still<00:04:19.350> stole<00:04:19.700> 400,000<00:04:20.700> resources<00:04:21.239> so<00:04:21.450> not

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
I still stole 400,000 resources so not

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.330 
I still stole 400,000 resources so not
too<00:04:21.810> many<00:04:21.900> worries<00:04:22.200> there<00:04:22.410> let's<00:04:23.250> go<00:04:23.310> ahead

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
too many worries there let's go ahead

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.920 
too many worries there let's go ahead
and<00:04:23.580> see<00:04:23.760> if<00:04:23.789> we<00:04:23.910> can<00:04:24.090> find<00:04:24.240> in<00:04:24.419> one<00:04:24.600> more<00:04:24.750> base

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
and see if we can find in one more base

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.270 
and see if we can find in one more base
and<00:04:25.169> I<00:04:25.229> think<00:04:25.470> this<00:04:25.590> should<00:04:25.740> be<00:04:25.800> not<00:04:26.100> good

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
and I think this should be not good

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.530 
and I think this should be not good
enough<00:04:26.490> to<00:04:26.669> get<00:04:26.820> us<00:04:26.970> the

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
enough to get us the

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.270 
enough to get us the
the<00:04:27.750> gold<00:04:27.960> for<00:04:28.260> our<00:04:28.440> archer<00:04:28.770> tower<00:04:28.920> upgrade

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
the gold for our archer tower upgrade

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.700 
the gold for our archer tower upgrade
okay<00:04:29.880> so<00:04:29.940> he<00:04:30.210> is<00:04:30.240> about<00:04:30.600> four<00:04:31.020> hundred<00:04:31.170> and

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
okay so he is about four hundred and

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.320 
okay so he is about four hundred and
forty<00:04:31.950> thousand<00:04:32.520> gold<00:04:32.640> avail<00:04:32.820> or<00:04:32.970> four

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
forty thousand gold avail or four

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.520 
forty thousand gold avail or four
hundred<00:04:33.570> forty<00:04:33.750> thousand<00:04:34.080> resources

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
hundred forty thousand resources

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.500 
hundred forty thousand resources
available<00:04:34.890> I<00:04:35.040> only<00:04:35.670> need<00:04:35.910> one<00:04:36.000> hundred<00:04:36.090> fifty

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
available I only need one hundred fifty

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.000 
available I only need one hundred fifty
thousand<00:04:36.840> gold<00:04:37.050> so<00:04:37.290> let's<00:04:37.470> see<00:04:37.650> if<00:04:37.770> we<00:04:37.860> can

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
thousand gold so let's see if we can

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.340 
thousand gold so let's see if we can
steal<00:04:38.250> some<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.760> think<00:04:39.420> most<00:04:39.750> of<00:04:39.900> it<00:04:40.020> will<00:04:40.200> be

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
steal some I think most of it will be

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.990 
steal some I think most of it will be
inside<00:04:40.770> of<00:04:40.950> the<00:04:41.070> gold<00:04:41.280> mines<00:04:41.490> so<00:04:41.730> that's<00:04:41.880> all

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
inside of the gold mines so that's all

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.700 
inside of the gold mines so that's all
I'm<00:04:42.090> going<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.270> go<00:04:42.390> for<00:04:42.600> today<00:04:42.720> let<00:04:43.560> me<00:04:43.620> go

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
base I sort of noticed that with like

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.570 
base I sort of noticed that with like
the<00:04:55.110> fact<00:04:55.320> that<00:04:55.440> people<00:04:55.740> could<00:04:55.950> steal<00:04:56.220> three

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
the fact that people could steal three

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.950 
the fact that people could steal three
hundred<00:04:56.850> thousand<00:04:57.210> from<00:04:57.330> my<00:04:57.420> storage<00:04:57.660> is<00:04:57.810> now

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
hundred thousand from my storage is now

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.200 
hundred thousand from my storage is now
it<00:04:58.620> used<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:58.950> be<00:04:59.070> my<00:04:59.190> elixir<00:04:59.460> storages<00:05:00.090> were

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
it used to be my elixir storages were

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.060 
it used to be my elixir storages were
full<00:05:00.450> all<00:05:00.690> the<00:05:00.870> time<00:05:01.080> but<00:05:01.290> now<00:05:01.470> they<00:05:01.740> they<00:05:02.010> do

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
them back up on these raids but it used

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.100 
them back up on these raids but it used
to<00:05:05.820> be<00:05:05.910> in<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.090> let's<00:05:06.270> play<00:05:06.390> series<00:05:06.780> when<00:05:06.990> my

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
to be in the let's play series when my

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.930 
to be in the let's play series when my
elixir<00:05:07.500> storage<00:05:07.560> was<00:05:07.890> full<00:05:08.100> that<00:05:08.610> I<00:05:08.640> wouldn't

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
elixir storage was full that I wouldn't

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.370 
elixir storage was full that I wouldn't
even<00:05:09.030> worry<00:05:09.270> about<00:05:09.330> elixir<00:05:09.840> because<00:05:09.960> I<00:05:10.110> knew<00:05:10.350> I

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
even worry about elixir because I knew I

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.080 
even worry about elixir because I knew I
would<00:05:10.620> get<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:10.830> back<00:05:10.950> from<00:05:11.190> my<00:05:11.400> elixir<00:05:11.670> pumps

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
would get it back from my elixir pumps

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:13.550 
would get it back from my elixir pumps
but<00:05:12.300> it<00:05:12.480> looks<00:05:12.660> like<00:05:12.720> now<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:12.990> do<00:05:13.230> have<00:05:13.470> to

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
but it looks like now I do have to

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.440 
but it looks like now I do have to
attack<00:05:13.860> the<00:05:14.040> the<00:05:14.310> open<00:05:14.880> pumps<00:05:15.210> I<00:05:15.270> guess<00:05:15.420> a

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
attack the the open pumps I guess a

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.540 
attack the the open pumps I guess a
little<00:05:15.720> bit<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.560> try<00:05:16.710> to<00:05:16.770> recuperate<00:05:17.250> that

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
little bit to try to recuperate that

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.610 
little bit to try to recuperate that
elixir<00:05:17.840> from<00:05:18.840> those<00:05:19.050> attacks<00:05:19.350> I've<00:05:19.530> been

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
elixir from those attacks I've been

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.380 
elixir from those attacks I've been
having<00:05:19.890> alright<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:20.970> let<00:05:21.060> me<00:05:21.090> go<00:05:21.180> ahead<00:05:21.210> and

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
having alright so let me go ahead and

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.370 
having alright so let me go ahead and
wrap<00:05:21.480> it<00:05:21.600> up<00:05:21.690> I'm<00:05:21.780> gonna<00:05:21.900> steal<00:05:22.080> some<00:05:22.230> of<00:05:22.260> these

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.230 
wrap it up I'm gonna steal some of these
elixir<00:05:22.770> I<00:05:22.800> already<00:05:23.280> I<00:05:23.400> already<00:05:23.670> have<00:05:24.000> enough

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 
elixir I already I already have enough

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.970 
elixir I already I already have enough
to<00:05:24.390> do<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.660> Archer<00:05:25.230> tower<00:05:25.260> upgrade<00:05:25.740> from<00:05:25.830> the

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
to do the Archer tower upgrade from the

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.050 
to do the Archer tower upgrade from the
gold<00:05:26.190> so<00:05:26.400> I'm<00:05:26.520> just<00:05:26.610> going<00:05:26.760> to<00:05:26.790> drop<00:05:26.940> a<00:05:26.970> few

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
gold so I'm just going to drop a few

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.360 
gold so I'm just going to drop a few
more<00:05:27.270> of<00:05:27.450> my<00:05:27.540> troops<00:05:27.870> try<00:05:28.590> my<00:05:28.710> barbarians<00:05:29.220> drop

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
more of my troops try my barbarians drop

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.070 
more of my troops try my barbarians drop
my<00:05:29.460> archers<00:05:29.850> drop<00:05:30.090> all<00:05:30.210> that<00:05:30.240> stuff<00:05:30.630> and<00:05:30.900> it

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
my archers drop all that stuff and it

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.690 
my archers drop all that stuff and it
should<00:05:31.260> be<00:05:31.350> enough<00:05:31.590> to<00:05:31.620> get<00:05:32.130> close<00:05:32.340> to<00:05:32.520> filling

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:32.700 
should be enough to get close to filling

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.000 
should be enough to get close to filling
up<00:05:32.910> my<00:05:33.030> elixir<00:05:33.270> storage<00:05:33.450> if<00:05:34.380> not<00:05:34.590> all<00:05:34.770> of<00:05:34.890> it

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
up my elixir storage if not all of it

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.740 
up my elixir storage if not all of it
okay<00:05:35.160> so<00:05:35.850> I<00:05:35.880> think<00:05:36.000> that's<00:05:36.270> gonna<00:05:36.360> do<00:05:36.570> it<00:05:36.660> for

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
okay so I think that's gonna do it for

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.950 
okay so I think that's gonna do it for
this<00:05:36.840> raid<00:05:37.050> I'm<00:05:37.200> at<00:05:37.320> about<00:05:37.500> 39<00:05:38.100> 41<00:05:38.940> percent<00:05:39.420> 43

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
this raid I'm at about 39 41 percent 43

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.040 
this raid I'm at about 39 41 percent 43
percent<00:05:40.790> trying<00:05:41.790> to<00:05:42.000> get<00:05:42.150> fifty<00:05:42.480> percent<00:05:42.840> I

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
percent trying to get fifty percent I

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.200 
percent trying to get fifty percent I
