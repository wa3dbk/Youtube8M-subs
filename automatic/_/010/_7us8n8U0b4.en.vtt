00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
your starting point you can do that you

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.919 
your starting point you can do that you
can<00:00:49.710> enter<00:00:49.949> this<00:00:50.100> information<00:00:50.480> one<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.510> three

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:51.929 
can enter this information one of three

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:55.669 
can enter this information one of three
ways<00:00:52.170> you<00:00:53.179> can<00:00:54.179> manually<00:00:54.660> enter<00:00:54.929> the<00:00:55.199> latitude

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
ways you can manually enter the latitude

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.529 
ways you can manually enter the latitude
longitude<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:57.480> can<00:00:57.629> go<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:58.019> map<00:00:59.539> search

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
longitude you can go to the map search

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.370 
longitude you can go to the map search
for<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> location<00:01:01.440> by<00:01:01.589> keyword<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:03.839> can<00:01:03.989> access

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:04.380 
for a location by keyword you can access

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.380 
for a location by keyword you can access
your<00:01:04.590> current<00:01:05.040> location<00:01:05.220> or<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:06.030> can<00:01:06.180> just

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
your current location or you can just

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.190 
your current location or you can just
tap<00:01:06.660> on<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:06.960> point<00:01:07.380> on<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.490> map<00:01:08.930> and<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.080> will

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
tap on a point on the map and it will

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.960 
tap on a point on the map and it will
populate<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.890> longitude<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.490> latitude

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:13.970 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.980 

now<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.120> enter<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.810> distance<00:01:16.290> say<00:01:17.990> 275

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
now you just enter your distance say 275

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.620 
now you just enter your distance say 275
miles<00:01:19.970> and<00:01:20.970> we'll<00:01:21.150> go<00:01:21.300> 180<00:01:21.960> degrees<00:01:22.530> due<00:01:22.860> south

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
miles and we'll go 180 degrees due south

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.040 
miles and we'll go 180 degrees due south
hit<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.780> result<00:01:25.880> it'll<00:01:26.880> calculate<00:01:27.150> where

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
hit the result it'll calculate where

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.610 
hit the result it'll calculate where
you'll<00:01:28.230> be<00:01:28.670> traveling<00:01:29.670> 270<00:01:30.510> miles<00:01:30.690> at<00:01:31.440> a

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:31.620 
you'll be traveling 270 miles at a

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.400 
you'll be traveling 270 miles at a
heading<00:01:31.980> of<00:01:32.100> 180<00:01:32.640> degrees<00:01:33.180> give<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.140> your

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
heading of 180 degrees give you your

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.890 
heading of 180 degrees give you your
latitude<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.010> longitude<00:01:35.550> then<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.750> go

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
latitude and longitude then you can go

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.680 
latitude and longitude then you can go
on<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> map<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.520> map<00:01:38.820> view<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
on the map and get a map view of that

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.920 
on the map and get a map view of that
distance<00:01:40.260> and<00:01:40.500> where<00:01:40.980> you<00:01:41.130> would<00:01:41.340> be<00:01:44.930> you've

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
distance and where you would be you've

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.200 
distance and where you would be you've
got<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.290> distance<00:01:46.770> calculator<00:01:47.370> that

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
got the distance calculator that

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.210 
got the distance calculator that
calculates<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.200> distance<00:01:49.440> between<00:01:49.830> two

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
calculates the distance between two

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.890 
calculates the distance between two
points<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.790> again<00:01:51.150> you<00:01:51.300> can<00:01:51.450> enter<00:01:51.660> the

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
points and again you can enter the

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.620 
points and again you can enter the
points<00:01:52.380> by<00:01:53.160> just<00:01:53.880> manually<00:01:54.270> enter<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
points by just manually enter the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.590 
points by just manually enter the
latitude<00:01:55.290> longitude<00:01:55.550> go<00:01:56.550> to<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> map<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.330> find

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
latitude longitude go to the map to find

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.880 
latitude longitude go to the map to find
it<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:57.990> use<00:01:58.260> your<00:01:58.470> current<00:01:58.740> location<00:02:00.890> you've

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
it or use your current location you've

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.100 
it or use your current location you've
got<00:02:02.070> an<00:02:02.190> area<00:02:02.720> tool<00:02:05.030> where<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.060> can<00:02:06.150> find<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
got an area tool where you can find and

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.020 
got an area tool where you can find and
create<00:02:07.410> an<00:02:07.950> area<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:09.500> calculate<00:02:10.500> how<00:02:10.710> much

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
create an area and calculate how much

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.730 
create an area and calculate how much
room<00:02:13.030> isn't<00:02:13.270> within<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.110> are<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.380> gonna<00:02:14.560> do

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
room isn't within it so are you gonna do

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.670 
room isn't within it so are you gonna do
is<00:02:15.090> hit<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.120> couple<00:02:16.330> of<00:02:16.540> points<00:02:16.930> on<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.140> map<00:02:17.320> to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
is hit a couple of points on the map to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.240 
is hit a couple of points on the map to
create<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.250> area<00:02:18.760> hit<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.870> calculate<00:02:20.250> it'll

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
create that area hit the calculate it'll

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.010 
create that area hit the calculate it'll
tell<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.550> how<00:02:21.580> many<00:02:21.700> acres<00:02:22.090> how<00:02:22.540> many<00:02:22.720> square

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
tell you how many acres how many square

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.500 
tell you how many acres how many square
miles<00:02:23.230> square<00:02:23.920> meters<00:02:24.370> or<00:02:24.670> within<00:02:25.210> those

miles square meters or within those

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.280 
miles square meters or within those
three<00:02:25.810> points<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:27.510> have<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> conversion<00:02:28.930> tool

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
three points you have a conversion tool

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.790 
three points you have a conversion tool
that'll<00:02:29.560> take<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.860> degrees<00:02:31.680> version<00:02:32.680> of

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
that'll take the degrees version of

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.860 
that'll take the degrees version of
longitude<00:02:33.310> latitude<00:02:33.520> and<00:02:34.120> convert<00:02:34.450> it<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.750> the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
longitude latitude and convert it to the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.780
