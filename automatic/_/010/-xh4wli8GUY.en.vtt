00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.180
 we have lived here I am 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.130
 if you do not like my singing like I came from memory 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.130
 this time talking about a game that belongs to the mega drive is nothing 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.409
 more than explain anything 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:13.399
 by willie walsh 

00:00:13.399 --> 00:00:17.349
 a game that has a connection hates with table games so I do not 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:20.289
 I will feel in a foreign place when narrating about India 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.490
 they call me the killers is a game developed by capcom in 1994 for the 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.560
 16-13 console public address 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.159
 also known as sega genesis and was a well-known game in Japanese Paschal 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.680
 martÃ­nez aguayo 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.250
 the title consists 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.600
 between the first three games they call him that they came out for purposes with graphics and 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.810
 music totally updated and improvements 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.100
 a true gem for the fans but it was shared 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.380
 the conversions respect the difficulty as much as possible 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.110
 these secretaries of the games 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.860
 final but at the same time we are improving both visually and aurally 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.270
 the graphics take advantage 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.460
 or to maximize the capabilities of the system and the environment plus the scenarios of 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.950
 most stubborn robots 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.410
 more details and redesign of people 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.950
 the music also respected 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.600
 with their respective hearing improvements that also take advantage of the capabilities 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.700
 of the month of April 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.030
 at the beginning of the game after an intro that is nothing like that 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.180
 will give us to choose which of the first three the caller of Moscow 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.590
 the title tells us already with those known passwords of the balls 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.630
 characteristics of the mega man of the country but it does have a battery 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.450
 internal that allows you to save the progress to continue when we are 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.390
 please without having to finish the game end to end 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.170
 the scenes are exactly the same and in addition to the improvements both to the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.280
 victims like practices the games 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.340
 the filis the novelty to highlight but go novelty 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.420
 the fun of the game is not just finished the three versions since 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.080
 capcom was responsible for hosting new screens with new bosses for 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.810
 defeat them for which they were fixed are the three strange dates that appear 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.990
 the amount of super famicom miguel boyer starts when we grab the parishioners 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.319
 Carlos Ramirez 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.349
 our gil doctor's strength and with some more scenes 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.609
 these scenes new curtains details of the three games both enemies and 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.560
 obstacles inside the screen and they are quite hidden simply 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.669
 you must have finished the three original titles to access them 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:30.639
 are seven scenes are not many but better this than nothing and more for a game 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:31.799
 of that time 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.620
 the very interesting is that before starting each of these scenes 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.529
 new dr the time gives us the possibility to choose three items of 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:43.299
 all there are in the three classics the three then 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.329
 the three items of mega man 2 and the item m of the mega man 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:49.729
 and at about 22 in addition to more robberies in this school 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:54.569
 I found it great to choose the best weapons based on criteria of 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.519
 each for dogs 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.809
 they mainly 

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:02.349
 Soothing jaume quite powerful the delay in getting married and I recommend them 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.679

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:06.009
 mangado 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:07.699
 Unlike 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.069
 to access certain 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.069
 It is not like this 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.069
 I take off my hat 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:20.689

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.629
 good as it was also his neighborhood not be superior at the time and 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.389
 many times superior nicky hayden tripkovic also that his permission 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.969
 the material about 

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:37.489

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.489
 maple with arrests 

00:03:41.119 --> 00:03:44.509
 I remain general 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.479
 they need so many graphic retouching 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.479
 two excellent both graphic and 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:52.680
 Returning to the goal Manuel Neuer 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.789
 the Supreme 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.789
 pfizer 3 titles of a salaried employee 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:59.249
