00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.710
 hello kids you're watching without 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.200
 that and I come to tell the last 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.580
 new features of windows 10 the build subtopic 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.259
 that you presented this past week and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.940
 let's count more or less Christmas 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.139
 that they have counted and the things that are 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.390
 new and when it's going to be presented 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.650
 windows 10 and for how much country and in 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.930
 how many languages there would be no news 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.550
 continue, I'm not going to tell you a 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.710
 little bit of what is this smartphone tutti 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.500
 with windows 10 your mobile phone tulum 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.180
 already spent working with your phone but 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.040
 you get home and from this I want to continue 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.840
 working I'm doing in a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 Creator screen directly in CÃ¡ceres 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.680
 the cable or with wifi and it 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.750
 would transform directly into 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.890
 desktop on screen all 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.720
 applications for example office that 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.270
 these have a format made for 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.040
 mobile phones would be transformed to the format of 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.870
 computer and would continue with the work that 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.090
 I was doing either a message or 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 well working on a word document or 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.610
 well doing anything 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.079
 directly he would continue working in 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.070
 your computer so that all this follows 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.989
 It serves to record what I have told you 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.270
 you are with your smartphone images of 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.220
 Android all your smartphone on an iphone 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.079
 is doing anything but you get 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.810
 home and you have last said back 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:08.969
 to open the mail the office all this is 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.870
 as if it will continue will continue this 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.550
 way 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.020
 making a movie if you want to do 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.660
 anything that movie can you 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.100
 throw to the computer and that your children see 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.600
 the movie on the computer or the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.920
 television screen and you the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.900
 background could continue 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.580
 working with your smartphone another of the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.960
 news is sport like is a screen 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.910
 start on the typical start screen 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.620
 you have on your computer but it's going 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.790
 throwing notifications you like by 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.100
 example this you are seeing is a 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.470
 heart if you like it if you do not like it 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.270
 suggests other other screens if by 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.070
 example you 've never used cover you 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.390
 says that you use cortana they created 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.250
 suggestions so you get the most 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.530
 world 10 performance but it's not the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.480
 typical tired notification that by 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.040
 example of yours get shorter says use cortana 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.380
 that I'm already using short no no no this 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.150
 is if you have never used cortana they send you 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.830
 below if not a case using 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.300
 word sends you the notification but one 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.920
 once you use it or that you already 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.330
 said that we are going to use it no longer 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.980
 I have that is more than throws 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.110
 information if you give notifications 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.640
 for youtube take them out and squeeze well the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.780
 maximum performance of windows 10 that 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.790
 it's pretty good because sometimes that 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.960
 things that we do not know and says this that 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.840
 you do like this you could do it from another 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.550
 way and it's really fine 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.660
 applications we complained that it is not 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.280
 that a windows there are not many 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.590
 applications because the best ones are in 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.510
 I am the best is in android forget 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.980
 of those codes this is a good 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.140
 news for the development of that code 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.450
 we can directly transfer our 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.790
 our application code in ios or in 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.709
 Android directly pass it to windows 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.180
 phone as this well very easy 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.340
 points form windows days is very easy 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.260
 have as a code translator in 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.670
 android so I understand by 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.470
 what you talked to developers 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.600
 that have started playing this platform 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.069
 you have to modify a bit of code 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.739
 you that useful your application in android 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.390
 obligation or your game and that launched it 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.130
 directly to the windows platform 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.959
 and we will have to modify some small 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.550
 things but you do not have to directly 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.530
 rewrite all the code without 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.700
 However, the clients of this is the 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.590
 person who has developed 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.810
 applications or games for it is for 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.310
 iphone that code can directly be 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.959
 copy directly in fact there is a 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.190
 game that is monument valley that is 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.019
 both for android she 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.519
 directly collect the complete code 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.930
 of it is the world forum would be 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.519
 directly the game I 'm going to leave 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.530
 over here the link to windows phone for 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.690
 that those who have a lumia and play and 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.700
 You see that it is the same as the 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.170
 ios version of what it means going 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.850
 to get applications to more than a thousand 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.960
 million devices you have 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.910
 listened well 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.670
 millions of mobile devices 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:26.290
 tablet computer smartphone because 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.030
 everyone pretty much works with 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.830
 windows you can have an android type 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.570
 stern iphone but with her this house what 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.510
 normal is that you have a computer with 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.150
 windows heroes all applications 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.140
 twitter whatsapp facebook all all no 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.150
 it will be the overnight will 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.620
 see a tour because the 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.970
 April ios developers that 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.980
 pick up that code and copy directly 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.630
 to have your application in windows but 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.980
 it is no longer to have an operation one 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.720
 application for windows not directly 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.880
 implication that I have then it hits me 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.890
 order I have on iphone I take the code 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.630
 that I have transferred it directly and 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.710
 I have the application for windows 10 that 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.360
 is what has happened with application of 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.090
 twitter the twitter application that you 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.740
 You see windows, it's not very good 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.630
 implemented but if you take the 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.310
 twitter application of windows 10 the 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.620
 of windows 10 that I have windows 10 in 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.170
 the computer and the twitter relationship is 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.850
 identical to the one of iphone good if you have 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.250
 identical inside it looks a lot like 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.750
 with the sidebar with what they change 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.130
 the users it seems quite I think 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.780
 that in directly copied the code 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.790
 other glasses that you have is that you 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.010
 it's your phone and you're working with 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.200
 he thing what we have told continuous what 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.830
 that we have previously told 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.599
 to home 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.830
 This is Colorado but this sounds the 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:33.530
 personal whatsapp twitter and all that 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:36.139
 you have to do it on your mobile or open up 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:38.300
 a screen with facebook with the 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:39.849
 twitter and do it from there with windows 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.139
 10 not because that connects directly 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:44.930
 but it's like your application directly 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.639
 it's not that I open the explorer and open and 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.319
 twitter or is not an application of 

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.699
 twitter is a facebook application is 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.379
 the application directly is the 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:53.990
 Youtube application is the application 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.759
 directly is like an extension of your 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.289
 mobile phone another novelty that has 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:59.030
 presented is the evolution of support 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:00.650
 spartan spartan project that is the new 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.060
 browser that will no longer be internet 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.759
 explorer but it's not going to be called 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.919
 final is going to call microsoft is a 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.539
 curve in the curve means why not 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.120
 has borders does not have frames do not have 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.159
 no frame if you see the design is 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.900
 very minimalist without any frame is 

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:16.280
 pretty pretty pretty good and 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.830
 it is also complemented with cutting us 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.969
 high submit and tell me look for this now 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.740
 we're going to have the keyboard touched 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:23.810
 touch keyboard so anything 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.789
 but for example open me youtube open up 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.229
 is the video to promise sends a 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.180
 twitter message all that we can 

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.979
 say with voice commands speaking if 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.389
 I have to be writing an authentic 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.460
 happens then if you have a screen that is 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.319
 touch or you have a surface 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.539
 because it is directly write you can 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.669
 choose with a finger with a pen and 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.650
 highlight web pages to write and do 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.210
 notes the second one is going to be a pass of 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.500
 Fact has not presented any phone 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.000
 because I think they're going to wait for 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.349
 is launched directly to present a 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.419
 flagship is clearly good 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.580
 michael but when it arrives it is 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:54.500
 short arrives for summer so now no 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.000
 will get windows 10 for after the 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.380
 summer get to windows 10 for the 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.849
 smartphone but to computers for 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.289
 the fish will arrive this summer so 

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:01.580
 this summer we already have windows 10 yo 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:03.889
 I have the premium version to the 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.330
 preview version the garage quite well 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.759
 said installed the sony vegas for 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.009
 avoid being the photos or stardust the efes 

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:11.479
 and it works perfectly m3 yes but it's 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.820
 that my country comes out afterwards is not going to 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:17.210
 leave for almost 200 countries for more than 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:18.860
 190 countries and in 111 languages ââthat you do not 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.599
 you can lose is this version of 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.000
 windows is going to be a pass to be 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.440
 unification of all the windows you have to 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.729
 wait a little bit so that all
