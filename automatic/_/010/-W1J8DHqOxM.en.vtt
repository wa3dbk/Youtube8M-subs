right now as you can see I've got a coil

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.350 
right now as you can see I've got a coil
of<00:01:44.549> copper<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:45.119> which<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.259> covered<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:47.360> like

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
of copper here which is covered in like

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.639 
of copper here which is covered in like
a<00:01:48.390> cellulose<00:01:49.110> based<00:01:49.470> paper<00:01:50.180> product<00:01:51.649> it's

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
a cellulose based paper product it's

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.060 
a cellulose based paper product it's
just<00:01:52.860> literally<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.570> paper<00:01:55.380> insulation

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
just literally like a paper insulation

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.550 
just literally like a paper insulation
and<00:01:57.049> I've<00:01:58.049> also<00:01:58.560> got<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.899> few<00:02:00.899> sticks<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.350> this

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and I've also got a few sticks of this

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.980 
and I've also got a few sticks of this
stuff<00:02:01.799> here<00:02:02.100> which<00:02:02.340> again<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.479> same

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
stuff here which again is the same

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.249 
stuff here which again is the same
cellulose<00:02:04.740> based<00:02:04.979> product<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.420> laminated

you<00:02:13.680> can<00:02:13.860> see<00:02:14.100> there<00:02:15.500> I've<00:02:16.500> got<00:02:16.530> some<00:02:16.830> larger

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
you can see there I've got some larger

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.060 
you can see there I've got some larger
ones<00:02:17.850> or<00:02:18.660> put<00:02:18.990> away<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:19.500> yeah<00:02:19.650> they're<00:02:19.890> about

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
ones or put away but yeah they're about

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.850 
ones or put away but yeah they're about
two<00:02:20.670> or<00:02:20.730> three<00:02:20.790> ml<00:02:21.090> thick<00:02:22.130> now<00:02:23.130> all<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.520> those

mineral oil that they insulate their

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.120 
mineral oil that they insulate their
transformers<00:02:30.180> with<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.680> I've<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:31.860> got<00:02:32.010> to

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
transformers with and I've just got to

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.460 
transformers with and I've just got to
drop<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.550> tin<00:02:32.970> off<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:33.660> guy<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.230> he's

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
drop a tin off to this guy and he's

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.160 
drop a tin off to this guy and he's
gonna<00:02:34.650> give<00:02:34.890> me<00:02:34.920> a<00:02:35.310> 5<00:02:35.880> liter<00:02:36.060> tint<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.690> mineral

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
gonna give me a 5 liter tint of mineral

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.280 
gonna give me a 5 liter tint of mineral
oil<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:39.510> I'll<00:02:39.600> be<00:02:39.690> able<00:02:39.780> to<00:02:39.930> make<00:02:40.080> my<00:02:40.260> own

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
oil so I'll be able to make my own

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.460 
oil so I'll be able to make my own
transformers<00:02:41.010> now<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.930> other<00:02:42.930> thing<00:02:43.230> is<00:02:43.440> that

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
transformers now the other thing is that

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.330 
transformers now the other thing is that
this<00:02:43.709> copper<00:02:44.190> here<00:02:44.490> is<00:02:44.940> not<00:02:45.709> standard<00:02:46.709> cheapo

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
this copper here is not standard cheapo

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.480 
this copper here is not standard cheapo
copper<00:02:47.790> it's<00:02:48.300> actually<00:02:48.780> what<00:02:49.110> they<00:02:49.230> call

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.490 
copper it's actually what they call

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.250 
copper it's actually what they call
electrolytic<00:02:50.490> copper<00:02:50.670> which<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.570> a<00:02:52.050> high

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
electrolytic copper which is a high

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.990 
electrolytic copper which is a high
purity<00:02:52.440> copper<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.160> has<00:02:53.370> been<00:02:53.640> purified

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
purity copper that has been purified

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.340 
purity copper that has been purified
further<00:02:54.770> by<00:02:55.770> electrolysis<00:02:56.660> so<00:02:57.660> increasing

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
further by electrolysis so increasing

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.710 
further by electrolysis so increasing
its<00:02:58.530> conductivity<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.910> this<00:03:00.090> is<00:03:00.239> good<00:03:00.540> quality

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
its conductivity so this is good quality

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.160 
its conductivity so this is good quality

the<00:03:04.230> other<00:03:04.470> thing<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.770> got<00:03:05.040> when<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.250> was<00:03:05.430> there

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
the other thing I got when I was there

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.550 
the other thing I got when I was there
was<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.410> Nomex

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
was this Nomex

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.330 
was this Nomex
diamond<00:03:08.100> dot<00:03:08.340> paper<00:03:08.870> it<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.530> another<00:03:11.040> form

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
diamond dot paper it is in another form

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.699 
diamond dot paper it is in another form
of<00:03:11.520> insulation<00:03:12.060> which<00:03:12.720> they<00:03:12.900> use<00:03:13.110> between<00:03:13.560> the

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
of insulation which they use between the

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.770 
of insulation which they use between the
layers<00:03:13.950> of<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.700> wines<00:03:14.940> on<00:03:15.360> their

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
layers of the wines on their

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.020 
layers of the wines on their
transformers<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:17.100> during<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.610> bake<00:03:17.790> out

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
transformers and during the bake out

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.170 
transformers and during the bake out
process<00:03:18.540> these<00:03:18.930> little<00:03:19.320> diamond<00:03:19.799> dots

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
process these little diamond dots

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.100 
process these little diamond dots
actually<00:03:21.410> melt<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.709> they<00:03:23.670> adhere<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:24.480> the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
actually melt and they adhere to the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.870 
actually melt and they adhere to the
layers<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.620> your<00:03:26.010> windings<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.700> your

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
layers of your windings in your

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.539 
layers of your windings in your
transformer<00:03:27.510> and<00:03:27.690> therefore<00:03:28.650> hold<00:03:28.980> the

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
transformer and therefore hold the

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.140 
transformer and therefore hold the
windings<00:03:30.000> together<00:03:30.330> nice<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.019> tightly<00:03:32.150> they

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
windings together nice and tightly they

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.940 
windings together nice and tightly they
this<00:03:33.600> sort<00:03:33.930> of<00:03:33.959> stuff<00:03:34.140> ranges<00:03:34.590> in<00:03:34.739> thickness

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
this sort of stuff ranges in thickness

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.220 
this sort of stuff ranges in thickness
from<00:03:35.100> about<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.640> hundred<00:03:36.000> micron<00:03:36.660> up<00:03:36.989> to

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
from about a hundred micron up to

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.850 
from about a hundred micron up to
roughly<00:03:37.650> 700<00:03:38.430> micron<00:03:39.140> this<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.350> one<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.680> the

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
roughly 700 micron this is one of the

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.940 
roughly 700 micron this is one of the
thicker<00:03:41.549> version<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:42.720> it's<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:43.049> very<00:03:43.380> good

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
thicker version so it's a very good

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.210 
thicker version so it's a very good
insulating<00:03:44.549> material<00:03:45.120> and<00:03:45.860> yeah<00:03:46.860> it's<00:03:47.070> good

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
insulating material and yeah it's good

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.870 
insulating material and yeah it's good
stuff<00:03:47.250> got<00:03:47.820> a<00:03:47.850> whole<00:03:48.950> offcut<00:03:49.980> roll<00:03:50.190> of<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.580> so

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
stuff got a whole offcut roll of that so

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.410 
stuff got a whole offcut roll of that so
I<00:03:51.239> think<00:03:51.540> that's<00:03:51.840> roughly<00:03:52.760> 450<00:03:53.760> millimeters

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
I think that's roughly 450 millimeters

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:00.080 
I think that's roughly 450 millimeters
tall<00:03:55.200> and<00:03:55.760> as<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:57.360> can<00:03:57.510> see<00:03:58.549> there<00:03:59.549> would<00:03:59.670> be<00:03:59.730> a

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
tall and as you can see there would be a

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.759 
tall and as you can see there would be a
few<00:04:00.450> meters<00:04:01.190> on<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.519> roll<00:04:03.170> now<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.320> second

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
few meters on that roll now the second

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.039 
few meters on that roll now the second
transformer<00:04:05.459> manufacturer<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.720> went<00:04:06.930> to

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
transformer manufacturer that I went to

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.350 
transformer manufacturer that I went to
visit<00:04:07.260> was<00:04:07.769> not<00:04:07.799> able<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.489> give<00:04:09.090> me<00:04:09.239> any

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
visit was not able to give me any

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.280 
visit was not able to give me any
materials<00:04:10.230> as<00:04:10.470> such<00:04:11.000> they<00:04:12.000> were<00:04:12.260> mainly<00:04:13.260> a

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
materials as such they were mainly a

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.849 
materials as such they were mainly a
batch<00:04:13.760> manufacturing<00:04:14.760> company<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.739> was

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
batch manufacturing company so that was

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.060 
batch manufacturing company so that was
understandable<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:17.729> he<00:04:17.970> did<00:04:18.299> offer<00:04:18.510> me<00:04:18.930> a<00:04:19.109> 500

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
understandable but he did offer me a 500

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.150 
understandable but he did offer me a 500
amp<00:04:20.280> rectifier<00:04:21.180> module<00:04:21.630> it<00:04:22.440> was<00:04:22.560> too<00:04:22.800> big<00:04:23.099> to

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
amp rectifier module it was too big to

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.770 
amp rectifier module it was too big to
take<00:04:23.520> away<00:04:23.760> so

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
take away so

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.910 
take away so
I<00:04:24.810> asked<00:04:25.050> him<00:04:25.170> if<00:04:25.200> I<00:04:25.350> could<00:04:25.380> strip<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:25.889> down

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
I asked him if I could strip it down

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.670 
I asked him if I could strip it down
which<00:04:26.550> he<00:04:26.790> agreed<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.360> and<00:04:27.810> these<00:04:28.320> are<00:04:28.500> some<00:04:28.650> of

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
which he agreed to and these are some of

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.379 
which he agreed to and these are some of
the<00:04:28.770> parts<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.250> I<00:04:29.460> saw<00:04:29.820> it's<00:04:30.090> from<00:04:30.360> that

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
the parts that I saw it's from that

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:32.900 
the parts that I saw it's from that
right<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.110> fire<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.560> got<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.370> whole<00:04:32.490> bunch<00:04:32.760> of

was<00:04:42.870> also<00:04:43.050> two<00:04:43.290> of<00:04:43.770> these<00:04:44.450> boards<00:04:45.450> each<00:04:46.200> of

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
was also two of these boards each of

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.390 
was also two of these boards each of
which<00:04:46.800> has<00:04:47.690> three<00:04:48.690> resistors<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.530> three

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
which has three resistors and three

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.810 
which has three resistors and three
capacitors<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.440> the<00:04:52.440> capacitors<00:04:53.040> are<00:04:53.250> rated

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
capacitors and the capacitors are rated

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.480 
capacitors and the capacitors are rated
to<00:04:54.260> 2<00:04:55.260> micro<00:04:55.650> farad<00:04:56.120> 440<00:04:57.120> volts<00:04:57.510> and<00:04:58.490> the

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
to 2 micro farad 440 volts and the

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.350 
to 2 micro farad 440 volts and the
resistors<00:05:00.060> are<00:05:00.169> 33<00:05:01.169> armed<00:05:01.520> 30<00:05:02.520> watt<00:05:02.790> resistors

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
resistors are 33 armed 30 watt resistors

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.270 
resistors are 33 armed 30 watt resistors
and<00:05:04.169> so<00:05:04.500> I<00:05:04.530> have<00:05:04.710> six<00:05:05.040> of<00:05:05.220> each<00:05:05.660> of<00:05:06.660> those<00:05:06.930> and

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
and so I have six of each of those and

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.710 
and so I have six of each of those and
I've<00:05:08.280> just<00:05:08.520> got<00:05:08.669> to<00:05:08.760> organise<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.120> time<00:05:09.419> to<00:05:09.570> go

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
I've just got to organise a time to go

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.290 
I've just got to organise a time to go
back<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:10.169> strip<00:05:11.010> the<00:05:11.130> diodes<00:05:11.640> out<00:05:11.910> because<00:05:12.210> I

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
back and strip the diodes out because I

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.750 
back and strip the diodes out because I
didn't<00:05:12.570> exactly<00:05:13.080> have<00:05:13.560> all<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.100> tools<00:05:14.400> I

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
didn't exactly have all the tools I

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.940 
didn't exactly have all the tools I
needed<00:05:14.970> with<00:05:15.210> me<00:05:15.390> and<00:05:16.260> so<00:05:16.440> I'll<00:05:16.530> probably<00:05:16.650> be

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
needed with me and so I'll probably be

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.040 
needed with me and so I'll probably be
going<00:05:17.370> back<00:05:17.669> there<00:05:17.700> next<00:05:18.120> week<00:05:18.270> sometime

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
going back there next week sometime

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.210 
going back there next week sometime
now<00:05:19.800> I<00:05:20.070> also<00:05:20.310> went<00:05:20.700> to<00:05:20.850> visit<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:22.220> manufacturer

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
now I also went to visit a manufacturer

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.659 
now I also went to visit a manufacturer
of<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:24.270> zinc<00:05:24.479> oxide<00:05:24.600> nanoparticles<00:05:25.669> amongst

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
of the zinc oxide nanoparticles amongst

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.659 
of the zinc oxide nanoparticles amongst
other<00:05:27.090> products<00:05:27.630> that<00:05:27.750> they<00:05:27.900> make<00:05:28.310> the<00:05:29.310> reason

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
other products that they make the reason

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.580 
other products that they make the reason
I<00:05:29.729> wanted<00:05:30.030> some<00:05:30.300> zinc<00:05:30.930> oxide<00:05:31.290> nanoparticles

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
I wanted some zinc oxide nanoparticles

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.550 
I wanted some zinc oxide nanoparticles
is<00:05:32.400> so<00:05:32.820> that<00:05:32.940> I<00:05:33.060> can<00:05:33.090> use<00:05:33.510> the<00:05:33.750> electrical

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
is so that I can use the electrical

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.790 
is so that I can use the electrical
properties<00:05:35.040> of<00:05:35.669> these<00:05:36.060> particles<00:05:36.540> in<00:05:36.990> a<00:05:37.320> dusty

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
properties of these particles in a dusty

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.610 
properties of these particles in a dusty
plasma<00:05:38.310> environment<00:05:38.880> in<00:05:39.780> conjunction<00:05:40.260> with

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
plasma environment in conjunction with

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.930 
plasma environment in conjunction with
my<00:05:41.100> longitudinal<00:05:41.910> electricity<00:05:42.900> experiments

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
my longitudinal electricity experiments

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.330 
my longitudinal electricity experiments
assume<00:05:44.940> I<00:05:45.120> get<00:05:45.300> my<00:05:45.450> custom<00:05:46.080> little<00:05:46.800> chambers

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
assume I get my custom little chambers

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.760 
assume I get my custom little chambers
made<00:05:47.550> up<00:05:47.780> so<00:05:48.780> I've<00:05:48.930> got<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.200> zinc<00:05:49.410> oxide

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
made up so I've got the zinc oxide

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.670 
made up so I've got the zinc oxide
nanoparticles<00:05:50.010> here<00:05:50.789> and<00:05:51.120> while<00:05:52.050> there<00:05:52.440> I

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
nanoparticles here and while there I

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.180 
nanoparticles here and while there I
also<00:05:52.890> picked<00:05:53.760> up<00:05:53.880> a<00:05:54.090> small<00:05:54.840> sample<00:05:55.410> of<00:05:55.590> sodium

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
also picked up a small sample of sodium

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.969 
also picked up a small sample of sodium
benzoate<00:05:56.729> the<00:05:57.570> sodium<00:05:57.960> benzoate<00:05:58.350> as<00:05:58.800> a

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
benzoate the sodium benzoate as a

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:05.200 
benzoate the sodium benzoate as a
particle<00:05:59.820> size<00:06:00.090> of<00:06:00.510> roughly<00:06:01.470> 2<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.810> 10<00:06:04.130> microns

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:05.210 
particle size of roughly 2 to 10 microns

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:08.560 
particle size of roughly 2 to 10 microns
whereas<00:06:06.210> the<00:06:06.450> zinc<00:06:07.020> oxide<00:06:07.440> has<00:06:07.620> an<00:06:07.770> average

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:08.570 
whereas the zinc oxide has an average

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.350 
whereas the zinc oxide has an average
particle<00:06:09.570> size<00:06:09.780> of<00:06:10.289> about<00:06:10.940> 36.9<00:06:13.250> nanometers

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
particle size of about 36.9 nanometers

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.529 
particle size of about 36.9 nanometers
so<00:06:15.360> as<00:06:16.110> you<00:06:16.229> can<00:06:16.380> see<00:06:16.440> here<00:06:17.150> most<00:06:18.150> of<00:06:18.450> the

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:18.539 
so as you can see here most of the

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.930 
so as you can see here most of the
particle<00:06:19.050> size<00:06:19.760> falls<00:06:20.760> within<00:06:21.120> the<00:06:21.390> 30<00:06:21.660> to<00:06:21.930> 50

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:22.940 
particle size falls within the 30 to 50

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.000 
particle size falls within the 30 to 50
nanometer<00:06:23.940> range<00:06:24.210> there's<00:06:25.080> also<00:06:25.260> a<00:06:25.410> small

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 
nanometer range there's also a small

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.050 
nanometer range there's also a small
amount<00:06:26.430> in<00:06:27.030> the<00:06:27.300> 100<00:06:28.140> to<00:06:28.410> 200<00:06:29.370> nanometer<00:06:29.880> range

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
amount in the 100 to 200 nanometer range

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.770 
amount in the 100 to 200 nanometer range
but<00:06:30.360> you<00:06:30.539> can<00:06:30.690> see<00:06:30.900> that<00:06:31.110> yeah<00:06:32.130> well<00:06:32.610> over<00:06:33.390> 90%

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
but you can see that yeah well over 90%

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:38.990 
but you can see that yeah well over 90%
of<00:06:34.169> it<00:06:34.320> is<00:06:34.560> in<00:06:35.550> this<00:06:35.820> band<00:06:36.570> here

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
of it is in this band here

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.809 
of it is in this band here
so<00:06:39.750> yeah<00:06:39.930> that'll<00:06:40.319> be<00:06:40.490> something<00:06:41.490> to<00:06:41.639> look

00:06:41.809 --> 00:06:41.819 
so yeah that'll be something to look

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:44.450 
so yeah that'll be something to look
forward<00:06:42.120> to<00:06:42.389> playing<00:06:42.870> with<00:06:43.110> I<00:06:43.710> won't<00:06:44.159> open

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:44.460 
forward to playing with I won't open

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.969 
forward to playing with I won't open
them<00:06:44.580> now<00:06:44.759> because<00:06:45.030> it's<00:06:45.330> really<00:06:45.979> no

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
them now because it's really no

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.409 
them now because it's really no
different<00:06:47.009> to<00:06:47.430> looking<00:06:47.699> at<00:06:47.789> some<00:06:48.120> talcum

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:48.419 
different to looking at some talcum

00:06:48.419 --> 00:06:51.860 
different to looking at some talcum
powder<00:06:48.599> but<00:06:49.530> we'll<00:06:50.370> have<00:06:50.849> a<00:06:50.909> look<00:06:51.060> at<00:06:51.210> how<00:06:51.690> they

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
powder but we'll have a look at how they

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.149 
powder but we'll have a look at how they
perform<00:06:52.289> under<00:06:52.800> a<00:06:52.830> dusty<00:06:53.340> plasma<00:06:54.210> environment

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:55.159 
perform under a dusty plasma environment

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:57.589 
perform under a dusty plasma environment
so<00:06:56.159> they'll<00:06:56.340> be<00:06:56.520> pretty<00:06:56.849> cool<00:06:57.120> looking

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
so they'll be pretty cool looking

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:59.540 
so they'll be pretty cool looking
forward<00:06:57.960> to<00:06:58.080> that<00:06:58.259> but<00:06:58.560> I've<00:06:59.129> got<00:06:59.340> to<00:06:59.430> finish

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
forward to that but I've got to finish

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.180 
forward to that but I've got to finish
making<00:07:00.060> these<00:07:00.180> vacuum<00:07:00.810> chambers<00:07:01.319> and<00:07:01.770> I've

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.190 
making these vacuum chambers and I've

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.710 
making these vacuum chambers and I've
got<00:07:02.280> a<00:07:02.310> whole<00:07:02.460> bunch<00:07:02.699> of<00:07:02.789> other<00:07:02.970> videos<00:07:03.030> that

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
got a whole bunch of other videos that

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.089 
got a whole bunch of other videos that
I've<00:07:03.810> been<00:07:03.930> meaning<00:07:04.319> to<00:07:04.349> do<00:07:04.590> so<00:07:04.770> I'll<00:07:04.889> try<00:07:05.069> and

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:05.099 
I've been meaning to do so I'll try and

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:06.830 
I've been meaning to do so I'll try and
get<00:07:05.250> all<00:07:05.370> those<00:07:05.580> out<00:07:05.819> the<00:07:05.909> way<00:07:06.060> before<00:07:06.509> we<00:07:06.629> move

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 
get all those out the way before we move

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.490
