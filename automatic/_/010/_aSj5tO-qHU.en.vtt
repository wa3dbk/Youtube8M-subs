the ideal is the wedding the ideal is

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.190 
the ideal is the wedding the ideal is
making<00:02:22.460> it<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:22.850> there's<00:02:23.330> not<00:02:23.510> much<00:02:23.870> of<00:02:24.020> an<00:02:24.110> eye

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
life afterwards I think that's one

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.920 
life afterwards I think that's one
reason<00:02:28.370> why<00:02:28.670> marriages<00:02:29.090> are<00:02:29.240> so<00:02:29.390> vulnerable

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
reason why marriages are so vulnerable
