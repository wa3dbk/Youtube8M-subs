00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.620
 So I've like the last few days on YouTube after a few bulbs system 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.790
 and look for buildings that work best on households 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.589
 Arntz I found them, but most think so soost 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.789
 So it was her relief the Nuremberg Rostock 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.960
 there would just stop by Tibor Toth honest careless for shipment above 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.710
 become 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.939
 long ago is not so good because 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.509
 who has one left at 4 6 and son 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.409
 Nakheel workforce 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.409
 could build that 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.520
 that's that works with a switch and percent sees which 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.429
 December on 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.660
 exhibited puts in practice a foul-whistle concert 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.660
 here is this switch now 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.650
 then completely replaced 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.050
 and he's not a why so postponed so not really percent 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.840
 instead of in other states 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.840
 I press again on the same switch 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.700
 LeMond Steinaus percent from Gettorf 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.830
 like me 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.260
 Of course, Lech is me doing that and 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.780
 At the beginning I just had my style with that two switches user me 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.900
 have here 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 the back half started circuit 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.130
 built as the first starter 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.490
 there probably the Crisis 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.719
 and those on the other side 

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.430
 if that succeeded 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.620
 Painted switch has pressed 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.060
 is just percent the psp2 lived that protects and she received her 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.420
 the cat went out the Pistons high-vocal rock of the current three times 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.930
 been raised so high 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.330
 Mattia works hard then the slopes have been addressed the person was 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.670
 pushed 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.619
 and since I have come away unworthy of both winners it is in the box of 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.380
 you have gone down to mere changes 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.039
 then do the episodes on the other side because that's the way from the bare to the stone 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.650
 were changed 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.659
 now I wanted that all percent 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.980
 but do not solve over two jaws but over a wait 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.260
 and then around 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.710
 I do not always want to do that and then I noticed that 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.940
 I just have to check which locations is on it 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.919
 yes not every little system built 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.259
 that's starting to check 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.079
 in double digits in Steinfeld the deb-team at 4 also always 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:16.919
 just used around 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:20.599
 possible hunched he is always on no matter what status Escada has 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.679
 and percent if nothing like the exam that's not all 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:29.369
 then here's wearing first round and since I'm pulling Eggleston 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:33.969
 GaitÃ¡n these repeaters and the system has practical it is just the light 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:38.329
 turned on therefore if he first down percent there would be the light of a 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:40.650
 he sets the Octavia to explain this 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.659
 is Steinman's 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.899
 w16 made that warm debates press 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.229
 then it could be scenario that one percent did not have them 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:51.019
 Waiting time has come down 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.679
 that goes to escape here 

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:57.009
 either way and then 

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.989
 so 10 o'clock on goes when both signals to 1 means that they are completely off 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:03.849
 It is not even on 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.969
 it checks this baten signal and at the same time whether the signal remained 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:09.039
 one 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.039
 that is when the signal to eat the lamps off 

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:15.569
 and if at the same time the parking is Siegerland 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.689
 because this band is four 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.319
 and percent 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.719
 the process of turning on the lamp 

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.179
 initiated 

00:03:23.179 --> 00:03:26.789
 now I've tried it exactly the same again percent for the other one 

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:28.189
 Page made 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:31.889
 that is, if the parking winner is the original forwarded the IOM 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.219
 the nagging from Battenberg 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:36.259
 4 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.949
 Ahrendt's getting in 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:40.029
 so percent 

00:03:40.029 --> 00:03:40.840
 10 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.909
 who 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:46.120
 the first round is and that they are white of the data in Afghanistan 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.209
 pressed and the state cadres 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.909
 then it would be fast and what they are going to percent and swap 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:54.909
 initiated and percent the lamps is turned off 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.219
 the whole one can then again per cent when watch 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:04.010
 is just as it is still a bit awkwardly built but only by 2 4 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.169
 Percent first 'what to show 

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:07.909
 that you can do something like that 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:12.249
 I have my neck around that Barton Signal is there and up there 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.019
 is the first payment 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.849
 Reviers the second escapes 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.609
 the eleven percent is percent comes the first signal to Sommerer 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.730
 employee 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.800
 until the departure of the 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.969
 the signal for turning on the lamp 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.959
 there is basically no not so many as a professional easily complicated 

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:36.360
 but looks 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.509
 Aging so far turned upside down and the whole thing on this nine man 9 

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.870
 blocked that I had available now 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.870
 to place and Suez has 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.710
 the only thing that has stopped me right now is 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:56.400
 Winkler Betz and Hot Chili forward the bathroom to August 

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:59.800
 pull block behind make the I do not like yet but at NT 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.979
 larger buildings will then no longer upright is also Marten 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:07.439
 we do not pull anything more March and wood industry the parking system what we 

00:05:07.439 --> 00:05:09.990
 is expected 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.539
 Brown is lit. 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:12.599
 so on
