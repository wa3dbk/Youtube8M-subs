00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
down to a much earthier tone so you like

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.170 
down to a much earthier tone so you like
this<00:00:41.250> but<00:00:41.610> go<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.739> something<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:44.070> lot<00:00:44.340> let's

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
this but go for something a lot let's

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.520 
this but go for something a lot let's
say<00:00:45.450> dirtier<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> perhaps<00:00:47.820> this<00:00:48.410> when<00:00:49.410> you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
say dirtier so perhaps this when you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.160 
say dirtier so perhaps this when you
paint<00:00:49.770> your<00:00:49.920> room<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.670> color<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.750> going

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
complementary to this say I would start

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.280 
complementary to this say I would start
by<00:01:20.610> saying<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:21.450> looks<00:01:21.750> nice<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.259> that

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
looks nicer that looks nice with this

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.340 
looks nicer that looks nice with this
couch<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.509> looks<00:01:24.659> good<00:01:24.810> with<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.140> table

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
couch it looks good with this table

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.219 
couch it looks good with this table
looks<00:01:26.100> pretty<00:01:26.369> good<00:01:26.520> with<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.729> carpet<00:01:27.229> looks

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229

good<00:01:28.500> with<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.680> bricks<00:01:29.549> over<00:01:29.790> there<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:31.170> so

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
good with the bricks over there and so

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.890 
good with the bricks over there and so
that's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.770> choice<00:01:32.070> now<00:01:32.579> let's<00:01:32.759> try<00:01:33.060> perhaps

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
that's a choice now let's try perhaps

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.020 
that's a choice now let's try perhaps
another<00:01:34.290> choice<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.799> maybe<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.460> room<00:01:35.729> should

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
another choice so maybe the room should

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.120 
another choice so maybe the room should
be<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.180> little<00:01:36.540> greener<00:01:38.060> Green<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.240> a<00:01:39.270> tough<00:01:39.540> one

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
be a little greener Green is a tough one

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.830 
be a little greener Green is a tough one
we<00:01:41.130> we<00:01:41.460> tend<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.880> look<00:01:42.000> at<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.180> color<00:01:42.420> like<00:01:42.659> this

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
we we tend to look at a color like this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.690 
we we tend to look at a color like this
and<00:01:43.079> think<00:01:43.290> oh<00:01:43.439> that's<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.280> lovely

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
and think oh that's a really lovely

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.850 
and think oh that's a really lovely
green<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.049> paint<00:01:46.259> your<00:01:46.439> walls<00:01:46.680> and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
green and then you paint your walls and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.340 
green and then you paint your walls and
it<00:01:46.920> looks<00:01:47.070> like<00:01:47.159> mint<00:01:47.640> mint<00:01:48.570> chips<00:01:49.020> they're

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
it looks like mint mint chips they're

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.130 
it looks like mint mint chips they're
just<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.890> like<00:01:50.100> screaming<00:01:50.520> green<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.750> again

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
just it's like screaming green so again

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.179 
just it's like screaming green so again
I<00:01:52.350> would<00:01:52.530> go<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.640> lot<00:01:53.970> dirtier<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.040> rule<00:01:56.040> of

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
I would go a lot dirtier and rule of

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.950 
I would go a lot dirtier and rule of
thumb<00:01:56.369> every<00:01:56.670> time<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.090> seems<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.540> work<00:01:57.570> just

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
thumb every time it seems to work just

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.149 
thumb every time it seems to work just
go<00:01:58.409> a<00:01:58.710> lot<00:01:59.159> earthier<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.740> therefore<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
go a lot earthier and therefore it's a I

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.859 
go a lot earthier and therefore it's a I
call<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.490> a<00:02:02.520> more<00:02:02.759> liveable<00:02:03.299> color<00:02:03.509> you<00:02:03.719> can

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
call it a more liveable color you can

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.209 
call it a more liveable color you can
live<00:02:04.140> with<00:02:04.290> these<00:02:04.439> colors<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:04.890> don't<00:02:05.040> need

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
live with these colors they don't need

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.690 
live with these colors they don't need
to<00:02:05.310> scream<00:02:05.610> at<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:06.110> so<00:02:07.110> perhaps<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:08.069> green<00:02:08.489> or

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
to scream at you so perhaps a a green or

to scream at you so perhaps a a green or
a<00:02:08.729> color<00:02:08.940> in<00:02:09.149> this<00:02:09.270> room<00:02:09.539> would<00:02:09.780> work<00:02:10.020> so<00:02:10.500> I

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
a color in this room would work so I

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.100 
a color in this room would work so I
take<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.069> around<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.970> all<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.360> my<00:02:12.510> things<00:02:12.810> and

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
take it around to all of my things and

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.490 
take it around to all of my things and
make

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
make

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.620 
make
it<00:02:13.680> looks<00:02:13.980> right<00:02:14.640> with<00:02:14.910> everybody<00:02:15.270> and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
it looks right with everybody and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.350 
it looks right with everybody and
everybody's<00:02:16.140> happy<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.800> then<00:02:17.790> at<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.030> end<00:02:18.210> of

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
everybody's happy and then at the end of

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.300 
everybody's happy and then at the end of
a<00:02:18.450> period<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.900> might<00:02:19.080> have<00:02:19.290> maybe<00:02:19.710> two<00:02:19.980> or<00:02:20.130> three

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
a period I might have maybe two or three

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.980 
a period I might have maybe two or three
or<00:02:20.430> four<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.820> these<00:02:20.970> colors<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.570> think<00:02:21.840> are

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
or four of these colors that I think are

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.340 
or four of these colors that I think are
really<00:02:22.260> good<00:02:23.180> maybe<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.360> completely

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
really good maybe in completely

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.800 
really good maybe in completely
different<00:02:25.470> color<00:02:26.040> families<00:02:26.580> perhaps<00:02:27.420> a<00:02:27.570> gold

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
different color families perhaps a gold

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.100 
different color families perhaps a gold
in<00:02:28.020> color<00:02:28.260> just<00:02:28.350> complimentary<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:30.110> then

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
in color just complimentary and then

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.340 
in color just complimentary and then
it's<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.890> decision<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.700> which<00:02:33.540> color<00:02:33.930> to<00:02:34.170> put

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
it's the decision of which color to put

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.880 
it's the decision of which color to put
on<00:02:34.500> your<00:02:34.680> wall<00:02:34.880> in<00:02:35.880> some<00:02:36.150> instances<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.200> will

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
on your wall in some instances you will

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.650 
on your wall in some instances you will
have<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.130> color<00:02:38.400> in<00:02:38.610> mind<00:02:38.820> for<00:02:39.120> instance<00:02:39.209> at

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
have a color in mind for instance at

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.620 
have a color in mind for instance at
this<00:02:40.080> color<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.280> wall<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:42.390> is<00:02:42.540> the

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
this color on this wall and this is the

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.690 
this color on this wall and this is the
color<00:02:42.840> you<00:02:43.020> must<00:02:43.230> have<00:02:43.440> and<00:02:43.770> so<00:02:44.220> you<00:02:44.280> wanted<00:02:44.640> to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
color you must have and so you wanted to

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.250 
color you must have and so you wanted to
try<00:02:44.940> and<00:02:45.060> color<00:02:45.240> match<00:02:45.480> up<00:02:45.690> with<00:02:45.840> your<00:02:46.050> fan

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
try and color match up with your fan

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.210 
try and color match up with your fan
depth<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:48.560> getting<00:02:49.560> as<00:02:49.680> close<00:02:49.950> as<00:02:50.100> you

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
depth and getting as close as you

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.380 
depth and getting as close as you
possibly<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:51.110> or<00:02:52.110> if<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:53.010> if<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:54.030> can<00:02:54.180> get<00:02:54.360> a

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
possibly can or if you if you can get a

possibly can or if you if you can get a
sample<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.590> color<00:02:55.860> on<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.550> a<00:02:56.580> piece<00:02:56.850> of

sample of this color on to a piece of
paper<00:02:57.239> and<00:02:57.540> take<00:02:57.989> it<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.260> your<00:02:58.290> local<00:02:58.470> paint

I'm<00:03:05.430> going<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.730> find<00:03:06.030> what<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:06.720> think<00:03:07.110> is

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
I'm going to find what I think is

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.830 
I'm going to find what I think is
closest<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:09.420> wall<00:03:09.600> color<00:03:11.540> which<00:03:12.540> probably

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
closest to the wall color which probably

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.180 
closest to the wall color which probably
doesn't<00:03:13.350> quite<00:03:13.500> exist<00:03:14.959> but<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.560> is<00:03:16.770> getting

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
doesn't quite exist but this is getting

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:26.690 
doesn't quite exist but this is getting
there<00:03:24.709> so<00:03:25.709> just<00:03:25.980> to<00:03:26.160> show<00:03:26.370> you<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.640> little

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
there so just to show you this little

there so just to show you this little
trick<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:28.400> and<00:03:29.400> what<00:03:29.549> you<00:03:29.670> want<00:03:29.850> to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
trick that I have and what you want to

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.800 
trick that I have and what you want to
do<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:31.489> take<00:03:32.489> a<00:03:32.549> piece<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.940> paper<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.390> cut<00:03:33.630> two

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
do is take a piece of paper and cut two

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.120 
do is take a piece of paper and cut two
triangles<00:03:34.410> out<00:03:34.799> like<00:03:35.070> this<00:03:35.310> put<00:03:36.239> one<00:03:36.450> on<00:03:37.130> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
triangles out like this put one on the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.610 
triangles out like this put one on the
area<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.420> want<00:03:39.660> to<00:03:39.840> match<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.530> the

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
area that you want to match and the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.830 
area that you want to match and the
other<00:03:40.830> on<00:03:41.130> what<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.489> think<00:03:41.910> is<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.660> right

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
color and it is pretty clear as day if

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.620 
color and it is pretty clear as day if
they<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.900> hold<00:03:49.079> all<00:03:49.350> this<00:03:49.530> up<00:03:49.769> at<00:03:49.950> this<00:03:50.100> time

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
they can hold all this up at this time

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.020 
they can hold all this up at this time
that<00:03:51.630> these<00:03:52.170> two<00:03:52.500> colors<00:03:52.890> do<00:03:53.190> not<00:03:53.400> match<00:03:53.700> yet

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
that these two colors do not match yet
