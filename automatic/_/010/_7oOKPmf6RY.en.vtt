have a laser version of this as well as

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.290 
have a laser version of this as well as
you<00:00:26.460> can<00:00:26.609> see<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.180> box<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.810> rather<00:00:28.619> pretty

you can see the box is rather pretty

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.429 
you can see the box is rather pretty
also<00:00:30.300> has<00:00:30.449> lots<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.869> features<00:00:31.109> and

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
also has lots of features and

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.620 
also has lots of features and
specifications<00:00:31.619> about<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> product<00:00:33.210> on<00:00:33.390> it

specifications about the product on it

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.740 
specifications about the product on it
but<00:00:33.840> most<00:00:34.079> importantly<00:00:34.969> you<00:00:35.969> can<00:00:36.030> get<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> feel

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
but most importantly you can get a feel

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.709 
but most importantly you can get a feel
for<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.170> mouse<00:00:37.440> if<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.340> go<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.760> store<00:00:39.180> and

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
for the mouse if you go in store and

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.250 
for the mouse if you go in store and
they<00:00:40.379> don't<00:00:40.590> have<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.600> display<00:00:42.600> for<00:00:43.079> you

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
they don't have this on display for you

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.310 
they don't have this on display for you
to<00:00:43.440> actually<00:00:43.649> try<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.660> i<00:00:45.780> guess<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.110> is

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
to actually try on and i guess this is

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
to actually try on and i guess this is
the<00:00:46.350> next<00:00:46.829> best<00:00:47.129> thing<00:00:47.550> you<00:00:48.059> know<00:00:48.180> what<00:00:48.329> you

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the next best thing you know what you

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.479 
the next best thing you know what you
can<00:00:48.690> watch<00:00:48.870> reviews<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.129> look<00:00:50.340> at

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
can watch reviews you can look at

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.510 
can watch reviews you can look at
pictures<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.480> videos<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.410> all<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.039> kind<00:00:53.430> of

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
pictures and videos and all that kind of

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.750 
pictures and videos and all that kind of
stuff<00:00:53.579> if<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.719> don't<00:00:55.050> try<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.219> mouse<00:00:56.460> on

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
stuff if you don't try your mouse on

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.290 
stuff if you don't try your mouse on
before<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.329> buy<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:58.199> most<00:00:59.129> cases<00:00:59.460> you're

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
before you buy it in most cases you're

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.299 
before you buy it in most cases you're
probably<00:01:00.660> going<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.230> return<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.770> i<00:01:02.010> mean<00:01:02.190> we

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
probably going to return it i mean we

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.000 
probably going to return it i mean we
all<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:02.879> different<00:01:03.090> hand<00:01:03.570> sizes<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.739> mice

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
all have different hand sizes the mice

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.039 
all have different hand sizes the mice
are<00:01:05.309> shaped<00:01:05.820> differently<00:01:05.909> some<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.780> them<00:01:06.930> you

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
are shaped differently some of them you

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.380 
are shaped differently some of them you
know<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.320> humongous<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:08.250> whatever<00:01:08.549> small<00:01:08.939> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
know are humongous or whatever small and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.920 
know are humongous or whatever small and
a<00:01:10.170> lot<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> times<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.670> don't<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.600> that

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
a lot of times if you don't do that

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.020 
a lot of times if you don't do that
you're<00:01:13.770> probably<00:01:14.070> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.520> end<00:01:14.640> up

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
you're probably going to end up

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.840 
you're probably going to end up
returning<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.630> but<00:01:16.049> enough<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.860> my<00:01:17.100> blah<00:01:17.610> blah

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
returning it but enough of my blah blah

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.940 
returning it but enough of my blah blah
blah<00:01:17.880> let's<00:01:18.780> get<00:01:19.020> on<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.409> review<00:01:19.560> now

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
blah let's get on with the review now

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.200 
blah let's get on with the review now
this<00:01:20.100> might<00:01:20.280> seem<00:01:20.340> trivial<00:01:20.670> but<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.030> thought

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
this might seem trivial but I thought

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.090 
this might seem trivial but I thought
I'd<00:01:21.330> mention<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.780> anyway<00:01:22.110> sometimes<00:01:22.439> products

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
I'd mention it anyway sometimes products

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.179 
I'd mention it anyway sometimes products
like<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.670> can<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> real<00:01:24.540> pain<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.229> unpack

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
like this can be a real pain to unpack

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.420 
like this can be a real pain to unpack
well<00:01:26.909> this<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.240> isnt<00:01:27.509> thankfully<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:29.009> just

so<00:01:44.820> let's<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.299> specifications<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.200> of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
so let's get the specifications out of

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.569 
so let's get the specifications out of
the<00:01:46.350> way<00:01:46.439> first<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:46.950> then<00:01:47.250> I'll<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the way first and then I'll have a

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.889 
the way first and then I'll have a
closer<00:01:47.880> look<00:01:48.270> at<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.780> maximum<00:01:49.140> DPI<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:50.899> 6400

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
closer look at the maximum DPI is a 6400

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.950 
closer look at the maximum DPI is a 6400
it<00:01:52.200> comes<00:01:52.439> with<00:01:52.590> an<00:01:52.680> optical<00:01:52.860> picsart<00:01:53.790> 39<00:01:54.329> 88

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it comes with an optical picsart 39 88

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.560

now<00:02:51.569> let's<00:02:51.750> have<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.930> closer<00:02:52.139> look<00:02:52.500> except<00:02:52.859> for

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
now let's have a closer look except for

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.470 
now let's have a closer look except for
where<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.250> court<00:02:53.549> exits<00:02:53.970> at<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.209> front<00:02:54.419> of

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
where the court exits at the front of

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.539 
where the court exits at the front of
the<00:02:54.599> mouse<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.230> perfectly<00:02:55.829> symmetrical

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
the mouse it is perfectly symmetrical

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.179 
the mouse it is perfectly symmetrical
and<00:02:56.730> thus<00:02:56.970> an<00:02:57.239> ambidextrous<00:02:57.930> mouse<00:02:58.859> and<00:02:59.099> that

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
and thus an ambidextrous mouse and that

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.740 
and thus an ambidextrous mouse and that
should<00:02:59.340> make<00:02:59.430> a<00:02:59.489> lot<00:02:59.849> of<00:02:59.879> left-handed<00:03:00.540> people

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
should make a lot of left-handed people

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.709 
should make a lot of left-handed people
very<00:03:01.379> very<00:03:02.099> happy<00:03:02.519> now<00:03:03.060> have<00:03:03.239> a<00:03:03.269> look<00:03:03.359> at<00:03:03.629> the

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719 
very very happy now have a look at the

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.830 
very very happy now have a look at the
mouse<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:03.930> tell<00:03:04.319> me<00:03:04.409> what<00:03:04.500> you<00:03:04.530> think<00:03:04.650> I<00:03:05.840> love

this<00:03:07.230> white<00:03:07.709> and<00:03:08.010> black<00:03:08.790> combo<00:03:09.689> very<00:03:10.439> very

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
this white and black combo very very

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.149 
this white and black combo very very
sharp<00:03:11.400> however<00:03:12.329> the<00:03:12.840> top<00:03:13.139> is<00:03:13.439> high<00:03:14.189> gloss<00:03:14.969> and

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
sharp however the top is high gloss and

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.189 
sharp however the top is high gloss and
it's<00:03:17.159> white<00:03:17.430> so<00:03:17.849> it<00:03:18.090> really<00:03:18.389> is<00:03:18.540> not<00:03:18.900> going<00:03:19.079> to

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
it's white so it really is not going to

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.500 
it's white so it really is not going to
attract<00:03:19.620> dust<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.459> fingerprints<00:03:21.000> really

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
attract dust and fingerprints really

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.990 
attract dust and fingerprints really
easily<00:03:22.049> my<00:03:22.319> only<00:03:22.470> concern<00:03:22.709> is<00:03:22.979> it's<00:03:23.639> going<00:03:23.879> to

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
easily my only concern is it's going to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.439 
easily my only concern is it's going to
be<00:03:24.239> slippery<00:03:25.019> on<00:03:25.379> both<00:03:26.010> sides<00:03:26.340> here<00:03:27.150> in<00:03:27.299> the

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
be slippery on both sides here in the

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.199 
be slippery on both sides here in the
middle<00:03:27.870> it's<00:03:28.379> matte<00:03:28.859> black<00:03:29.129> and<00:03:29.459> on<00:03:30.000> both

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.390 
middle it's matte black and on both
sides<00:03:30.629> at<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:30.959> bottom<00:03:31.500> well<00:03:31.799> it's<00:03:32.069> gripping

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
sides at the bottom well it's gripping

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.339 
sides at the bottom well it's gripping
that's<00:03:32.819> good<00:03:33.060> because<00:03:33.329> you<00:03:33.569> can<00:03:33.720> get<00:03:33.840> hold<00:03:34.169> of
