before<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.150> even<00:01:33.329> try<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> go<00:01:33.869> into<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.110> server

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
before you even try to go into a server

before you even try to go into a server
go<00:01:35.250> into<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> private<00:01:35.939> server<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.390> just<00:01:36.420> take

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
go into a private server and just take

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.219 
go into a private server and just take
shots<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.320> random<00:01:37.860> things<00:01:38.100> at<00:01:38.400> signs<00:01:39.030> at<00:01:39.420> BOTS

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
shots at random things at signs at BOTS

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.289 
shots at random things at signs at BOTS
and<00:01:40.470> make<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.680> bot<00:01:40.920> appear<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> bot<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.090> good

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and make a bot appear a bot it's a good

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.910 
and make a bot appear a bot it's a good
way<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.509> get<00:01:42.899> yourself<00:01:42.990> comfortable<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
way to get yourself comfortable with the

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.580 
way to get yourself comfortable with the
weapon<00:01:44.189> now<00:01:45.119> let's<00:01:45.780> talk<00:01:46.049> about<00:01:46.110> arrow

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
weapon now let's talk about arrow

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.910 
weapon now let's talk about arrow
placement<00:01:47.340> arrow<00:01:48.060> placement<00:01:48.810> fully<00:01:49.470> relies

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
placement arrow placement fully relies

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.850 
placement arrow placement fully relies
on<00:01:49.950> your<00:01:50.399> ability<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.060> predict<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:52.110> path<00:01:52.530> of

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
on your ability to predict the path of

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.270 
on your ability to predict the path of
enemy<00:01:53.430> players<00:01:54.200> what<00:01:55.200> does<00:01:55.320> that<00:01:55.350> mean<00:01:55.649> that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
enemy players what does that mean that

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.580 
enemy players what does that mean that
means<00:01:56.579> that<00:01:57.060> if<00:01:57.299> you<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.960> tell<00:01:58.259> where

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
means that if you can tell where

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.410 
means that if you can tell where
somebody's<00:01:59.009> going<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.460> run<00:01:59.700> not<00:02:00.180> where

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
somebody's going to run not where

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.940 
somebody's going to run not where
they're<00:02:00.570> currently<00:02:01.020> running<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:01.619> where<00:02:01.799> they

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
they're currently running but where they

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.480 
they're currently running but where they
are<00:02:02.100> going<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.759> run<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.750> will<00:02:03.869> succeed

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
are going to run you will succeed

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.100 
are going to run you will succeed
immensely<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.850> Huntsman<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.450> good

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
immensely with the Huntsman a good

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.350 
immensely with the Huntsman a good
example<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.740> up<00:02:07.890> here<00:02:08.129> see<00:02:08.340> I<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.819> tried<00:02:09.330> to

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
example is up here see I just tried to

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.360 
example is up here see I just tried to
predict<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> movement<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.410> that<00:02:10.709> demo<00:02:10.979> man<00:02:11.220> I

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
predict the movement of that demo man I

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.670 
predict the movement of that demo man I
was<00:02:11.610> wrong<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.510> still<00:02:12.840> try

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
was wrong but I still try

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.930 
was wrong but I still try
stationary<00:02:14.680> targets<00:02:15.099> are<00:02:15.220> pretty<00:02:15.400> easy<00:02:15.610> like

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
stationary targets are pretty easy like

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.430 
stationary targets are pretty easy like
this<00:02:16.090> engineer<00:02:16.599> up<00:02:16.720> there<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:16.930> killed<00:02:17.290> his

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
this engineer up there I killed his

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.440 
this engineer up there I killed his
century<00:02:17.830> but<00:02:18.280> here<00:02:18.489> we<00:02:18.640> go<00:02:18.790> right<00:02:19.060> here<00:02:19.090> this

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
century but here we go right here this

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.729 
century but here we go right here this
is<00:02:19.510> a<00:02:19.629> great<00:02:19.959> example<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.470> what<00:02:20.620> I'm<00:02:20.709> talking

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
is a great example of what I'm talking

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.220 
is a great example of what I'm talking
about<00:02:21.129> I<00:02:21.489> will<00:02:21.819> freeze<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.239> for<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.599> shoot

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
about I will freeze it for you shoot
