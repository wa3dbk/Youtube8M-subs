00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.800
 you have misunderstood a fire rekindled therefore I bring with joy the 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.610
 he does not encounter in a fight 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.750
 Audiard, I'm looking forward to it too, says Mr. Bucher month 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.070
 and JAL and I like to book 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.560
 from the latter the Guardian Galler has nothing to do "so many things to come on 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.430
 Ai AR Sunday was an extremely good idea of ​​you percent after that you have to 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.570
 leave 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.590
 a because now ours 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.990
 ours had become weaker 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.350
 and that was a brave one 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.150
 I want to attack tracks spring and Mina paralysis on to heal 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.020
 not so bad not so bad 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.060
 I knew that she attracts optimist does not matter 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.460
 I have also attacked Walser Forstner with water only 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.380
 what a shame 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.890
 so again launcher 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.360

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.710
 Japan lost a strong dampening strengthening I change formally too rigidly 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.520
 there 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.010
 and Paestum from how fast it is if the scandal stop 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.430
 this explains life Meier OAS 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.570
 Clean man jerking down to save a bit more 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.250
 I think that was not so good 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.490
 It does not look like it is quite good 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.270
 Something like that has the fish Arno Kapp 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.130
 useful Stechert is too 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.549
 try since Arnold Pier and Radien give degrees 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.549
 Speed ​​limit wörth-ost she does not have much earthquake 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.770

 apn apn on the faltering year but what was going on now except for return 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.739
 "But fine Steinbeck once heals for his arms 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.369
 Optimists on last year 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:16.369
 very good shack Toka does that 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.359
 That percent of this weather yesterday day has stayed that way 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.959
 which has become so much stronger 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.689
 What I can think of is what makes it very positive and SuS injured MOF 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:28.359
 you can dive off 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.569
 He reflects this 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.759
 constantly galloping Océ now we of course have to steam off 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.310
 At that time a lot of Pokemon goes on we switch to a polisher 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.310
 and then try and get them to the 4th 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:44.469
 that they do not water this going on 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:48.290
 damn shame okay but what he did this and the firing pin Fasth 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.419
 chosen 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.889
 so even more water these bring yes OK now it all the time my god that was 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:54.249
 lasted now 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:02:57.560
 Ai now comes steel industry year yet 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.149

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.179
 Felske was okay with it can live with clay people 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:12.719
 So the traditional rose in March that I have to admit quite well 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:17.599
 "I'll tell you which strong opponents meet that's just the second 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.689
 Do not be bad, not bad 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.790

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:40.709
 since the day has clear 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.269

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.629
 and what did her promise of Equinet he saw in that 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.289

 He has us to cancel canceled 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:18.919

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:26.279
 us who in the million 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:27.969
 the park saved us 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:31.800
 and it is not expected that they would have got what she had him 

00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:33.650
 beaten that was close 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.870
 no matter he is speechless often I think I have my eyebrows sunk yes that 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.970
 can happen in his heated fight so the fight was tough 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.279
 unlike the other two fight year 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.990

 «Guardian» acts explained 

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:50.379
 with it the many years 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:52.620
 but apparently you are not damned 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.810
 Jaja ladders tapped the ball and sound whether Alexa Hummel 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.490
 a no offense 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.710
 so Dubois first again he has quake yes 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.719
 and UBR from Firestorm 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:07.719
 and you need that, they were like that 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:11.479
 We will refresh everything if I say now you can too 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.499
 that's a bit of a waste 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:16.659
 inspect a bit high and attack 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:19.059
 that would 

00:06:19.059 --> 00:06:22.199
 Percentage point to start the match Langdorf increase 

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:26.339

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:28.770
 go to the asphalt here Zoom to 4 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:32.129
 Special will defend honest hears on ca 

00:06:32.129 --> 00:06:34.439
 Percent discount on this 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.259
 just might be useful just think 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.710
 and then still a few Sander van Boxmeer look through Chlamydia Rehm 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:41.729
 overdone 

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:44.909
 it briefly starts short just before the lab wants to short off 

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:47.319
 in the midst of it, reports could be what 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:48.669
 still tolerated 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:51.219
 and 6 for Saturn, there are also 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:54.219

00:06:55.719 --> 00:06:57.469
 all right 

00:06:57.469 --> 00:07:00.469
 and then even more on with yes 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.979
 so DALSA and yes are parked here 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.620
 Saliva 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:10.620
 and then sailor sings against Utøya the next day 

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:14.249
 We can still do that from higher Oechsner 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:18.489
 yes and then try our luck i hope we can manage the top four only 

00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:19.619
 two more 

00:07:19.619 --> 00:07:25.249
 Percent of her too and then Comline from still open so now took store 

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:29.449
