move forward three feet for every foot
you<00:00:46.500> fall<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.670> can<00:00:47.789> give<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> glide

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
you fall so it can give you a glide

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.729 
you fall so it can give you a glide
angle<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.020> you're<00:00:49.140> no<00:00:49.230> longer<00:00:49.440> flying

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
why would you want to do something like

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.369 
why would you want to do something like

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
for me the wingsuit landing is something

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.059 
for me the wingsuit landing is something
that<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.569> know<00:03:31.689> people<00:03:32.650> have<00:03:32.739> never<00:03:32.859> done

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:35.409 
before and that's it's hard in this day

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:36.420 
before and that's it's hard in this day
and<00:03:35.440> age<00:03:35.590> do<00:03:35.859> something<00:03:36.099> that's<00:03:36.220> never<00:03:36.310> been

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
and age do something that's never been

and age do something that's never been
done<00:03:36.579> before<00:03:36.729> I<00:03:37.060> mean<00:03:37.209> this<00:03:37.629> will<00:03:37.870> be<00:03:37.989> the

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
done before I mean this will be the

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:39.659 
done before I mean this will be the
first<00:03:38.349> time<00:03:38.590> that<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.859> human<00:03:39.159> being<00:03:39.190> has

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
first time that a human being has

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.670

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
reached terminal velocity and landed on

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.640 
reached terminal velocity and landed on
their<00:03:42.310> face<00:03:42.669> at<00:03:43.299> over<00:03:43.479> 110<00:03:43.959> miles<00:03:44.169> an<00:03:44.290> hour<00:03:44.440> and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
their face at over 110 miles an hour and

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.689 
their face at over 110 miles an hour and
gotten<00:03:44.889> up<00:03:44.949> and<00:03:45.069> done<00:03:45.159> it<00:03:45.280> again<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.609> know

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:45.699 
gotten up and done it again you know

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:46.830 
gotten up and done it again you know
that's<00:03:45.879> so<00:03:45.970> that's<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.269> very<00:03:46.419> special<00:03:46.659> thing

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
that's so that's a very special thing

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.569 
that's so that's a very special thing
and<00:03:47.260> as<00:03:47.680> far<00:03:47.889> as<00:03:47.979> I'm<00:03:48.069> concerned<00:03:48.400> this<00:03:48.489> is

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
and as far as I'm concerned this is

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:49.800 
and as far as I'm concerned this is
something<00:03:48.879> people<00:03:49.150> who<00:03:49.389> want<00:03:49.510> to<00:03:49.540> do<00:03:49.629> since

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
something people who want to do since

the time of Icarus all Jeb needs now is

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.809 
the time of Icarus all Jeb needs now is
