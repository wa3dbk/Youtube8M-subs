00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.609 
why we don't cite it out another delver
um<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:57.759> think<00:01:58.759> I'd<00:01:59.060> rather<00:01:59.479> keep<00:01:59.960> up<00:02:00.200> psychic

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
um I think I'd rather keep up psychic

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.370 
um I think I'd rather keep up psychic
barrier<00:02:01.600> yeah<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:02.810> think<00:02:02.930> that's<00:02:03.170> better

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
barrier yeah I think that's better

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.170 
barrier yeah I think that's better
because<00:02:03.770> if<00:02:03.950> he<00:02:04.040> drops<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.549> I<00:02:04.700> mean<00:02:04.909> even<00:02:04.939> though

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
because if he drops a I mean even though

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.510 
because if he drops a I mean even though
we<00:02:05.270> have<00:02:05.420> vapor<00:02:05.630> snag<00:02:05.960> if<00:02:06.770> he<00:02:06.950> drops<00:02:07.220> I'd

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
we have vapor snag if he drops I'd

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.309 
we have vapor snag if he drops I'd
rather<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.820> counter<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.300> crusader<00:02:08.750> or<00:02:08.989> something

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
rather a counter a crusader or something

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.370 
rather a counter a crusader or something
next<00:02:09.440> turn<00:02:10.600> although<00:02:11.600> if<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.840> delver<00:02:12.140> slips

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
next turn although if this delver slips

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.990 
next turn although if this delver slips
then<00:02:12.530> I'm<00:02:12.620> going<00:02:12.739> to<00:02:12.770> feel<00:02:12.920> stupid<00:02:13.310> but<00:02:13.819> if<00:02:13.940> we

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
then I'm going to feel stupid but if we

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.490 
then I'm going to feel stupid but if we
if<00:02:14.090> we<00:02:14.150> had<00:02:14.270> a<00:02:14.300> ponder<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:14.810> hand<00:02:14.989> then<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.319> think

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
if we had a ponder in hand then I think

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.559 
if we had a ponder in hand then I think
I<00:02:15.560> would<00:02:15.680> definitely<00:02:15.830> go<00:02:16.130> delver<00:02:16.580> ponder<00:02:17.239> so

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
I would definitely go delver ponder so

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.570 
I would definitely go delver ponder so
that<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.780> way<00:02:17.840> they<00:02:17.989> both<00:02:18.230> flip<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:19.340> since<00:02:19.489> we

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
that the way they both flip but since we

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.920 
that the way they both flip but since we
don't<00:02:19.610> guarantee<00:02:20.330> we<00:02:20.660> don't<00:02:20.810> have<00:02:20.900> a

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
don't guarantee we don't have a

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.600 
don't guarantee we don't have a
guaranteed<00:02:21.410> flip<00:02:21.650> next<00:02:21.920> turn<00:02:22.069> I<00:02:22.100> don't<00:02:22.430> think

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
guaranteed flip next turn I don't think

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:24.250 
guaranteed flip next turn I don't think
it's<00:02:22.730> worth<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.060> since<00:02:23.930> we<00:02:24.110> have<00:02:24.230> a

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
it's worth it since we have a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
it's worth it since we have a
counterspell<00:02:24.709> in<00:02:24.860> hand<00:02:28.510> all<00:02:29.510> right<00:02:30.280> tapped

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
counterspell in hand all right tapped

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.350 
counterspell in hand all right tapped
land<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:33.010> riches<00:02:34.010> play<00:02:34.220> oh<00:02:34.430> come<00:02:35.150> on<00:02:35.300> he

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
land and riches play oh come on he

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.640 
land and riches play oh come on he
doesn't<00:02:35.480> reek<00:02:35.780> reaches<00:02:36.110> out<00:02:36.260> but<00:02:36.350> he's<00:02:36.440> alone

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
doesn't reek reaches out but he's alone

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.240 
doesn't reek reaches out but he's alone
yeah<00:02:36.890> only<00:02:37.489> has<00:02:37.700> one<00:02:38.830> thing<00:02:39.830> in<00:02:39.890> the<00:02:40.040> graveyard

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
yeah only has one thing in the graveyard

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.920 
yeah only has one thing in the graveyard
to<00:02:40.580> all<00:02:41.120> right<00:02:41.239> so<00:02:41.450> we<00:02:41.540> should<00:02:41.690> have<00:02:41.780> played

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
to all right so we should have played

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.229 
to all right so we should have played
delver<00:02:42.290> but<00:02:42.500> we<00:02:43.160> didn't<00:02:43.430> know<00:02:43.519> I<00:02:43.730> sure<00:02:44.060> did<00:02:44.180> he

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
delver but we didn't know I sure did he

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.000 
delver but we didn't know I sure did he
play<00:02:44.420> like<00:02:44.690> a<00:02:44.720> plague<00:02:45.019> stinger<00:02:45.350> suppose<00:02:45.709> it

was<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.790> we<00:02:47.150> flip<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.420> no<00:02:48.350> all<00:02:48.680> right<00:02:48.769> well

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
was and we flip it no all right well

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.199 
was and we flip it no all right well
lands<00:02:49.100> are<00:02:49.310> good<00:02:49.430> i<00:02:49.459> have<00:02:49.670> no<00:02:49.819> complaint

such a huge tempo swing I think we're

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.599 
such a huge tempo swing I think we're
doing<00:03:51.109> fine<00:03:51.440> right<00:03:51.470> here<00:03:51.859> we're<00:03:52.489> basically

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
doing fine right here we're basically

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:53.979 
doing fine right here we're basically
controlling<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.299> game<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.540> only<00:03:53.720> way<00:03:53.810> we<00:03:53.930> can

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
controlling the game the only way we can

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.630 
controlling the game the only way we can
really<00:03:54.049> lose<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.650> if<00:03:54.769> he<00:03:54.829> blows<00:03:55.069> us<00:03:55.280> out<00:03:55.459> with<00:03:55.609> a

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
really lose is if he blows us out with a

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.220 
really lose is if he blows us out with a
Black<00:03:55.850> Sun<00:03:56.120> zenith<00:03:56.480> and<00:03:56.660> I<00:03:56.750> don't<00:03:56.930> want<00:03:57.079> to<00:03:57.140> get

yeah I guess in from what you're saying
like<00:04:00.099> all<00:04:00.220> signs<00:04:00.430> are<00:04:00.550> indicating<00:04:00.970> that<00:04:01.060> it

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
like all signs are indicating that it

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.790 
like all signs are indicating that it
