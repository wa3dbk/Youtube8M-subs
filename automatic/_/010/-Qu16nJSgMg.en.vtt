that she stinks but the problem is that

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.260 
that she stinks but the problem is that
we<00:02:05.409> don't<00:02:05.440> have<00:02:05.710> water<00:02:06.040> at<00:02:06.370> home<00:02:06.550> we<00:02:07.090> have<00:02:07.240> a

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
we don't have water at home we have a

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.960 
we don't have water at home we have a
river<00:02:07.840> nearby<00:02:07.870> and<00:02:08.769> in<00:02:09.099> winter<00:02:09.280> we<00:02:09.519> cannot<00:02:09.759> go

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
river nearby and in winter we cannot go

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.030 
river nearby and in winter we cannot go
there<00:02:10.000> because<00:02:10.330> it's<00:02:10.629> too<00:02:10.840> it's<00:02:11.170> too<00:02:11.290> cold<00:02:11.620> so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
there because it's too it's too cold so

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.680 
there because it's too it's too cold so
obviously<00:02:12.700> then<00:02:12.940> it's<00:02:13.120> a<00:02:13.239> self-fulfilling

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
obviously then it's a self-fulfilling

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.740 
obviously then it's a self-fulfilling
prophecy<00:02:14.440> they<00:02:14.980> do<00:02:15.549> stink<00:02:15.970> but<00:02:16.299> they<00:02:16.480> also
