blower motor this is a variable speed
blower<00:00:59.489> motor<00:00:59.789> we<00:01:00.539> send<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.989> AC<00:01:01.379> current<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.070> it

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
blower motor we send a AC current to it

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.640 
blower motor we send a AC current to it
it's<00:01:02.579> converted<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> DC<00:01:03.570> current<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.530> can

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
it's converted to a DC current so we can

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.160 
it's converted to a DC current so we can
control<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.220> RPM<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.060> blower<00:01:06.270> motor<00:01:06.540> we

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
control the RPM of the blower motor we

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.289 
control the RPM of the blower motor we
can<00:01:07.290> go<00:01:07.380> from<00:01:07.500> 20%<00:01:07.890> input<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> hundred

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
can go from 20% input to a hundred

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.289 
can go from 20% input to a hundred
percent<00:01:09.390> input<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.140> boiler<00:01:10.970> this<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.180> the

to be increased depending on the size of

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.230 
to be increased depending on the size of
the<00:04:37.470> boiler<00:04:37.770> you're<00:04:37.950> installing<00:04:38.250> you<00:04:39.030> may<00:04:39.180> be

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
the boiler you're installing you may be

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.620 
the boiler you're installing you may be
able<00:04:39.390> to<00:04:39.540> reduce<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:40.230> vent<00:04:41.100> piping<00:04:41.490> but<00:04:42.480> you

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
able to reduce the vent piping but you

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.400 
able to reduce the vent piping but you
may<00:04:42.780> have<00:04:42.810> to<00:04:43.080> increase<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:44.580> boiler<00:04:44.910> piping

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
may have to increase the boiler piping

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.140 
may have to increase the boiler piping
so<00:04:46.410> know<00:04:47.250> what<00:04:47.430> size<00:04:47.610> boiler<00:04:48.030> you're

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.150 
so know what size boiler you're

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.000 
so know what size boiler you're
installing<00:04:48.420> double<00:04:49.410> check<00:04:49.590> it<00:04:49.710> against<00:04:49.980> the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
installing double check it against the

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.830 
installing double check it against the
manual<00:04:50.430> to<00:04:50.910> see<00:04:50.940> if<00:04:51.180> you<00:04:51.270> have<00:04:51.390> to<00:04:51.510> increase

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
the supply and return piping or if you

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.430 
the supply and return piping or if you
can<00:04:55.380> decrease<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:56.270> exhaust<00:04:57.270> piping<00:04:57.690> which

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
can decrease the exhaust piping which

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.480 
can decrease the exhaust piping which
will<00:04:58.650> save<00:04:59.580> in<00:04:59.910> the<00:05:00.360> cost<00:05:00.600> of<00:05:00.720> your<00:05:00.870> exhausting

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
will save in the cost of your exhausting

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.740 
will save in the cost of your exhausting
but<00:05:02.490> we<00:05:02.640> need<00:05:02.790> to<00:05:02.880> make<00:05:03.030> sure<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.330> flow<00:05:03.510> rate

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
but we need to make sure the flow rate

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.150 
but we need to make sure the flow rate
through<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.080> boiler<00:05:04.470> is<00:05:04.560> correct

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
through the boiler is correct

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.340 
through the boiler is correct
double<00:05:05.760> check<00:05:06.000> the<00:05:06.600> manual<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:07.200> make<00:05:07.290> sure

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
double check the manual to make sure

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.830 
double check the manual to make sure
that<00:05:07.620> this<00:05:07.740> is<00:05:07.920> correct<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.520> that's<00:05:09.510> the

that this is correct and that's the

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.570 
that this is correct and that's the
