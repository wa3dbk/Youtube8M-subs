00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.150
 hi everyone is playing how 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.199
 go listen to me I'm fine I 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.240
 you find today for a 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.769
 new video for this video I you 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.019
 found for a discovery tour of a 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.849
 game this game cf lapidary I think that 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.890
 you know this normal game - available 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.630
 only on the spot and on the phone and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.019
 again before the summer available but more 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.059
 now 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.800
 and here I make you a video about this game 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.540
 on ps3 what is normally 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.610
 impossible so how to handle that to see 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 this game makes it a beta came out the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.030
 Beta is currently the point 3 0 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.140
 maybe when you will see the video 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.940
 the 0.4 0.5 etc will be output is good for 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.079
 the moment there 0.3 and so and I think 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.969
 that it will last a little bit longer 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.680
 of this game there is still something 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.629
 for speed out there so the beta and that's 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.770
 only the game you do not have a menu 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.120
 so for now and it's really 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.710
 very simple you just have to 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.390
 download the looting and that is in 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.160
 the description of the video you 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
 install it via installs park fail 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.420
 of course you will need a ps3 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.500
 jailbreak if you did not have one 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.909
 advise you anyway before the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.260
 video like this here you can a 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.200
 little bit for chords without tripod 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.610
 baird on ps3 and if you have one ps3 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.320
 jailbreak and well I invite you 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.270
 strongly at least test it because it's 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.409
 really super fun so to install it 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.240
 as I wanted to say here you are 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.990
 download the pkg in the description 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.450
 video 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.250
 Then you will not help that half you 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.020
 install it in this way there that in 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.060
 total I think it takes me to the big 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.189
 maximum five minutes to download 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.320
 install and play really I think 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.060
 that it takes really maximum five minutes 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.590
 okay then there is once you 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.030
 you can not wait to see that confusing 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.970
 of chord menus you can only 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.619
 play so to play to ride cm1 and 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.990
 to start the game these start 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.700
 okay of course you do not have 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.020
 better score or something always 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.060
 for the moment it's only a beta 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.560
 you only have the game is well 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.579
 obviously I hope that in the future 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.049
 kind in the beta 0.7 eventually eh 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.299
 well we may have to bring back a score 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.880
 in beta 0.9 we are also made 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.710
 less 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.299
 I think if we have that future I 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.039
 may still be a 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.420
 new video but I still think 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.830
 only for people who do not have 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.599
 inconvenience break this is not why you 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.890
 go tell me wow under these two matches 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.569
 that I do not do this to find myself not 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.950
 other jaibreak frankly there it is 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.840
 a little discovery it's as if I 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.519
 were discovering a TV game that 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.349
 bf hardline okay it's really a 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.660
 discovery I am really happy and 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.519
 well to be able to face discovery thanks to 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.680
 my ps3 at break and I think too 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.360
 why not possible no and well 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.069
 download still a lot of games 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.910
 are the ps3 that I would like you to act 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.830
 do not hide it still takes 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.390
 a lot of dust and I tell myself I 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.760
 see through edge could do when 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.290
 even videos dvi d hotels such forgiveness 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.540
 you are tutorials to 100g break but 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.340
 in fact actually how do you say in 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.989
 big I will download the game soma 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.519
 jailbreak but I 'll do as if I 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:47.500
 did not have a Roma language and well the 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.360
 here I will not use a trick for 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.130
 modify the game I will do everything as if 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.599
 these were the normal ps3 at least I 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.340

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:55.930
 all the young people like that that's it 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.280
 would arrange for me I will not have to pay the 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.380
 games I would not even have to contact 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.880
 people that it was to be able to 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.310
 to receive the games frankly I 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.870
 will have it for free quickly and I 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.519
 think it could still be 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.989
 please so here I think now 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.180
 have you said everything I will leave you 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.000
 I think with another four minutes 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.970
 of video - for me eddy records on 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.690
 this game on ps3 it's 25 or a little more 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.980
 or 29 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.239
 frankly I do not know anymore but I 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.049
 think you're first of all that very 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.430
 soon 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.900
 I will leave you I hope that 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.980
 this video will please you do not hesitate there 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.239
 that's why not a little I like 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.530
 always seems super fun 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.880
 so this game I tell you now 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.720
 I completely forgot to tell you 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:34.660
 will only release them if he goes out on ps3 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.980
 and on psp will not come out on ps4 and 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.299
 it 's okay for the moment the 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.700
 resolution I think you have it 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.350
 noticed on the video there are some 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.630
 black bands on the sides and I you 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.260
 say it now if you have a psp 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.120
 3000 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.319
 a TV with foliage idea well 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.269
 you will not have this me anyway 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.920
 on my television I did not have these 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.600
 black bands but it's only on 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.040
 the rec I have these black stripes but 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.150
 good it's not very serious to novels you 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.540
 have a little bit of 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.940
 gameplay 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.250
 so me frankly this game I'm having fun 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:01.660
 still well I do not think we can 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.769
 play very long because at one time we 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.720
 will start to get bored 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.220
 but when you will start to 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.430
 understand the manipulation finally the 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.840
 handling 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.829
 understand that's how you move 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.790
 with yours also raining little bird 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.959
 so you are the dead you 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.030
 can still do a lot of 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.229
 records month beginning of the video I think 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.139
 you see the wehrmacht was there anyway 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.699
 a lot of trouble to evolve gesture is 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.740
 still a lot in the heroes in 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.090
 es1 will accept and then when I 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.340
 started to understand a little bit 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.080
 you really have to go 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.180
 gently I think because in fact I have 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.680
 noticed that on this game is much more 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.389
 the jumps are different enough that 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.650
 gave that nap you can 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.150
 do small jumps and big 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.250
 under basically if you do is a 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.940
 however, a touch only 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.380
 in the field 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.580
 and although you will see what you 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.110
 just go for a breath 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.690
 while I know you really do 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.039
 you long press the r1 you 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.000
 go make a big jump and that I 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.360
 really think it's not bad to 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.580
 lower 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.229
 Well, it's still maybe I 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.370
 can in simple a little easier so 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.250
 here I am I really hope this 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.060
 video my company will have pleased you 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.320
 do not hesitate to know why not a 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.210
 little I like it can always be done 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.680
 pleasure and of course if you
