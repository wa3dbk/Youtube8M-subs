00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.160
 androidblog.it therefore the one with 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.430
 light white light interface then 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.680
 not that of the June preview fear 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.210
 so this is a white and non-white theme 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.920

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.879
 phones that sucks luca va well it is 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.280
 compatible most of the 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.890
 devices as much as they tell the 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.379
 the larger a window the more it is 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.910

 xperia neo v because 2 on 5 android it 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.270

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.560
 the keyboard then download this pk is 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.659

 to put the vibration point e 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.579
 other multilingual preferences if 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.250

 let's see the keyboard then 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.770
 let's go to the application that no one if 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.459
 logistics how it works part 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:15.790
 of the low and behold you see that it is really 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.790

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.000

 as the application is very simple 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.970
