00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
bouncing down if you go over it too much

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.970 
bouncing down if you go over it too much
you're<00:02:26.120> gonna<00:02:26.270> risk<00:02:26.660> kind<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.290> blurring<00:02:27.800> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
you're gonna risk kind of blurring the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.580 
you're gonna risk kind of blurring the
lines<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.760> this<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.209> sort<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.540> a<00:02:29.690> one-hit

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
lines so this is sort of a one-hit

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.160 
lines so this is sort of a one-hit
wonder<00:02:30.620> with<00:02:31.250> this<00:02:31.489> just<00:02:31.850> kind<00:02:32.090> of<00:02:32.209> bounce<00:02:32.720> and

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
wonder with this just kind of bounce and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.320 
wonder with this just kind of bounce and
then<00:02:33.770> move<00:02:34.070> to<00:02:34.100> another<00:02:34.400> area

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.540
