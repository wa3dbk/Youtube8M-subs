00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:11.470

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.450
 throwing honey 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.950

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.950
 honey what contributes 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.820
 The hair is soft 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.280
 so we're going to aa 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.280
 distribute 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.060
 the amount 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.060
 considers 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.430
 we are also going to add 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.300
 a spoonful of virgin olive oil 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.300
 extra 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:08.229
 and also sweet almond oil 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.229
 sweet almonds 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.310
 what almond oil does 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.080
 sweets 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.570
 especially strengthen the hair 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.160
 and those areas that are damaged as 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:27.720
 for example the tips that are usually 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.670
 April and tar and so they try 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.340
 regenerate them and leave them softer 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.500
 we are also going to add a spoonful of 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.500
 white wine vinegar 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:49.870
 and this is going to make our hair 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:52.540
 take the shine already lost so much the 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:57.459
 vinegar like 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:02.680
 the lemon juice usually give a lot of shine 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:06.910
 to the hair and we are also going to add 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.270
 aloe vera i am going to add this gel 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.550
 which is from mercadona than in another tutorial 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.230
 I will explain exactly why I use it 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:20.970
 that practically for all because 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.970
 contains a lot of aloe 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.070
 well, natural 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.240
 and the truth that to me with the skin so 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.240
 sensitive that I have then 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:40.250
 it helps me a lot for all the 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.480
 inclement weather and other good 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.650
 once we have all the 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.650
 ingredients we are going to 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.170
 to move very well 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:59.330
 stays and caesar depending on the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.790
 amount of hair you have then well 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.140
 let's take one or two egg yolks 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:08.810
 I'm seeing that for my hair this 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.400
 it's going to stay short so I'm going to 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.069
 throw another 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.880
 other buds of musicians once you already 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:23.420
 we have 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:23.420
 the mixture made and well proceed 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.770
 comb the hair 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.250
 very well 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.230
 once we already have all the entanglements 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.810
 taken away 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.810
 to protect him with 12 years 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.620
 and let's see 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:02.569
 Apply 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:05.539
 the product all over the hair 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.760
 I 'm going to apply it with the yolks of the 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:10.540
 fingers I'm going to put 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.540
 and deception 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.580
 and little by little 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:23.060
 all over the hair 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.060
 it's a little 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:35.169
 because they keep the egg when it dries 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:35.169
 it stays pretty hard 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:42.420
 I like to apply it from the roots 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.820
 to the tips because as I say 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.310
 It is a mask to strengthen and what 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.850
 best way to strengthen the hair 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:54.950
 that from the root to the tips like 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:57.880
 It takes the egg takes a lot 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.880
 vitamins 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.980
 It also carries oils that protect the 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.980
 hair 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.310
 and the truth 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.000
 as you see gotten 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:32.960
 when I have applied to all the 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:37.210
 mask as 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:41.810
 so that it penetrates well apart because the 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:43.699
 massage contact will provide 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:46.849
 heat to the mix and it's going to make 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:48.830
 penetrate better in the hair fiber well 

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:51.889
 that once we have massage we have 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.720
 applied all the mixture we massaged 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.039
 and we have spread all the mixture by 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.490
 all the hair 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.490
 we are going to 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.930
 roll it up and let's let it act 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:12.129
 15 or 20 minutes later the vice by 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:15.050
 normal clarifies jce and well let's notice 

00:07:12.129 --> 00:07:19.039
 the result especially for the yolk of the 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:21.280
 egg because it really gives quite 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:24.470
 results I hope you like it in my 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.360

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.139
