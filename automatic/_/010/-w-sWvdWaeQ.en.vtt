00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.570
 oh girls and boys here 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.080
 a video I will show you how 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.060
 repair a powder case so this is a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.480
 blush or lighthouse all that is 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.279
 so compact for those you need 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.230
 your powder case so this is your 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:34.920
 compact 70% alcohol handkerchiefs 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.290
 is a utensil a little utensil for 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.579
 crush it all so to start I 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.710
 advise you to wash your hands 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.020
 and disinfect all the utensils or 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.590
 container that you will use so 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.350
 to start you crush the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.809
 powder a maximum if there are small 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.789
 pieces it does not matter they'll get 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.829
 dissolve the moment we pour 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.820
 the alcohol in it so soon crushed and 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:11.220
 this is me I leave it in his 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:14.970
 original packaging and then I add 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.880
 the alcohol so a council for well proportioned 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.619
 to have a control over the dosage 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.869
 put alcohol first in the cork 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.930
 and you slowly know that 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.970
 more alcohol than you go m if after 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.400
 the powder is too liquid 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.170
 it can go up the level and so you 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.040
 go to have to wait a lot more 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.350
 long as alcohol evaporates for 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.619
 you can use your makeup 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.430
 or your bluff so here's some advice 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.130
 dosed and in order to obtain a paste but 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.229
 not too much liquid because I 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.490
 did it for the blush mac and 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.750
 unfortunately there were small 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.350
 air bubbles that remained at 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.340
 interior 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.399
 here we have no problem so here we go 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.840
 two and little by little and then it'll go 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.920
 faster for drying for 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.920
 evaporation of alcohol 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.090
 if you put too much alcohol you 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.940
 can have worries like here a 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.560
 little air hole so you do the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.700
 gesture that I'm doing 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.400
 air bubbles from group 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.050
 the utensil I'm using right now 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.709
 it is a utensil with mac 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.569
 of utensils pro and that's what that is 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:34.170
 I am actually using to resume but 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.300
 blush cream or closed blend where one puts 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.170
 cream compact foundation 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.540
 so here you are you remember the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.130
 everything to have a flat surface if 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.549
 there are small irregularities this is 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.930
 not a problem so to finish 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:54.780
 neatly you use a tissue 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:00.500
 to actually clean your djing package 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.500
 and that's it to finish the whole thing 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.310
 as it is a product 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.810
 bobby brown here they are removable so 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.510
 here I removed it all because its 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.560
 returned to the east in the recesses 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.660
 so that's it cleans up then cleans up 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.459
 for bargain hunters bricks of the bobby style 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.950
 brown split the compacts after all 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.209
 you have different colors 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.709
 you have a way but I did not 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.239
 really want to do it is to 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.070
 repeat each color each time 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.260
 as bargain hunters brics and its 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.750
 lines and so when his casbah that's it 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.370
 stay well separated you can take 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.440
 small compartments of mini 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.989
 goblets and so resume every time 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:45.299
 each color is then worked by 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:47.459
 color but me what I did here 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.260
 it's just trying to leave 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.450
 a bit because the bricks bargainers in 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.340
 general I use them while passing all 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.319
 not a jump I do not really tell you 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.350
 color by color but that's it for 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.150
 keep a little beauty of this powder 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.900
 I tried to leave each color to 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.900
 his place 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.280
 so here you can do that with 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.820
 all your powder as long as it is 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.220
 compact 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.540
 watch out for some pigments because 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.590
 that for the pigments it's a bit 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.360
 different 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.250
 the pigments you just need to 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.350
 add a few clicks of glycerin 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:24.900
 pardon so the alcohol is in 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.150
 pharmacy in supermarkets not really 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.860
 all know that absolutely need 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.410
 70% and glycerine 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:33.840
 it costs nothing in pharmacy 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.000
 also and as for the 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.950
 product quality it's always the 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.450
 even here an example with one of my 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.090
 favorites at mac 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.740
 it was a mineralized well here it is 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.720
 was just falling the only difference 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.730
 is that they move if not always the 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.650
 same intensity the composition remains the 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.450
 even there is no problem you go 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.160
 nothing to see on your skin so here you go 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.980
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:58.680
 thank you for the laity and and carve me if 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.210
 you intend to repair one of your compact 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.840
 I make you big kisses and I you 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.530
