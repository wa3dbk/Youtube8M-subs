an actual image gives you some idea for

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.210 
an actual image gives you some idea for
operation<00:02:35.879> of<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.150> turbine<00:02:39.290> if<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:40.860> notice

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
operation of the turbine if you notice

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.920

scroll the penstock diameter of a
Francis<00:02:54.659> turbine<00:02:55.079> could<00:02:55.290> be<00:02:55.439> as<00:02:55.620> large<00:02:55.890> as<00:02:56.129> 10

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
Francis turbine could be as large as 10

speed<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.260> runner<00:03:01.500> can<00:03:01.859> be<00:03:02.010> in<00:03:02.159> the<00:03:02.280> range

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
speed of the runner can be in the range

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.039 
speed of the runner can be in the range
of<00:03:02.670> 80<00:03:02.819> to<00:03:03.150> 1,000<00:03:03.840> rpm<00:03:05.030> the<00:03:06.030> turbine<00:03:06.480> shaft<00:03:06.510> of

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
of 80 to 1,000 rpm the turbine shaft of

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.899 
of 80 to 1,000 rpm the turbine shaft of
the<00:03:07.139> Francis<00:03:07.620> turbine<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:08.220> almost<00:03:08.579> always

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:08.909 
the Francis turbine is almost always

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:10.629 
the Francis turbine is almost always
mounted<00:03:09.540> vertically

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:10.639 
mounted vertically

00:03:10.639 --> 00:03:13.339 
mounted vertically
this<00:03:11.639> makes<00:03:11.940> discharge<00:03:12.510> of<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> water<00:03:13.049> much

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
this makes discharge of the water much

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.379 
this makes discharge of the water much
easier<00:03:13.709> due<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.190> swirling<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.909> water<00:03:15.150> in

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
easier due to swirling of the water in

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:17.599 
easier due to swirling of the water in
the<00:03:15.510> inlet<00:03:15.840> scroll<00:03:16.170> and<00:03:16.379> the<00:03:17.010> effect<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.459> the
