blocks of thoughts or radio signals can

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.399 
blocks of thoughts or radio signals can
translate<00:01:13.100> visually<00:01:13.880> Esther<00:01:14.450> is<00:01:14.600> translating

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.709 
her eyes and she saw a room full of
fireflies<00:02:09.700> what<00:02:10.700> looked<00:02:10.909> like<00:02:10.999> millions<00:02:11.599> of

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:11.719 
fireflies what looked like millions of

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.140

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
fireflies too many to count and then all

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.780 
fireflies too many to count and then all
of<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.359> fire

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
of the fire

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.660

gathered<00:02:15.390> together<00:02:15.659> in<00:02:15.840> one<00:02:15.870> corner<00:02:16.670> emitting

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
gathered together in one corner emitting

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.130 
gathered together in one corner emitting
the<00:02:17.760> light<00:02:17.939> that<00:02:18.090> was<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.269> bright<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.870> Esther

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
the light that was so bright that Esther

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.440 
the light that was so bright that Esther
could<00:02:19.290> not<00:02:19.469> look<00:02:19.680> into<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:20.159> and<00:02:20.430> then<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
could not look into it and then the

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.750 
could not look into it and then the
bright<00:02:21.659> light<00:02:21.900> dispersed<00:02:22.500> into<00:02:22.799> several

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
bright light dispersed into several

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.630 
bright light dispersed into several
lights<00:02:24.269> around<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.750> room<00:02:24.989> not<00:02:25.620> millions<00:02:26.370> and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640

not<00:02:26.790> one<00:02:27.000> bright<00:02:27.239> light<00:02:27.269> but<00:02:27.810> several<00:02:28.170> lights

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
not one bright light but several lights

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.649 
not one bright light but several lights
around<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.400> room<00:02:29.579> that<00:02:29.790> Esther<00:02:30.060> could<00:02:30.269> behold

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.440 
around the room that Esther could behold
and<00:02:31.049> then<00:02:31.739> she<00:02:31.980> said<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.519> see<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.420> are

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
and then she said I see that you are

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.250 
and then she said I see that you are
energy<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.200> we<00:02:34.620> said<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.459> your<00:02:35.879> visual

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
energy and we said this is your visual

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.349 
energy and we said this is your visual
translation<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.379> that<00:02:37.500> which<00:02:37.980> we<00:02:38.189> are<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.640> it

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
translation of that which we are and it

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.599 
translation of that which we are and it
is<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.750> most<00:02:39.900> accurate<00:02:40.340> translation<00:02:41.340> that

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
is the most accurate translation that

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.490 
is the most accurate translation that
Esther<00:02:42.269> and<00:02:42.420> her<00:02:42.540> practical<00:02:43.079> mindedness

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
could find because it was the

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.509 
could find because it was the
translation<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.920> way<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.280> we<00:02:47.400> were

projecting it in other words we want

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.110 
projecting it in other words we want

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 
literally created a language that

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.760 
literally created a language that
depicts<00:06:24.500> purely<00:06:25.160> the<00:06:25.400> intent<00:06:26.090> of<00:06:26.300> Abraham<00:06:27.140> but

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
that does not mean that it is the only

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.630 
that does not mean that it is the only
language<00:06:29.780> that<00:06:30.380> is<00:06:30.500> authentic<00:06:30.830> there<00:06:31.460> are

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:31.640 
language that is authentic there are

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.220 
language that is authentic there are
many<00:06:31.880> ways<00:06:32.090> of<00:06:32.450> interpreting<00:06:33.220> non-physical
