00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.470
 hi it's jacquot for a video of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.109
 presentation of euros troc simulator 2 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.880
 first I would like to tell you that no this 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.380
 is not a shit game what I 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.289
 think you think so but jean no 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.210
 it's not at all the series like 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.189
 excavator simulator or stuff in 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.700
 the genre is not at all 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.129
 same box 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.899
 so it's a eats are you that 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:36.270
 it's a good game it was noted by 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.120
 example by jeuxvideo.com she was 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.940
 so noted 16 out of 20 so that's it's a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.430
 good game symbology here I have that to 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.050
 bah say good bye after ten so 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.260
 as you can imagine, this is a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.430
 game two trucks drove trucks 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.989
 but there is not only that of course there is not 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.370
 that trucks can also manage 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.230
 our company for example we can 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.520
 have drivers I have two 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.040
 the two drivers I have six months and 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.870
 melanie they go important by day with 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.610
 so many profiles distance breeds the and 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.829
 hints of stuff me I you 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.420
 show it a bit later so here we go 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.409
 I have two drivers we can also 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.840
 buy trucks 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.299
 I have three trucks are forced to the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.569
 pay yourself good there is the bank there 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.780
 help 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:21.119
 but well we pay them so I have three 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.880
 trucks that's of course it's my handsome 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.100
 renault have magnificent chrono that I have 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.259
 paid 126 thousand euros so still a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.789
 good little money but I already have 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.549
 profitable since as you see it 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.439
 I came back to 124 thousand as well 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.329
 it's my head but on these maps is not 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.149
 my head in true of course we are encrypted 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.109
 obliged to take an avatar at the beginning 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.819
 so the good head of impeccable con of 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:46.829
 that otherwise there are level chi levels 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.240
 13 we feel the winners according to the 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.439
 number of races donated how much 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.299
 xp time per race 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.219
 I think about it because 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.599
 we win xp each race I leave 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.590
 too precisely how does it work but 

00:01:54.599 --> 00:02:01.259
 otherwise I would see my distance traveled 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.299
 monday this garden 10 of 4.2 I do not know 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.340
 too much what it fits I do not want too much 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.859
 why it's useful but hey there is one to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.569
 10 years two tablets analysis of 4.2 otherwise 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.520
 there's my red truck and one of the guys already 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.440
 17% 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.060
 that's good game I have pretty much everything 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.739
 show for the menu I can show it 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.000
 more but here I'll show you if 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.170
 you ask me to make videos 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.850
 above all cases it takes time in 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.680
 time but it will never be a series 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.880
 on it if you ask me to do 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.200
 a few small races once from 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.120
 from time to time there I you 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.200
 really details the game but in 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.300
 Waiting here is this little 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.800
 quick presentation he gets out of you 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.200
 ask if you want videos 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.349
 above or not good I was there I know 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.500
 even more where am I then where am 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.840
 besides I'm in the rain good I 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.380
 will go on the highway it's gone to 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.450
 larache 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.519
 I think I'm in Germany if I 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.380
 remember well nothing i show you a 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.440
 little world map right after I 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.030
 just but show you quickly 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.360
 how it's done that it's done well 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.099
 still 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.239
 Here it is quite well done 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.650
 it was in the rain so it's a little 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.760
 dark but when you see 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.170
 but I do not know if you have it 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.880
 in video but there is still more 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.459
 well done I think she is good 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.459
 done and worked well that's good 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.569
 classic decor in simulator mode 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.640
 still know that it's done well 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.959
 sign to my truck the class is good 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.069
 if I showed you the map of the world 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:22.290
 so here is the map of the world 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.700
 alas these little ones nothing only problem 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.829
 is that I can also you have 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.299
 noticed but there is no France there 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.500
 is not Spain after Portugal there is no 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.250
 not italy not press there are some 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.950
 screw in italy 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.930
 there are plenty of countries missing 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.019
 so that's a little defect a little 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.750
 big fault god and that's good it's 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.030
 already very big already to do everything a 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.639
 gag onale it's already very big you 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.040
 did he not long ago a time 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:48.389
 that it was pretty much the manchester I 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.790
 believe that up to line precisely I 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:52.680
 took the boat all the way up to 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.780
 linz so his version I'll show you 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.340
 if you ask me to make videos I 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.319
 will show you the tunnel under the sleeve 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.000
 the boat we can pass all that is 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.530
 Funny good it's funny except that it's 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.829
 that a load as you will see but 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.600
 well here it is it is quite complete 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.579
 here I think I showed you I 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.200
 did a little show everything this loan so 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.840
 I can show you also the others of 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.560
 fresh and marshall this fast thing that's it 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.849
 where these resignations all stupid is pretty much 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.099
 near what I had done last time 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:24.330
 but two senses so that's the way I do not 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.490
 do not see that you show others 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.639
 since the game is simulator 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.099
 here are little things in detail results 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.280
 no truck show you everything that 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.810
 is 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.120
 here is there flashing there are some 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.260
 headlights and hop the flashing gemmi which 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.650
 do not attempt akouala of course 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.990
 there is all that is normal flagship tac 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.850
 here I am going to make many calls from 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:51.160
 headlights lighthouse calls that's otherwise because 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.810
 everything a truck can see as 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.060
 el shehaby but no i'm 17% 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.650
 the current mission I have none and 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.060
 cuts also we see I'm not going all 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.550
 show you I'll show you that in 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.840
 a video if you ask me to hell I 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.100
 think I'll make you one 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.130
 small from time to time for example a 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.260
 little paris lille without with the maximum 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.230
 almond or fun stuff like that where 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.410
 it is precisely without fine without 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.700
 accident that's good short there's plenty 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.500
 there are a lot of dangerous things there but I 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.150
 can not show you everything like that 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.760
 that the map is big enough I can not 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:23.290
 all you show me 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.060
 So we will leave each other on top of me 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.060
 I'm having trouble turning around to turn around 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.130
 to return to Paris I have a little 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.960
 galley let go even pochy but it's not 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.210
 serious for the sake of the video I'm 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.850
 am lost it's not serious gps of any 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.790
 way so we're leaving here on 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:41.260
 we will meet again I think will also 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.760
 you ask me the dirt track video 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.110
 we will meet if renault trucks 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.230
 but otherwise one way I will do 

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:49.570
 other games presentations I think 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.590
 and I will probably continue the 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:51.940
 series sid meier's pirates 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.760

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.980
