opinion<00:01:47.690> why<00:01:48.650> was<00:01:48.890> Vista<00:01:49.310> not<00:01:49.549> so<00:01:49.940> well<00:01:50.150> we<00:01:50.299> see

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
opinion why was Vista not so well we see

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.840 
opinion why was Vista not so well we see
by<00:01:50.750> you<00:01:51.140> know<00:01:51.229> consumers<00:01:51.799> and<00:01:52.010> critics<00:01:52.790> alike

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
by you know consumers and critics alike

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.950 
by you know consumers and critics alike
I<00:01:53.240> think<00:01:54.110> Vista<00:01:54.740> was<00:01:55.490> a<00:01:55.520> situation<00:01:56.210> where<00:01:56.420> we

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
I think Vista was a situation where we

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.170 
I think Vista was a situation where we
had<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.549> product<00:01:58.549> which<00:01:58.670> we<00:01:58.790> wouldn't<00:01:59.000> really

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
had a product which we wouldn't really

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.730 
had a product which we wouldn't really
we<00:01:59.540> really<00:01:59.570> want<00:01:59.870> to<00:01:59.900> get<00:02:00.020> out<00:02:00.200> there<00:02:00.380> into<00:02:00.560> the

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
we really want to get out there into the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.680 
we really want to get out there into the
public<00:02:00.979> and<00:02:01.310> unfortunately<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.299> think<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.659> lot

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
public and unfortunately I think a lot

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.570 
public and unfortunately I think a lot
of<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.290> situations<00:02:03.799> where<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.220> know

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
of the the situations where you know

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.460 
of the the situations where you know
software<00:02:05.090> vendors<00:02:05.479> weren't<00:02:05.720> ready<00:02:06.049> our

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
software vendors weren't ready our

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.870 
software vendors weren't ready our
hardware<00:02:06.830> partners<00:02:07.130> weren't<00:02:07.400> ready<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:07.820> I

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
hardware partners weren't ready and I

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.919 
hardware partners weren't ready and I
think<00:02:08.060> partially<00:02:08.360> that's<00:02:08.659> their<00:02:08.810> own<00:02:08.899> fault

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
think partially that's their own fault

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.449 
think partially that's their own fault
row<00:02:09.349> we<00:02:09.440> probably<00:02:09.619> didn't<00:02:09.920> educate<00:02:10.009> them

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.459 
row we probably didn't educate them

more<00:05:22.860> stable<00:05:23.159> and<00:05:23.870> it's<00:05:24.870> more<00:05:25.020> usable<00:05:25.590> as<00:05:25.710> well

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
more stable and it's more usable as well

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.270 
more stable and it's more usable as well
right<00:05:26.310> in<00:05:26.880> fact<00:05:27.270> when<00:05:28.110> our<00:05:28.289> users<00:05:28.740> buy<00:05:28.949> a<00:05:28.979> mac

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
right in fact when our users buy a mac

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.310 
right in fact when our users buy a mac
they<00:05:29.729> love<00:05:30.030> that<00:05:30.060> experience<00:05:30.870> they<00:05:31.020> love<00:05:31.199> the

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
they love that experience they love the

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.070 
they love that experience they love the
experience<00:05:31.560> because<00:05:31.860> the<00:05:32.849> hardware<00:05:33.419> is<00:05:33.659> very

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
experience because the hardware is very

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.719 
experience because the hardware is very
tightly<00:05:34.380> integrated<00:05:35.130> with<00:05:35.159> the<00:05:35.280> software

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
tightly integrated with the software

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.790 
tightly integrated with the software
okay<00:05:36.210> and<00:05:36.419> so<00:05:36.539> we<00:05:36.659> can<00:05:36.810> really<00:05:37.020> produce<00:05:37.259> a<00:05:37.650> much

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
okay and so we can really produce a much

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.540 
okay and so we can really produce a much
better<00:05:38.250> system<00:05:39.030> than<00:05:39.270> anybody<00:05:39.750> else<00:05:39.960> can

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
better system than anybody else can

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.649 
better system than anybody else can
right<00:05:41.550> so<00:05:41.729> there's<00:05:41.880> a<00:05:41.909> rumor<00:05:42.120> going<00:05:42.150> on<00:05:42.509> the

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
right so there's a rumor going on the

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:43.939 
right so there's a rumor going on the
windows<00:05:42.960> seven<00:05:43.139> actually<00:05:43.259> improves<00:05:43.710> battery

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:43.949 
windows seven actually improves battery

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:46.760 
windows seven actually improves battery
life<00:05:44.250> on<00:05:44.460> notebooks<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:45.360> their<00:05:45.449> books<00:05:45.770> about

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
life on notebooks and their books about

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.350 
life on notebooks and their books about
this<00:05:46.979> yeah<00:05:47.610> I<00:05:47.639> mean<00:05:47.789> it's<00:05:47.969> just<00:05:48.060> something

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
this yeah I mean it's just something

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.520 
this yeah I mean it's just something
we're<00:05:48.479> actually<00:05:48.509> seeing<00:05:48.870> a<00:05:49.020> lot<00:05:49.229> of<00:05:49.259> users

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
we're actually seeing a lot of users

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.140 
we're actually seeing a lot of users
actually<00:05:49.770> experience<00:05:50.400> right<00:05:50.639> and<00:05:50.759> what<00:05:50.909> tends

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
actually experience right and what tends

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:52.999 
actually experience right and what tends
to<00:05:51.240> happen<00:05:51.330> is<00:05:51.719> because<00:05:51.840> of<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.289> processing

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:53.009 
to happen is because of the processing

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:54.320 
to happen is because of the processing
there's<00:05:53.400> actually<00:05:53.639> been<00:05:53.669> reduced<00:05:54.120> in<00:05:54.210> the

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
there's actually been reduced in the

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.480 
there's actually been reduced in the
optimization<00:05:54.630> of<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:55.830> actual<00:05:56.130> operating

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
optimization of the actual operating

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.580 
optimization of the actual operating
system<00:05:56.880> we're<00:05:57.419> seeing<00:05:57.719> now<00:05:57.840> that<00:05:58.199> it's<00:05:58.380> more

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 
system we're seeing now that it's more

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.779 
system we're seeing now that it's more
intelligent<00:05:59.159> in<00:05:59.219> the<00:05:59.280> way<00:05:59.400> it<00:05:59.460> actually<00:05:59.550> uses

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
intelligent in the way it actually uses

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:01.820 
intelligent in the way it actually uses
battery<00:06:00.210> life<00:06:00.389> so<00:06:00.690> non-essential<00:06:01.620> services

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
battery life so non-essential services

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.529 
battery life so non-essential services
can<00:06:02.219> be<00:06:02.250> shut<00:06:02.550> down<00:06:02.580> after<00:06:03.030> a<00:06:03.240> period<00:06:03.419> of

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
can be shut down after a period of

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.990 
can be shut down after a period of
inactivity<00:06:03.719> so<00:06:04.590> that<00:06:04.710> actually<00:06:05.000> increases

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
inactivity so that actually increases

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.959 
inactivity so that actually increases
the battery<00:06:06.479> life<00:06:06.630> okay<00:06:07.349> and<00:06:07.639> can<00:06:08.639> you<00:06:08.699> care

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:08.969 
the battery life okay and can you care

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:10.670 
the battery life okay and can you care
to<00:06:09.240> share<00:06:09.300> with<00:06:09.900> us<00:06:10.050> more<00:06:10.289> about<00:06:10.349> the<00:06:10.590> energy

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
to share with us more about the energy

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.820 
to share with us more about the energy
usage<00:06:11.250> on<00:06:11.460> windows<00:06:11.849> 7<00:06:11.969> yeah<00:06:12.840> so<00:06:13.139> so<00:06:13.500> what's

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
usage on windows 7 yeah so so what's

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.439 
usage on windows 7 yeah so so what's
interesting<00:06:14.009> is<00:06:14.310> that<00:06:14.340> with<00:06:14.639> windows<00:06:15.030> seven

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
interesting is that with windows seven

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.330 
interesting is that with windows seven
after<00:06:15.990> a<00:06:16.169> peer<00:06:16.440> of<00:06:16.469> an<00:06:16.590> activity<00:06:16.860> like<00:06:17.009> I<00:06:17.130> said

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
after a peer of an activity like I said

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:18.680 
after a peer of an activity like I said
it<00:06:17.430> shuts<00:06:17.639> it<00:06:17.789> down<00:06:17.820> now<00:06:18.090> we've<00:06:18.210> actually<00:06:18.360> seen

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:18.690 
it shuts it down now we've actually seen

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.810 
it shuts it down now we've actually seen
this<00:06:18.840> in<00:06:19.020> studies<00:06:19.380> that<00:06:19.530> after<00:06:19.889> 15<00:06:20.039> minutes<00:06:20.490> by

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
this in studies that after 15 minutes by

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.879 
this in studies that after 15 minutes by
default<00:06:21.270> it<00:06:21.840> will<00:06:21.900> actually<00:06:22.199> go<00:06:22.530> ahead<00:06:22.710> and

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
default it will actually go ahead and

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:24.529 
default it will actually go ahead and
shut<00:06:23.159> down<00:06:23.340> non-essential<00:06:23.520> services<00:06:24.180> like

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
shut down non-essential services like

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.240 
shut down non-essential services like
the<00:06:24.690> monitor<00:06:25.050> for<00:06:25.169> example<00:06:25.590> okay<00:06:25.830> and<00:06:26.009> they

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
the monitor for example okay and they

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.920 
the monitor for example okay and they
were<00:06:26.280> from<00:06:26.909> that<00:06:27.060> actual<00:06:27.389> shutdown<00:06:27.780> we've

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
were from that actual shutdown we've

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.839 
were from that actual shutdown we've
experienced<00:06:28.620> up<00:06:28.770> to<00:06:29.070> forty<00:06:29.490> percent

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
experienced up to forty percent

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:31.969 
experienced up to forty percent
electricity<00:06:30.599> savings<00:06:31.020> on<00:06:31.169> the<00:06:31.710> actual

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 
electricity savings on the actual

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.430 
electricity savings on the actual
machine<00:06:32.370> so<00:06:33.180> it's<00:06:33.389> really<00:06:33.690> efficient<00:06:34.259> for<00:06:34.380> the

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
machine so it's really efficient for the

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.670 
machine so it's really efficient for the
weight<00:06:34.560> and<00:06:34.710> she<00:06:34.860> handles<00:06:35.190> lectricity<00:06:36.680> all

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
weight and she handles lectricity all

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.679 
weight and she handles lectricity all
right<00:06:37.830> you<00:06:38.130> know<00:06:38.219> you

00:06:38.679 --> 00:06:38.689 
right you know you

00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:40.509 
right you know you
stop<00:06:39.110> about<00:06:39.289> power<00:06:39.559> saving<00:06:40.009> options<00:06:40.339> and

00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:40.519 
stop about power saving options and

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:42.729 
stop about power saving options and
energy<00:06:40.849> and<00:06:40.969> all<00:06:41.059> that<00:06:41.269> with<00:06:42.259> snow<00:06:42.529> leopard

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:42.739 
energy and all that with snow leopard

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:45.459 
energy and all that with snow leopard
giving<00:06:43.699> it<00:06:43.939> plays<00:06:44.239> a<00:06:44.269> part<00:06:44.659> in<00:06:44.869> minimizing

00:06:45.459 --> 00:06:45.469 
giving it plays a part in minimizing

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:49.389 
giving it plays a part in minimizing
energy<00:06:46.129> usage<00:06:46.459> you<00:06:46.610> know<00:06:46.959> yeah<00:06:47.959> Apple<00:06:48.709> has<00:06:48.739> a

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:49.399 
energy usage you know yeah Apple has a

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:52.239 
energy usage you know yeah Apple has a
comprehensive<00:06:50.169> approach<00:06:51.169> to<00:06:51.679> the<00:06:51.799> way<00:06:51.949> we

00:06:52.239 --> 00:06:52.249 
comprehensive approach to the way we

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:54.999 
comprehensive approach to the way we
account<00:06:52.969> for<00:06:53.119> all<00:06:53.449> the<00:06:53.809> power<00:06:54.019> consumption

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:55.009 
account for all the power consumption

00:06:55.009 --> 00:06:58.449 
account for all the power consumption
and<00:06:55.399> emissions<00:06:56.229> and<00:06:57.229> majority<00:06:57.889> of<00:06:57.919> them<00:06:58.189> comes

00:06:58.449 --> 00:06:58.459 
and emissions and majority of them comes

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.609 
and emissions and majority of them comes
from<00:06:58.699> the<00:06:58.819> use<00:06:58.999> of<00:06:59.029> our<00:06:59.299> products<00:06:59.719> so<00:07:00.319> what<00:07:00.499> we

00:07:00.609 --> 00:07:00.619 
from the use of our products so what we

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:02.679 
from the use of our products so what we
have<00:07:00.709> done<00:07:00.919> like<00:07:01.549> no<00:07:01.699> other<00:07:01.879> manufacturer<00:07:02.389> can

00:07:02.679 --> 00:07:02.689 
have done like no other manufacturer can

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:06.249 
have done like no other manufacturer can
do<00:07:02.899> is<00:07:03.110> to<00:07:03.439> tightly<00:07:04.429> integrate<00:07:05.149> again<00:07:05.749> all<00:07:05.959> the

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.259 
do is to tightly integrate again all the

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:09.489 
do is to tightly integrate again all the
software<00:07:07.039> and<00:07:07.279> the<00:07:07.399> hardware<00:07:07.629> to<00:07:08.629> really<00:07:09.289> save

00:07:09.489 --> 00:07:09.499 
software and the hardware to really save

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:11.350 
software and the hardware to really save
on<00:07:09.709> energy<00:07:10.159> use<00:07:10.669> and<00:07:10.849> there<00:07:11.029> are<00:07:11.089> really<00:07:11.239> three

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
on energy use and there are really three

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.149 
on energy use and there are really three
ways<00:07:11.809> right<00:07:12.139> which<00:07:12.349> you<00:07:12.499> can<00:07:12.679> save<00:07:12.919> on<00:07:13.039> energy

00:07:13.149 --> 00:07:13.159 
ways right which you can save on energy

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:15.609 
ways right which you can save on energy
just<00:07:13.610> one<00:07:14.089> which<00:07:14.419> is<00:07:14.449> to<00:07:14.869> use<00:07:15.110> really

00:07:15.609 --> 00:07:15.619 
just one which is to use really

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:19.929 
just one which is to use really
efficient<00:07:16.809> power<00:07:18.099> use<00:07:19.099> low<00:07:19.489> energy

00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:19.939 
efficient power use low energy

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:23.049 
efficient power use low energy
consumption<00:07:20.839> components<00:07:21.679> and<00:07:22.069> really<00:07:22.550> the

00:07:23.049 --> 00:07:23.059 
consumption components and really the

00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:24.879 
consumption components and really the
power<00:07:23.689> management<00:07:24.079> features<00:07:24.619> in<00:07:24.800> the

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:24.889 
power management features in the

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:27.129 
power management features in the
software<00:07:24.919> right<00:07:25.909> and<00:07:26.179> we<00:07:26.300> tightly<00:07:26.539> integrate

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:27.139 
software right and we tightly integrate

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:29.319 
software right and we tightly integrate
all<00:07:27.319> of<00:07:27.379> those<00:07:27.709> so<00:07:28.039> for<00:07:28.219> example<00:07:28.249> your<00:07:28.999> Mac

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:29.329 
all of those so for example your Mac

00:07:29.329 --> 00:07:32.619 
all of those so for example your Mac
os10<00:07:29.569> will<00:07:30.199> spin<00:07:30.439> down<00:07:30.619> whenever<00:07:30.889> possible<00:07:31.629> it

00:07:32.619 --> 00:07:32.629 
os10 will spin down whenever possible it

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:34.809 
os10 will spin down whenever possible it
will<00:07:32.929> deem<00:07:33.169> down<00:07:33.409> the<00:07:33.619> power<00:07:34.039> saving<00:07:34.519> already

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:34.819 
will deem down the power saving already

00:07:34.819 --> 00:07:37.959 
will deem down the power saving already
power<00:07:35.029> saving<00:07:35.449> LED<00:07:35.709> displays<00:07:36.709> as<00:07:36.919> I<00:07:37.459> mentioned

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:37.969 
power saving LED displays as I mentioned

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:40.989 
power saving LED displays as I mentioned
even<00:07:38.509> between<00:07:38.929> keystrokes<00:07:39.589> we<00:07:39.829> monitor<00:07:40.759> all

00:07:40.989 --> 00:07:40.999 
even between keystrokes we monitor all

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:44.199 
even between keystrokes we monitor all
the<00:07:41.209> processor<00:07:41.659> usage<00:07:42.289> in<00:07:43.219> in<00:07:43.459> fact<00:07:43.849> we<00:07:44.029> look

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:44.209 
the processor usage in in fact we look

00:07:44.209 --> 00:07:46.089 
the processor usage in in fact we look
at<00:07:44.389> the<00:07:44.509> mac<00:07:44.749> mini<00:07:44.779> for<00:07:45.319> example<00:07:45.800> that

00:07:46.089 --> 00:07:46.099 
at the mac mini for example that

00:07:46.099 --> 00:07:48.850 
at the mac mini for example that
consumes<00:07:46.639> about<00:07:46.849> twenty-five<00:07:47.569> percent<00:07:47.809> of<00:07:48.529> a

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:48.860 
consumes about twenty-five percent of a

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.069 
consumes about twenty-five percent of a
typical<00:07:49.189> light<00:07:49.909> bulb<00:07:50.149> which<00:07:50.779> is<00:07:50.929> fantastic
