00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.139
 today at f1 techno car tires from 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.410
 run always at full speed 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.389
 on the dry and in the wet they don't look like 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.009
 different from the others but the tires of 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.040
 a race car thanks to some 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.050
 features are unique speeds 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.510
 supersonic curves at the limit of force 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.130
 of gravity temperatures over 120 degrees 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.130
 and braking in just a few meters 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.379
 pilots take credit for each 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.690
 victory by crossing the finish line but 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:38.160
 behind every victory there are always 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.160
 excellent tires 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.980
 there are all kinds of pots 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.470
 test tubes vials stills born for 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.500
 measure collect mix e 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.780
 keep and here that many are born 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.440
 scientific discoveries and it is right here 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.449
 that the formula 1 tire is born 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.269
 over a thousand people work in the centers 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.040
 of pirelli research in the world and in this 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.720
 laboratory in milan every day 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.720
 more than 400 people work 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.689
 al pirelli tire accurate analysis 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.909
 chemical structure of the samples e 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.979
 components of all materials there 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.350
 will lead to the characterization of the 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.200
 tire compound faster than 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.380
 world 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.909
 256 are the podiums won by 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.909
 pirelli in formula 1 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.700
 now we pass the microscopic investigation 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.490
 through which they can be examined 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.500
 the properties of the compounds that give the 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.140
 structure characterization 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.560
 polymeric and inorganic charge of the 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.560
 mix 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.500
 putting together the results of these 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.990
 endless top secret searches and more than 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.180
 200 materials we get the mix 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.070
 perfect tire that before 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.090
 must be produced on a large scale must 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.700
 pass numerous tests in the meantime at 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.330
 motor sport department of Izmit in 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.400
 Turkey technical workers and engineers 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.820
 put theory into practice by building 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.400
 tires based on virtual models 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.830
 more than 100 elements per tire and 18 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.270
 structural components 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.090
 five hours of work per person 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.250
 coverage and more than 200 employees 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.530
 will produce as many as 50,000 tires for the 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.530
 formula 1 season 2013 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.030
 in this area a very precise radius 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.370
 laser traces the tread patterns on the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.530
 smooth tire surface for 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.290
 then switch to gouge where 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.680
 technical experts carve love the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.680
 prototype 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.849
 the tire is mounted in this 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:24.189
 machinery that measures distribution 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.189
 of pressures in the contact area 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.680
 now a loaded worm 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.519
 slowly reaching the tire 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.290
 a radial force of 800 kg each 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.870
 very thin slab of material 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.519
 piezoelectric manages to measure the 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.519
 pressure every square millimeter 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:50.139
 through a very powerful computer i 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.999
 data is analyzed and a map 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.969
 colored shows us the intensity of the 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:57.639
 load pressure and whether the test data 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:04:02.040
 the engineers meet these difficult 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.040
 tire is ready for the second test 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.100
 the maximum speed ever achieved in one 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.190
 Formula 1 track is a good 370 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.970
 kilometers per hour and the men of the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.660
 pirelli 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.660
 they know it well 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:27.590
 adherence, durability and safety are these 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.600
 the standards that a cover must 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.030
 guarantee on all types of 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.860
 asphalt and temperatures that sometimes 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.860
 exceed 120 degrees 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.320
 a mechanical arm pushes it 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.540
 tire on this drum from 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.410
 diameter of 2 meters and a good two tons 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.960
 of weight said road wheel that can 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.940
 reach speeds up to 450 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:05.180
 kilometers per hour 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:07.850
 a stroboscopic chamber through one 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.040
 strong light eternity frames it 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.320
 tire to monitor his own 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.980
 integrity making it seem to stand still 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.770
 despite the high speed 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.690
 and do not brake me as much as 10 times 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.910
 large compared to those of a municipality 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.560
 automobile are able to stop the 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.560
 drum in just 5 seconds 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.710
 while a special camera called 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.340
 also thermal imager measures the temperature 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.560
 in every single point of the image a 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.390
 technician with the help of a special 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.520
 processing software 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:43.400
 displays all phases on the screen 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.840
 of the test by monitoring temperatures e 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.840
 tire integrity 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:52.590
 beyond the laws of physics ailerons e 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.710
 dynamic air forces confer to 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.499
 single-seater an additional weight that grows 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.870
 with increasing speed , strength 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:02.999
 generated downwards or even 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.650
 exceed the weight of the twice 

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:07.110
 car 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.009
 the rubber rests on a belt that can 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.370
 arrive at a speed of 250 km per hour 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:16.789
 it's a giant mechanical arm 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:19.529
 exercises different pressures like on the track 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:21.960
 angles through a sensor 

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:24.620
 the forces transmitted to the are measured 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.599
 hub this test for external use 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.250
 requested by the formula 1 teams measure 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:33.379
 the dynamic response of the tire 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.379
 as if it were under the kingdom 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.260
 and now the tire is ready for 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:48.180
 Cut the finish line 

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:48.180
 provided that you do not stop in the pits
