00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the Maybelline one so I figured I would

do<00:00:22.230> like<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.560> swatch<00:00:23.029> comparison<00:00:24.029> on<00:00:24.300> my<00:00:24.810> under

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
eyes that way we can see which one is

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.880 
eyes that way we can see which one is
actually<00:00:26.939> better<00:00:27.300> for<00:00:27.869> me<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.349> best<00:00:28.590> type<00:00:28.769> of

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
actually better for me the best type of

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.230 
actually better for me the best type of
concealer<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.369> works<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.789> something<00:00:30.119> that

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
concealer that works is something that

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.849 
concealer that works is something that
has<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> beige<00:00:30.990> or<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.349> pink<00:00:31.679> undertone

has like a beige or a pink undertone

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.250 
has like a beige or a pink undertone
because<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.820> will<00:00:32.969> help<00:00:33.059> cancel<00:00:33.540> out<00:00:33.690> any

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
because that will help cancel out any

because that will help cancel out any
like<00:00:34.770> bluish<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.579> purple<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.809> have

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
it all right here so I probably won't be

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.240 
it all right here so I probably won't be
using<00:01:39.780> custard<00:01:40.320> today<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> just

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
using custard today because it just

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.580 
using custard today because it just
won't<00:01:41.490> work<00:01:41.790> with<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:42.810> I've<00:01:42.930> got<00:01:43.170> going<00:01:43.200> on

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
won't work with what I've got going on

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.469 
won't work with what I've got going on
and<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.280> have<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.729> Maybelline<00:01:45.210> fit

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
and then I have the Maybelline fit

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.420 
and then I have the Maybelline fit
concealers<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.860> colors<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> I<00:01:47.369> have

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
concealers and the colors that I have

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.630 
concealers and the colors that I have
are<00:01:47.909> 15<00:01:48.570> which<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.869> fair<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.310> this

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
are 15 which is fair and I think this

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.100 
are 15 which is fair and I think this
one<00:01:50.850> might<00:01:51.000> actually<00:01:51.060> end<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.630> being<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.960> little

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
one might actually end up being a little

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.830 
one might actually end up being a little
too<00:01:52.439> light<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:52.740> me<00:01:53.130> they<00:01:53.700> didn't<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.180> really

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
too light for me they didn't have really

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.690 
too light for me they didn't have really
like<00:01:55.079> any<00:01:55.290> shades<00:01:55.710> at<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.009> drugstore<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.549> I

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
like any shades at the drugstore that I

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.760 
like any shades at the drugstore that I
went<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.479> is<00:01:57.540> number<00:01:57.840> 15<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:58.619> it's

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
went to so this is number 15 and it's

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740 
went to so this is number 15 and it's
fair<00:01:59.100> with<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> pink<00:01:59.640> undertone<00:02:00.119> and<00:02:00.360> then<00:02:00.719> I

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
fair with a pink undertone and then I

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.410 
fair with a pink undertone and then I
have<00:02:00.990> number<00:02:01.649> 10<00:02:01.979> which<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.520> light<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.180> this

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
have number 10 which is light and this

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.480 
have number 10 which is light and this
one<00:02:03.630> also<00:02:03.840> has<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> pink<00:02:04.530> undertone<00:02:05.009> but<00:02:05.280> I'm

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
one also has a pink undertone but I'm

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.730 
one also has a pink undertone but I'm
going<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.700> do<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:06.090> on

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
going to do one on

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.199 
going to do one on
each<00:02:06.829> I<00:02:07.040> so<00:02:07.070> that<00:02:07.400> way<00:02:07.490> we<00:02:07.640> can<00:02:07.820> see<00:02:08.030> the

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
each I so that way we can see the

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.940 
each I so that way we can see the
difference<00:02:08.599> and<00:02:08.840> then<00:02:08.989> I'm<00:02:09.500> going<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.770> end<00:02:09.890> up

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
difference and then I'm going to end up

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.260 
difference and then I'm going to end up
zooming<00:02:10.310> in<00:02:10.459> even<00:02:10.700> though<00:02:10.789> I<00:02:10.819> don't<00:02:10.970> want<00:02:11.120> to

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
zooming in even though I don't want to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.420 
zooming in even though I don't want to
so<00:02:11.930> that<00:02:12.020> way<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:12.170> guys<00:02:12.349> can<00:02:12.560> really<00:02:12.739> see<00:02:13.040> i

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
so that way you guys can really see i

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.190 
so that way you guys can really see i
swatched<00:02:13.970> them<00:02:14.120> on<00:02:14.270> my<00:02:14.390> hand<00:02:14.599> earlier<00:02:14.930> but<00:02:15.170> I

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
swatched them on my hand earlier but I

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.690 
swatched them on my hand earlier but I
haven't<00:02:15.440> actually<00:02:15.709> tried<00:02:16.010> either<00:02:16.280> one<00:02:16.580> of

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
haven't actually tried either one of

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.820 
haven't actually tried either one of
these<00:02:16.819> on<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.180> under<00:02:17.390> eye<00:02:17.420> area<00:02:17.540> yet<00:02:18.080> so<00:02:18.709> this

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
these on the under eye area yet so this

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.470 
these on the under eye area yet so this
will<00:02:19.010> be<00:02:19.130> kind<00:02:19.459> of<00:02:19.489> like<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.670> first<00:02:19.880> impression

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
will be kind of like a first impression

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.479 
will be kind of like a first impression
video<00:02:20.599> too<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:21.319> obviously<00:02:22.010> I<00:02:22.069> don't<00:02:22.160> have<00:02:22.340> any

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
video too so obviously I don't have any

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:24.370 
video too so obviously I don't have any
makeup<00:02:22.610> on<00:02:22.849> right<00:02:23.060> now<00:02:23.180> besides<00:02:23.569> my<00:02:24.019> eyebrows

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
makeup on right now besides my eyebrows

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.620 
makeup on right now besides my eyebrows
just<00:02:24.620> that<00:02:24.950> way<00:02:25.099> like<00:02:25.670> I<00:02:25.910> don't<00:02:26.120> have<00:02:26.330> anything

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
just that way like I don't have anything

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.020 
just that way like I don't have anything
distracting<00:02:27.349> from<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:28.220> concealer

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
distracting from the concealer

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.390 
distracting from the concealer
competition<00:02:29.870> so<00:02:30.349> the<00:02:30.620> first<00:02:30.860> thing<00:02:31.160> obviously

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
competition so the first thing obviously

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.759 
competition so the first thing obviously
price<00:02:32.030> point<00:02:32.360> definitely<00:02:32.840> Maybelline<00:02:33.500> takes

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
price point definitely Maybelline takes

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:34.839 
price point definitely Maybelline takes
the<00:02:33.920> cake<00:02:34.099> on<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.430> one

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
the cake on that one

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.440 
the cake on that one
NARS<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.300> $29<00:02:35.989> maybelline<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.739> between<00:02:37.450> five

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
NARS is $29 maybelline is between five

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.699 
NARS is $29 maybelline is between five
and<00:02:38.900> seven

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
and seven

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.750 
and seven
so<00:02:40.489> clearly<00:02:40.910> this<00:02:41.510> one<00:02:41.870> wins<00:02:42.260> packaging<00:02:43.250> they

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
so clearly this one wins packaging they

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.550 
so clearly this one wins packaging they
look<00:02:43.970> very<00:02:44.000> similar<00:02:44.299> this<00:02:44.870> one<00:02:45.080> does<00:02:45.290> have<00:02:45.319> a

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
look very similar this one does have a

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.559 
look very similar this one does have a
higher-quality<00:02:46.040> feel<00:02:46.519> but<00:02:46.910> I<00:02:47.120> mean<00:02:47.239> that

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
higher-quality feel but I mean that

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.059 
higher-quality feel but I mean that
doesn't<00:02:47.750> really<00:02:47.959> matter<00:02:48.110> to<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.440> lot<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.680> people

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
doesn't really matter to a lot of people

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.509 
doesn't really matter to a lot of people
and<00:02:49.340> then<00:02:49.940> they<00:02:50.090> both<00:02:50.360> have<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:51.200> same<00:02:52.100> or

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:52.519 
and then they both have the same or

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.620 
and then they both have the same or
similar<00:02:52.630> applicator<00:02:53.630> it's<00:02:53.900> like<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.140> lip<00:02:54.950> gloss

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
similar applicator it's like a lip gloss

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.170 
similar applicator it's like a lip gloss
kind<00:02:56.630> of<00:02:57.549> applicator<00:02:58.549> so<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:58.910> like<00:02:59.060> the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
kind of applicator so it's like the

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.880 
kind of applicator so it's like the
exact<00:02:59.510> same<00:02:59.720> thing<00:02:59.930> I<00:03:00.080> think<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.350> NARS<00:03:00.560> one<00:03:00.769> is

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
exact same thing I think the NARS one is

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.590 
exact same thing I think the NARS one is
just<00:03:01.069> a<00:03:01.160> little<00:03:01.370> bit<00:03:01.489> larger<00:03:01.610> now<00:03:02.239> we're<00:03:02.450> just

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
just a little bit larger now we're just

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.640 
just a little bit larger now we're just
I<00:03:02.810> guess<00:03:02.959> going<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.230> go<00:03:03.290> ahead<00:03:03.380> and<00:03:03.560> get

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
I guess going to go ahead and get

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.530 
I guess going to go ahead and get
started<00:03:03.769> and<00:03:04.190> I'm<00:03:04.370> going<00:03:04.549> to<00:03:04.580> start<00:03:04.910> with<00:03:05.209> the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
started and I'm going to start with the

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.240 
started and I'm going to start with the
maybelline<00:03:06.230> one<00:03:06.440> so<00:03:06.799> when<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:07.010> put<00:03:07.160> on

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
maybelline one so when I put on

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.100 
maybelline one so when I put on
concealer<00:03:07.549> I<00:03:07.730> typically<00:03:08.180> like<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.480> focus<00:03:08.810> it

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
concealer I typically like to focus it

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.550 
concealer I typically like to focus it
more<00:03:09.410> like<00:03:09.709> on<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:09.950> inner<00:03:10.190> corner<00:03:11.530> like<00:03:12.530> that

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
more like on the inner corner like that

honey<00:03:34.190> from<00:03:34.519> NARS

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.870 

so<00:03:41.170> I'm<00:03:41.320> not<00:03:41.440> sure<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.920> think<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.310> guys<00:03:42.430> can<00:03:42.670> see

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
so I'm not sure I think you guys can see

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.290 
so I'm not sure I think you guys can see
it<00:03:42.970> but<00:03:43.000> honey<00:03:43.390> definitely<00:03:44.080> has<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.650> lot<00:03:44.860> more

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
it but honey definitely has a lot more

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.330 
it but honey definitely has a lot more
like<00:03:46.300> melon<00:03:46.810> in<00:03:47.020> it<00:03:47.410> more<00:03:47.770> of<00:03:47.830> like<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:47.980> salmon

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
like melon in it more of like a salmon

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.400 
like melon in it more of like a salmon
undertone<00:03:48.910> so<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:49.210> definitely<00:03:49.330> has<00:03:49.660> more<00:03:50.050> pink

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
undertone so it definitely has more pink

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.200 
undertone so it definitely has more pink
and<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.680> little<00:03:50.890> bit<00:03:50.980> less<00:03:51.160> neutral<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:51.880> now

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.210 
and a little bit less neutral and now

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.430 
and a little bit less neutral and now
I'm<00:03:52.300> going<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.450> go<00:03:52.600> ahead<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:52.870> buff<00:03:53.020> it<00:03:53.140> in<00:03:53.230> and

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
I'm going to go ahead and buff it in and

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.360 
I'm going to go ahead and buff it in and
I'm<00:03:53.500> going<00:03:53.650> to<00:03:53.740> start<00:03:53.980> off<00:03:54.070> with<00:03:54.100> the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
I'm going to start off with the

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:07.400 
I'm going to start off with the
maybelline<00:03:54.790> side

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.290 

okay<00:04:08.100> so<00:04:08.160> there's<00:04:08.460> that<00:04:08.700> one<00:04:08.910> it<00:04:09.090> definitely

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
okay so there's that one it definitely

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.350 
okay so there's that one it definitely
covers<00:04:10.110> pretty<00:04:10.680> well<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.550> now<00:04:11.790> I'm<00:04:11.970> going<00:04:12.210> to

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
covers pretty well and now I'm going to

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:25.340 
covers pretty well and now I'm going to
buff<00:04:12.930> out<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.200> NAR<00:04:13.410> side

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.320 

okay<00:04:26.040> so<00:04:26.100> I<00:04:26.250> can't<00:04:26.520> really<00:04:26.760> see<00:04:26.970> like<00:04:27.000> right

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
okay so I can't really see like right

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.970 
okay so I can't really see like right
after<00:04:27.480> I<00:04:27.630> buffed<00:04:27.900> it<00:04:28.050> in<00:04:28.170> the<00:04:28.320> NARS<00:04:28.530> is<00:04:28.800> like<00:04:28.950> a

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
after I buffed it in the NARS is like a

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.210 
after I buffed it in the NARS is like a
lot<00:04:29.280> darker<00:04:29.550> than<00:04:30.320> the<00:04:31.320> Maybelline<00:04:31.740> wand<00:04:31.950> okay

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
lot darker than the Maybelline wand okay

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.590 
lot darker than the Maybelline wand okay
so<00:04:32.280> I<00:04:32.400> just<00:04:32.610> zoomed<00:04:32.790> in<00:04:32.940> a<00:04:32.970> little<00:04:33.090> bit<00:04:33.390> more

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
so I just zoomed in a little bit more

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.020 
so I just zoomed in a little bit more
and<00:04:33.840> honestly<00:04:34.590> I<00:04:34.980> don't<00:04:35.190> really<00:04:35.400> see<00:04:35.700> much<00:04:35.850> of

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
and honestly I don't really see much of

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.350 
and honestly I don't really see much of
a<00:04:36.090> difference<00:04:36.450> besides<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.140> color<00:04:38.150> the<00:04:39.150> NARS

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
a difference besides the color the NARS

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.810 
a difference besides the color the NARS
one<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.780> definitely<00:04:40.320> like<00:04:40.530> not<00:04:40.640> the<00:04:41.640> right

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
one is definitely like not the right

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.460 
one is definitely like not the right
shade<00:04:42.120> for<00:04:42.150> me<00:04:42.480> it's<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.720> little<00:04:42.840> bit<00:04:43.050> too<00:04:43.260> dark

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
shade for me it's a little bit too dark

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.530 
shade for me it's a little bit too dark
and<00:04:43.740> it's<00:04:43.890> even<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.370> says<00:04:44.580> it's<00:04:44.790> light<00:04:45.060> so<00:04:45.390> I'm

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
and it's even it says it's light so I'm

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.500 
and it's even it says it's light so I'm
not<00:04:45.660> sure<00:04:46.370> what<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.490> dealio<00:04:47.700> is<00:04:47.880> there

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
what it looks like after it's kind of

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.240 
what it looks like after it's kind of
like<00:05:26.670> set<00:05:27.030> okay<00:05:27.690> so<00:05:27.750> it's<00:05:27.990> been<00:05:28.050> about<00:05:28.250> 10-15

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
like set okay so it's been about 10-15

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.790 
like set okay so it's been about 10-15
minutes<00:05:29.280> since<00:05:29.880> I<00:05:30.090> added<00:05:30.420> the<00:05:30.870> setting<00:05:31.680> powder

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
minutes since I added the setting powder

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.770 
minutes since I added the setting powder
around<00:05:32.220> my<00:05:32.310> eyes<00:05:32.490> and<00:05:32.790> I'm<00:05:33.330> just<00:05:33.480> checking

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
around my eyes and I'm just checking

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.700 
around my eyes and I'm just checking
back<00:05:34.080> in<00:05:34.110> and<00:05:34.800> it<00:05:35.760> actually<00:05:35.820> looks<00:05:36.600> like<00:05:36.900> the

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
back in and it actually looks like the

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.770 
back in and it actually looks like the
Maybelline<00:05:38.250> one<00:05:38.280> is<00:05:38.760> doing<00:05:39.210> a<00:05:39.390> little<00:05:39.570> bit

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
Maybelline one is doing a little bit

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.390 
Maybelline one is doing a little bit
less<00:05:39.960> creasing<00:05:40.500> than<00:05:40.680> the<00:05:40.800> NARS<00:05:41.010> one<00:05:41.220> which

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
less creasing than the NARS one which

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.780 
less creasing than the NARS one which
I'm<00:05:41.550> kind<00:05:41.820> of<00:05:42.590> surprised<00:05:43.590> by<00:05:43.860> it<00:05:44.460> looks<00:05:44.670> like

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
I'm kind of surprised by it looks like

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.670 
I'm kind of surprised by it looks like
the<00:05:44.940> NARS<00:05:45.180> one<00:05:45.360> kind<00:05:45.930> of<00:05:46.020> built<00:05:46.260> up<00:05:46.380> a<00:05:46.560> little

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
the NARS one kind of built up a little

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.040 
the NARS one kind of built up a little
bit<00:05:46.890> more<00:05:47.100> around<00:05:47.370> my<00:05:47.880> drier<00:05:48.240> areas<00:05:48.720> I<00:05:48.900> mean

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
bit more around my drier areas I mean

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.570 
bit more around my drier areas I mean
it's<00:05:49.200> also<00:05:49.320> a<00:05:49.470> lot<00:05:49.650> easier<00:05:49.680> to<00:05:50.130> see<00:05:50.280> because

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
it's also a lot easier to see because

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.550 
it's also a lot easier to see because
this<00:05:50.700> color<00:05:50.940> is<00:05:51.150> just<00:05:51.330> not<00:05:51.510> working<00:05:51.720> for<00:05:52.020> me<00:05:52.080> at

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
this color is just not working for me at

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.100 
this color is just not working for me at
all<00:05:52.830> but<00:05:53.190> it<00:05:53.370> looks<00:05:53.670> like<00:05:53.940> the<00:05:54.360> Maybelline<00:05:54.870> one

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
all but it looks like the Maybelline one

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.750 
all but it looks like the Maybelline one
kind<00:05:55.620> of<00:05:55.740> worked<00:05:55.980> a<00:05:56.070> little<00:05:56.190> bit<00:05:56.370> better<00:05:56.430> with

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
kind of worked a little bit better with

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.700 
kind of worked a little bit better with
my<00:05:56.880> drier<00:05:57.120> skin<00:05:57.450> so<00:05:57.750> I<00:05:57.780> guess<00:05:57.960> overall<00:05:58.290> I

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
my drier skin so I guess overall I

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.880 
my drier skin so I guess overall I
probably<00:05:59.580> would<00:06:00.240> not<00:06:00.480> say<00:06:00.810> and<00:06:01.380> this<00:06:01.560> actually

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:01.890 
probably would not say and this actually

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.500 
probably would not say and this actually
hurts<00:06:02.070> saying<00:06:02.370> this<00:06:02.520> but<00:06:02.790> you're<00:06:03.330> probably

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
hurts saying this but you're probably

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.710 
hurts saying this but you're probably
just<00:06:04.050> as<00:06:04.440> well<00:06:05.430> off<00:06:05.700> buying<00:06:06.090> the<00:06:06.270> Maybelline

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
just as well off buying the Maybelline

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.570 
just as well off buying the Maybelline
one<00:06:06.750> as<00:06:07.170> you<00:06:07.350> are<00:06:07.470> the<00:06:07.650> NARS<00:06:07.860> one<00:06:07.980> just<00:06:08.400> because

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
one as you are the NARS one just because

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.910 
one as you are the NARS one just because
it's<00:06:09.090> I<00:06:09.360> mean<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.750> coverage<00:06:10.260> is<00:06:10.410> very<00:06:10.470> similar

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:10.920 
it's I mean the coverage is very similar

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.070 
it's I mean the coverage is very similar
I<00:06:11.280> feel<00:06:11.610> like<00:06:11.910> the<00:06:12.090> Maybelline<00:06:12.540> one<00:06:12.570> is<00:06:13.050> a

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
I feel like the Maybelline one is a

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.310 
I feel like the Maybelline one is a
little<00:06:13.530> bit<00:06:14.210> more<00:06:15.210> forgiving<00:06:15.780> around<00:06:15.900> drier

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
little bit more forgiving around drier

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.290 
little bit more forgiving around drier
areas<00:06:16.800> especially<00:06:17.130> once<00:06:17.610> I<00:06:17.700> put<00:06:17.880> a<00:06:17.910> setting

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
areas especially once I put a setting

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.140 
areas especially once I put a setting
powder<00:06:18.480> on<00:06:18.600> top<00:06:18.900> of<00:06:19.080> it<00:06:19.230> and<00:06:19.670> it's<00:06:20.670> also<00:06:20.820> a<00:06:20.940> lot

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
powder on top of it and it's also a lot

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.270 
powder on top of it and it's also a lot
cheaper<00:06:21.180> so<00:06:21.750> even<00:06:21.960> though<00:06:22.080> I<00:06:22.110> love<00:06:22.530> NARS<00:06:22.830> more

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 
cheaper so even though I love NARS more

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.460 
cheaper so even though I love NARS more
than<00:06:23.520> a<00:06:23.820> lot<00:06:24.060> of<00:06:24.210> things<00:06:24.420> I'm<00:06:25.080> actually<00:06:25.230> going

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
than a lot of things I'm actually going

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:26.960 
than a lot of things I'm actually going
to<00:06:25.560> have<00:06:25.650> to<00:06:25.740> vote<00:06:25.860> for<00:06:25.920> Maybelline<00:06:26.430> this<00:06:26.760> time

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:26.970 
to have to vote for Maybelline this time

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.900 
to have to vote for Maybelline this time
which<00:06:27.210> is<00:06:27.360> a<00:06:27.650> surprising<00:06:28.650> but<00:06:29.220> I<00:06:29.280> think<00:06:29.610> it<00:06:29.730> did

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
which is a surprising but I think it did

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.520 
which is a surprising but I think it did
a<00:06:29.940> really<00:06:30.030> good<00:06:30.450> job<00:06:30.660> and<00:06:30.870> I<00:06:30.930> also<00:06:31.110> think

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
a really good job and I also think

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.030 
a really good job and I also think
Maybelline<00:06:32.160> has<00:06:32.460> a

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:33.040 
Maybelline has a

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.100 
Maybelline has a
good<00:06:33.190> range<00:06:33.550> of<00:06:33.820> colors<00:06:34.180> typically<00:06:34.960> they're

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
good range of colors typically they're

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.230 
good range of colors typically they're
out<00:06:35.290> of<00:06:35.320> stock<00:06:35.650> of<00:06:36.010> most<00:06:36.550> of<00:06:36.700> the<00:06:36.820> popular

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 
out of stock of most of the popular

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.480 
out of stock of most of the popular
shades<00:06:37.510> so<00:06:37.720> you<00:06:37.780> might<00:06:37.990> be<00:06:38.110> better<00:06:38.260> off
