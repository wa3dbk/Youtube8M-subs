I<00:02:02.790> think<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> eyelashes<00:02:03.689> are<00:02:03.810> making<00:02:04.110> up<00:02:04.229> for

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
I think the eyelashes are making up for

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.440 
I think the eyelashes are making up for
the<00:02:04.500> lack<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.829> eyebrows<00:02:05.340> yeah<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:06.149> she

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the lack of eyebrows yeah I think she

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.320 
the lack of eyebrows yeah I think she
took<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.780> eyebrows<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.710> too

took the eyebrows out too
them<00:02:08.479> as<00:02:08.660> eyelash<00:02:09.440> extensions<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:11.360> you<00:02:11.570> know
