all<00:00:00.329> right<00:00:00.420> let's<00:00:00.630> give<00:00:00.780> them<00:00:00.900> another

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:01.020 
all right let's give them another

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.450 
all right let's give them another
example<00:00:01.770> and<00:00:01.860> let's<00:00:01.979> take<00:00:02.159> them<00:00:02.220> a<00:00:02.280> little

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
example and let's take them a little

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.999 
example and let's take them a little
closer<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.909> home<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.330> this<00:00:04.080> shows<00:00:04.410> that<00:00:04.440> God

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
closer to home and this shows that God

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.299 
closer to home and this shows that God
placed<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.060> earth<00:00:06.359> our<00:00:07.170> earth<00:00:07.410> in<00:00:07.740> just<00:00:08.040> the
