have<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.630> clutch<00:01:33.930> out<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> few<00:01:34.290> extra<00:01:34.439> kills<00:01:34.799> and

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
have to clutch out a few extra kills and

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.679 
have to clutch out a few extra kills and
it<00:01:35.400> all<00:01:35.520> happens<00:01:35.909> from<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.210> little<00:01:36.329> Aryan

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
it all happens from that little Aryan

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.210 
it all happens from that little Aryan
sub<00:01:36.930> base<00:01:37.110> like<00:01:37.320> directly<00:01:37.619> across<00:01:37.860> from<00:01:37.950> where

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
sub base like directly across from where

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.950 
sub base like directly across from where
I<00:01:38.250> am<00:01:38.369> right<00:01:38.520> now<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.090> I'm<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.780> spawn

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
I am right now and I'm just spawn

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.260 
I am right now and I'm just spawn
trapping<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.500> mother<00:01:40.710> at<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:42.180> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
trapping the mother at a and it's a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.490 
trapping the mother at a and it's a
medium<00:01:42.570> range<00:01:42.750> shot<00:01:43.020> something<00:01:43.259> that's

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
medium range shot something that's

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.080 
medium range shot something that's
probably<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> easiest<00:01:44.310> for<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.549> Uzi<00:01:44.880> but

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
probably not the easiest for the Uzi but

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.780 
probably not the easiest for the Uzi but
the<00:01:45.270> recoil<00:01:45.780> is<00:01:46.020> becoming<00:01:46.610> maintainable<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
the recoil is becoming maintainable and

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.940 
the recoil is becoming maintainable and
that's<00:01:48.390> like<00:01:48.750> always<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.320> difficulty<00:01:49.860> when

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
that's like always the difficulty when

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.800 
that's like always the difficulty when

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
what the hell it is but you think that's

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.590 
what the hell it is but you think that's
something<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.519> was<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.850> bulky<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.390> took

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
something that was that bulky and took

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.300 
something that was that bulky and took
up<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.959> kind<00:03:25.170> of<00:03:25.260> that<00:03:25.530> kind<00:03:25.650> of<00:03:25.769> room<00:03:26.010> I<00:03:26.160> mean

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
up that kind of that kind of room I mean

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.100 
up that kind of that kind of room I mean
it's<00:03:26.459> something<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:26.880> small<00:03:26.940> yet<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.660> has<00:03:27.840> like

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
it's something so small yet it has like

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.130 
it's something so small yet it has like
the<00:03:28.290> widest<00:03:28.860> fucking<00:03:29.459> hips<00:03:29.700> ever<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.450> don't

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
the widest fucking hips ever I don't

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.530 
the widest fucking hips ever I don't
know<00:03:31.260> what<00:03:31.440> it<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.709> I'm<00:03:31.950> it's<00:03:32.880> just<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.420> think

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
know what it is I'm it's just you think

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.030 
know what it is I'm it's just you think
it<00:03:33.690> would<00:03:33.810> be<00:03:33.900> like<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.110> smaller<00:03:34.440> little<00:03:34.709> bit<00:03:34.920> of

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
it would be like a smaller little bit of

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.160 
it would be like a smaller little bit of
a<00:03:35.160> bit<00:03:36.030> of<00:03:36.120> an<00:03:36.209> iron<00:03:36.420> site<00:03:36.660> for<00:03:36.840> something<00:03:37.050> that

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
a bit of an iron site for something that

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.890 
a bit of an iron site for something that
says<00:03:37.320> small<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.860> precise<00:03:38.310> but<00:03:38.610> it's<00:03:39.600> really

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
says small and precise but it's really

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.660 
says small and precise but it's really
just<00:03:40.050> it's<00:03:40.470> just<00:03:40.560> really<00:03:40.950> an<00:03:41.130> awkward<00:03:41.430> one<00:03:41.519> it

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
just it's just really an awkward one it

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.160 
just it's just really an awkward one it
just<00:03:41.790> takes<00:03:41.970> up<00:03:42.150> so<00:03:42.330> much<00:03:42.390> room<00:03:42.540> it's<00:03:42.930> hard<00:03:42.989> to

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
just takes up so much room it's hard to

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.259 
just takes up so much room it's hard to
be<00:03:43.260> accurate<00:03:43.470> but<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.700> actually<00:03:44.910> pretty

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
be accurate but it's actually pretty

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:46.729 
be accurate but it's actually pretty
damn<00:03:45.510> decent<00:03:45.750> it's<00:03:46.019> something<00:03:46.500> i<00:03:46.560> wouldn't

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
damn decent it's something i wouldn't

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.140 
damn decent it's something i wouldn't
expect<00:03:46.860> it's<00:03:47.250> like<00:03:47.370> trying<00:03:47.550> like<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.850> famas

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
expect it's like trying like the famas

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.699 
expect it's like trying like the famas
red<00:03:48.390> dot<00:03:48.570> sight<00:03:48.810> or<00:03:48.959> something<00:03:49.200> on<00:03:49.320> black<00:03:49.500> ops

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
red dot sight or something on black ops

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.050 
red dot sight or something on black ops
and<00:03:49.950> putting<00:03:50.160> on<00:03:50.280> one<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.550> big<00:03:50.760> fat

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
and putting on one of the big fat

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.240 
and putting on one of the big fat
radicals<00:03:51.989> on<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.290> when<00:03:52.470> you<00:03:52.800> should<00:03:52.980> just<00:03:53.130> be

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
radicals on it when you should just be

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.040 
radicals on it when you should just be
using<00:03:53.519> like<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.790> dot<00:03:54.000> or<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.660> lines<00:03:54.870> without

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
using like the dot or the lines without

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:58.040 
using like the dot or the lines without
or<00:03:55.320> something<00:03:55.560> like<00:03:55.680> that<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.900> I've<00:03:57.900> also

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
or something like that and I've also

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.240 
or something like that and I've also
wanted<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.530> address<00:03:58.739> something<00:03:59.010> now<00:03:59.220> that

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
wanted to address something now that

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.979 
wanted to address something now that
we're<00:03:59.430> back<00:03:59.459> in<00:03:59.610> involved<00:04:00.420> in<00:04:00.510> here<00:04:00.720> is<00:04:00.840> I'm

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
we're back in involved in here is I'm

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.300 
we're back in involved in here is I'm
contemplating<00:04:01.680> getting<00:04:01.769> back<00:04:02.040> into<00:04:02.190> the

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
contemplating getting back into the

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.860 
contemplating getting back into the
competitive<00:04:02.519> scene<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.000> little<00:04:03.180> bit<00:04:03.450> which

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
competitive scene a little bit which

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.360 
competitive scene a little bit which
would<00:04:04.019> require<00:04:04.140> me<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.500> play<00:04:04.709> black<00:04:04.950> ops<00:04:05.130> not

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
would require me to play black ops not

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.860 
would require me to play black ops not
necessarily<00:04:05.820> for<00:04:05.970> gameplays<00:04:06.360> but<00:04:06.570> actually

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
necessarily for gameplays but actually

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.660

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:09.860 
play again and I'm thinking about
getting<00:04:08.940> into<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.390> getting<00:04:09.600> back<00:04:09.720> into

like<00:05:23.740> nine<00:05:24.039> kills<00:05:24.400> or<00:05:24.550> so<00:05:24.729> something

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:25.300 
like nine kills or so something

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.640 
like nine kills or so something
something<00:05:25.599> roughly<00:05:25.990> around<00:05:26.139> there<00:05:26.379> nine<00:05:26.530> or

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
something roughly around there nine or

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:28.499 
something roughly around there nine or
ten<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.039> some<00:05:27.819> base<00:05:27.940> has<00:05:28.090> always<00:05:28.330> been<00:05:28.449> a

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
ten and some base has always been a

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:29.909 
ten and some base has always been a
difficult<00:05:28.780> map<00:05:29.110> and<00:05:29.319> that's<00:05:29.440> what<00:05:29.590> has<00:05:29.740> always

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 
difficult map and that's what has always

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:31.409 
difficult map and that's what has always
baffled<00:05:30.430> me<00:05:30.460> why<00:05:30.639> I've<00:05:30.789> always<00:05:30.940> been<00:05:31.120> shocked

baffled me why I've always been shocked

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:32.790 
baffled me why I've always been shocked
even<00:05:31.539> though<00:05:31.750> demolitions<00:05:32.259> a<00:05:32.319> lot<00:05:32.469> easier<00:05:32.680> to

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
even though demolitions a lot easier to

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.709 
even though demolitions a lot easier to
spawn<00:05:33.039> trap<00:05:33.279> and<00:05:33.460> get<00:05:33.580> nukes<00:05:33.819> on<00:05:34.000> on<00:05:34.240> this<00:05:34.509> map

spawn trap and get nukes on on this map

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:37.050 
spawn trap and get nukes on on this map
it<00:05:35.529> was<00:05:35.620> always<00:05:35.770> a<00:05:35.889> shocking<00:05:36.400> fact<00:05:36.639> to<00:05:36.759> me<00:05:36.880> that

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
it was always a shocking fact to me that

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.149 
it was always a shocking fact to me that
when<00:05:37.180> I<00:05:37.210> got<00:05:37.419> my<00:05:37.599> my<00:05:37.930> quad<00:05:38.169> nuke<00:05:38.409> eventually<00:05:39.009> it

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
when I got my my quad nuke eventually it

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.550 
when I got my my quad nuke eventually it
was<00:05:39.550> on<00:05:39.729> this<00:05:39.969> map<00:05:40.300> and<00:05:40.659> you<00:05:41.259> know<00:05:41.380> I<00:05:41.409> was

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.870 
was on this map and you know I was
thought<00:05:41.949> it<00:05:42.039> would<00:05:42.159> be<00:05:42.250> on<00:05:42.310> like<00:05:42.460> Afghan<00:05:42.849> or

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
thought it would be on like Afghan or

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.370 
thought it would be on like Afghan or
favela<00:05:43.330> you<00:05:43.509> know<00:05:43.599> because<00:05:43.840> my<00:05:43.870> first<00:05:44.139> tooth

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380 
favela you know because my first tooth

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.019 
favela you know because my first tooth
triple<00:05:44.800> nukes<00:05:44.979> well<00:05:45.190> favela<00:05:45.520> so<00:05:45.699> I<00:05:45.729> figured

00:05:46.019 --> 00:05:46.029 
triple nukes well favela so I figured

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:47.339 
triple nukes well favela so I figured
that<00:05:46.180> was<00:05:46.330> going<00:05:46.539> to<00:05:46.569> be<00:05:46.659> the<00:05:46.840> map<00:05:46.990> to<00:05:47.110> do<00:05:47.199> it

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
that was going to be the map to do it

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:49.110 
that was going to be the map to do it
the<00:05:47.770> second<00:05:48.130> one<00:05:48.219> I<00:05:48.250> did<00:05:48.490> was<00:05:48.699> very<00:05:48.819> close<00:05:49.090> to

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.120 
the second one I did was very close to

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.450 
the second one I did was very close to
being<00:05:49.270> a<00:05:49.479> quad<00:05:49.690> as<00:05:49.840> well<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.289> you<00:05:51.159> know<00:05:51.250> that's

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
being a quad as well and you know that's

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.670 
being a quad as well and you know that's
what<00:05:51.580> I<00:05:51.610> was<00:05:51.759> always<00:05:51.909> looking<00:05:52.029> for<00:05:52.599> and<00:05:52.810> and

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
what I was always looking for and and

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.409 
what I was always looking for and and
then<00:05:53.949> I<00:05:54.039> tried<00:05:54.279> pressing<00:05:54.490> myself<00:05:54.819> to<00:05:55.120> get<00:05:55.210> five

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
then I tried pressing myself to get five

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:56.760 
then I tried pressing myself to get five
nukes<00:05:55.659> in<00:05:55.779> one<00:05:55.870> game<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.169> after<00:05:56.259> that<00:05:56.469> point<00:05:56.680> I

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
nukes in one game and after that point I

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.589 
nukes in one game and after that point I
couldn't<00:05:56.979> even<00:05:57.039> get<00:05:57.219> a<00:05:57.250> four<00:05:57.520> again<00:05:57.819> things
