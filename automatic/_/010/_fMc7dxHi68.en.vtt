00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
far I'm liking these colony traps I

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.960 
far I'm liking these colony traps I
think<00:03:46.959> that<00:03:47.110> behalf<00:03:47.350> doesn't<00:03:47.800> when<00:03:48.670> I<00:03:48.700> went<00:03:48.910> to

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
think that behalf doesn't when I went to

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.160 
think that behalf doesn't when I went to
Minnesota<00:03:49.120> there<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:49.840> they're<00:03:50.140> working

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170
