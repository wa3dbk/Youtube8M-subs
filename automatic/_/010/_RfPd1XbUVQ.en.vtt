for<00:03:05.850> me<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:07.459> but<00:03:08.459> somehow<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.090> think<00:03:09.239> since<00:03:09.870> I

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
for me and but somehow I think since I

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.470 
for me and but somehow I think since I
moved<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.380> London<00:03:10.760> I<00:03:12.470> I<00:03:13.470> sort<00:03:13.859> of<00:03:13.950> see<00:03:14.730> this

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
moved to London I I sort of see this

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.890 
moved to London I I sort of see this
problem<00:03:16.019> actually<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:16.799> just<00:03:17.390> small<00:03:18.390> part<00:03:18.780> of

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
problem actually it's just small part of

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.030 
problem actually it's just small part of
the<00:03:19.019> problem<00:03:19.230> we<00:03:19.680> are<00:03:19.709> facing<00:03:19.890> in<00:03:20.930> in<00:03:21.930> in<00:03:22.650> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the problem we are facing in in in a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.780 
the problem we are facing in in in a
circle<00:03:23.340> oh<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:26.160> that's<00:03:26.310> what<00:03:26.579> I'm<00:03:26.760> trying

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
circle oh so so that's what I'm trying

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.229 
circle oh so so that's what I'm trying
to<00:03:27.120> do<00:03:27.299> in<00:03:27.540> my<00:03:27.720> work<00:03:28.049> so<00:03:28.079> it's<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.250> Tibetan<00:03:29.940> issue

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
to do in my work so it's a Tibetan issue

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.900 
to do in my work so it's a Tibetan issue
is<00:03:30.480> not<00:03:30.690> a<00:03:30.750> dominant<00:03:30.989> issue<00:03:31.530> it's<00:03:32.280> just<00:03:32.579> a<00:03:32.670> part

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
is not a dominant issue it's just a part

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.890 
is not a dominant issue it's just a part
of<00:03:33.030> an<00:03:33.120> issue<00:03:33.299> then<00:03:34.049> I<00:03:34.200> believe<00:03:34.709> to<00:03:35.670> solve<00:03:36.660> that

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
of an issue then I believe to solve that

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.569 
of an issue then I believe to solve that
problem<00:03:36.959> probably<00:03:38.989> we<00:03:40.100> we<00:03:41.100> have<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> work

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
problem probably we we have to work

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.690 
problem probably we we have to work
together<00:03:42.829> because<00:03:43.829> only<00:03:43.980> us<00:03:44.190> we<00:03:44.370> know<00:03:44.549> of

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
together because only us we know of

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.870 
together because only us we know of
there<00:03:44.910> is

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
there is

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.240 
there is
even<00:03:46.300> some<00:03:46.900> of<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.110> public<00:03:47.410> even<00:03:47.650> worse<00:03:47.890> them

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
even some of the public even worse them

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.010 
even some of the public even worse them
today<00:03:48.610> I<00:03:48.850> mean<00:03:49.000> like<00:03:49.240> what's<00:03:49.600> happening<00:03:49.930> in

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
today I mean like what's happening in

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.840 
today I mean like what's happening in
the<00:03:50.110> Palestine<00:03:50.650> was<00:03:51.400> happening<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.240> Africa<00:03:53.850> so

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
the Palestine was happening in Africa so

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.059 
the Palestine was happening in Africa so
I<00:03:55.270> think<00:03:55.690> she<00:03:55.840> should<00:03:56.110> change<00:03:56.530> there<00:03:56.950> was<00:03:57.040> a

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
I think she should change there was a

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.570 
I think she should change there was a
same<00:03:57.400> way<00:03:57.720> we<00:03:59.040> probably<00:04:00.040> sometimes<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.520> think

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
same way we probably sometimes I think

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.550 
same way we probably sometimes I think
even<00:04:00.910> we<00:04:01.120> have<00:04:01.270> to<00:04:01.390> change<00:04:01.660> the<00:04:01.870> generation

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
even we have to change the generation

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.470 
even we have to change the generation
and<00:04:02.980> we<00:04:03.100> may<00:04:03.250> might<00:04:03.760> come<00:04:04.030> up<00:04:04.209> some

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
and we may might come up some

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.320 
and we may might come up some
interesting<00:04:05.190> idea<00:04:06.190> way<00:04:06.459> of<00:04:06.610> solving<00:04:06.910> that

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
interesting idea way of solving that

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.830 
interesting idea way of solving that
problem<00:04:07.540> so<00:04:08.459> so<00:04:09.459> that's<00:04:09.640> really<00:04:10.060> I<00:04:10.090> think<00:04:10.300> that

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
problem so so that's really I think that

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.030 
problem so so that's really I think that
subject<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:11.590> try<00:04:11.800> to<00:04:11.860> try<00:04:12.580> to<00:04:12.610> try<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.950> put<00:04:14.950> it

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
subject and try to try to try to put it

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.920 
subject and try to try to try to put it
into<00:04:15.340> my<00:04:15.459> world<00:04:15.730> although<00:04:16.480> I<00:04:16.510> mean<00:04:16.750> way<00:04:16.870> you

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
into my world although I mean way you

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:29.630 
into my world although I mean way you
love<00:04:17.139> the<00:04:17.290> title<00:04:17.500> especially<00:04:17.890> for<00:04:18.370> this<00:04:18.959> is

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.840 

the<00:04:30.640> subtitle<00:04:31.419> is<00:04:31.570> called<00:04:32.190> Shanghai<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.580> Lhasa

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
the subtitle is called Shanghai to Lhasa

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.210 
the subtitle is called Shanghai to Lhasa
Express<00:04:34.570> so<00:04:35.290> I<00:04:35.320> mean<00:04:35.560> when<00:04:35.680> you<00:04:35.770> got<00:04:35.890> the<00:04:36.040> title

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
Express so I mean when you got the title

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.270 
Express so I mean when you got the title
actually<00:04:36.820> it<00:04:36.940> seems<00:04:37.540> like<00:04:37.870> the<00:04:38.680> whole<00:04:39.070> thing

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
actually it seems like the whole thing

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.300 
actually it seems like the whole thing
is<00:04:39.490> being<00:04:39.810> talking<00:04:40.810> about<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.140> railway<00:04:41.410> but<00:04:42.160> I

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
is being talking about the railway but I

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.540 
is being talking about the railway but I
I<00:04:42.640> do<00:04:43.240> hope<00:04:43.720> you<00:04:43.930> can<00:04:44.169> spend<00:04:44.470> some<00:04:44.650> time<00:04:44.919> go<00:04:45.520> a

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
I do hope you can spend some time go a

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.600 
I do hope you can spend some time go a
little<00:04:45.790> bit<00:04:45.970> closer<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:46.870> look<00:04:47.290> the<00:04:48.040> contents

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
little bit closer and look the contents

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.880 
little bit closer and look the contents
then<00:04:48.850> I'm<00:04:49.450> sure<00:04:49.720> it's<00:04:49.960> not<00:04:50.229> really<00:04:50.680> about<00:04:50.740> the

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
then I'm sure it's not really about the

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.800 
then I'm sure it's not really about the
railway<00:04:51.370> actually<00:04:51.970> there<00:04:52.180> are<00:04:52.360> lots<00:04:52.570> of

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
railway actually there are lots of

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.219 
railway actually there are lots of
things<00:04:53.140> I<00:04:53.350> think<00:04:53.410> that<00:04:53.620> as<00:04:53.919> I<00:04:54.070> mentioned

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
things I think that as I mentioned

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.320 
things I think that as I mentioned
globalization<00:04:56.760> commercialization<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:57.940> also

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
globalization commercialization and also

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.050 
globalization commercialization and also
different<00:04:58.690> influences<00:04:59.440> and<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.760> there<00:05:00.940> is<00:05:01.030> a

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
different influences and so there is a

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.880 
different influences and so there is a
good<00:05:01.330> saying

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
good saying

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:08.250 
good saying
thing<00:05:02.890> and<00:05:04.560> so<00:05:05.560> that's<00:05:06.460> what<00:05:06.700> I<00:05:06.729> like<00:05:07.200> sort<00:05:08.200> of

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
thing and so that's what I like sort of

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.969 
thing and so that's what I like sort of
being<00:05:08.320> with<00:05:08.979> my<00:05:09.280> work<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:09.930> another<00:05:10.930> thing<00:05:11.289> I<00:05:12.510> I

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
being with my work and another thing I I

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.690 
being with my work and another thing I I
try<00:05:14.979> to<00:05:15.039> make<00:05:15.520> my<00:05:15.760> work<00:05:16.380> is<00:05:17.380> sort<00:05:17.710> of<00:05:17.740> made<00:05:17.979> more

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729 
easy for people to understand I think

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:24.900 
easy for people to understand I think
that<00:05:22.240> was<00:05:22.720> sort<00:05:23.110> of<00:05:23.200> my<00:05:23.320> really<00:05:23.650> grammar<00:05:24.460> ego

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910 
that was sort of my really grammar ego

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.690 
that was sort of my really grammar ego
because<00:05:25.750> I'm<00:05:25.930> trying<00:05:26.110> to<00:05:26.200> go<00:05:26.470> to<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.890> basic<00:05:27.160> of
