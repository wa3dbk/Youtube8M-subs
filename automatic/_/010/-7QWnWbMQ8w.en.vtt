field and we've got an extraordinary
sight<00:00:05.190> and<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:06.629> is<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.839> in<00:00:07.290> Mongolia<00:00:07.890> but

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
sight and this is a in Mongolia but

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.770 
sight and this is a in Mongolia but
there's<00:00:08.250> actually<00:00:08.550> three<00:00:08.849> small<00:00:09.389> Chinese

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
there's actually three small Chinese

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.089 
there's actually three small Chinese

traditional Chinese almost home-built

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.010 
traditional Chinese almost home-built
design<00:00:17.750> and<00:00:18.750> they're<00:00:19.619> mining<00:00:20.070> not<00:00:21.020> raw

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020

material the remaining their tailings of

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.820 
material the remaining their tailings of
left<00:00:26.160> behind<00:00:26.519> by<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:26.849> large<00:00:27.150> dredge<00:00:27.619> which<00:00:28.619> is<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
left behind by a large dredge which is a

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.970 
left behind by a large dredge which is a
classic<00:00:30.109> Siberian<00:00:31.109> Russian<00:00:31.410> dredge<00:00:31.590> right

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
classic Siberian Russian dredge right

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.680 
classic Siberian Russian dredge right
over<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:33.000> yeah

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
over here yeah

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.360 
over here yeah
and<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:37.260> problem<00:00:37.649> for<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.920> dredge<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
and the the problem for this dredge is

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.280 
and the the problem for this dredge is
the<00:00:38.700> big<00:00:38.850> drag<00:00:39.090> is<00:00:39.270> designed<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.050> river

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
the big drag is designed for river

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.920 
the big drag is designed for river
gravels<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.010> it's<00:00:41.100> acting<00:00:41.520> for<00:00:41.700> us<00:00:41.850> but<00:00:42.719> here

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
gravels and it's acting for us but here

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.270 
gravels and it's acting for us but here
it's<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.170> function<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.680> river<00:00:43.829> gravels

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
it's the function with the river gravels

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.900 
it's the function with the river gravels
the<00:00:44.520> gold<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:45.450> top<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.350> red<00:00:47.100> clay<00:00:47.370> with<00:00:47.640> even

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
at the rear end not only rocks but also

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.869 
at the rear end not only rocks but also
enormous<00:00:57.030> balls<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:57.989> Bank<00:00:58.370> now<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.670> see

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
enormous balls at Bank now what you see

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.060 
enormous balls at Bank now what you see
at<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.030> Chinese<00:01:00.449> dredge<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:00.840> being<00:01:01.109> their

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
at the Chinese dredge is being their

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.690 
at the Chinese dredge is being their
remaining<00:01:02.489> not<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.180> fines<00:01:03.510> from<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.989> sluice

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:04.700 
remaining not for fines from the sluice

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.060 
remaining not for fines from the sluice
they're<00:01:05.700> way<00:01:06.330> down<00:01:06.360> under<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.170> water<00:01:07.320> they're

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
they're way down under the water they're

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.030 
they're way down under the water they're
remaining<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:09.020> oversize<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.560> gone<00:01:10.740> out<00:01:10.890> at

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
remaining the oversize it's gone out at

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.940 
remaining the oversize it's gone out at
the<00:01:11.159> end<00:01:11.310> of<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> rear<00:01:12.299> stacker<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the end of the rear stacker of the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.580 
the end of the rear stacker of the
Siberian<00:01:14.670> Russian<00:01:15.119> great<00:01:15.299> what<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:16.350> means

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
Siberian Russian great what this means

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.370 
Siberian Russian great what this means
then<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:18.450> clay<00:01:18.659> balls<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:19.170> course

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
then is that the clay balls of course

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.940 
then is that the clay balls of course
suck<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> time<00:01:20.310> after<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.700> few<00:01:20.880> moments

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
suck and the time after a few moments

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.710 
suck and the time after a few moments
but<00:01:22.950> still<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.970> difficult<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.630> believe

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
but still it's difficult to believe

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.510 
but still it's difficult to believe
these<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> dredges<00:01:25.799> are<00:01:25.950> recovering

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
these are the dredges are recovering
