best-known cocktail the cap Aranea start
out<00:00:04.799> I'm<00:00:05.759> going<00:00:05.910> to<00:00:05.970> take<00:00:06.120> about<00:00:06.359> an<00:00:06.569> ounce<00:00:06.960> of

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
out I'm going to take about an ounce of

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.640 
out I'm going to take about an ounce of
actually<00:00:07.710> rough<00:00:08.010> raw<00:00:08.820> sugar<00:00:09.120> cubes<00:00:09.570> put<00:00:10.500> those

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
actually rough raw sugar cubes put those

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.060 
actually rough raw sugar cubes put those
into<00:00:10.920> my<00:00:11.010> shaker<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.170> crush<00:00:13.170> these<00:00:13.380> up<00:00:13.440> and

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
into my shaker and crush these up and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.369 
into my shaker and crush these up and
this<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.610> one<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.120> big<00:00:15.360> variations<00:00:16.109> in

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
this is one of the big variations in

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.400 
this is one of the big variations in
copper<00:00:16.710> Amyas<00:00:17.039> it's<00:00:17.869> what<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.990> do<00:00:19.170> with<00:00:19.260> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
copper Amyas it's what you do with the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.200 
copper Amyas it's what you do with the
sugar<00:00:19.650> you<00:00:20.010> use<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:21.980> sugar<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.220> solution<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:24.029> in

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
sugar you use a sugar in solution as in

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.660 
sugar you use a sugar in solution as in
simple<00:00:24.600> syrup<00:00:24.779> where<00:00:25.740> do<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:26.010> break<00:00:26.400> these<00:00:26.640> up

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
simple syrup where do you break these up

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.000 
simple syrup where do you break these up
why<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.150> chose<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.810> break<00:00:27.990> these<00:00:28.140> up<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.529> when<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
why I chose to break these up is when I

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.669 
why I chose to break these up is when I
add<00:00:29.279> my<00:00:29.550> lime<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.210> I'm<00:00:30.480> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> add<00:00:30.840> about<00:00:31.140> a

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
add my lime and I'm going to add about a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.250 
add my lime and I'm going to add about a
little<00:00:32.160> more<00:00:32.399> than<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> half<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.969> lime<00:00:33.260> that's

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
little more than a half a lime that's

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.000 
little more than a half a lime that's
been<00:00:34.559> cut<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:34.980> little<00:00:35.399> half<00:00:36.329> wheels<00:00:36.980> when<00:00:37.980> I

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
been cut into little half wheels when I

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.270 
been cut into little half wheels when I
add<00:00:38.280> these<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.420> start<00:00:39.750> muddling<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.980> goal

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
add these and I start muddling the goal

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.319 
add these and I start muddling the goal
is<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:42.030> really<00:00:42.350> press<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.910> break<00:00:45.120> up

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
is to really press this and to break up

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.660 
is to really press this and to break up
the<00:00:45.539> lime<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.289> the<00:00:46.410> oils<00:00:46.829> from<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.160> peel

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the lime so that the oils from the peel

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.470 
the lime so that the oils from the peel
are<00:00:48.000> being<00:00:49.010> excoriated<00:00:50.010> by<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.579> rough<00:00:51.059> sugar

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
are being excoriated by that rough sugar

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.250 
are being excoriated by that rough sugar
and<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.559> juice<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:53.510> going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.660> help<00:00:54.930> bring

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and the juice is going to help bring

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
and the juice is going to help bring
that<00:00:55.289> into<00:00:55.829> solution<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.730> me

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that into solution for me

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.130 
that into solution for me
the<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.930> drawback<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:59.190> mixing<00:00:59.930> with<00:01:00.930> these

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
the one drawback of mixing with these

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.320 
the one drawback of mixing with these
little<00:01:02.000> rough<00:01:03.000> sugars<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.750> that<00:01:04.909> it<00:01:05.909> won't<00:01:06.210> go

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
little rough sugars is that it won't go

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.940 
little rough sugars is that it won't go
completely<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.020> solution<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.770> does<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
completely in the solution as it does a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.370 
completely in the solution as it does a
simple<00:01:08.369> syrup<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:09.150> that<00:01:09.330> being<00:01:09.510> said<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.020> cap

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
simple syrup but that being said the cap

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.219 
simple syrup but that being said the cap
Aranea<00:01:10.770> roughly<00:01:11.220> translates<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
Aranea roughly translates to

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.460 
Aranea roughly translates to
country-bumpkin

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
country-bumpkin

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.990 
country-bumpkin
and<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.860> feel<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.490> bit<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.820> rough

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
and I feel like a little bit of rough

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.270 
and I feel like a little bit of rough
roughness<00:01:15.659> around<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.049> edges<00:01:16.350> makes<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
roughness around the edges makes for a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.160 
roughness around the edges makes for a
delicious<00:01:17.400> kappa<00:01:17.850> rhenium<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.960> i'm<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
delicious kappa rhenium so i'm going to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.480 
delicious kappa rhenium so i'm going to
add<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:19.439> ounces<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.799> Kasasa

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
add two ounces of Kasasa

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.030 
add two ounces of Kasasa
these<00:01:20.970> are<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.270> two<00:01:21.659> most<00:01:22.259> challenging<00:01:22.770> parts

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
these are the two most challenging parts

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.590 
these are the two most challenging parts
of<00:01:23.159> this<00:01:23.280> drink<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.240> see<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.540> very

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
of this drink as you can see it's very

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.819 
of this drink as you can see it's very
easy<00:01:24.810> but<00:01:25.259> Kasasa<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.369> coppery<00:01:26.700> Neah<00:01:27.829> two

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
easy but Kasasa and coppery Neah two

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.300 
easy but Kasasa and coppery Neah two
ounces<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.280> Kasasa

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
ounces of Kasasa

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.260 
ounces of Kasasa
and<00:01:32.720> then<00:01:33.720> i'm<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.790> drink<00:01:35.790> going<00:01:36.090> back

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and then i'm this is a drink going back

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.170 
and then i'm this is a drink going back
to<00:01:36.450> its<00:01:36.630> sort<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.990> rural<00:01:37.710> rustic<00:01:38.340> roughness

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
to its sort of rural rustic roughness

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.450 
to its sort of rural rustic roughness
it's<00:01:39.840> actually<00:01:40.229> not<00:01:40.350> even<00:01:40.500> strained<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.400> I'm

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
it's actually not even strained so I'm

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.910 
it's actually not even strained so I'm
going<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.700> use<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.960> glass<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.290> I'm<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
going to use the glass that I'm going to

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.090 
going to use the glass that I'm going to
pour<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> in<00:01:44.509> to<00:01:45.509> give<00:01:45.750> me<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.320> amount<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:46.799> ice

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
pour it in to give me the amount of ice

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.609 
pour it in to give me the amount of ice
that<00:01:47.490> I'm<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.909> add<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.240> shaker<00:01:48.630> add

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
that I'm going to add to my shaker add

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.910 
that I'm going to add to my shaker add
that<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.220> my<00:01:50.820> glass<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.299> chilled<00:01:51.860> now<00:01:52.860> I'm

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that in my glass is chilled now I'm

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:04.580 
that in my glass is chilled now I'm
going<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.130> give<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> shake

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.110 

shake<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:05.740> a<00:02:05.800> little<00:02:06.100> bit<00:02:06.220> longer<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:06.970> that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
shake that a little bit longer so that

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.780 
shake that a little bit longer so that
some<00:02:07.330> of<00:02:07.360> those<00:02:07.560> rough<00:02:08.560> sugar<00:02:08.950> crystals<00:02:09.490> break

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
some of those rough sugar crystals break

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.160 
some of those rough sugar crystals break
up<00:02:10.000> give<00:02:10.240> it<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.810> little<00:02:10.840> taste<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:12.930> like<00:02:13.930> that<00:02:14.140> a

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
up give it a little taste I like that a

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.980 
up give it a little taste I like that a
lot

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
lot
