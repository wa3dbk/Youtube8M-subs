00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the Sennheiser RS 170 s I did buy these

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.170 
the Sennheiser RS 170 s I did buy these
and<00:00:22.439> they're<00:00:23.310> not<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.490> cheapest<00:00:23.939> set<00:00:24.060> of

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and they're not the cheapest set of

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.970 
and they're not the cheapest set of
headphones<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:24.930> did<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> lot<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.470> research

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
headphones but I did a lot of research

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.570 
headphones but I did a lot of research
in<00:00:26.220> terms<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:27.080> wireless<00:00:28.080> headphones<00:00:28.650> so

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
in terms of wireless headphones so

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.009 
in terms of wireless headphones so
that's<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.910> big<00:00:30.119> advantage<00:00:30.240> with<00:00:30.810> this

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
that's the big advantage with this

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.370 
that's the big advantage with this
specific<00:00:31.460> unit<00:00:32.690> so<00:00:33.690> we<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.870> straight<00:00:34.079> into<00:00:34.260> it

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
specific unit so we get straight into it

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.860 
specific unit so we get straight into it
and<00:00:34.649> unbox<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.910> main<00:00:36.120> reason<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.600> chose

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and unbox it the main reason I chose

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.770 
and unbox it the main reason I chose
this<00:00:37.170> over<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.770> lot<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.070> other<00:00:38.780> wireless

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
this over a lot of the other wireless

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.090 
this over a lot of the other wireless
options<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.860> fact<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:42.739> the<00:00:43.739> battery

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
options was the fact that the battery

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
options was the fact that the battery
life<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:45.690> supposed<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.680> about<00:00:47.579> I
