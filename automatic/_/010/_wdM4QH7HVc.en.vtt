00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
welcome back settling here the other day

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:04.430 
welcome back settling here the other day
on<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.149> live<00:00:03.419> stream<00:00:03.810> I<00:00:03.990> was<00:00:04.110> screwing<00:00:04.319> around

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
on a live stream I was screwing around

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.249 
on a live stream I was screwing around
with<00:00:04.770> TNT<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.970> etho<00:00:06.600> was<00:00:06.750> watching<00:00:07.080> and<00:00:07.170> he

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
with TNT and etho was watching and he

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.080 
with TNT and etho was watching and he
suggested<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.189> cool<00:00:08.460> idea<00:00:08.610> for<00:00:09.290> jetpacks<00:00:10.290> and

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
suggested a cool idea for jetpacks and

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.430 
suggested a cool idea for jetpacks and
so<00:00:12.090> what<00:00:12.360> I've<00:00:12.450> done<00:00:12.630> here<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:12.990> I<00:00:13.110> built<00:00:13.320> a

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
so what I've done here is I built a

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.200 
so what I've done here is I built a
little<00:00:13.620> thing<00:00:14.190> it's<00:00:14.400> just<00:00:14.490> got<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.790> command

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
little thing it's just got to command

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.170 
little thing it's just got to command
blocks<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> little<00:00:15.870> clock<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:17.180> basically

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
blocks and a little clock and basically

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.080 
blocks and a little clock and basically
I<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.570> use<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:19.050> as<00:00:19.350> JPEG<00:00:20.010> so<00:00:20.279> if<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:20.850> go<00:00:21.000> ahead

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
I can use this as JPEG so if I go ahead

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.540 
I can use this as JPEG so if I go ahead
and<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.840> can't<00:00:22.020> see<00:00:22.170> my<00:00:22.289> mouse<00:00:22.529> on<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.340> video

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
and you can't see my mouse on the video

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.160 
and you can't see my mouse on the video
but<00:00:23.880> I'm<00:00:24.000> clicking<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> up<00:00:24.630> button<00:00:25.050> right

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
but I'm clicking on the up button right

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.910 
but I'm clicking on the up button right
now<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.830> just<00:00:25.859> click<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.670> really<00:00:26.789> fast

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:27.920 
now and I just click on it really fast

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.209 
now and I just click on it really fast
I'm<00:00:28.920> gonna<00:00:29.099> fly<00:00:29.400> straight<00:00:29.789> up<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:31.009> every<00:00:32.009> time

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
I'm gonna fly straight up and every time

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.750 
I'm gonna fly straight up and every time
I<00:00:32.250> click<00:00:32.579> click<00:00:33.149> click<00:00:33.630> click<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:34.640> fly<00:00:35.640> up<00:00:35.670> a

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
I click click click click I fly up a

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.900 
I click click click click I fly up a
little<00:00:35.880> bit<00:00:36.000> more<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.630> also<00:00:36.750> fly<00:00:37.079> ignore<00:00:37.350> it

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
little bit more I can also fly ignore it

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.979 
little bit more I can also fly ignore it
fly<00:00:38.910> up<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.239> bit

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
fly up a bit

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.540 
fly up a bit
fly<00:00:40.739> back<00:00:40.950> south<00:00:41.570> and<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.649> stay<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.010> midair

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
fly back south and I can stay in midair

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.860 
fly back south and I can stay in midair
for<00:00:44.820> quite<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> while<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.450> basically<00:00:45.690> as<00:00:45.840> long

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
for quite a while it basically as long

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.130 
for quite a while it basically as long
as<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.170> want<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.350> keep<00:00:46.469> clicking<00:00:46.879> east-west<00:00:48.140> but

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
as I want to keep clicking east-west but

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.420 
as I want to keep clicking east-west but
I<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.410> press<00:00:49.620> up<00:00:49.829> every<00:00:50.070> once<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.309> a<00:00:50.399> while

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
I have to press up every once in a while

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.209 
I have to press up every once in a while
in<00:00:51.270> order<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> keep<00:00:51.719> going<00:00:52.050> up<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:53.039> yeah

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
in order to keep going up but yeah

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.619 
in order to keep going up but yeah
basically<00:00:53.340> I'm<00:00:53.579> not<00:00:53.640> dying<00:00:53.969> because<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.600> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
basically I'm not dying because I have a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.200 
basically I'm not dying because I have a
resistance<00:00:55.199> effect<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.800> that's<00:00:56.640> just<00:00:57.030> part

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
resistance effect and that's just part

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.389 
resistance effect and that's just part
of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.329> clock<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.230> actually<00:00:58.559> two<00:00:59.160> very

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
of the clock so it's actually two very

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.810 
of the clock so it's actually two very
simple<00:00:59.730> command<00:00:59.969> blocks<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:01.399> well<00:01:02.399> here

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
simple command blocks it's well here

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.280 
simple command blocks it's well here
this<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.120> just<00:01:03.239> gives<00:01:03.480> us<00:01:03.600> resistance<00:01:04.140> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
this one just gives us resistance and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.539 
this one just gives us resistance and
that's<00:01:04.350> what<00:01:04.530> keeps<00:01:04.619> me<00:01:04.739> from<00:01:04.979> dying<00:01:05.159> due<00:01:05.489> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
that's what keeps me from dying due to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.460 
that's what keeps me from dying due to
the<00:01:05.670> TNT<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:08.810> tell<00:01:09.810> Rock<00:01:10.049> command

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the TNT this one is a tell Rock command

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.800 
the TNT this one is a tell Rock command
that<00:01:10.770> basically<00:01:11.549> creates<00:01:12.180> a<00:01:12.299> bunch<00:01:12.510> of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that basically creates a bunch of

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.289 
that basically creates a bunch of
colored<00:01:13.350> links<00:01:13.830> in<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> text<00:01:14.850> box<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
colored links in the in the text box and

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.399 
colored links in the in the text box and
each<00:01:15.960> link<00:01:16.759> summons<00:01:17.759> prime<00:01:18.060> TNT<00:01:18.630> relative<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
each link summons prime TNT relative to

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.100 
each link summons prime TNT relative to
you<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.310> whenever<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.119> click<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.540> it's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
you so whenever you click on it it's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.030 
you so whenever you click on it it's
going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.350> some<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.650> TMT

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
going to some of the TMT

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.850 
going to some of the TMT
you<00:01:23.759> have<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.030> an<00:01:24.119> OP<00:01:24.240> in<00:01:24.540> order<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.960> use<00:01:25.350> use

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
you have to be an OP in order to use use

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.190 
you have to be an OP in order to use use
the<00:01:26.100> links<00:01:26.460> because<00:01:27.119> they<00:01:27.479> use<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.930> summon

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the links because they use the summon

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.480 
the links because they use the summon
command<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.770> can't<00:01:28.979> run<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> seven

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
command and you can't run a seven

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.440 
command and you can't run a seven
command<00:01:29.759> unless<00:01:30.450> you're<00:01:30.630> an<00:01:30.720> op<00:01:30.840> but<00:01:31.939> but<00:01:32.939> kind
