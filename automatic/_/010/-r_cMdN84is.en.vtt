take control of the match I don't know
what<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.120> do<00:03:06.330> because<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.800> did<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.670> know<00:03:08.760> I<00:03:08.790> just

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
what to do because I did you know I just

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.520 
what to do because I did you know I just
didn't<00:03:09.300> know<00:03:09.390> the<00:03:09.570> business<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:10.110> well<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:10.500> I

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
didn't know the business that well so I

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.920 
didn't know the business that well so I
couldn't<00:03:10.890> tell<00:03:11.040> stories<00:03:11.519> and<00:03:11.550> the<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.420> in

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
couldn't tell stories and the in the in

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.860 
couldn't tell stories and the in the in
the<00:03:13.080> ring<00:03:13.380> until<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.430> end<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.390> I<00:03:15.420> had<00:03:15.750> to

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
the ring until the end so I had to

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.110 
the ring until the end so I had to
follow<00:03:16.110> every<00:03:16.680> single<00:03:17.130> footstep<00:03:17.519> of<00:03:17.940> my

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
follow every single footstep of my

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.780 
follow every single footstep of my
opponent<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.860> think<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.640> was

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
opponent and so I think that was

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.860 
opponent and so I think that was
probably<00:03:20.970> the<00:03:21.209> most<00:03:21.330> difficult

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
probably the most difficult

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.620 
probably the most difficult
I'd<00:03:21.989> love<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.800> wrestle<00:03:23.370> him<00:03:23.519> right<00:03:23.730> now<00:03:24.150> or

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
I'd love to wrestle him right now or

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.290 
I'd love to wrestle him right now or
kickboxing<00:03:25.500> or<00:03:25.620> whatever<00:03:25.920> he<00:03:26.100> wants<00:03:26.459> mah<00:03:26.670> gahd

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
kickboxing or whatever he wants mah gahd

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.289 
kickboxing or whatever he wants mah gahd
I'd<00:03:27.540> pay<00:03:28.050> money<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:29.310> get<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.580> opportunity

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
I'd pay money to get that opportunity

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.990 
I'd pay money to get that opportunity
but<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:31.500> mean<00:03:31.920> that's<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.459> only<00:03:32.670> time<00:03:32.850> it

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
but I mean that's the only time it

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.150 
but I mean that's the only time it
really<00:03:33.120> ever<00:03:33.330> happened<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:33.870> me<00:03:33.989> one<00:03:34.560> time<00:03:34.590> I

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
really ever happened to me one time I

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.710 
really ever happened to me one time I
think<00:03:35.250> my<00:03:35.519> second<00:03:35.940> or<00:03:36.030> third<00:03:36.060> match<00:03:36.480> I

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
think my second or third match I

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.530 
think my second or third match I
wrestled<00:03:37.110> barbarian<00:03:37.709> and<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:38.760> got<00:03:39.090> up<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.510> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
wrestled barbarian and I I got up to the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.199 
wrestled barbarian and I I got up to the
he<00:03:40.230> put<00:03:40.470> me<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.890> corner<00:03:41.190> on<00:03:41.549> the<00:03:41.670> top<00:03:41.910> rope

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
he put me in the corner on the top rope

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.390 
he put me in the corner on the top rope
and<00:03:42.420> gave<00:03:42.750> me<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.930> belly-to-belly<00:03:43.500> suplex<00:03:43.980> off

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
and gave me a belly-to-belly suplex off

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.350 
and gave me a belly-to-belly suplex off
the<00:03:44.640> top<00:03:44.850> rope

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.330

and<00:03:45.870> I<00:03:46.319> came<00:03:46.530> in<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.770> back<00:03:46.950> and
