00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
her smile is as big as New York City so
that's<00:01:32.700> one<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.329> things<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.750> need<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> work

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
that's one of the things I need to work

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.319 
that's one of the things I need to work
on<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.590> her<00:01:34.740> chin<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.369> little<00:01:35.790> bit<00:01:35.909> too<00:01:36.150> wide

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
on and her chin is a little bit too wide

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.120 
on and her chin is a little bit too wide
so<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:39.210> if<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.600> had<00:01:39.810> some<00:01:40.110> gum<00:01:40.590> paste<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
so and if I had some gum paste and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.600 
so and if I had some gum paste and
fondant<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.850> cooperated<00:01:43.280> things<00:01:44.280> would<00:01:44.490> be

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
fondant that cooperated things would be

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.980

a<00:01:44.640> little<00:01:44.790> bit<00:01:45.060> different<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.509> think<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.780> think

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
a little bit different I think I think

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.090 
a little bit different I think I think
the<00:01:46.079> end<00:01:46.259> result<00:01:46.409> would<00:01:46.710> be<00:01:46.770> much<00:01:47.070> better

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
the end result would be much better

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.580 
the end result would be much better
