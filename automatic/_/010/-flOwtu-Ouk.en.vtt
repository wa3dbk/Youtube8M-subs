00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
I have no talent but I thought I'd just

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.020 
I have no talent but I thought I'd just
tell<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.200> no<00:01:28.439> talent<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.549> really

tell you I have no talent it's really

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.440

sad like honestly I have no talent and

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.899 
sad like honestly I have no talent and
probably<00:01:33.869> because<00:01:34.110> things<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.310> take<00:01:35.490> talent

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
probably because things that take talent

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.390 
probably because things that take talent
also<00:01:36.210> take<00:01:36.420> practice<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.549> I'm<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.970> a
