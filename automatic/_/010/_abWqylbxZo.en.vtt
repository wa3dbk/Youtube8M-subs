00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 it's right in front of our other TV screen installing the package 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.370
 first row 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.169
 hard drives 

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:12.799
 on the ps3 click click click 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.900
 quevilly cfa broke his european record 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.900
 and now we just have it 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:22.669
 do not install that kill 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:25.669
 aybran 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 it happens without problem very quickly 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.310
 in his previous 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.900
 it's almost ready 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.830
 you still have to copy god files 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.270
 for that 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.670
 we mutualise 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.270
 like Thursday but finally within the manager that you're close to either 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.270
 formally 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.220
 so the screen splits in two 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.460
 a part would be so I left on the right 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.690
 on the one hand 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.690
 we will go with the help of the arrows 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.120
 internally discuss descroix that is, go from 2 to 0 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.290
 and M 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.780
 and finally at the bottom we will find 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.780
 that of 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.830
 on the personal page so we had to remember a number 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.490
 and it's that this one does not 137 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.930
 right we will go 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.140
 the text says omnibus that place 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.910
 also in the same folder 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.910
 ps3 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.330
 there now is that 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.280
 just to understand is that you have to transfer all the files from the disk 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.850
 hard 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.830
 several shots 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.830
 a word from the ps3 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.370
 games is more or less easy here I propose to return 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.020
 about to yield to edf from previous records 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.860
 again we will copy it from the modified poet 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.189
 thanks to a free kick 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.119
 then start on the disk 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.399
 external tÃ¼rk 

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:21.819
 we go back to their file 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.219
 we're coming from rodez m 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.959
 copy the integral 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.729
 they went out to give the good 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.729
 of the punch doubt because this one contains the world 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.489
 I come out 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.489
 simply courtrai 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.229
 so I'm going to copy 

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:43.299
 all of this 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.519
 start 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.689
 so from that moment that reports some time 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.689
 it depends on the young man's head this game is almost giguere 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.439
 and one to one percent in my opinion if the number of files 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:57.739
 few minutes so 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.739
 I could have gone out the day offering as soon as it's over 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:05.509
 the transfer the coming to end in the tunnel began to change 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.559
 so we end up with the legendary in the discs the cold surfer 

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:13.699
 like that of the external 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.049
 in the farm we will return 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.179
 in the background we put modified pitot tubes 

00:03:19.179 --> 00:03:20.889
 amended 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.629
 in the future the past 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.999
 in the coming people 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.559
 ferron 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.999
 and now we're left with the pan 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:31.169
 points 2 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.159
 from there it is simply enough to 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.819
 leave a major fault 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.819
 valid 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.479
 and we will be able if everything went well 

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:54.119
 normally the little girl 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:55.409
 think so 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:56.909
 so foundation 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:59.909
 the little girl who is associated with him 

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:03.529
 what do we do 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.139
 p the game launches properly 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.569
 we will still wait for minutes for the uncertain time 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.620
 usually when it does not work click here Sunday 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.759
 it remained a black screen that forced them 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.759
 the state of ps3 she has like montpellier 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.449
 it works well and truly 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.639
 so thank you all for having them follow the bike as I indicated I'll 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.039
 change right away 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.039
 she's the topic 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:51.150
 the command line 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.340
 so a rocket for the quality of videos 6% 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.719
 cp lys-lm times on the screen 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:00.590
 nor the hour on the court the computer I did the older one more 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.620
 hoping that the understand 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.160
 if you have any questions do not hesitate to ask us what we ask 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.419
 the report 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.039
 the busy is not the time
