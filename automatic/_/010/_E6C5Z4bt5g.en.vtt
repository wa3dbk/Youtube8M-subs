00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.810 
Cara did some demo deadlifts and see him
doing<00:02:25.750> here<00:02:26.190> would<00:02:27.190> like<00:02:27.340> him<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.580> use<00:02:27.790> a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
doing here would like him to use a

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.360 
doing here would like him to use a
little<00:02:28.120> bit<00:02:28.240> less<00:02:28.420> weight<00:02:28.660> on<00:02:28.870> these<00:02:29.250> but<00:02:30.250> they

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
little bit less weight on these but they

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.760 
little bit less weight on these but they
haven't<00:02:30.820> really<00:02:31.090> done<00:02:31.360> them<00:02:31.570> much<00:02:32.110> before<00:02:32.530> so

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
haven't really done them much before so

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.740 
haven't really done them much before so
I<00:02:32.800> didn't<00:02:33.040> want<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.280> know<00:02:33.370> where<00:02:33.550> to<00:02:33.610> go<00:02:33.760> in

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
I didn't want to know where to go in

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.180 
I didn't want to know where to go in
terms<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.200> weight<00:02:35.380> not<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:35.890> it's<00:02:36.040> too

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
terms of the weight not that it's too

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.530 
terms of the weight not that it's too
heavy<00:02:36.400> for<00:02:36.670> him<00:02:36.760> but<00:02:36.910> I<00:02:36.970> think<00:02:37.030> they<00:02:37.360> could

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
heavy for him but I think they could

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.130 
heavy for him but I think they could
shoot<00:02:37.990> faster<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:39.150> with<00:02:40.150> more<00:02:40.209> veterus<00:02:40.810> for

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
shoot faster and with more veterus for

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.130 
shoot faster and with more veterus for
him<00:02:41.230> and<00:02:41.410> hear<00:02:42.070> she's<00:02:42.280> doing<00:02:42.310> a<00:02:42.670> sumo<00:02:43.180> stiff

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
him and hear she's doing a sumo stiff

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.740 
him and hear she's doing a sumo stiff
