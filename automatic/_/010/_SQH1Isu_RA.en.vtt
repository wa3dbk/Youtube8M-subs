 I do not know if he entered 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.009

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.649
 that's going to know the wine with lime and a lot 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.649
 if so, let's leave a little bit below 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.550
 they are equal to 15 20 7 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.099
 and it 's fair 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:34.450
 half of the bottles for half 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.540
 half do not have it all do not have 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.540
 fear 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.870
 many generous 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:02.870
 I'm recording these days it reminds me of 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:05.319
 the vermouths and mirage and crucified 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.319
 serious 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.709
 It is very special to me 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:22.980
 Ron Herron then let's put it 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.430
 although it is a gift from here that is done 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:30.060
 here in the north rum old admiral 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.340
 for all rum has to its providence 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:40.709
 of the wicked 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:42.540
 the picaresque this is all we can 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.170
 buy in areas where there were drinks 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.170
 for sangria 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.750
 at the last minute 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.020
 now tsukiko hilito de azÃºcar is missing 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:10.980
 is what is left over 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.290
 well, it's something real 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.670
 and then some fruits from those forest 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.710
 desaforarlos with a couple in the afternoon is 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.910
 and we are going to buy fresh fruit but not 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.910
 live what they burn the most 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.080
 'we are and liquid without liquid 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:47.840
 meanwhile let's see how it goes 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:47.840
 making name lift the lid 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:56.020
 in this line there are 94 floating soul 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.409
 because that's the way if we do not know 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.499
 that this has been possible 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:04.269
 and then later we will throw the truth is 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:06.300
 true the versatile you have to go to what 

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:06.300
 our 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:13.300
 let's see where he did it 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.300
 adriano is not that we won not also 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.050
 but this is going to be an average video 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.050
 hour 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.449
 directly 

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:27.449
 so it's pulmonary 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:37.060
 and the last drop 

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:39.060
 It is done 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.490
 good 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:46.360
 this was recorded at the time the 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:58.350
 that we are 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:58.350
 this way it looks very bad 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:08.599
 this is all this 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:11.440
 let's go forward let's hope you 

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.440
 you pass equally well
