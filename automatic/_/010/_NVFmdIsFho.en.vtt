your line is going to be in where you
guys<00:00:10.590> going<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:10.980> be<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.190> term<00:00:11.490> because<00:00:11.870> if

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
guys going to be in that term because if

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.390 
guys going to be in that term because if
you're<00:00:13.259> going<00:00:13.440> off<00:00:13.530> over<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.889> little<00:00:14.070> terrain

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
you're going off over a little terrain

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.189 
you're going off over a little terrain
change<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.030> have<00:00:15.210> five<00:00:15.870> degree

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
change and you have five degree

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.630 
change and you have five degree
different<00:00:16.500> angle<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.890> know<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.279> your<00:00:17.430> line

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
different angle you know in your line

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.070 
different angle you know in your line
it's<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.449> going<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.690> be<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.810> difference

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
it's a it's going to be the difference

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.779 
it's a it's going to be the difference
in<00:00:19.170> between<00:00:19.410> you<00:00:19.529> having<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.949> fast<00:00:20.189> line<00:00:20.460> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
in between you having a fast line and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.939 
in between you having a fast line and
going<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.330> course<00:00:21.539> when<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.529> think<00:00:22.800> about

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
going out the course when I think about

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.640 
going out the course when I think about
doing<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.250> turn<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.609> course<00:00:23.910> um<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:25.170> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
doing a turn in the course um it's the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.349 
doing a turn in the course um it's the
next<00:00:25.949> turn<00:00:26.130> start<00:00:26.460> some<00:00:26.609> butternut<00:00:26.880> above<00:00:27.180> as

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
next turn start some butternut above as

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.950 
next turn start some butternut above as
I<00:00:27.689> go<00:00:27.810> by<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.990> gate<00:00:28.320> arm<00:00:29.300> kind<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.359> pushing<00:00:30.869> my

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
I go by a gate arm kind of pushing my

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.440 
I go by a gate arm kind of pushing my
outside<00:00:31.349> hand<00:00:31.380> through<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> turn<00:00:32.329> so<00:00:33.329> that

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
outside hand through the turn so that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.260 
outside hand through the turn so that
gets<00:00:33.719> my<00:00:34.320> my<00:00:34.710> body<00:00:34.890> moving<00:00:35.130> forward<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.090> gets

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
gets my my body moving forward it gets

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.229 
gets my my body moving forward it gets
my<00:00:36.420> hips<00:00:36.630> up<00:00:36.840> on<00:00:37.050> it<00:00:37.620> also<00:00:37.890> points<00:00:38.010> my<00:00:38.250> hips<00:00:38.460> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
my hips up on it also points my hips to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.000 
my hips up on it also points my hips to
the<00:00:39.270> outside<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.930> next<00:00:40.140> turn<00:00:40.320> because<00:00:40.710> you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the outside of the next turn because you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.049 
the outside of the next turn because you
want<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:41.190> hips<00:00:41.460> point<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.879> direction

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
want your hips point in the direction

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.020 
want your hips point in the direction
you<00:00:42.420> want<00:00:42.450> your<00:00:42.690> skis<00:00:42.930> going<00:00:43.260> arm<00:00:43.789> and<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:44.879> as

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
you want your skis going arm and then as

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.650 
you want your skis going arm and then as
I<00:00:45.149> do<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.750> push<00:00:46.440> off<00:00:46.649> my<00:00:46.890> outside<00:00:47.250> foot

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
I do that as I push off my outside foot

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.930 
I do that as I push off my outside foot
onto<00:00:48.660> my<00:00:49.079> new<00:00:49.230> foot<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.770> before<00:00:50.520> i'm<00:00:50.610> even<00:00:50.700> on

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
onto my new foot so before i'm even on

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.729 
onto my new foot so before i'm even on
the<00:00:51.120> new<00:00:51.239> edge<00:00:51.420> i'm<00:00:51.719> already<00:00:51.930> waiting<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.559> in

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the new edge i'm already waiting that in

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.680 
the new edge i'm already waiting that in
that<00:00:52.890> new<00:00:53.070> foot<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:53.940> when<00:00:54.059> i<00:00:54.120> roll<00:00:54.329> over

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
that new foot and so when i roll over

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.139 
that new foot and so when i roll over
onto<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.440> new<00:00:55.649> edge<00:00:55.860> it's<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.610> skis<00:00:56.879> already

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
onto the new edge it's the skis already

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.360 
onto the new edge it's the skis already
bent<00:00:57.329> up<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.750> then<00:00:57.870> from<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.500> feel<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
bent up and then from then I feel the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.010 
bent up and then from then I feel the
edge<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.760> I<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.000> push<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.570> hard<00:01:00.600> as<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.960> can

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
edge and I just push as hard as I can

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.470 
edge and I just push as hard as I can
into<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.370> I'm<00:01:02.520> I'm<00:01:02.730> bending<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.270> ski

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
into it so that I'm I'm bending the ski

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.830 
into it so that I'm I'm bending the ski
up<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.809> really<00:01:04.019> getting<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.920> lot<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.070> arm<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:06.270> lot

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
up and really getting a lot of arm a lot

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.000 
up and really getting a lot of arm a lot
of<00:01:06.930> torque<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> ski<00:01:07.530> so<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.799> kind<00:01:07.979> of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
of torque on the ski so that kind of

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.500 
of torque on the ski so that kind of
slingshots<00:01:08.549> meet<00:01:08.790> through<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> main<00:01:09.210> part<00:01:09.450> of

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
slingshots meet through the main part of

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.810 
slingshots meet through the main part of
the<00:01:09.600> turn<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.020> then<00:01:10.470> from<00:01:10.770> from<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.520> top<00:01:11.700> of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the turn and then from from that top of

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
the turn and then from from that top of
the<00:01:11.880> turn<00:01:12.030> I'm<00:01:12.119> just<00:01:12.330> pushing<00:01:12.780> my<00:01:13.049> pushing

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the turn I'm just pushing my pushing

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
the turn I'm just pushing my pushing
myself<00:01:13.890> into<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.400> middle<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.670> turn<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.090> my<00:01:15.240> hip

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
myself into the middle of turn so my hip

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.030 
myself into the middle of turn so my hip
gets<00:01:15.509> really<00:01:15.780> closely<00:01:15.990> ground<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.920> I'm

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
gets really closely ground and I'm

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.890 
gets really closely ground and I'm
really<00:01:17.189> laid<00:01:17.430> over<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.909> then<00:01:18.060> as<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.570> go<00:01:18.689> by<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
really laid over and then as I go by the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.719 
really laid over and then as I go by the
gate<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.740> process<00:01:20.159> for<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.340> next<00:01:20.580> turn

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
gate the process for the next turn

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.039 
gate the process for the next turn
starts<00:01:21.060> again<00:01:21.270> I'm<00:01:21.390> when<00:01:21.630> I'm<00:01:21.750> having<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
starts again I'm when I'm having a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.469 
starts again I'm when I'm having a
really<00:01:22.200> good<00:01:22.350> race<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.920> know<00:01:23.040> because<00:01:23.700> when

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
really good race I I know because when

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.609 
really good race I I know because when
I'm<00:01:24.570> skiing<00:01:24.840> down<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.020> course<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.470> don't

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
I'm skiing down the course I don't

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.020 
I'm skiing down the course I don't
really<00:01:25.799> feel<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.340> time<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> prepare

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
really feel like I have time to prepare

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.609 
really feel like I have time to prepare
for<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.390> next<00:01:27.509> turn<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.259> know<00:01:28.350> it's<00:01:28.500> just

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
for the next turn you know it's just

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.310 
for the next turn you know it's just
constant<00:01:29.479> going<00:01:30.479> from<00:01:30.689> one<00:01:30.840> turn<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.290> next

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
constant going from one turn to the next

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.289 
constant going from one turn to the next
turn<00:01:31.680> there's<00:01:31.920> no<00:01:32.070> time<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.369> prepare<00:01:32.939> or

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299
