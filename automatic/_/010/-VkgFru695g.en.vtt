00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello everyone i 'm elias 360 and i 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 I bring this no video and this time gameplay 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.940
 commented of call of duty coast in this 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.769
 I bring you one of the four 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.360
 maps that is included in the new dlc 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.920
 of bass station that will be released tomorrow 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.240
 for sale and well all this example and 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.490
 as I said in the previous video what 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.350
 I recorded in the angels in the call of duty 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.869
 championship the world call tournament 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.340
 of duty ghosts this time not every 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.289
 then it is done with the delivery that is 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.240
 in force so nothing had promised you 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.740
 an extinction gameplay ' but 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.390
 finally it has given me many problems 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.520
 because then because it is a job more 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.530
 long that these an employee about ten 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.630
 minutes approximately and in addition to it 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.030
 it's 2.0 so it weighed pretty 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.649
 more and at the time of uploading well they were 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.030
 too many hours so you will have it 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.129
 morning in the morning quite 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.649
 early so those who want to see what 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.260
 So you have that same thing about 11 o'clock 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.789
 maybe approximately however 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.219
 I upload this video to compensate or 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.059
 climb another map better so good 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.739
 calm because you are going to have 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.390
 also three videos that I had 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.210
 promised only that the extinction has 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.890
 failed a little this map is 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.539
 set where modern call of duty 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.010
 warfare 3 as you will have given a 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.200
 little account not because they when 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.570
 you start playing from the first second 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.369
 realize that it is based on 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.320
 that map and the truth is that it's 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.539
 pretty cool the layout comes 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.280
 being quite pretty similar just 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.100
 Well, there are distances a bit 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.710
 older or younger depends on the case / 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.810
 so areas that in call of duty modern 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.909
 warfare 3 because they were at distances 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.450
 different is not to say the dome maybe 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.560
 be a little closer to the area of 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.049
 offices that is the call at least 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.159
 as call out in competitive each 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.479
 I can also call it as I want but 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.310
 good to change the distances a little 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.259
 but the provision has been 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.060
 pretty similar so we could say 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.789
 that this is done 2.0 as it would have 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.259
 called probably in the title 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.689
 you are also seeing that I have put 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.250
 there is a hidden weapon and if there is no 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.259
 we know if it's only available in the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.119
 free for all is to say all against all 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.189
 I think it's also available in 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.079
 the rest of game modes only that is 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.090
 a little more complicated when we were 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.640
 looking for that weapon because more or less we 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.170
 we left we did not kill ourselves not there you are 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.229
 seeing that also in some other 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.209
 highlight I use this weapon of the 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.649
 repair as assault rifle but the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.930
 truth is that I already tell you that to me 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.069
 personally I prefer to take it as your 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.249
 rifle because 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.409
 this ope is worth directly and I 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:21.989
 I advise you to use it as your rifle 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.730
 What else do you say about this map? 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.930
 good is a small map as it was already 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.579
 in call of duty modern warfare 3 of 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.650
 done tom is famous among other things 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.719
 for being the smallest map that came from 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.760
 series and the truth is that the maps 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.530
 small for me in my opinion they are 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.989
 better when playing so good not 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.579
 you have to be looking for enemies 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.290
 they can field so to speak but the 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.790
 you can find a little before this is 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.049
 the elevated area that we also had 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.969
 in call of duty modern warfare 3 en 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.620
 pretty recommendable if more or less 

00:02:44.969 --> 00:02:48.780
 you know hold the guy so to speak 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.790
 because good the fact of being in 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.219
 one in a superior forgiveness position 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.750
 It always gives you an advantage over 

00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:56.310
 the enemies now you are going to see that in 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.040
 When I finish this clip, you will see a 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.840
 click which is neither endorsements from another 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.760
 youtuber but for you to see how it 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.199
 You can alternate between your rifle and 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.719
 assault the truth is that this is a good 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:08.790
 player is worth from these that is removed 70 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.079
 zeros and things like that and well then 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.090
 there you are seeing that now yes 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.469
 we are taking the weapon and the only thing 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.359
 you have to do is shoot the crane 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.769
 ok we were trying to break the 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.359
 cables and others but not the only thing 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.300
 you have to do is start shooting 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.190
 to the arm of the crane and finally it falls 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.200
 the container which can choose this 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.940
 weapon you can download or you can also 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.400
 go up again , which is good 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.960
 highly recommended because from below 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.400
 it is more difficult to get you are you 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.900
 seeing that it is a weapon of the mode of 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.900
 extinction 'okay I think it was in the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.910
 night fall map of the previous dlc and 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.560
 Well, it 's a checada, it's a mushroom 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.420
 weapon is pretty complicated to get 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.830
 but good if you get it there you have it 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.600
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.670
 this video you already know like and favorites 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.440
 In a little while you will have another video and 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.960
 with nothing more to say, Elijah says goodbye 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.960
 360 until next time 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.010
 for me
