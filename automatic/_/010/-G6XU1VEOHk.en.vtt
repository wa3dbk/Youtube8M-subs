so<00:00:41.010> yeah<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.579> series<00:00:42.000> that<00:00:42.270> had<00:00:42.450> been

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
so yeah for a series that had been

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.049 
so yeah for a series that had been
evolving<00:00:43.170> into<00:00:43.530> something<00:00:43.559> completely<00:00:44.190> fresh

and new for each game bit.trip flux
might<00:00:48.149> seem<00:00:48.600> disappointing<00:00:49.440> at<00:00:49.590> first<00:00:49.890> but

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
might seem disappointing at first but

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:03.229 
might seem disappointing at first but
the<00:00:50.879> key<00:00:51.090> word<00:00:51.300> there<00:00:51.329> is<00:00:51.780> scene<00:01:02.239> remember

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
the key word there is scene remember

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.719 
the key word there is scene remember
that<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.870> ingenious<00:01:04.290> brains<00:01:04.890> behind<00:01:05.220> gaijin

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
that the ingenious brains behind gaijin

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.700 
that the ingenious brains behind gaijin
games<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.570> broken<00:01:06.810> all<00:01:07.080> kinds<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.560> new

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
games have broken all kinds of new

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.830 
games have broken all kinds of new
ground<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.280> past<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.850> even<00:01:09.420> though<00:01:09.689> the

main<00:01:10.020> gameplay<00:01:10.320> mechanic<00:01:11.040> from<00:01:11.250> beat<00:01:11.520> has

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
main gameplay mechanic from beat has

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.359 
main gameplay mechanic from beat has
been<00:01:11.760> reused<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.689> overall<00:01:13.470> experience<00:01:13.920> has

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
been reused the overall experience has

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.490 
been reused the overall experience has
been<00:01:14.580> highly<00:01:15.030> refined<00:01:15.420> for<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> satisfying

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
been highly refined for a satisfying

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:30.899 
been highly refined for a satisfying
conclusion<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.759> epic<00:01:18.150> saga<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.780> bit.trip

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.490 

so<00:01:31.909> the<00:01:32.030> controls<00:01:32.450> are<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.750> same<00:01:32.990> as<00:01:33.259> bit.trip

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
so the controls are the same as bit.trip

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.620 
so the controls are the same as bit.trip
beat<00:01:33.740> where<00:01:34.430> basically<00:01:34.909> you<00:01:35.060> tilt<00:01:35.539> your

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
paddle up and down the screen returning

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.800
