next<00:00:47.129> we're<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> take<00:00:47.550> our<00:00:47.700> white<00:00:47.940> wire

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
next we're going to take our white wire

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.569 
next we're going to take our white wire
with<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.480> ring<00:00:48.570> terminal<00:00:49.340> we're<00:00:50.340> going<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
with the ring terminal we're going to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.270 
with the ring terminal we're going to
ground<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:51.289> back<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.770> sheet<00:00:52.980> metal

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
ground it back here to the sheet metal

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.799 
ground it back here to the sheet metal
we're<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.850> go<00:00:53.940> back<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.420> area

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
we're going to go back in this area

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.060 
we're going to go back in this area
because<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.440> where<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> sheet<00:00:55.890> metal

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
because this is where the sheet metal

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.130 
because this is where the sheet metal
overlaps<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.480> it'll<00:00:57.629> be<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.750> little<00:00:58.020> bit

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
overlaps so it'll be a little bit

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
overlaps so it'll be a little bit
thicker<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> give<00:00:59.160> us<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.340> better<00:00:59.460> grounding

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
thicker and give us a better grounding

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.680 
thicker and give us a better grounding
point<00:01:01.010> with<00:01:02.010> our<00:01:02.100> ground<00:01:02.430> wire<00:01:02.520> installed<00:01:03.090> we

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
point with our ground wire installed we

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.929 
point with our ground wire installed we
go<00:01:03.840> ahead<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.049> add<00:01:04.260> our<00:01:04.290> two-way<00:01:04.799> adhesive<00:01:05.430> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939
