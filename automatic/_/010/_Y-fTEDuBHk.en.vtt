tough<00:01:25.670> xtreme<00:01:26.670> which<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.030> which<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.270> talked

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
tough xtreme which we which we talked

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.450 
tough xtreme which we which we talked
about<00:01:27.810> previously<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.470> know<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.770> splits

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
about previously you know this is splits

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.370 
about previously you know this is splits
up<00:01:29.640> into<00:01:29.729> two<00:01:30.090> because<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.570> saw<00:01:30.780> this<00:01:31.229> is

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
up into two because it saw this is

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.620 
up into two because it saw this is
mainly<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.740> protection<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.509> anything<00:01:33.509> else

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
mainly for protection and anything else

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.050 
mainly for protection and anything else
this<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.079> mainly<00:01:34.290> everything<00:01:35.070> for<00:01:35.220> protection

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
this is mainly everything for protection

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.640 
this is mainly everything for protection
so<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.420> top<00:01:36.600> part<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:37.140> made<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.560> this

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
so the top part is made up of this

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.440 
so the top part is made up of this
acrylic<00:01:37.950> window<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.610> plastic<00:01:39.090> window<00:01:39.360> which

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
acrylic window or plastic window which

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.999 
acrylic window or plastic window which
you<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.869> goes<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.320> top<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:40.710> device

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
you know goes on the top of your device

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.190 
you know goes on the top of your device
and<00:01:41.220> connects<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> other<00:01:42.600> part<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:42.990> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
and connects to the other part that is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.289 
and connects to the other part that is
the<00:01:43.350> bottom<00:01:43.829> part<00:01:44.159> which<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.240> right

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the bottom part which is this one right

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.120 
the bottom part which is this one right
now<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:46.229> made<00:01:46.409> up<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.619> hard<00:01:47.430> TPU<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:49.130> it's

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
now this made up of hard TPU and it's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.870 
now this made up of hard TPU and it's
very<00:01:50.430> well<00:01:50.640> protected<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.299> very<00:01:51.479> well<00:01:52.880> you

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
very well protected and very well you

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.450 
very well protected and very well you
know<00:01:53.970> about<00:01:54.329> covered<00:01:55.259> with<00:01:55.409> rubber<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.009> it's

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
know about covered with rubber so it's

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.609 
know about covered with rubber so it's
going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> take<00:01:56.909> those<00:01:57.119> impacts<00:01:57.619> relatively

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
going to take those impacts relatively

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.920 
going to take those impacts relatively
nicely<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.250> your<00:02:00.000> mini<00:02:00.210> is<00:02:00.329> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> be<00:02:00.689> safe

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
nicely and your mini is going to be safe

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.249 
nicely and your mini is going to be safe
and<00:02:01.259> sound<00:02:02.450> but<00:02:03.450> he<00:02:03.540> goes<00:02:03.719> which<00:02:03.869> are<00:02:03.990> any<00:02:04.110> use

are<00:02:04.439> quite<00:02:04.619> impressive<00:02:04.860> i<00:02:05.399> have<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.820> say<00:02:05.850> this

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
are quite impressive i have to say this

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.520 
are quite impressive i have to say this
goes<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:06.630> around<00:02:06.719> forty<00:02:07.079> dollars<00:02:07.409> or

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
goes for around forty dollars or

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.169 
goes for around forty dollars or
something<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.310> price<00:02:08.459> i<00:02:08.670> really<00:02:09.030> do

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
something so for the price i really do

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.530 
something so for the price i really do
think<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> great<00:02:10.890> device<00:02:11.520> in<00:02:11.849> terms<00:02:12.090> of

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
think that is a great device in terms of

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.660 
think that is a great device in terms of
action<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.110> stuff<00:02:13.349> like<00:02:13.500> that<00:02:13.560> so<00:02:14.489> we<00:02:14.579> can

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
action and stuff like that so we can

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.520 
action and stuff like that so we can
take<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.879> look<00:02:15.090> at<00:02:15.209> all<00:02:15.360> of<00:02:15.390> these<00:02:15.689> cases<00:02:15.989> are

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
take a look at all of these cases are

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.440 
take a look at all of these cases are
together<00:02:16.799> we're<00:02:17.280> going<00:02:17.310> to<00:02:17.459> compare<00:02:17.819> these

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
together we're going to compare these

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.399 
together we're going to compare these
three<00:02:18.750> against<00:02:19.260> each<00:02:19.409> other<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.700> showdown

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:21.409 
three against each other in a showdown

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:24.289 
three against each other in a showdown
all<00:02:22.409> right<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:22.890> i<00:02:22.920> have<00:02:23.189> divided<00:02:23.579> this<00:02:23.700> show

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
all right so i have divided this show

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.000 
all right so i have divided this show
down<00:02:24.359> into<00:02:24.810> three<00:02:25.109> parts<00:02:25.349> for<00:02:25.650> foreigners

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
down into three parts for foreigners

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.890 
down into three parts for foreigners
design<00:02:26.459> second<00:02:26.879> is<00:02:26.969> installation<00:02:27.540> thirties

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
design second is installation thirties

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.259 
design second is installation thirties
protection<00:02:28.439> so<00:02:28.709> in<00:02:28.859> terms<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.269> installation

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
protection so in terms of installation

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.899 
protection so in terms of installation
as<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:31.200> can<00:02:31.319> see<00:02:31.439> the<00:02:31.560> ipad<00:02:31.680> mini<00:02:31.920> wins

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
as you can see the ipad mini wins

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.880 
as you can see the ipad mini wins
obviously<00:02:33.480> it's<00:02:33.659> just<00:02:34.140> snap<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.349> on<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.829> you

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
obviously it's just snap it on and you

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.920 
obviously it's just snap it on and you
are<00:02:35.159> good<00:02:35.340> to<00:02:35.370> go<00:02:35.489> the<00:02:36.239> Intel<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.599> case<00:02:36.780> is

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
are good to go the Intel you case is

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.899 
are good to go the Intel you case is
again<00:02:37.140> relatively<00:02:37.500> easy<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.950> put<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.579> but

00:02:38.899 --> 00:02:38.909 
again relatively easy to put it in but

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:41.030 
again relatively easy to put it in but
there<00:02:39.540> are<00:02:39.629> some<00:02:39.780> there<00:02:40.260> are<00:02:40.349> some<00:02:40.409> cons<00:02:40.799> which

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
there are some there are some cons which

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.410 
there are some there are some cons which
I'll<00:02:41.189> be<00:02:41.310> talking<00:02:41.430> about<00:02:41.700> further<00:02:42.120> in<00:02:42.329> the

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
I'll be talking about further in the

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.509 
I'll be talking about further in the
video<00:02:42.719> which<00:02:43.439> is<00:02:43.650> connected<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.489> the

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
video which is connected to the

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.449 
video which is connected to the
installation<00:02:45.329> which<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.599> kind<00:02:45.780> of<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.959> bummer

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
installation which is kind of a bummer

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.729 
installation which is kind of a bummer
but<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.760> know<00:02:47.879> that's<00:02:48.150> what<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:48.840> that

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
but you know that's what it is and that

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.750 
but you know that's what it is and that
is<00:02:49.859> what<00:02:49.950> i'm<00:02:50.010> going<00:02:50.129> to<00:02:50.189> show<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.609> that

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
is what i'm going to show you and that

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.819 
is what i'm going to show you and that
is<00:02:50.879> why<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.060> comparison<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.689> done<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.650> third

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
is why this comparison is done the third

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.759 
is why this comparison is done the third
is<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:52.980> case<00:02:53.310> made<00:02:53.549> extra<00:02:53.970> tough<00:02:54.269> xtreme<00:02:54.769> this

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
is the case made extra tough xtreme this

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.949 
is the case made extra tough xtreme this
is<00:02:55.889> relatively<00:02:56.310> easy<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.639> snap<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.810> and

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
is relatively easy to snap it in and

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.379 
is relatively easy to snap it in and
this<00:02:58.439> goes<00:02:58.650> into<00:02:58.829> the<00:02:58.980> bottom<00:02:59.099> part<00:02:59.430> which<00:03:00.359> is

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
this goes into the bottom part which is

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.929 
this goes into the bottom part which is
looking<00:03:00.510> relatively<00:03:01.019> nice<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.939> relatively

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
looking relatively nice to relatively

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.670 
looking relatively nice to relatively
easy<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.329> put<00:03:03.750> it<00:03:03.870> in<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.169> you'll<00:03:04.319> be<00:03:04.500> good<00:03:04.620> to

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
easy to put it in and you'll be good to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.159 
easy to put it in and you'll be good to
go<00:03:04.829> so<00:03:05.639> in<00:03:05.790> terms<00:03:05.939> of<00:03:06.180> installation<00:03:06.900> and

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
go so in terms of installation and

that's what i like about it now let's
take<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.620> look<00:03:16.680> at<00:03:16.889> the<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.790> ports<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.180> stuff

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
take a look at the the ports and stuff

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:20.899 
take a look at the the ports and stuff
on<00:03:18.599> the<00:03:18.750> cases<00:03:19.169> themselves<00:03:19.579> first<00:03:20.579> is<00:03:20.790> the

or anything like that it's just to cover
in<00:03:43.829> in<00:03:44.159> case<00:03:44.430> some<00:03:45.060> water<00:03:45.269> goes<00:03:45.510> inside<00:03:45.840> now

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
in in case some water goes inside now

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:47.990 
in in case some water goes inside now
this<00:03:46.680> is<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.859> first<00:03:47.069> convert<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.579> have<00:03:47.790> the

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
this is the first convert I have the

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.119 
this is the first convert I have the
tough<00:03:48.180> xtreme<00:03:48.449> as<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.780> can<00:03:48.900> see<00:03:49.079> that<00:03:49.290> part<00:03:49.889> is

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
tough xtreme as you can see that part is

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.550 
tough xtreme as you can see that part is
kind<00:03:50.340> of<00:03:50.430> not<00:03:50.970> fitting<00:03:51.209> properly<00:03:51.329> now<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.409> is

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
kind of not fitting properly now that is

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.580 
kind of not fitting properly now that is
a<00:03:52.590> defect<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.639> I<00:03:54.269> don't<00:03:54.629> that's<00:03:54.989> some<00:03:55.199> quality

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
a defect and I don't that's some quality

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.990 
a defect and I don't that's some quality
control<00:03:55.949> issues<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:56.430> they<00:03:56.519> that<00:03:56.699> should<00:03:56.879> not

control issues and they that should not

the case-mate tough xtreme the top you

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.339 
the case-mate tough xtreme the top you
can<00:04:02.549> see<00:04:02.609> cutouts<00:04:03.030> for<00:04:03.120> our<00:04:03.359> microphone<00:04:04.109> and

can see cutouts for our microphone and

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.170 
can see cutouts for our microphone and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.599 
buttons for our power button and a cut
out<00:04:06.209> for<00:04:06.510> our<00:04:06.629> 3.5<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.739> a<00:04:07.829> speaker<00:04:08.189> cut<00:04:08.370> out<00:04:08.459> as

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
out for our 3.5 and a speaker cut out as

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.179 
out for our 3.5 and a speaker cut out as
well<00:04:08.790> as<00:04:09.000> well<00:04:09.540> as<00:04:09.659> the<00:04:09.810> camera<00:04:10.109> cut<00:04:10.290> out<00:04:10.409> this

00:04:11.179 --> 00:04:11.189 
well as well as the camera cut out this

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:13.339 
well as well as the camera cut out this
is<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.430> back<00:04:11.579> part<00:04:11.939> this<00:04:12.389> is<00:04:12.509> for<00:04:12.750> propping

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:13.349 
is the back part this is for propping

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.140 
is the back part this is for propping
your<00:04:13.500> device<00:04:13.829> up<00:04:14.040> for<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.549> know<00:04:14.639> movies<00:04:14.970> and

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
your device up for you know movies and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.990 
your device up for you know movies and
stuff<00:04:15.329> because<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.709> does<00:04:17.250> prop<00:04:17.579> up<00:04:17.759> and

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
stuff because it does prop up and

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.029 
stuff because it does prop up and
overall<00:04:18.630> for<00:04:19.079> that<00:04:19.229> I<00:04:19.470> think<00:04:19.829> it's<00:04:19.949> a<00:04:20.009> great

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
overall for that I think it's a great

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.839 
overall for that I think it's a great
case<00:04:20.459> indeed<00:04:21.139> so<00:04:22.139> the<00:04:22.289> case<00:04:22.440> meet<00:04:22.680> again<00:04:23.070> in<00:04:23.099> in

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
case indeed so the case meet again in in

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.360 
case indeed so the case meet again in in
in<00:04:24.270> terms<00:04:24.479> of<00:04:24.690> design<00:04:24.990> is<00:04:25.139> where<00:04:25.289> is<00:04:25.469> nice<00:04:25.860> not

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
in terms of design is where is nice not

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.570 
in terms of design is where is nice not
the

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.909 
the
best<00:04:26.759> but<00:04:26.970> it's<00:04:27.259> certainly<00:04:28.259> very<00:04:28.530> not<00:04:28.889> very

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
best but it's certainly very not very

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.399 
best but it's certainly very not very
very<00:04:29.280> nice<00:04:29.460> so<00:04:29.759> not<00:04:30.030> bad<00:04:30.240> we<00:04:30.900> come<00:04:31.169> to<00:04:31.199> the<00:04:31.379> next

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409 
very nice so not bad we come to the next

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.800 
very nice so not bad we come to the next
one<00:04:31.740> which<00:04:31.889> the<00:04:32.039> ipad<00:04:32.340> mini<00:04:32.370> smart<00:04:32.849> cover<00:04:33.120> the

smart cover by the eye by Apple is

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.550 
smart cover by the eye by Apple is

provides the least protection out of the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.790 
provides the least protection out of the
bunch<00:04:40.740> is<00:04:41.719> the<00:04:42.719> best<00:04:43.199> looking<00:04:43.379> out<00:04:43.650> of<00:04:43.680> the

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
bunch is the best looking out of the

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.830 
bunch is the best looking out of the
bunch<00:04:44.069> and<00:04:44.310> it's<00:04:44.729> the<00:04:44.879> most<00:04:45.090> low<00:04:45.389> profile<00:04:45.719> out

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
bunch and it's the most low profile out

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.980 
bunch and it's the most low profile out
of<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:46.020> bunch<00:04:47.270> this<00:04:48.270> is<00:04:48.479> just<00:04:48.719> meant<00:04:48.900> to

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:48.990 
of the bunch this is just meant to

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.050 
of the bunch this is just meant to
protect<00:04:49.710> your<00:04:50.039> device<00:04:50.159> from<00:04:50.490> scratches<00:04:50.669> and

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
protect your device from scratches and

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.700 
protect your device from scratches and
stuff<00:04:51.360> while<00:04:51.659> pulling<00:04:51.960> on<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.080> desk<00:04:52.319> and<00:04:52.500> solve

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 
stuff while pulling on a desk and solve

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.920 
stuff while pulling on a desk and solve
and<00:04:52.860> that's<00:04:53.039> all<00:04:53.400> it<00:04:53.430> wants<00:04:54.000> to<00:04:54.030> do<00:04:54.240> for<00:04:54.599> that<00:04:54.629> I

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
and that's all it wants to do for that I

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.510 
and that's all it wants to do for that I
think<00:04:55.199> it's<00:04:55.289> a<00:04:55.349> great<00:04:55.469> case<00:04:55.800> not<00:04:56.069> the<00:04:56.189> best<00:04:56.400> but

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
think it's a great case not the best but

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.360 
think it's a great case not the best but
again<00:04:57.500> it's<00:04:58.500> good<00:04:58.800> but<00:04:59.009> the<00:04:59.159> price<00:04:59.340> is

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
again it's good but the price is

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.249 
again it's good but the price is
something<00:04:59.969> which<00:05:00.389> is<00:05:00.479> not<00:05:00.539> that<00:05:00.840> good<00:05:01.080> and

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 
something which is not that good and

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.350 
something which is not that good and
it's<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.949> Apple<00:05:02.310> premium<00:05:02.669> so<00:05:02.819> you<00:05:02.879> cannot<00:05:03.150> do

it's the Apple premium so you cannot do
anything<00:05:03.629> about<00:05:03.810> it<00:05:03.960> so<00:05:04.740> this<00:05:04.889> third<00:05:05.250> is<00:05:05.370> the

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
anything about it so this third is the

griffin in deli case now the griffin
intelli<00:05:07.530> case<00:05:07.830> has<00:05:08.759> its<00:05:08.969> flaws<00:05:09.090> as<00:05:09.449> i<00:05:09.629> said<00:05:09.870> the

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
intelli case has its flaws as i said the

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.230 
intelli case has its flaws as i said the
in<00:05:10.620> terms<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:10.979> installation<00:05:11.610> i<00:05:11.789> was<00:05:11.969> kind<00:05:12.180> of

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
in terms of installation i was kind of

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.230 
in terms of installation i was kind of
pissed<00:05:12.810> at<00:05:13.139> seeing<00:05:13.590> this<00:05:13.830> now<00:05:14.550> this<00:05:14.759> step<00:05:15.060> as

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
pissed at seeing this now this step as

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.959 
pissed at seeing this now this step as
you<00:05:15.300> can<00:05:15.419> see<00:05:15.599> is<00:05:15.810> not<00:05:15.990> going<00:05:16.259> inside<00:05:16.740> and<00:05:16.979> that

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:17.969 
you can see is not going inside and that

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.390 
you can see is not going inside and that
sucks<00:05:18.389> it<00:05:18.690> really<00:05:19.349> should<00:05:19.650> go<00:05:19.830> inside<00:05:19.979> but

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
sucks it really should go inside but

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.890 
sucks it really should go inside but
that's<00:05:20.610> not<00:05:20.729> going<00:05:21.000> inside<00:05:21.150> so<00:05:21.360> that's<00:05:21.539> a<00:05:21.690> a

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
that's not going inside so that's a a

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.490 
that's not going inside so that's a a
design<00:05:22.409> flaw<00:05:22.680> of<00:05:22.889> the<00:05:23.520> griffin<00:05:23.849> and<00:05:23.940> deli<00:05:24.150> case

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
design flaw of the griffin and deli case

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.269 
design flaw of the griffin and deli case
so<00:05:25.500> that<00:05:25.919> kind<00:05:26.279> of<00:05:26.310> concludes<00:05:27.029> the<00:05:27.360> design

00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:28.279 
so that kind of concludes the design

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:32.959 
so that kind of concludes the design
stuff<00:05:30.590> in<00:05:31.590> terms<00:05:32.009> of<00:05:32.099> design<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.460> Smart<00:05:32.729> Cover

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
stuff in terms of design the Smart Cover

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.300 
stuff in terms of design the Smart Cover
you<00:05:33.300> know<00:05:33.419> really<00:05:33.569> does<00:05:33.810> get<00:05:33.960> my<00:05:34.139> board<00:05:34.319> now

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:17.190 
highest out of the bunch obviously

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.219 
highest out of the bunch obviously
because<00:06:17.460> it's<00:06:17.580> meant<00:06:17.789> to<00:06:17.879> do<00:06:18.029> that<00:06:18.060> and<00:06:18.509> it

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
because it's meant to do that and it

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:20.779 
because it's meant to do that and it

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789 
also does all the propping up features

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:23.990 
also does all the propping up features
except<00:06:21.270> that<00:06:21.659> the<00:06:21.839> auto<00:06:22.440> wake<00:06:22.710> and<00:06:22.949> off<00:06:23.069> just

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
except that the auto wake and off just

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.969 
except that the auto wake and off just
because<00:06:24.120> it<00:06:24.330> does<00:06:24.449> not<00:06:24.479> have<00:06:24.779> a<00:06:24.810> top<00:06:25.319> cover<00:06:25.650> so

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
because it does not have a top cover so

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:28.369 
because it does not have a top cover so
or<00:06:26.370> all<00:06:26.849> in<00:06:27.000> terms<00:06:27.180> of<00:06:27.419> protection<00:06:28.020> i<00:06:28.139> think

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:28.379 
or all in terms of protection i think

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:31.089 
or all in terms of protection i think
the<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.740> case<00:06:29.159> made<00:06:29.430> is<00:06:29.550> a<00:06:29.580> better<00:06:29.819> better<00:06:30.479> by

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:31.099 
the the case made is a better better by

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.189 
the the case made is a better better by
ok<00:06:32.099> guys<00:06:32.279> i<00:06:32.490> hope<00:06:32.819> you<00:06:32.879> have<00:06:33.449> a<00:06:33.479> better<00:06:33.750> idea<00:06:33.870> on

ok guys i hope you have a better idea on
these<00:06:34.500> three<00:06:34.740> cases<00:06:34.919> it's<00:06:35.339> all<00:06:35.490> up<00:06:35.610> to<00:06:35.759> you<00:06:35.789> see

what man
the<00:06:38.930> most<00:06:39.110> for<00:06:39.470> me<00:06:39.500> I<00:06:39.889> like<00:06:40.130> protection<00:06:40.520> more

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:40.820 
the most for me I like protection more

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.270 
the most for me I like protection more
than<00:06:40.970> anything<00:06:41.150> else<00:06:41.420> because<00:06:41.950> I've<00:06:42.950> dropped

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 
than anything else because I've dropped

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.790 
than anything else because I've dropped
my<00:06:43.520> bad<00:06:43.850> twice<00:06:44.510> and<00:06:44.870> i<00:06:44.990> have<00:06:45.110> replaced<00:06:45.500> my

my bad twice and i have replaced my

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.100 
my bad twice and i have replaced my
apart<00:06:46.130> from<00:06:46.370> the<00:06:46.580> warranty<00:06:46.970> twice<00:06:47.210> twice<00:06:47.660> so<00:06:48.080> i

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.110 
apart from the warranty twice twice so i

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:49.750 
apart from the warranty twice twice so i
