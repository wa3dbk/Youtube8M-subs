00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.570
 monas and reflections commenting on a 

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:07.910
 new gameplay 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.220
 this time it 's modern warfare 3 is a 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.990
 departure of the operations mission 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.719
 special I have no idea how to 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:18.020
 but I know you have to go to the reactor 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.750
 and deactivate it well I'll go straight to 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.320
 grain and explain what are the 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.310
 dedicated servers the non-dedicated and 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.070
 some little things that have to do with 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.000
 they are worth first of all say that 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.190
 a server that is a mother a server is 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.810
 a much more powerful computer than the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.250
 that you will have in your houses unless 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:39.410
 that you have a computer of these 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.890
 extremes but good is usually much more 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.890
 powerful and that is designed to 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:51.260
 endure in long play sessions of 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.050
 I use well a dedicated server is a 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.660
 computer 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.800
 which is where a game is played 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.870
 ok and that is only dedicated to 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.370
 that online games are played in the 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.100
 say so that people connect to that 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.130
 computer and can play online is worth how 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.350
 is dedicated nobody is using it 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.930
 nobody is downloading they are 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.000
 downloading things is not being 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.119
 shared or nothing is only used 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.440
 to play for that connections with 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:23.470
 the servers are very fluid in the 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.590
 departure then at the end the experience of 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.200
 game then improve vouchers more is more 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.800
 funny on the contrary a server 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.539
 not dedicated is still the same as the 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.250
 dedicated only that it is a computer 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.950
 in which files are being downloaded 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.539
 is being used for other purposes or 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.590
 for other things 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.560
 also 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.329
 that is being shared to be 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.390
 used with different games ie 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.939
 a computer can be running as 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.620
 You see model is going to be three and ni for speed 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.080
 for example 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.720
 that is, when I want to play 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.790
 online iffor steve I can connect to 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.290
 this server that is not dedicated and 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.960
 also when we can do three 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.300
 I will also connect to this server 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.430
 It's worth it because you share the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.440
 connection between the different games that 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.890
 run the gaming experience will be 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.200
 worse since you will be much more likely to 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.640
 you meet with the lag and good all 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.870
 we know what to play with and if not what 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.370
 we know you are the worst of the worst you 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.400
 they take away the desire to play at least 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.400
 my 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.980
 Now I'm going to talk about something that I 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.890
 say the next one take me to the next 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.390
 gameplay point which is what is the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.390
 maximum quin the matchmaking 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:46.700
 in a few words, what it does is 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.790
 based on the connection in the speed 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.030
 of the connection of your console when your 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.489
 internet searches for the server or the game 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.620
 have best possible connection worth 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.209
 so you do not suffer agn and nothing and 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.239
 because I say this because normally the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.090
 maximum quin is usually used in games 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.470
 that do not have dedicated servers 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.240
 ok because with a game you have 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.850
 dedicated servers 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.530
 usually you connect to a 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.360
 a list of items of 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.610
 servers too and you connect in 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.950
 them and then you get this is what 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.420
 it happens in consoles I think I guess 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.490
 it also happens 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.940
 I repeat again that a game has 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:30.190
 matchmaking does not mean you do not have 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.020
 dedicated servers the only thing that has 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.370
 said is that usually the games 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.989
 that does not have dedicated servers are 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.989
 use but good 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.910
 but very well defined pretty much 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.400
 but 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.739
 and it is that there are some companies like 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.120
 activision that they do not use it and because 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:53.739
 there are other companies like activision that 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.260
 yes I look forgiving as electronic 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.650
 saying it using this is because a 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.750
 Dedicated server requires maintenance 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:06.150
 you have to install it city configurables 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.819
 you have to keep them worth that takes 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:14.810
 Y 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:16.970
 economic expense and that is why the 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.799
 they use because it compensates us because they do not 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.479
 they have simply because I think that 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.000
 activision would not compensate more point but 

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:24.530
 not from here because he also used 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.800
 I have to say that not always the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.630
 game company start solÃ­s and that 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.729
 is not always the one in charge of putting 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.009
 Served dedicated with X and others 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:39.400
 companies like for their first big unique 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:44.850
 thing that we can 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.850
 Yes Yes 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.129
