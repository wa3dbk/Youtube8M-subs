subtitled yeah absolutely and I do have
to<00:00:31.769> mention<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.460> lot<00:00:32.759> of<00:00:32.790> those<00:00:32.880> players

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
to mention that a lot of those players

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.220 
to mention that a lot of those players
that<00:00:33.270> were<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.660> video<00:00:33.840> they<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.110> have

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that were in that video they do have

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.540 
that were in that video they do have
their<00:00:34.260> own<00:00:34.380> live<00:00:34.559> stream<00:00:34.860> so<00:00:35.070> always<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.489> out

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
their own live stream so always go out

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
their own live stream so always go out
and<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:35.940> them<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.420> definitely<00:00:37.020> live

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
and so with them and definitely live

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.380 
and so with them and definitely live
streams<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.590> think<00:00:37.770> are<00:00:37.860> very<00:00:38.040> similar<00:00:38.790> with

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
streams I think are very similar with

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.000 
streams I think are very similar with
the<00:00:39.540> grassroots<00:00:40.050> kind<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.320> theme<00:00:40.500> that<00:00:40.770> stark

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010
