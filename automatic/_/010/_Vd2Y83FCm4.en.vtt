00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
guys request it and stuff like that so

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.799 
guys request it and stuff like that so
pretty<00:00:14.849> much<00:00:15.000> I'm<00:00:15.210> not<00:00:15.240> too<00:00:15.509> sure<00:00:15.690> I've

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
pretty much I'm not too sure I've

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.630 
pretty much I'm not too sure I've
already<00:00:15.990> done<00:00:16.260> this<00:00:16.379> guide<00:00:16.619> before<00:00:16.830> however

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
already done this guide before however

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.130 
already done this guide before however
there's<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:17.910> couple<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.240> months<00:00:18.359> ago<00:00:18.570> if<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:18.930> have

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
there's a couple of months ago if I have

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.410 
there's a couple of months ago if I have
done<00:00:19.289> it<00:00:19.439> so<00:00:19.740> hopefully<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:21.060> more

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
done it so hopefully this is more

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.240 
done it so hopefully this is more
relevant<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:22.050> now<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.560> basic<00:00:22.859> just<00:00:23.010> an<00:00:23.100> update

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
relevant to now and basic just an update

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.220 
relevant to now and basic just an update
on<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.609> prices<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.180> stuff<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.510> so

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
on the prices and stuff like that so

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.300 
on the prices and stuff like that so
basically<00:00:25.350> what<00:00:25.680> you'll<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.830> doing<00:00:25.980> today<00:00:26.220> is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
basically what you'll be doing today is

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.820 
basically what you'll be doing today is
making<00:00:26.880> baskets<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.390> bananas<00:00:27.869> now<00:00:28.410> these<00:00:28.560> are

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
making baskets of bananas now these are

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.560 
making baskets of bananas now these are
known<00:00:29.070> as<00:00:29.189> bananas<00:00:29.760> five<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.359> grand

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
known as bananas five in the grand

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.450 
known as bananas five in the grand
exchange<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.890> need<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.160> make<00:00:32.219> one

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
exchange and what you need to make one

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.330 
exchange and what you need to make one
basket<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.149> five<00:00:33.690> bananas<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.469> obviously<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
basket is five bananas and obviously a

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.240 
basket is five bananas and obviously a
basket<00:00:35.880> now<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.450> baskets<00:00:36.960> only<00:00:37.290> cost<00:00:37.530> one<00:00:37.829> GP

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
basket now the baskets only cost one GP

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.590 
basket now the baskets only cost one GP
so<00:00:38.520> I'm<00:00:38.670> not<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.120> account<00:00:39.450> that

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
so I'm not really going to account that

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.090 
so I'm not really going to account that
into<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> costing<00:00:40.320> citri<00:00:40.649> doesn't<00:00:40.920> make<00:00:41.070> a

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
into the costing citri doesn't make a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.430 
into the costing citri doesn't make a
difference<00:00:41.309> at<00:00:41.610> all<00:00:41.640> to<00:00:41.969> be<00:00:42.000> honest<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.510> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
difference at all to be honest and the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
difference at all to be honest and the
bananas<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.250> five<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.460> them<00:00:44.760> cost<00:00:45.030> 500<00:00:45.510> GP<00:00:45.780> so

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
bananas for five of them cost 500 GP so

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.650 
bananas for five of them cost 500 GP so
I'll<00:00:46.079> see<00:00:46.289> 100<00:00:46.680> gph<00:00:47.190> now<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> total<00:00:48.450> cost

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
I'll see 100 gph now the total cost

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.510 
I'll see 100 gph now the total cost
obviously<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.440> still<00:00:49.649> gonna<00:00:49.800> be<00:00:49.860> roughly<00:00:50.219> five

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
obviously is still gonna be roughly five

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.979 
obviously is still gonna be roughly five
from<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.730> GP<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.449> after<00:00:51.719> you've<00:00:51.840> made<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
from the GP so after you've made the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
from the GP so after you've made the
baskets<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.010> try<00:00:53.219> selling<00:00:53.489> back<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
baskets and you try selling back in the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.490 
baskets and you try selling back in the
ground<00:00:53.969> exchange<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.629> normally<00:00:54.989> buy<00:00:55.170> for

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
ground exchange they normally buy for

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.170 
ground exchange they normally buy for
roughly<00:00:55.770> 1<00:00:55.980> K<00:00:56.250> as<00:00:56.460> you'll<00:00:56.640> see<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:56.910> this<00:00:57.030> video

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
roughly 1 K as you'll see in this video

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.910 
roughly 1 K as you'll see in this video
now<00:00:57.870> this<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.050> pretty<00:00:58.320> much<00:00:58.410> just<00:00:58.680> because

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
now this is pretty much just because

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.319 
now this is pretty much just because
they<00:00:59.039> are<00:00:59.160> really<00:00:59.370> high<00:00:59.579> demand<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.030> lot<00:01:00.180> people

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
they are really high demand a lot people

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.479 
they are really high demand a lot people
use<00:01:00.690> them<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.410> going<00:01:01.649> by<00:01:01.829> this<00:01:01.890> profit<00:01:02.399> you

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
use them so going by this profit you

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.880 
use them so going by this profit you
make<00:01:02.520> pro<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.090> basket<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.719> 500<00:01:04.320> GP<00:01:04.650> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
make pro on basket is 500 GP and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.740 
make pro on basket is 500 GP and
obviously<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.700> can<00:01:05.820> make<00:01:05.970> four<00:01:06.210> baskets<00:01:06.600> per

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
obviously you can make four baskets per

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.140 
obviously you can make four baskets per
bag<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.380> use<00:01:07.560> for<00:01:08.040> baskets<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.729> 20

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
bag because you use for baskets and 20

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.420 
bag because you use for baskets and 20
bananas<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.560> make<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.890> pay<00:01:11.070> profit

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
bananas and you can make to pay profit

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.880 
bananas and you can make to pay profit
per<00:01:11.610> bag<00:01:11.820> which<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.090> quite<00:01:12.390> cool<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
per bag which is quite cool and

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.410 
per bag which is quite cool and
considering<00:01:13.890> each<00:01:14.100> bag<00:01:14.369> only<00:01:14.760> takes<00:01:14.970> about<00:01:15.090> 10

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
considering each bag only takes about 10

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
considering each bag only takes about 10
seconds<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.200> that's<00:01:16.590> with<00:01:16.770> banking<00:01:17.280> it's

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
seconds and that's with banking it's

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.149 
seconds and that's with banking it's
basically<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.270> 2k<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.960> 10<00:01:19.170> seconds<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.950> per

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
basically like 2k in 10 seconds so per

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.399 
basically like 2k in 10 seconds so per
one<00:01:20.430> minute<00:01:20.729> you're<00:01:20.850> making<00:01:21.210> 12<00:01:21.450> k<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.020> going

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
one minute you're making 12 k and going

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.460 
one minute you're making 12 k and going
by<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.619> you're<00:01:22.979> making<00:01:23.310> roughly<00:01:24.080> 720<00:01:25.080> k<00:01:25.259> per

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
by this you're making roughly 720 k per

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.590 
by this you're making roughly 720 k per
hour<00:01:25.650> now<00:01:26.340> these<00:01:26.610> are<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.850> figures<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.210> right

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
hour now these are the figures for right

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.179 
hour now these are the figures for right
now<00:01:27.630> when<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.080> make<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.409> video<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.950> obviously

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
now when I make this video so obviously

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.740 
now when I make this video so obviously
please<00:01:29.490> do<00:01:29.700> make<00:01:29.850> sure<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.060> do<00:01:30.329> check<00:01:30.570> it

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
please do make sure you do check it

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.539 
please do make sure you do check it
