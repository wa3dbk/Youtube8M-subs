00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:06.829 

so<00:00:04.799> we<00:00:05.460> have<00:00:05.879> to<00:00:06.060> monitor<00:00:06.210> the<00:00:06.540> planet's

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
so we have to monitor the planet's

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.980 
so we have to monitor the planet's
resources<00:00:06.930> we<00:00:07.560> have<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:08.389> begin<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.599> construct

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
resources we have to begin to construct

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.990 
resources we have to begin to construct
a<00:00:10.260> system<00:00:10.500> of<00:00:10.950> production<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.880> distribution

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
a system of production and distribution

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.209 
a system of production and distribution
that<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.660> not<00:00:12.870> based<00:00:13.049> on<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.380> whims<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.769> profit

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
that is not based on the whims of profit

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.490 
that is not based on the whims of profit
it's<00:00:14.610> based<00:00:14.910> on<00:00:15.179> what<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:15.660> most<00:00:15.870> efficient

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
it's based on what is the most efficient

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.880 
it's based on what is the most efficient
means<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:17.130> do<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:18.050> there<00:00:19.050> are<00:00:19.170> resources<00:00:19.500> all

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
means to do that there are resources all

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.290 
means to do that there are resources all
over<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.220> planet<00:00:20.430> obviously<00:00:21.000> we<00:00:21.090> have<00:00:21.210> to

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
over the planet obviously we have to

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.150 
over the planet obviously we have to
begin<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.600> understand<00:00:22.080> what<00:00:22.260> we<00:00:22.380> have<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:23.039> have

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
begin to understand what we have we have

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.410 
begin to understand what we have we have
to<00:00:23.250> use<00:00:23.369> science<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:23.789> technology<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.300> begin

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
to use science and technology to begin

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.230 
to use science and technology to begin
to<00:00:24.630> orient<00:00:24.840> our<00:00:25.350> use<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.430> these<00:00:26.550> resources<00:00:26.609> in

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
to orient our use of these resources in

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.759 
to orient our use of these resources in
the<00:00:27.300> most<00:00:27.330> efficient<00:00:27.869> way<00:00:27.900> possible<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the most efficient way possible and

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.220 
the most efficient way possible and
that's<00:00:29.010> why<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.460> advocate<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.510> systems

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
that's why we advocate the systems

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:39.170 
that's why we advocate the systems
approach<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.710> we<00:00:31.830> do<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> when<00:00:38.850> you're<00:00:38.940> born

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
approach that we do so when you're born

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.010 
approach that we do so when you're born
on<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.450> planet

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
on this planet

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.500 
on this planet
you<00:00:40.200> inherit<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> planet<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.670> planet<00:00:41.820> is

you inherit the planet the planet is

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.569 
you inherit the planet the planet is
your<00:00:42.780> home<00:00:43.140> not<00:00:43.980> some<00:00:44.399> part<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.760> land<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.870> is

your home not some part of land that is

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.510 
your home not some part of land that is

those at the top to make sure no one can
interfere<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.480> fact<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.809> they

interfere with the fact that they

interfere with the fact that they
control<00:01:04.409> mostly<00:01:04.830> everything

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.820 

if<00:01:12.800> you<00:01:13.070> motivated<00:01:13.880> our<00:01:14.750> resources<00:01:15.470> right<00:01:15.620> now

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
if you motivated our resources right now

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.280 
if you motivated our resources right now
to<00:01:15.890> change<00:01:16.370> the<00:01:16.550> face<00:01:16.850> of<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.180> earth<00:01:17.330> to

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
to change the face of the earth to

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.140 
to change the face of the earth to
create<00:01:18.470> a<00:01:18.620> resource-based<00:01:18.710> economy<00:01:19.280> we<00:01:19.940> could

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
create a resource-based economy we could

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.460 
create a resource-based economy we could
do<00:01:20.300> it<00:01:20.450> very<00:01:20.600> very<00:01:20.720> quickly

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
do it very very quickly

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.920 
do it very very quickly
the<00:01:21.950> problem<00:01:22.310> is<00:01:22.430> again<00:01:22.760> the<00:01:23.390> established

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
the problem is again the established

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.210 
the problem is again the established
orthodoxies<00:01:24.590> and<00:01:24.770> self-preserving

right now we are faced with an

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
tied into the energy collapse we're

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.440 
tied into the energy collapse we're

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
new paradigm that's on the horizon that

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.320 
new paradigm that's on the horizon that
we<00:03:32.230> must<00:03:32.470> drive<00:03:32.740> forward<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.520> as<00:03:33.670> fast<00:03:33.940> as

humanly possible we are driven by

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.270 
humanly possible we are driven by
biosocial<00:03:45.850> pressures<00:03:46.200> meaning<00:03:47.200> that<00:03:47.920> it

biosocial pressures meaning that it

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.060 
biosocial pressures meaning that it
takes<00:03:48.670> problems<00:03:49.390> for<00:03:49.959> us<00:03:50.080> to<00:03:50.320> wake<00:03:50.590> up<00:03:50.620> and

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
takes problems for us to wake up and

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:59.470 
takes problems for us to wake up and
want<00:03:51.520> to<00:03:51.670> change<00:03:51.970> things
