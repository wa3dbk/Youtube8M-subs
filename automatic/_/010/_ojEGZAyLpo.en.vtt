me<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.140> is<00:02:18.350> always<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.709> surprise<00:02:19.010> again<00:02:19.400> you

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
me it is always a surprise again you

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.199 
me it is always a surprise again you
know<00:02:19.850> very<00:02:20.060> often<00:02:20.300> we<00:02:21.170> present<00:02:21.739> models<00:02:22.180> for<00:02:23.180> a

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
know very often we present models for a

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.350 
know very often we present models for a
final<00:02:23.600> as<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.860> final<00:02:25.100> presentation<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:25.970> the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
final as a final presentation is the

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.340 
final as a final presentation is the
model<00:02:26.840> fix<00:02:27.080> we<00:02:27.290> call<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.650> whether<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:29.350> design

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
model fix we call it whether the design

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.759 
model fix we call it whether the design
is<00:02:30.560> frozen<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:32.030> few<00:02:32.330> months<00:02:32.480> later<00:02:32.769> when

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
is frozen and a few months later when

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.220 
is frozen and a few months later when
you<00:02:34.070> look<00:02:34.220> at<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:34.970> know<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.299> dictionary

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
you look at the you know the dictionary

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.270 
you look at the you know the dictionary
like<00:02:36.380> the<00:02:36.590> colors<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.580> have<00:02:38.560> 15<00:02:39.560> prototypes

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
like the colors you have 15 prototypes

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.280 
like the colors you have 15 prototypes
in<00:02:40.549> perfect<00:02:40.970> condition<00:02:41.480> it's<00:02:41.630> amazing

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
in perfect condition it's amazing

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.340 
in perfect condition it's amazing
sometimes<00:02:42.560> early<00:02:43.330> unbelievable<00:02:44.330> day<00:02:44.630> but<00:02:45.170> huh

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
sometimes early unbelievable day but huh

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.560 
sometimes early unbelievable day but huh
what<00:02:45.830> is<00:02:45.920> your<00:02:46.040> objective<00:02:46.370> is<00:02:46.640> even<00:02:46.910> died<00:02:47.060> and

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
what is your objective is even died and

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.690 
what is your objective is even died and
what<00:02:47.750> are<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:47.959> key<00:02:48.170> element<00:02:48.530> of<00:02:48.620> here<00:02:48.950> I<00:02:49.160> think

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
what are the key element of here I think

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.620 
what are the key element of here I think
that<00:02:49.850> you<00:02:50.120> know<00:02:50.269> has<00:02:50.510> come<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.750> long<00:02:50.870> way<00:02:51.200> and

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
that you know has come a long way and

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.520 
that you know has come a long way and
you<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:54.019> I<00:02:54.820> has<00:02:55.820> very<00:02:56.060> expressive<00:02:56.600> course<00:02:57.049> so

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
you and I has very expressive course so

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.789 
you and I has very expressive course so
I<00:02:57.890> think<00:02:58.489> from<00:02:58.580> a<00:02:58.730> design<00:02:59.030> point<00:02:59.239> of<00:02:59.420> view<00:02:59.799> you

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
I think from a design point of view you

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.860 
I think from a design point of view you
know<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:01.790> know<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:01.970> started<00:03:02.540> with<00:03:02.720> this

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
know you know I started with this

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.039 
know you know I started with this
fluidic<00:03:03.500> sculpture<00:03:04.750> region<00:03:05.750> through<00:03:05.930> this

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
fluidic sculpture region through this

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.009 
fluidic sculpture region through this
predict<00:03:06.650> sculpture<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.940> it's<00:03:08.810> very

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
predict sculpture and it's very

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.340 
predict sculpture and it's very
expressive<00:03:09.440> design<00:03:09.739> very<00:03:10.370> very<00:03:10.930> extreme<00:03:11.930> kind

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
expressive design very very extreme kind

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.729 
expressive design very very extreme kind
of<00:03:12.470> lines<00:03:12.739> and<00:03:13.070> things<00:03:13.209> but<00:03:14.209> you<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.780> would<00:03:15.560> like

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
of lines and things but you I would like

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.729 
of lines and things but you I would like
to<00:03:16.010> to<00:03:16.579> keep<00:03:16.850> going<00:03:17.299> on<00:03:17.480> that<00:03:17.660> but<00:03:17.930> maybe<00:03:18.350> make

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
to to keep going on that but maybe make

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.770 
to to keep going on that but maybe make
it<00:03:18.890> not<00:03:19.070> quite<00:03:19.610> as<00:03:19.820> extreme<00:03:20.360> but<00:03:20.540> more

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
it not quite as extreme but more

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.470 
it not quite as extreme but more
controlled<00:03:21.260> and<00:03:21.500> more<00:03:21.769> more<00:03:22.730> sophisticated

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
controlled and more more sophisticated

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.069 
controlled and more more sophisticated
not<00:03:23.810> so<00:03:24.019> much<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.890> laughs<00:03:25.100> to<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.790> the

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
not so much the laughs to the to the

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.490 
not so much the laughs to the to the
details<00:03:27.079> line<00:03:27.350> but<00:03:27.680> maybe

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
details line but maybe

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.210 
details line but maybe
more<00:03:28.740> look<00:03:28.920> at<00:03:29.040> the<00:03:29.190> big<00:03:29.370> picture<00:03:29.640> and<00:03:31.220> listen

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
more look at the big picture and listen

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.490 
more look at the big picture and listen
she<00:03:32.510> do<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.630> mean<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.870> want<00:03:34.260> to<00:03:34.350> make

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
she do you mean you want to make

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.410 
she do you mean you want to make
something<00:03:34.710> more<00:03:34.890> classic<00:03:35.160> let's<00:03:35.730> say<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.060> in

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
something more classic let's say I in

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.490 
something more classic let's say I in
the<00:03:36.600> right<00:03:36.840> yes<00:03:37.350> you<00:03:37.620> know<00:03:37.740> ain't<00:03:38.280> nobody<00:03:38.460> yes

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
the right yes you know ain't nobody yes

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.290 
the right yes you know ain't nobody yes
still<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:41.040> needs<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.430> be<00:03:41.550> expressive<00:03:42.120> and

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
still it needs to be expressive and

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.750 
still it needs to be expressive and
fresh<00:03:42.570> yeah<00:03:43.320> it's<00:03:43.770> my<00:03:43.890> question<00:03:44.310> did<00:03:44.460> you<00:03:44.490> say

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
fresh yeah it's my question did you say

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.940 
fresh yeah it's my question did you say
you<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.570> I<00:03:45.750> has<00:03:45.930> to<00:03:45.959> become<00:03:46.410> more<00:03:46.590> premium

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
you and I has to become more premium

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.280 
you and I has to become more premium
let's<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:47.640> Volkswagen<00:03:47.940> want<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.840> stay<00:03:49.080> like

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
let's like Volkswagen want to stay like

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.850 
let's like Volkswagen want to stay like
Jenny<00:03:50.060> homogeneously<00:03:51.060> ya<00:03:51.240> know<00:03:51.630> what<00:03:52.590> is<00:03:52.709> the

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
Jenny homogeneously ya know what is the

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.060 
Jenny homogeneously ya know what is the
line<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:54.720> think<00:03:55.170> it's<00:03:55.320> very<00:03:55.530> important<00:03:56.190> to<00:03:58.070> to

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
line I think it's very important to to

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.760 
line I think it's very important to to
kind<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.490> be<00:03:59.730> ahead<00:03:59.880> from<00:04:00.480> from<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.200> general

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
kind of be ahead from from the general

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.620 
kind of be ahead from from the general
average<00:04:02.730> of<00:04:03.239> oil<00:04:03.770> producers<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:05.630> improve

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
average of oil producers and and improve

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.630 
average of oil producers and and improve
the<00:04:06.840> quality<00:04:06.959> as<00:04:07.470> much<00:04:07.739> as<00:04:07.980> we<00:04:08.160> can<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.610> course

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
the quality as much as we can of course

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.910 
the quality as much as we can of course
this<00:04:08.970> always<00:04:09.300> needs<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.630> be<00:04:09.750> in<00:04:09.840> balance<00:04:10.020> it

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
this always needs to be in balance it

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.729 
this always needs to be in balance it
with<00:04:11.040> this<00:04:11.190> icing<00:04:11.700> but<00:04:12.140> still<00:04:13.140> in<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.590> field

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
with this icing but still in the field

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.080 
with this icing but still in the field
on<00:04:13.920> the<00:04:13.950> design<00:04:14.340> point<00:04:14.640> of<00:04:14.790> view<00:04:14.850> the

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
on the design point of view the

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.620 
on the design point of view the
perceived<00:04:15.570> quality<00:04:15.859> in<00:04:16.859> interior<00:04:17.459> still<00:04:17.880> we

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
perceived quality in interior still we

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.979 
perceived quality in interior still we
can<00:04:18.840> do<00:04:18.959> a<00:04:18.989> lot<00:04:19.200> that<00:04:19.410> we<00:04:19.530> can<00:04:19.560> we<00:04:20.010> can<00:04:20.989> progress

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
can do a lot that we can we can progress

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.820 
can do a lot that we can we can progress
and<00:04:22.440> we<00:04:22.620> can<00:04:22.860> progress<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.610> make<00:04:24.290> other<00:04:25.290> steps

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
and we can progress and make other steps

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.580 
and we can progress and make other steps
till<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.580> there<00:04:27.480> is<00:04:27.570> a<00:04:27.600> lot<00:04:27.780> in<00:04:27.960> it<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:28.290> this<00:04:28.380> is

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
till is there is a lot in it and this is

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.220 
till is there is a lot in it and this is

how to to work on the brand image and

how to to work on the brand image and
only<00:05:04.080> on<00:05:04.229> the<00:05:04.350> on<00:05:04.470> the<00:05:04.500> brand<00:05:05.060> is<00:05:06.060> the<00:05:06.479> brand

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
only on the on the brand is the brand

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.990 
only on the on the brand is the brand
image<00:05:06.930> to<00:05:07.200> respect<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.800> brand<00:05:08.070> and<00:05:08.280> tooth<00:05:08.550> how

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
image to respect the brand and tooth how

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.760 
image to respect the brand and tooth how
to<00:05:09.060> really<00:05:09.720> also<00:05:11.570> reinforce<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:12.750> and<00:05:12.960> make<00:05:13.740> it

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
to really also reinforce it and make it

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.130 
to really also reinforce it and make it
even<00:05:14.070> stronger<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.479> think<00:05:15.690> this<00:05:15.780> is<00:05:15.840> one<00:05:16.110> of

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
even stronger and I think this is one of

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.490 
even stronger and I think this is one of
the<00:05:16.490> things<00:05:17.490> I'm<00:05:17.729> really

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
the things I'm really

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.410 
the things I'm really
I<00:05:18.680> can<00:05:19.340> do<00:05:19.490> in<00:05:20.000> a<00:05:20.540> good<00:05:20.690> way<00:05:20.840> does<00:05:21.260> it<00:05:21.410> mean<00:05:21.650> that

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
I can do in a good way does it mean that

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:25.210 
I can do in a good way does it mean that
in<00:05:23.420> your<00:05:23.600> design<00:05:23.990> are<00:05:24.590> you<00:05:24.830> for<00:05:25.100> the

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
in your design are you for the

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.130 
in your design are you for the
revolution<00:05:25.520> sometime<00:05:26.300> or<00:05:26.510> do<00:05:26.660> you<00:05:26.750> think<00:05:26.810> we

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.140 
revolution sometime or do you think we

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.290 
revolution sometime or do you think we
have<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.560> evaluate<00:05:28.370> it<00:05:28.940> will<00:05:29.120> you<00:05:29.210> ate

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
have to evaluate it will you ate

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.570 
have to evaluate it will you ate
evolution<00:05:30.020> evolution<00:05:30.260> or<00:05:30.860> dating<00:05:31.160> some<00:05:31.370> time

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
evolution evolution or dating some time

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.510 
evolution evolution or dating some time
when<00:05:31.880> needs<00:05:32.180> a<00:05:32.480> big<00:05:32.780> you<00:05:33.500> know<00:05:33.620> I<00:05:33.650> think<00:05:34.310> this

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
when needs a big you know I think this

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:36.580 
when needs a big you know I think this
is<00:05:34.760> it's<00:05:35.150> in<00:05:35.360> between<00:05:35.510> here<00:05:35.990> you<00:05:36.140> need<00:05:36.320> to<00:05:36.350> do

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
is it's in between here you need to do

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.120 
is it's in between here you need to do
both<00:05:36.800> because<00:05:37.540> in<00:05:38.540> one<00:05:38.600> way<00:05:38.990> I<00:05:39.350> think<00:05:39.770> we<00:05:39.950> need

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
both because in one way I think we need

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.320 
both because in one way I think we need
to<00:05:40.190> make<00:05:40.490> big<00:05:40.850> steps<00:05:41.260> but<00:05:42.260> on<00:05:42.560> the<00:05:42.680> other<00:05:42.800> hand

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
to make big steps but on the other hand

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.410 
to make big steps but on the other hand
you<00:05:44.330> know<00:05:45.070> what<00:05:46.070> one<00:05:46.550> somewhat<00:05:46.940> we<00:05:47.090> didn't

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:47.420 
you know what one somewhat we didn't

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.780 
you know what one somewhat we didn't
cure<00:05:47.660> is<00:05:49.300> to<00:05:50.300> create<00:05:50.600> a<00:05:50.660> certain<00:05:51.430> style<00:05:52.430> in<00:05:52.700> the

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
cure is to create a certain style in the

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.690 
cure is to create a certain style in the
direction<00:05:53.120> and<00:05:53.770> so<00:05:54.770> it's<00:05:55.160> think<00:05:55.580> it's

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
direction and so it's think it's

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.780 
direction and so it's think it's
important<00:05:56.210> to<00:05:56.270> keep<00:05:56.360> a<00:05:56.570> continuity<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:58.430> this

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:58.790 
important to keep a continuity and this

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.110 
important to keep a continuity and this
is<00:05:58.940> also<00:05:59.090> kind<00:05:59.360> of<00:06:00.580> reliability<00:06:01.580> for<00:06:02.030> the

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
is also kind of reliability for the

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.659 
is also kind of reliability for the
customer<00:06:02.660> so<00:06:02.840> when<00:06:03.680> you<00:06:03.800> get<00:06:03.980> your<00:06:04.010> next<00:06:04.430> car

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
customer so when you get your next car

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.790 
customer so when you get your next car
you<00:06:04.820> know<00:06:05.000> what<00:06:05.240> to<00:06:05.419> explain<00:06:05.810> it<00:06:05.960> let's<00:06:06.620> think

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
you know what to explain it let's think

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.670 
you know what to explain it let's think
about<00:06:06.860> the<00:06:07.100> two<00:06:07.250> ladies<00:06:07.400> car<00:06:07.970> the<00:06:08.360> Genesis<00:06:08.840> 1

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:09.680 
about the two ladies car the Genesis 1

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.490 
about the two ladies car the Genesis 1
it<00:06:10.240> seemed<00:06:11.240> very<00:06:11.419> classic<00:06:11.960> like<00:06:12.169> you<00:06:12.380> know

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
it seemed very classic like you know

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.880 
it seemed very classic like you know
that<00:06:13.690> civil<00:06:14.690> stereo<00:06:16.060> in<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.380> size<00:06:18.380> of<00:06:18.620> call

because it is difficult enough to get
