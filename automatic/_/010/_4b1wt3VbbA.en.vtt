 and we put the normal button here you have to 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.020
 wait a little bit for this process 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.000
 they need to be root users if you do not know 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.170
 how does the user have the galaxy aut 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.610
 n 7000 version 1 or galaxy 1 east 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.619
 would leave in enjoyment in a video in the 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.930
 which I show you how to do it root very very 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.330
 easy with both an application very well 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.450
 then we give in accept takes here 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.360
 we give in jump ok and then we give 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.369
 here where it says download and install 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.920
 host puts and you have to wait also in 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.990
 this process takes no more than a minute 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.530
 ok those 3 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.690

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.080
 he asked me to send greetings then 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.300
 good greetings while this process passes 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.710
 this is good the time that elapses 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.450
 it also depends on the connection to 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.130
 internet that you have either a 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.160
 megabyte 26 etcetera etcetera ok is this 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:35.080
 it depends on your connection and it also depends 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.080
 to the signal you have 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.510
 ok says your android device should 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.980
 be free of advertising anyway 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.530
 it may be necessary to restart for 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.319
 clean the dns cache ok good 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.000
 then the only thing we have to do 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.739
 is to restart the device and I'm going to 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.269
 leave here pressed and we're going to 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.269
 restart forgiveness 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.329
 and restart the device 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.510
 yes 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.360
 what if 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.900
 Peru 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.800
 well there you are already starting 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.410
 plus 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.110
 good and we see that it started 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.479
 very good and good this was all already 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.490
 only they needed to remember to enter 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.210
 restart the device when they open the 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.620
 application will show you now so 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.389
 to do the process again but 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.379
 we no longer want the process 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:37.599
 ask the request to do good to give 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:40.539
 root permissions but he already asks me 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.849
 because I already had the application be 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.889
 installed ok ok well this has been 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:46.720
 I hope you liked it and not anymore 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:49.949
 more advertising in the applications or the 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.949
 internet or anything 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:58.370
 I do not know why it came out but good in the 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.950
 advertising for example let's make a 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:06.090
 example in the series application 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:08.700
 ok in which it gives you wallpapers 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.410
 et cetera etcetera et cetera but good 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.740
 let's wait for it to connect to a 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:15.000
 server ok and in the part of here if 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.560
 you look at some phones 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.690
 who have not done this process are going to 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.110
 have here in this part advertising 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:25.560

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.580
