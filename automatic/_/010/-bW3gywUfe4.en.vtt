00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.430
 Hello UTB van muffins today we 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.800
 talking about the foundry clan of the black mountain 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.109
 Garrosh knew that the Hurons could be broken. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.150
 subjugating their great father to grull 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.330
 once known as the dragon both play 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.849
 become the usual laborer about him and go 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.529
 speech in today's video in general will 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.980
 pretty simple how should 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.440
 be the first boss of the raid tanks must 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.760
 control the direction of the load when 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.730
 final blow 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.660
 and all others must speak at 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.020
 crushing 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.690
 and network output wars consider one of 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.180
 fill our pools don't be surprised here 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:56.629
 many lags and some effects for example 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.010
 a blow with a swing will not match 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.489
 all wars that will not be on the earth 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.970
 surprised it ok so let's go 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.070
 great battle begins need to be 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.200
 be careful not to catch the stunning 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.630
 hitting like we did with a robber on 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.090
 the very bullet for this must be in 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.770
 10 meters from the load 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.710
 besides there was an impacting blow to the whole row 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.840
 it is very important to monitor the impact of the petrification 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.320
 which here you see scatters all 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.979
 players 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.259
 there is a countdown and when the time 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.350
 run out that crushing will cause damage 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.350
 to all surrounding players typing 100 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.329
 energy game casts its infernal 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.960
 blow which in theory should be shared by all 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.119
 raid though we didn't do that either 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.280
 so the tanks got a lion strike and not 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.380
 lived long after the infernal 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.990
 hitting the tank should take the game load 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.520
 raid for great breaking 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.200
 blows 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.380
 periodically groomer causes blockages vaults 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.430
 caves are cracked and showered in these 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.130
 wars better not stand 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.520
 periodically grue casts a blow with a span 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.860
 here hello with a shaker from dota 2 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.220
 and when the grohl is attacked by a destructive 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.740
 a riot then only blows with a swing it and 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.930
 starts to beat 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.880
 it's a blow to the ground that hurts everyone 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.050
 opponents on a straight line 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:22.130
 in front of the caster serious damage like you 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.140
 see howling zone of this blow does not match 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.430
 with real direction drawing 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.010
 Well, this can sometimes be expected 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.350
 still a beta test that's actually 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.750
 the whole fight let's summarize again 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.000
 so the tanks control the infernal 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.550
 punches and unwrap in or from raid 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.740
 raid also roll came blea 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.280
 blows america look to not 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.130
 get everyone is looking to not 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.770
 run into the weid of the obstruction and watch 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.920
 blow fossilization in which the need 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.280
 gain distance if dota hangs on you 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.830
 so as not to hurt the comrade by crushing 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.920
 from there the span is easy to move away this line 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:06.830
 you can see how the zone is destructive 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.940
 the rampage is experienced by the whole raid running 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.600
 around the bush 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.820
 actually that's all i would like to still 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.200
 additionally say it is a kind of hack 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.420
 which we used to 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.960
 Infernal strike to 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:25.610
 sharing this damage is just those players 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.240
 who have -90 types of manka mages or 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.730
 horn 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:32.390
 They changed in turn and shared together with 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.210
 tank this damage she's probably all 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.550
 Thank you all wait for new videos about 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.440
