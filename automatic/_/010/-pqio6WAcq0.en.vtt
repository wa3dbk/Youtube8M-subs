00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.620
 new complete here on my channel 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.089
 raskin 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.440
 demand again a new gameplay and 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.630
 also on a new folder, namely the mat 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.039
 fertig is also used is carla with mercury 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.720
 and again from the right forest mine 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.400
 I strictly use the war score 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.970
 reset escort drone and again the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.680
 black 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.180
 this dp about five minutes ago 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.680
 met and I thought I'd upload it to 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.570
 you and of course not a lot of time 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.070
 to the gamer I have two jars in total 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.719
 played the first game, I was immediately 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 raced can creates a few funfairs on it 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.600
 and the second jar I get this 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.219
 gameplay you them nice game-play 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.570
 to watch but I want today too 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.610
 weather evens going to give some tips and tricks 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 concerning the jump control what you 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.180
 here the player just sees your team with 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.399
 6 to 6 and we play arms race 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.140
 Instead of 100 points get 150 points 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.910
 and I don't know exactly where they are anymore 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.350
 span I really just want them in 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.910
 my back a span so you see here too 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.230
 it did so check my back so 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.460
 my teammate is again next to me 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.940
 so I thought so if you do n't go 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.989
 tension more 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.760
 so now probably came all the way 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.350
 left and then the boy 4a and 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.969
 of course if you jorien the sky and then 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.229
 do you know exactly where they tension and if 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.880
 you a war it is in the air and then 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.710
 you know exactly where they are going even 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.210
 they have coaches who must slash scores 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.530
 you also just have to be on if you have the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.210
 want to keep spawn in check because is 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.710
 pretty hard all that time 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.630
 Sparkles roll to keep the has time 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.310
 know where the and miss but that 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.509
 You must be able to do it as your school 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.130
 goes for a new clear because if you 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.659
 that is not possible if you do not know where the and 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.130
 you just don't get too strenuous 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.960
 succeed and so you only die 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.400
 girl dip I'm now inside the enemy 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.259
 and I was just doing it now 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.850
 try not to start again next to 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.380
 Spain just needs that minimal 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.909
 has to monitor you need it 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.590
 keep an eye on where tensioning with 10 degrees 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.520
 where are the 10 mate kempen 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.380
 because you just see the eric loop 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.460
 10 degrees increased directly to them 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.079
 just leave it here for me again 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.939
 and they do see here too 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.439
 another emmy arriving walk and so must 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.850
 you shot a little bit in every folder 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.530
 maneuver so you have to get in a bit 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.180
 each order on ordinary has on that minimal 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.799
 stay flat i was this eight found gamepad 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.390
 also listening to card music cat 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.280
 according to my rhiana with stay getting up 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.600
 such a dubstep ticket and remix I had is 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.490
 otherwise no game sound but I had 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.320
 just my mini-map and with 10 degrees 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.579
 to look at to determine where the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.320
 Enemy stood out and now of course 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.000
 just that waiter or is it in the air 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 now it was just easy peasy if you were that waiter 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.579
 or is it in the air and you know 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.960
 exactly where a miso you do 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.789
 nothing to do anymore and you go 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.289
 naturally molds inside that you wear 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.760
 him and that they also just the 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.069
 the intention is that the war is made 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.599
 through just 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.310
 a minute to look up and if we 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.870
 for example use coast or so then 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.519
 you don't know where the enemy sneaked but you 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.780
 we know fine and if you walk 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.340
 Fatima knows expired 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.930
 Do you also know if and if they miss out 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.889
 should you try the hefty ones 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.420
 always pimp a little 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:28.010
 because that question comes in very often 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.329
 from jan i it was on my mini-map 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.560
 watching but suddenly 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:32.299
 someone was behind it or something but that 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.069
 You always have a problem 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:35.689
 be lucky in call of duty if you have that 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.189
 have not you go on the punches 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.750
 just put an emmy on ice in your back 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:40.189
 but you just have a calf that 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.569
 many people just trying to significantly 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.400
 Many people also use chose chose 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.379
 designer and at and you can do that too 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.389
 just don't decide where they walk but 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.469
 you should always try to do that 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:50.120
 you do n't trust it in one 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.379
 for example, a corridor that is on the right 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.819
 is mine if you don't trust it 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.590
 it just doesn't go if 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.969
 you do not trust and think okay that 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.980
 theme that runs beside me is really common 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:59.599
 super bad that is already 20 go then 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.400
 also do not walk along with it 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.049
 walk him away from him and just go 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.639
 do your own chronic and I will come 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.319
 just stay on for about 10 minutes 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:08.030
 talk about exactly what you should do 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:09.919
 but you just have to find out for yourself 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.599
 on every collins everyone also on every what 

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:13.310
 also because you have to place the spawn 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.810
 know all this crazy is very simple too 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.430
 tension either at the front or at the 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.900
 on the side or at the back and there 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.790
 they can also only span 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.079
 this on this man it's super easy 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.939
 to remember but you have to 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.379
 just all remember one 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.359
 it should all be just self-exploration 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.889
 Pilot can also upload you every day 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.090
 of that joke that joke that joke 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.889
 but then you have nothing on yourself 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.629
 because you have to see in the game itself 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.819
 to obtain you have to put it yourself in it 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:36.530
 get to see the game just as well 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.509
 to be able to learn so as well as simply 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.189
 my tip of today door getting better 

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:41.419
 in the game just a lot is about 

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.709
 and just going to play a lot but also 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:44.299
 again not too much as I already have a few 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.340
 weeks back on, but he scored 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.019
 as can be seen 29 is with three 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.699
 warm and so I just had warm 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.810
 turned on as a day of well I change 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.459
 my killstreaks again 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.599
 but may this complete well have fun 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.819
 found boys please forgive me 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.560
 from home as the 800 again 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.819
 inches are perhaps the 900,000 may 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.199
 channels I am very happy there 

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:03.609
 thanks for watching guys and see you 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.609
 next time bye bye
