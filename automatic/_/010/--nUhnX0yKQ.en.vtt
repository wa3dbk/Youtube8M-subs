Rooney's<00:02:16.320> absence<00:02:16.740> but<00:02:16.860> he<00:02:16.950> hasn't<00:02:17.280> done<00:02:17.400> it

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
Rooney's absence but he hasn't done it

Rooney's absence but he hasn't done it
it<00:02:17.880> seems<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.270> obviously<00:02:18.750> we've<00:02:18.930> had<00:02:19.050> him

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
it seems like obviously we've had him

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.440 
it seems like obviously we've had him
rare<00:02:19.350> as<00:02:19.710> well<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:19.890> think<00:02:20.190> if<00:02:20.340> we<00:02:21.000> had<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.210> proper

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
rare as well I think if we had a proper

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.970 
rare as well I think if we had a proper
centrum<00:02:21.930> couple<00:02:22.380> of<00:02:22.470> minutes<00:02:22.680> central

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
midfield it behind him would he be

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.450 
midfield it behind him would he be
playing<00:02:24.450> better<00:02:24.600> but<00:02:25.290> nevertheless<00:02:25.620> he<00:02:26.310> has

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
playing better but nevertheless he has

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.370 
playing better but nevertheless he has
to<00:02:26.610> do<00:02:26.700> more<00:02:26.730> he<00:02:27.120> has<00:02:27.210> to<00:02:27.360> be<00:02:27.480> stronger<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:28.080> know
