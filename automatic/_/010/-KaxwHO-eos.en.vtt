00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.650
 fz sula valley would be wrong 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.919
 in the surroundings 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.960
 so as it was quite small 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.779
 and also the children also 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.030
 they were still 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.960
 Without speaking 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.950
 well instead of doing what Joseph did before apostles project 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.340
 motto when saying them 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.340
 I have decided that I am going to go to carrefour and 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.530
 and I'm going to buy some figs 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 so you wait for your moment 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.980
 the woman the bike 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.980
 I come here 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.170
 the quarter hour 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.270
 you had friends because it's still early for the children 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.390
 and yet we are still in time to 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.070
 after the peculiarity of the fig tree 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 and it has two types of fruits 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:56.870
 the brevas 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.450
 mature before 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.950
 in spring 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.250
 while idols do it later 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.740
 in late summer or early autumn 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.490
 that's where the saying goes 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.359
 what is said 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:11.019
 when something happens 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.659
 very infrequently 

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:15.659
 it is said that it goes from figs to figs 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.279
 I'm going to talk about the fig tree because it's a tree 

00:02:19.279 --> 00:02:21.609
 that presents a pollination 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.859
 Very particular 

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:25.209
 d 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.669
 in symbiosis with 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:28.579
 tiny and - p 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.409
 the small view 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.809
 the term gender pays 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:35.319
 Who are in charge 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.689
 pollinate 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.349
 the fig tree flowers 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.529
 first of all 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:43.489
 I want to explain 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.279
 a small 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:48.269
 clarification 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.069
 really the fig tree 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.069
 does not give rise to fruits and is not a place 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.879
 this is botanical terminology 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.879
 What's inside 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.819
 of tiny flowers 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.819
 both female 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.339
 fruit is called the organ 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.029
 of a single flower while competition 

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.309
 what comes from the grouping of numerous 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:23.839
 in this case 

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.839
 the FIG tree 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.609
 are amounts in that type 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.079
 specifically the females 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.609
 when they reach the children 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.359
 still green 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.359
 they introduce their bishop sector inside them 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.719
 to deposit them 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.329
 the eggs hatch 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.089
 they hatch first 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:57.269
 those who are going to wrinkle camachos 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.039
 inside the ibo 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.089
 and that they will have two missions 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:04.479
 in his short life 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.739
 first 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.199
 the females were founded 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.059
 they are still inside the globe 

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:15.669
 And in second place 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:16.769
 punch out 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.150
 small holes 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.439
 the wall of the son 

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:21.309
 so that the females 

00:04:21.309 --> 00:04:23.259
 when he had an option in 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.710
 can go east 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.710
 these females 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.189
 to leave also the same 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:38.580
 conducting 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.240
 the collection 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.349
 of pollen from flowers Moscow 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.009
 and leave it 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.319
 and other trees 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.610
 they will enter 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.270
 secondary 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.270
 new feminine flowers 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.309
 now I want you to notice 

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:03.309
 I hope that the camera allows me 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.159
 in a live in this case a watering hole 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.159
 laureate of the project 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.789
 this is the hole that is com 

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:24.080
 the only way out 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.080
 communication with the outside 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:31.349
 and all these techniques 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:34.909
 the evolution of the tiny flowers 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:36.199
 what was inside 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.199
 of the bureba was not green 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:44.009
 I want you to know 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.490
 when we act 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.499
 we are not eating too 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:51.499
 of tiny 

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:54.499
 wasps 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.779
 but that are totally 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:10.779
 priceless 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.400
 I want to discover you 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.400
 a whole universe 

00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:22.349
 microscopic 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.650
 it escapes the human eye 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.270
 and that many times 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.580
 lets enjoy 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.580
 call like this 

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:35.919
 although said many of you after this 

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:39.240
 I thought twice 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.180
 before eating together
