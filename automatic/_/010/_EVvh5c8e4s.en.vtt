00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.060 
is straighten his back and he's in the
twenty<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.689> twenty-two<00:01:37.020> year<00:01:37.380> old<00:01:37.409> range<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
twenty to twenty-two year old range and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580 
twenty to twenty-two year old range and
so<00:01:38.280> we're<00:01:38.729> talking<00:01:39.079> oftentimes<00:01:40.079> as<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.290> horse

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
so we're talking oftentimes as a horse

here<00:02:01.700> maybe<00:02:02.700> previously<00:02:03.090> talked<00:02:03.719> about<00:02:03.990> a

here maybe previously talked about a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
hip this is a good example of a horse

whose hip is more of a triangle okay as

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.890 
whose hip is more of a triangle okay as
we<00:02:10.860> move<00:02:11.069> through<00:02:11.099> here<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.730> here<00:02:11.790> it's<00:02:12.599> more

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
we move through here and here it's more

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.670 
we move through here and here it's more
triangular

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
triangular

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.890 
triangular
in<00:02:14.069> shape<00:02:14.370> rather<00:02:14.909> than<00:02:15.120> nice<00:02:15.299> and<00:02:15.569> boxy

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
in shape rather than nice and boxy

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.809 
in shape rather than nice and boxy
because<00:02:16.170> he<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.439> relatively<00:02:16.859> short<00:02:17.250> down<00:02:17.549> here

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
because he is relatively short down here

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.770 
because he is relatively short down here
through<00:02:18.030> his<00:02:18.150> stifle<00:02:18.659> right<00:02:20.629> okay

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
through his stifle right okay

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.390 
through his stifle right okay
now<00:02:22.200> we'll<00:02:22.379> go<00:02:22.500> ahead<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.769> watch<00:02:22.950> this<00:02:23.159> horse

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
now we'll go ahead and watch this horse

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.330 
now we'll go ahead and watch this horse
track<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:23.969> move<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.450> show<00:02:24.900> you<00:02:24.959> how

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
track and move and show you how

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.380 
track and move and show you how
sometimes<00:02:26.340> they<00:02:26.549> do<00:02:26.609> break<00:02:26.939> some<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.209> the

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
sometimes they do break some of the

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.000 
sometimes they do break some of the
rules<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:27.719> so<00:02:27.930> don't<00:02:28.170> look<00:02:28.349> at<00:02:28.469> them<00:02:28.650> just<00:02:28.829> by

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
rules and so don't look at them just by

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.979 
rules and so don't look at them just by
standing<00:02:29.459> there<00:02:29.519> alone<00:02:29.730> sometimes<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.780> still

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
standing there alone sometimes you still

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.750 
standing there alone sometimes you still
do<00:02:31.170> need<00:02:31.379> to<00:02:31.500> track<00:02:31.739> them<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.099> move<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.489> move

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
do need to track them to move and move

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.429 
do need to track them to move and move
them<00:02:33.000> to<00:02:33.359> get<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.629> true<00:02:33.810> picture<00:02:34.019> of<00:02:34.290> how

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
them to get the true picture of how

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.259 
them to get the true picture of how
they're<00:02:34.590> going<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.799> perform<00:02:35.250> now<00:02:35.909> we've<00:02:36.090> got

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
they're going to perform now we've got

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.819 
they're going to perform now we've got
this<00:02:36.450> horse<00:02:36.719> out<00:02:36.870> here<00:02:37.079> on<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.260> lunge<00:02:37.469> line<00:02:37.560> to

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829 
this horse out here on the lunge line to

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.349 
this horse out here on the lunge line to
watch<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.250> way<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.400> he<00:02:38.639> does<00:02:38.790> track<00:02:39.120> and

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
watch the way that he does track and

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.599 
watch the way that he does track and
move<00:02:39.540> and<00:02:39.780> I'd<00:02:40.469> like<00:02:40.650> you<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.920> think<00:02:41.189> back<00:02:41.370> and

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
move and I'd like you to think back and

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.819 
move and I'd like you to think back and
reflect<00:02:42.030> of<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.299> of<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.319> three<00:02:43.560> previous

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
reflect of the of the three previous

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:45.679 
reflect of the of the three previous
horses<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.549> you've<00:02:44.730> already<00:02:44.969> seen<00:02:45.450> and

00:02:45.679 --> 00:02:45.689 
horses that you've already seen and

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:47.569 
horses that you've already seen and
again<00:02:46.200> we<00:02:46.349> talked<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> lot<00:02:46.859> about<00:02:47.129> the<00:02:47.340> length

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
again we talked a lot about the length

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.819 
again we talked a lot about the length
of<00:02:47.730> their<00:02:47.879> stride<00:02:48.269> both<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.109> front<00:02:49.439> and<00:02:49.650> behind

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
of their stride both in front and behind

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.979 
of their stride both in front and behind
and<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.489> symmetry<00:02:50.970> of<00:02:51.000> their<00:02:51.239> stride<00:02:51.569> okay

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
and the symmetry of their stride okay

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.349 
and the symmetry of their stride okay
this<00:02:52.739> horse<00:02:53.129> might<00:02:53.489> actually<00:02:53.730> be<00:02:54.060> one<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.299> the

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
this horse might actually be one of the

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.240 
this horse might actually be one of the
best<00:02:54.569> examples<00:02:55.169> that<00:02:55.260> we<00:02:55.439> have<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.919> a<00:02:56.010> horse

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
best examples that we have of a horse

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.470 
best examples that we have of a horse
that<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.519> have<00:02:56.730> that<00:02:56.939> has<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.329> most

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
that we have that has the most

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.140 
that we have that has the most
symmetrical<00:02:58.109> stride<00:02:58.469> he<00:02:59.370> probably<00:02:59.760> in

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
symmetrical stride he probably in

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.209 
symmetrical stride he probably in
contrast<00:03:00.780> to<00:03:00.989> what<00:03:01.109> his<00:03:01.230> conformation<00:03:01.980> tells

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:02.219 
contrast to what his conformation tells

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:04.580 
contrast to what his conformation tells
you<00:03:02.459> maybe<00:03:03.030> does<00:03:03.359> a<00:03:03.389> better<00:03:03.659> job<00:03:03.959> of<00:03:03.989> trotting

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
you maybe does a better job of trotting

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.890 
you maybe does a better job of trotting
out<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.859> his<00:03:04.980> shoulder<00:03:05.400> reaching<00:03:06.359> out<00:03:06.689> with<00:03:06.719> a

have you know usually the conformation

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.350 
have you know usually the conformation
depicts<00:04:55.979> it's<00:04:56.400> harder<00:04:56.760> for<00:04:56.910> them<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.090> lope

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.790 
depicts it's harder for them to lope
harder<00:04:57.780> to<00:04:57.870> keep<00:04:57.990> that<00:04:58.200> hiding<00:04:58.410> underneath

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
harder to keep that hiding underneath

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.010 
harder to keep that hiding underneath
themselves<00:04:59.580> and<00:04:59.729> this<00:05:00.120> horse<00:05:00.389> really<00:05:00.660> doesn't

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
themselves and this horse really doesn't

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.409 
themselves and this horse really doesn't
do<00:05:01.110> that<00:05:01.229> he's<00:05:01.470> got<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.710> lot<00:05:01.919> of<00:05:01.950> stride<00:05:02.419> and

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
do that he's got a lot of stride and

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.570 
do that he's got a lot of stride and
again<00:05:03.840> doesn't<00:05:04.620> really<00:05:04.950> match<00:05:05.220> what<00:05:05.460> you

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
again doesn't really match what you

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.129 
again doesn't really match what you
would<00:05:05.729> think<00:05:05.940> him<00:05:06.180> to<00:05:06.210> do<00:05:06.419> when<00:05:06.570> he's<00:05:06.690> standing

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
would think him to do when he's standing

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.409 
would think him to do when he's standing
there<00:05:07.200> and<00:05:07.410> so<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.710> good<00:05:08.070> example<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.700> you

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
there and so a good example that you

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:10.850 
there and so a good example that you
know<00:05:09.540> you<00:05:09.600> need<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:09.930> look<00:05:10.229> at<00:05:10.410> them<00:05:10.590> on<00:05:10.740> the

know you need to look at them on the
ground<00:05:11.130> but<00:05:11.310> then<00:05:11.490> you<00:05:11.639> need<00:05:11.850> to<00:05:11.970> watch<00:05:12.150> them

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419

track<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:12.870> move<00:05:13.020> and<00:05:13.229> then<00:05:13.380> even<00:05:13.620> more

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.560 
guess the ultimate the decision for you
to<00:05:39.900> make<00:05:40.110> is<00:05:40.560> whether<00:05:41.340> or<00:05:41.520> not<00:05:41.580> a<00:05:41.700> horse<00:05:42.030> meets

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
to make is whether or not a horse meets

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.400 
to make is whether or not a horse meets

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.099 
prime example where if you look at him

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:54.980 
prime example where if you look at him
conformational<00:05:53.880> e<00:05:53.970> he's<00:05:54.150> probably<00:05:54.599> not<00:05:54.780> going

and one final note for you to certainly

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.290 
and one final note for you to certainly
keep<00:06:04.560> in<00:06:04.740> mind<00:06:04.979> when<00:06:05.220> you<00:06:05.310> evaluate<00:06:05.580> horse<00:06:06.090> is

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
keep in mind when you evaluate horse is

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.200 
keep in mind when you evaluate horse is
their<00:06:06.840> attitude<00:06:07.340> we've<00:06:08.340> got<00:06:08.550> a<00:06:08.580> horse<00:06:08.910> here

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
their attitude we've got a horse here

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.570 
their attitude we've got a horse here
that<00:06:09.389> is<00:06:09.510> obviously<00:06:09.990> very<00:06:10.320> willing<00:06:11.220> to<00:06:11.400> do

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
that is obviously very willing to do

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.060 
that is obviously very willing to do
what<00:06:11.820> we<00:06:11.940> ask<00:06:11.970> of<00:06:12.450> him<00:06:12.660> makes<00:06:13.440> him<00:06:13.530> a<00:06:13.710> very

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
what we ask of him makes him a very

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.029 
what we ask of him makes him a very
enjoyable<00:06:14.430> horse<00:06:14.910> to<00:06:15.090> be<00:06:15.240> around<00:06:15.800> we've<00:06:16.800> got

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
enjoyable horse to be around we've got

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:18.020 
enjoyable horse to be around we've got
some<00:06:17.370> other<00:06:17.490> end<00:06:17.729> of<00:06:17.849> it

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
some other end of it

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.180 
some other end of it
Jools<00:06:18.210> that<00:06:19.110> maybe<00:06:19.290> make<00:06:19.590> you<00:06:19.740> work<00:06:19.950> a<00:06:20.070> little

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
Jools that maybe make you work a little

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.730 
Jools that maybe make you work a little
bit<00:06:20.400> harder<00:06:20.460> for<00:06:21.300> their<00:06:21.450> abilities<00:06:21.930> so<00:06:22.530> they

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
bit harder for their abilities so they

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.980 
bit harder for their abilities so they
may<00:06:22.920> be<00:06:22.980> a<00:06:23.100> horse<00:06:23.400> that<00:06:23.610> would<00:06:23.730> appear<00:06:24.240> to<00:06:24.600> be

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:24.990 
may be a horse that would appear to be

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.340 
may be a horse that would appear to be
an<00:06:25.410> excellent<00:06:26.370> prospect<00:06:27.060> but<00:06:27.780> once<00:06:27.990> you<00:06:28.140> start

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
an excellent prospect but once you start

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.990 
an excellent prospect but once you start
to<00:06:28.440> work<00:06:28.680> with<00:06:28.710> them<00:06:29.010> their<00:06:29.190> attitude<00:06:29.640> proves

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
to work with them their attitude proves

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.240 
to work with them their attitude proves
otherwise<00:06:30.180> and<00:06:30.780> so<00:06:30.810> while<00:06:31.590> we<00:06:31.740> can<00:06:31.890> certainly

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
otherwise and so while we can certainly

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.700 
otherwise and so while we can certainly
talk<00:06:32.490> about<00:06:32.870> everything<00:06:33.870> that<00:06:34.050> we<00:06:34.260> stand<00:06:34.320> here

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
talk about everything that we stand here

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.530 
talk about everything that we stand here
and<00:06:34.770> look<00:06:34.920> about<00:06:35.190> look<00:06:35.430> at<00:06:35.610> ultimately<00:06:36.390> you

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
and look about look at ultimately you

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.480 
and look about look at ultimately you
have<00:06:36.690> to<00:06:36.840> work<00:06:37.020> with<00:06:37.200> that<00:06:37.350> horse<00:06:37.590> to<00:06:38.160> be<00:06:38.280> able

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
have to work with that horse to be able
