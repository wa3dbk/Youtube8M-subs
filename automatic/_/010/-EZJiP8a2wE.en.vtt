00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.560
 yes I think it is equal if the 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:38.060
 dragon stadium seats there the nature then 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.090
 they were - and I 'm sorry I saw them 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.160
 but thanks to the problem 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.650
 the fc basel is working like 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.900
 whatever the message is the message 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.270
 sent to st -jakob-park 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.260
 because the first half is not 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.570
 really champions league worthy of the 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.070
 loss hits the fc basel 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.930
 itself unnecessarily in distress 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.100
 but at the end of this game remains 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.630
 just a conclusion to the round-start the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.460
 is important to place these days 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.490
 have very strong are very weak 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.680
 played 2000 souls very good has so 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.350
 made many chances and then yes in the 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.260
 last minute 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.909
 devastating and come as short as possible 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.970
 in the end it is good for the held one 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.890
 penalty the gate of david degen which 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.450
 the fc basel in the playoffs of the 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.930
 champions league brings 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.210
 in this final round, the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.219
 experiences from the games against molde 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.869
 be brought in with 

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:42.290
 Now I think the game is coming 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.759
 take with you and learn the next 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.140
 gates and the first round 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:51.170
 the differently announced few sovereign 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.590
 but and to the sovereign down to the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.859
 10 o'clock again the point or otherwise 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.549
 that said, everything's fine 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:04.430
 one of joy and another of suffering so close 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.270
 everything is together so brutal 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.270
 be football
