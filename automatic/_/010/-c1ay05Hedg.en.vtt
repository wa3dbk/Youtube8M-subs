looks so the body looks pretty decent

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.750 
looks so the body looks pretty decent
but<00:00:41.260> you're<00:00:42.260> trying<00:00:42.590> to<00:00:42.710> pretty<00:00:42.920> much<00:00:43.070> bait

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
but you're trying to pretty much bait

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.560 
but you're trying to pretty much bait
people<00:00:44.270> to<00:00:44.360> come<00:00:44.510> back<00:00:44.720> to<00:00:44.870> a<00:00:44.900> WoW<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:46.480> part<00:00:47.480> of

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:47.570 
people to come back to a WoW and part of

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.650 
people to come back to a WoW and part of
it<00:00:47.720> is<00:00:47.870> giving<00:00:48.379> them<00:00:48.559> amount<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:49.820> okay<00:00:50.420> that's

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
it is giving them amount so okay that's

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.010 
it is giving them amount so okay that's
a<00:00:51.350> tall<00:00:51.590> order<00:00:52.010> for<00:00:52.309> some<00:00:52.640> of<00:00:52.760> us<00:00:52.900> for<00:00:53.900> me

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
a tall order for some of us for me

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.960 
a tall order for some of us for me
personally<00:00:54.230> I<00:00:54.860> think<00:00:55.190> the<00:00:55.489> amount<00:00:55.640> could<00:00:55.820> look

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
personally I think the amount could look

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.580 
personally I think the amount could look
a<00:00:56.059> lot<00:00:56.180> better<00:00:56.360> and<00:00:56.750> I<00:00:56.870> know<00:00:56.930> blizzard<00:00:57.440> could

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
a lot better and I know blizzard could

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.210 
a lot better and I know blizzard could
do<00:00:57.739> it<00:00:57.890> the<00:00:58.640> wings<00:00:58.879> to<00:00:59.360> come<00:00:59.540> out<00:01:00.190> instead<00:01:01.190> of

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
do it the wings to come out instead of

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.360 
do it the wings to come out instead of
having<00:01:01.430> one<00:01:01.610> full<00:01:02.269> like<00:01:02.600> texture<00:01:03.290> for<00:01:03.920> several

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
having one full like texture for several

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.330 
having one full like texture for several
different<00:01:05.020> the<00:01:06.020> white<00:01:06.350> lines<00:01:06.710> or<00:01:07.070> whatever

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
different the white lines or whatever

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.760 
different the white lines or whatever
the<00:01:07.520> hell<00:01:07.700> they<00:01:08.600> could<00:01:08.659> actually<00:01:08.930> separate

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
the hell they could actually separate

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.010 
the hell they could actually separate
each<00:01:10.040> of<00:01:10.340> those<00:01:10.430> white<00:01:10.760> lines<00:01:10.790> with<00:01:11.479> it's<00:01:11.720> like

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
each of those white lines with it's like

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.680 
each of those white lines with it's like
kind<00:01:12.409> of<00:01:12.470> graying<00:01:12.860> out<00:01:13.100> area<00:01:13.670> they<00:01:14.659> could

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
kind of graying out area they could

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.630 
kind of graying out area they could
separate<00:01:15.650> he<00:01:15.800> should<00:01:15.979> I<00:01:16.010> make<00:01:16.250> its<00:01:16.490> own

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
separate he should I make its own

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.340 
separate he should I make its own
texture<00:01:17.120> so<00:01:17.570> they<00:01:17.750> could<00:01:17.870> all<00:01:17.960> kind<00:01:18.140> of<00:01:18.260> like

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
texture so they could all kind of like

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.440 
texture so they could all kind of like
flow<00:01:18.650> around<00:01:18.940> individually<00:01:19.940> instead<00:01:20.090> of<00:01:20.330> all

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
flow around individually instead of all

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.200 
flow around individually instead of all
doing<00:01:20.630> this<00:01:20.900> it'd<00:01:21.560> be<00:01:21.740> like<00:01:21.860> this

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.770 

lots<00:01:24.810> more<00:01:25.549> could<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.760> lot<00:01:26.970> more<00:01:27.030> going<00:01:27.450> into

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
lots more could be a lot more going into

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.810 
lots more could be a lot more going into
that<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.200> would<00:01:28.320> look<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.590> lot<00:01:28.619> more

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
that and it would look a lot more

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.660 
that and it would look a lot more
impressive<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:31.140> mean<00:01:31.740> granted<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.340> still

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
impressive I mean granted this is still

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.260 
impressive I mean granted this is still
beta<00:01:32.909> our<00:01:33.590> PTR<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.800> so<00:01:35.190> I<00:01:35.430> mean<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.820> could

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
beta our PTR are so I mean this could

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.820 
beta our PTR are so I mean this could
still<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:37.350> something<00:01:37.830> but<00:01:38.610> i'm<00:01:38.880> i'm<00:01:39.770> going<00:01:40.770> to

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
still do something but i'm i'm going to

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.350 
still do something but i'm i'm going to
guess<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.040> they<00:01:41.340> probably<00:01:41.610> won't<00:01:41.909> change<00:01:42.180> it

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
guess that they probably won't change it

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.649 
guess that they probably won't change it
much<00:01:42.600> from<00:01:42.869> where<00:01:43.050> it<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:44.300> but<00:01:45.300> like<00:01:45.479> i<00:01:45.630> said

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
much from where it is but like i said

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.389 
much from where it is but like i said
the<00:01:46.050> body<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.590> mount<00:01:46.800> looks<00:01:47.130> pretty

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
the body of the mount looks pretty

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.320 
the body of the mount looks pretty
decent<00:01:47.640> um<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.190> going<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.399> be<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.550> sparkle

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330
