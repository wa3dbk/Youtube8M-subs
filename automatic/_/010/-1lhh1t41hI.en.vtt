00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.440
 hello to all of you it's steven 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.570
 to introduce you to a new tweak 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.070
 cydia called useful fing and who 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.750
 will allow you to add and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.100
 change a whole bunch of things about 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.720
 your device like for example 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.880
 disable the name of the icons 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.439
 so if we go away probably springboard 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.730
 we can see that there is no name anymore 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.010
 below the application icons 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.140
 even inside the folders we see 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.939
 that there is nothing left 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.619
 interest you activate this option or 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.090
 always in the settings you can 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.020
 modify the text found at 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.820
 inside the bar of 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.140
 unlock on the lockscreen when 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.270
 the device is locked me you see 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.280
 that his marks and steven have marked this 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.050
 which you prefer and then we see 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.120
 we can also customize the plug 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.829
 so screenshots screenshots 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.960
 we can customize the text that will be 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.030
 displayed is the color of the screenshot 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.100
 that's what gives it a color 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.329
 random and in the pop up we see that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.489
 it is the text I have 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.020
 learned here we continue in the settings 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.969
 this time with options for 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.620
 customize the volume indicator 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.329
 so when you increase or you 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.110
 decrease the volume you see cry if we 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.210
 has a little text 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.580
 so we can also customize it 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.439
 continues and we see that we have here a lot 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.000
 of fields that can be filled it will be 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.920
 messages that will appear after 1 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.420
 res pring or a reboot of the device 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.369
 so we can customize all that I 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.930
 will show you after what it gives 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.759
 also has custom commands 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.619
 that we can enter the spotlight so 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.930
 to compose a new mail a new 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.119
 message on appeal a res preen a reboot 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.500
 or an extinction of the device these 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.210
 orders again you can 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.340
 customize them I left them 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.320
 basic so i'm going to type a unio message 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.290
 to compose a new message you 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.119
 see what it's doing here I support 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.220
 on search lower right and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.479
 the application messages get started we go 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.270
 land on a composition window 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.159
 fast new sms 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.840
 that's how it works and finally we 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.280
 has one last option here that concerns 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.180
 multitasking but I'll admit that 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.770
 it's not at all what it's 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.240
 since you see that the text is 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.630
 cut so it's a little badly done 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.700
 pity 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.530
 so we're done with the 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.820
 customizable options then we have 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.649
 a list of all the features 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.020
 that the developer has also added 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.270
 for example, we see that the limit of 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.220
 imposed pages by apple was removed on 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.020
 also sees that there will be no more badges 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.170
 on the folders more page points 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.150
 and that there will not be 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.459
 behind the springboard icons you 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.630
 see how it was earlier I 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.430
 you told me that the color of the screen 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.959
 shots was random a color put 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.569
 at random and well we find this 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.580
 feature that added here suite we 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.650
 to the kiosk icon that has been removed 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.330
 since nobody really uses it we have 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.280
 also the application name that will be 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.330
 placed on top but I saw the gema 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.640
 what's the name I could not you 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.440
 show how it's finally done we have a 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.030
 reflection added to the icons of the 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.860
 springboard and menus that are 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.330
 displayable via an activating gesture that 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.069
 you designate in the settings so 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.540
 you select useful kings with 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.910
 your active gesture wrongly and then 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.590
 you run it when I slide to the 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.450
 right on the status bar this is it 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.280
 menu that appears with the possibility of 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.989
 to make a reboot to stage mode 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.000
 the device to make 1 res price or so 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.769
 to turn it off and with this second menu 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.900
 I can send an email sent to like 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.880
 these games make you a call so the 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.470
 tweak is called useful fing but that 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.360
 it's really the only function that's 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.160
 interesting the rest is not really 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.950
 useful I for example there show you 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.510
 how to make a res pring with this menu 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.310
 when it is finished we have this new 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.959
 menu that appears as I had it 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.670
 configured in the settings with the 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.320
 opportunity to do a reboot or so 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.790
 to put the device in these words hole 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.190
 cancel to unlock the device 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.170
 then you see that there is a lot of 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.489
 functions are not all useful but 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.230
 less certain can still you 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.600
 interest this tweak it's called so 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.670
