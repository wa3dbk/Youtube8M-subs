00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.060 

interactive<00:00:22.960> gesture<00:00:23.470> and<00:00:23.680> giving<00:00:23.950> us

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:24.070 
interactive gesture and giving us

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.030 
interactive gesture and giving us
interactive<00:00:24.640> projection<00:00:25.470> so<00:00:26.470> if<00:00:26.560> I<00:00:26.650> put<00:00:26.830> down

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:27.040 
interactive projection so if I put down

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
behavior like fire-breathing dragons we

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.300 
behavior like fire-breathing dragons we
