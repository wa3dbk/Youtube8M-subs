 the women with the noble dresses

 run this in the memory of our friends 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.870

 the band was thus stigmatized was 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.660
 persecution of a claim that it 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.000
 cover some clandestine activity 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.250
 when clandestine in the dictatorship and we 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.140
 we leave in exclusive with a track that 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.050
 today accompanies it is a symbol of 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.180
 band and says that the legitimate because well this 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.910
 expression means absolutely nothing 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.979

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.020
 Do you want with your songs more? 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.180
 emblematic of ipanema city band 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.910
 wonderful is an identification with the 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.240
 strong city that opens and closes our 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.240
 children 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.430
 and the gifted pixinguinha and have a 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.700
 very special reason on February 17 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.680
 1973 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.450
 the ipanema band is in the center of 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.180
 general osorio square when we 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.190
 we received a provincial information from a 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.700
 boy came running to you there 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.100
 Peace saying that distinguished him was 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.540
 deceased at that time within the 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.820
 Our Lady of Peace church when he 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.240
 baptized a child when we learned 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.220
 so firmly that he was there not 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.340
 was in that moment 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.900
 so it's also almost unanimous, says 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.080
 pay homage to pixinguinha 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.600
 the band began to play in 11 that all 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.130
 world that is around the anthropologist 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.760
 this story of ozu tennis that already has 42 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.080
 years 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:47.720
 the band of ipanema holds a title that 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.460
 we treasure with care 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.220
 it was declared a cultural heritage 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.040
 Rio made the first well

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.610
 Toll registration number 10 001 is fair 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.709
 say it is legitimate that the ratio of 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.209
 band with the city is the same as the 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.940
 city ​​has with the band 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.200
 relationship to a relationship and showed 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.950
 unavailable
