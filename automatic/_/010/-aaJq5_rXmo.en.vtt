00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.720 

so<00:00:03.240> my<00:00:03.389> process<00:00:03.659> is<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.440> I<00:00:04.500> use<00:00:04.859> birch

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
so my process is that I use birch

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.669 
so my process is that I use birch
plywood<00:00:06.180> and<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:07.560> traced<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.250> drawing<00:00:08.519> on<00:00:08.910> to

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
plywood and I traced the drawing on to

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.580 
plywood and I traced the drawing on to
the<00:00:10.679> block<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.660> this<00:00:12.660> block<00:00:12.719> hasn't<00:00:13.440> been

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
the block and this block hasn't been

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.350 
the block and this block hasn't been
carved<00:00:13.980> yet<00:00:14.219> but<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.549> can<00:00:14.700> see<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.059> drawing

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
carved yet but you can see the drawing

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.349 
carved yet but you can see the drawing
is<00:00:15.710> outlined<00:00:16.710> on<00:00:16.920> here<00:00:17.369> with<00:00:17.789> registration

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
is outlined on here with registration

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.260 
is outlined on here with registration
marked<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.470> can<00:00:19.680> match<00:00:19.890> my<00:00:20.189> paper<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
marked so that I can match my paper and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.140 
marked so that I can match my paper and
then<00:00:21.779> I'll<00:00:21.930> carve<00:00:22.230> away<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.650> places<00:00:23.640> that

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
then I'll carve away the places that

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.710 
then I'll carve away the places that
stay<00:00:25.050> below<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.980> surface<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.730> leave<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
stay below the surface and leave the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
stay below the surface and leave the
high<00:00:28.199> parts<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.150> the<00:00:30.150> image<00:00:30.710> so<00:00:31.710> I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
high parts of the the image so I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.090 
high parts of the the image so I
prepared<00:00:32.630> two<00:00:33.630> blocks<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.620> that<00:00:34.770> was<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
prepared two blocks and that was the

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.610 
prepared two blocks and that was the
third<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:35.760> didn't<00:00:36.149> end<00:00:36.360> up<00:00:36.480> using<00:00:36.620> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
third one that I didn't end up using the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.250 
third one that I didn't end up using the
two<00:00:37.800> blocks<00:00:38.100> are<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:39.239> positive<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
two blocks are like a positive and the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.150 
two blocks are like a positive and the
negative<00:00:40.730> it's<00:00:41.730> low<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:42.649> because<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.890> high

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
negative it's low here because it's high

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.920 
negative it's low here because it's high
here<00:00:44.870> this<00:00:45.870> area<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.460> negative<00:00:47.670> space<00:00:48.090> so

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
here this area is the negative space so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
here this area is the negative space so
I<00:00:48.960> just<00:00:49.320> carved<00:00:49.680> ditches<00:00:50.100> around<00:00:50.430> these

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
I just carved ditches around these

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.090 
I just carved ditches around these
shapes<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.300> choose<00:00:51.809> not<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.230> put<00:00:52.649> ink<00:00:52.920> on

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
shapes and I choose not to put ink on

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.279 
shapes and I choose not to put ink on
these<00:00:53.370> background<00:00:53.969> because<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:54.840> background

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
these background because the background

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.110 
these background because the background
is<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.800> block<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.460> that's<00:00:56.910> where<00:00:57.090> I

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
is on this block and that's where I

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.680 
is on this block and that's where I
carved<00:00:57.629> all<00:00:57.809> this<00:00:58.079> details<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.449> the<00:01:00.449> kind<00:01:00.660> of

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
carved all this details and the kind of

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.950 
carved all this details and the kind of
patterns<00:01:01.199> of<00:01:01.410> flow<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.600> shows<00:01:03.600> up<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
patterns of flow that shows up in the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.620 
patterns of flow that shows up in the
background<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.799> print

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
background of this print

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.429 
background of this print
so<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:07.020> cup<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.409> wood<00:01:07.590> block<00:01:09.260> with<00:01:10.260> my

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
so I a cup the wood block with my

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.440 
so I a cup the wood block with my
oil-based<00:01:11.010> colors<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.820> then<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.150> put<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
oil-based colors and then I put the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.760 
oil-based colors and then I put the
paper<00:01:12.659> onto<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.260> block<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:15.140> match<00:01:16.140> up<00:01:16.409> all<00:01:16.590> my

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
paper onto the block and match up all my

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.270 
paper onto the block and match up all my
registration<00:01:17.610> marks<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.740> then<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> gets<00:01:19.979> run

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
registration marks and then it gets run

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.280 
registration marks and then it gets run
through<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> printing<00:01:21.000> press<00:01:21.290> which

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
through the printing press which

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.800 
through the printing press which
transfers<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> pond<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.880> block<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
transfers to a pond to the block and

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.530 
transfers to a pond to the block and
then<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.979> can<00:01:27.979> reveal<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.280> printing<00:01:30.180> when<00:01:30.509> I

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
then I can reveal the printing when I

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.600 
then I can reveal the printing when I
pull<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> prints<00:01:31.350> back<00:01:31.590> which<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.100> always<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
pull the prints back which is always the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.999 
pull the prints back which is always the
magic<00:01:33.000> moment<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.780> print<00:01:34.020> maker<00:01:34.229> what

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
magic moment for the print maker what

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.670 
magic moment for the print maker what
has<00:01:35.130> happened<00:01:35.579> some<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.270> colors<00:01:36.750> work<00:01:37.110> how

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
has happened some of the colors work how

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.109 
has happened some of the colors work how
is<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:38.119> Equality<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.500> consistent<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.549> have

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
is the Equality is it consistent I have

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.880 
is the Equality is it consistent I have
all<00:01:42.270> these<00:01:42.420> kinds<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.869> questions<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.530> I'm

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
all these kinds of questions that I'm

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950 
all these kinds of questions that I'm
looking<00:01:44.159> at<00:01:44.340> for<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> while<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:45.270> printing<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
looking at for a while I'm printing and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.469 
looking at for a while I'm printing and
then<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.890> main<00:01:47.070> one<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.490> are<00:01:47.729> those<00:01:48.000> colors

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
then the main one is are those colors

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780 
then the main one is are those colors
interesting<00:01:49.260> does<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.590> look<00:01:49.800> like<00:01:50.190> something

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
interesting does it look like something

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.899 
interesting does it look like something
that<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.120> want<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.479> happen<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.790> be

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that I want to happen and that can be

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.780 
that I want to happen and that can be
real<00:01:54.090> exciting<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.990> how<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.520> image<00:01:56.520> then

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
real exciting to see how this image then

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.270 
real exciting to see how this image then
develops
