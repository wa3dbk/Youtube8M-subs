 eighty reais an investment that can 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.110
 be better used if some 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.610
 taken into account is the 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.680
 especially if you take a look at the 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.740
 if it's not getting dry 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.079
 and from there she had been feeling so much 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.659
 so well whiting is ideal now 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.180

 money does not fall the leaf then he 50 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.600

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.989
 only in November and December 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.380
 this year the trend is I think okay 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.520
 plus gold then 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.340

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.850
 to complete the decoration the colors 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.430
 typical christmas green and red one 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.610
 of the most sought after flowers is the 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.200
 parrot a box with six vases leaves 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.990
 for 30 reais 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.550
 would be a month more for years than 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.440
 it would be the 13th month for us it increases 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.910
 our forecast are working to 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.060

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.910
 of search by color of plant data 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.910

 beautiful and the most joyful spirit ready 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.900
 To celebrate Christmas I think the most 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.900
 important to decorate the house is first 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:27.040
 to create a Christmas spirit, not a 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:29.620
 Yummy atmosphere and also the most 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.310
 important christmas is to prepare the arrival 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.360
 of Christ does not celebrate the arrival of 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.360
 christ the resurrection
