00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.610
 It is a major cut 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.610
 How to attach a group 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.480
 There are various ways though 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:32.290
 Straight to winter Straight to winter 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:36.640
 But is variety there'm also how to hold the phone 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:39.180
 Such a feeling this time- 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.650
 Yes 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.650
 Fall into the hair 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.980
 Length 4 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.660

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.489
 Upper Nagasan 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.480
 About this 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.600
 Want to 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.079
 Time is 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.769
 Hisayama at this angle 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.769
 I'm off, though 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.830
 It is way to put in from the bottom a little more 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.520
 Chiryu length 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.090
 The assumed 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.320
 Seen from below 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.320
 Taken off to a low of 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.420
 Is it working ? 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.260
 not really 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.549
 When you are in a vertical 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.549
 Well healed 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.300
 So much this way because there is 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.040
 Medium to long stroke day 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.780
 Tell 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.260
 There is not so much lately though 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:01.450
 I think when you put it so depending on the left and right 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.450
 This is the off-stroke ne 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:16.780
 Major cut class is the explanation column of this video 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.780
 In the end I will paste everything 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.770
 If good from there 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.770
 Please take a look 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.390

 It Is You Yari put in from the top 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.959
 In the same way 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.959
 Say and want to give this side leader 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.349
 Where I thought 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.370
 Head shape 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.930
 According to 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.060
 Pull straight out 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.060
 From the length I was fated 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.330
 Seen from above 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.240
 Dog from rice 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.240
 If you are good 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.020
 The angle itself is now 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.300
 Gradation of 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:17.370
 I'm cutting 某 gradation 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.370
 As you can see the layer 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.890
 How to do it from below 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.890
 Compared to 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.930
 A little hair movement 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.990
 It will be easier to get out 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.860
 It becomes easy to move 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.000
 Though it becomes easy to feather depending on the front 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.370
 Hmm 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.360
 this 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.950
 The visible part under 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.950
 So the problem is not 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.970
 I 'm working alone 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.680
 Nature 6 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.550
 When I do not know 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.970
 Comments are to 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.970
 various 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.840
 Table 2 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.859
 If you put a stroke from above 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.340
 A little on the front 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.760
 Because tends to them feeling 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.990
 Masu only hair of surface 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.990
 I wish I could 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.450
 If you put it in 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.190
 By putting from below 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:46.800
 Because it becomes easy to enter the house 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.440
 Heal 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.190
 In the case of restraint to contain 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.190
 Insert from below 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.300
 Do you want that to I want to move wow 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.750
 Coming out from above 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.830
 Long stroke 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.830
 I think it's okay 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.919
 Down like this 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.919
 I will put on 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.000
