00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:07.130
 hi friends from youtube I'm going to teach you 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.720
 what is the android point 4.2 team 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.540
 experience brings the sony 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.520
 on the lock screen we see that 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.040
 as usual the only thing that changes is the 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.630
 Camera widget and we use it 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.020
 upwards and then we access what 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.020
 is the camera 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.199
 the main screen we noticed that the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.990
 Notification bar is transparent 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.489
 and now it's divided into notifications of 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.629
 the applications and quick adjustments 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.629
 since they can be edited 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.110
 what is the screen like this when the 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.010
 same sector 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.010
 when sliding 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.699
 the wallpaper 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.149
 we note that our animated expire 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.280
 person 1 changing color is a 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.969
 time to move it 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.840
 only that if it's a bit slow for 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.840
 that changes color 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.990
 what are the themes 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:21.960
 you can see that here already gives us an option 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.950
 to leave an animal wallpaper 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.950
 one static 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.039
 it's basically the same as 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.370
 the android 4.3 the player follows 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.110
 same the same widgets 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.420
 only that there is also 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.670
 applications that did not appear in the 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.860
 provider in version 4.3 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.470
 in the menu the same as the options 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.720
 to uninstall and accommodate 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.170
 put in order the order that buses 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.170
 I took no 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.550
 adjustments we see for example from 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:57.550
 personalization 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.840
 it's more the background everything that came from 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.700
 android 4.3 good only that here already 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.990
 We can use notifications and 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.990
 the bar and status icons 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.180
 in what is the storage still 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.700
 it still gives us the option to transfer 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.709
 data to the sd card 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.599
 and it is an advantage because not all 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.599
 the teams have this 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.190
 here we see that it is the version 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.190
 4.4 point 2 of android 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.510
 the kat kit 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.459
 and then you can leave in this way 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.939
 we only slip up 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.939
 let's go back 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.300
 and this the blocking screen 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.130
 they incorporated again what is the 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.099
 screen capture as this is a 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.780
 option for people who did not know that 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.880
 download applications only for 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.860
 take screenshots 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.360
 only by leaving pressed what is 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.850
 the off key 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.370
 and it gives us the option or they can also 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.870
 take it with the lock button and 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.870
 volume down at the same time 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.930
 Well, leave your comments 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.890
 did not change much the android version 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.280
 but then we see that it is more fluid is more 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.280
 Quick 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.270
 oh I forgot what are the 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:44.180
 images 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.180
 for example already gives the direct option of 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:50.480
 where can we establish how 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.799
 we can immediately add what 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.329
 it's lock screen wallpaper 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:58.680
 option only occurred in adjustments 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.220
 previous versions of android 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.140
 download it is very good 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.700
 they will notice that they are more the ear is more 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.700
 fast lasts longer the battery 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.390
 good until light
