00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
can't even be sufficient on themselves

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.310 
can't even be sufficient on themselves
self-sufficient<00:01:50.600> they<00:01:50.690> have<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:50.900> ask<00:01:51.049> other

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
self-sufficient they have to ask other

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.160 
self-sufficient they have to ask other
people<00:01:51.650> and<00:01:51.979> just<00:01:52.640> be<00:01:52.850> sheep<00:01:53.180> and<00:01:53.450> follow<00:01:53.960> what

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
people and just be sheep and follow what

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.530 
people and just be sheep and follow what
they<00:01:54.290> do<00:01:54.350> like<00:01:54.740> make<00:01:55.610> your<00:01:55.760> own<00:01:55.880> settings<00:01:56.299> yeah

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
they do like make your own settings yeah

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.120 
they do like make your own settings yeah
base<00:01:56.870> it<00:01:57.049> off<00:01:57.110> of<00:01:57.170> someone<00:01:57.560> else's<00:01:57.590> settings

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
base it off of someone else's settings

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.649 
base it off of someone else's settings
that's<00:01:58.310> what<00:01:58.430> I<00:01:58.460> did<00:01:58.700> I<00:01:58.880> got<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> setup<00:01:59.510> from

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
that's what I did I got a setup from

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.090 
that's what I did I got a setup from
someone<00:02:00.020> else<00:02:00.170> who<00:02:00.440> just<00:02:00.470> gave<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:01.010> to<00:02:01.040> you

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
someone else who just gave it to you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.430 
someone else who just gave it to you
adding<00:02:01.369> asking<00:02:01.820> for<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.330> then<00:02:03.020> there<00:02:03.350> were

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
adding asking for it and then there were

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.630 
adding asking for it and then there were
a<00:02:03.470> few<00:02:03.680> things<00:02:03.830> that<00:02:04.040> I<00:02:04.070> didn't<00:02:04.310> like<00:02:04.400> so<00:02:04.610> I

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
a few things that I didn't like so I

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.240 
a few things that I didn't like so I
adjusted<00:02:05.030> it<00:02:05.180> myself<00:02:05.570> so<00:02:05.840> look<00:02:06.619> through<00:02:06.860> here

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
adjusted it myself so look through here

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.899 
adjusted it myself so look through here
and<00:02:07.720> just<00:02:08.720> use<00:02:08.840> some<00:02:09.560> common<00:02:09.890> sense<00:02:10.129> i<00:02:10.489> mean<00:02:10.519> if

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
and just use some common sense i mean if

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.280 
and just use some common sense i mean if
you're<00:02:11.060> looking<00:02:11.329> at<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.540> bike<00:02:11.689> setup<00:02:11.989> and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
you're looking at the bike setup and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.380 
you're looking at the bike setup and
it's<00:02:12.409> like

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
it's like

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.990 
it's like
see<00:02:13.510> what<00:02:13.780> am<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:13.960> wanting<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.380> look<00:02:14.500> at<00:02:15.000> the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
see what am I wanting to look at the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.949 
see what am I wanting to look at the
fork<00:02:16.330> oil<00:02:16.480> level<00:02:17.260> um<00:02:17.500> I<00:02:18.069> assume<00:02:19.030> that<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.750> more

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
fork oil level um I assume that the more

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.440 
fork oil level um I assume that the more
oil<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.440> have<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:21.130> more<00:02:21.940> bottoming

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
oil you have the more bottoming

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.880 
oil you have the more bottoming
resistance<00:02:23.020> you're<00:02:23.110> going<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.319> have<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.800> it's

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
resistance you're going to have and it's

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.770 
resistance you're going to have and it's
going<00:02:24.010> to<00:02:24.069> be<00:02:24.160> a<00:02:24.190> stiffer<00:02:24.640> front<00:02:25.180> fork<00:02:25.450> I<00:02:25.630> mean

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
going to be a stiffer front fork I mean

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.870 
going to be a stiffer front fork I mean
maybe<00:02:26.440> not<00:02:26.680> I'm<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.040> could<00:02:27.250> be<00:02:27.340> wrong<00:02:27.520> but

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
maybe not I'm that could be wrong but

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.180 
maybe not I'm that could be wrong but
just<00:02:28.480> test<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.870> go<00:02:29.080> all<00:02:29.350> the<00:02:29.590> way<00:02:29.620> up<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.100> then

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
just test it go all the way up and then

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.949 
just test it go all the way up and then
all<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.760> way<00:02:30.790> back<00:02:30.880> down<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.450> just<00:02:31.570> ride<00:02:31.810> with

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
all the way back down and just ride with

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.810 
all the way back down and just ride with
it<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.290> see<00:02:32.440> what<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:32.709> see<00:02:33.100> how<00:02:33.250> it<00:02:33.459> works

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
it and see what it's see how it works

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.240 
it and see what it's see how it works
for<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.209> what<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.600> like<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:35.290> don't<00:02:36.160> know<00:02:36.220> I

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
for you and what you like I don't know I

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.300 
for you and what you like I don't know I
just<00:02:36.400> think<00:02:36.640> that<00:02:37.830> everyone<00:02:38.830> makes<00:02:38.980> too<00:02:39.160> big

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
just think that everyone makes too big

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.830 
just think that everyone makes too big
of<00:02:39.430> a<00:02:39.489> deal<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.150> they<00:02:40.239> do<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.480> MX

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
of a deal of it and they do it on MX

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.740 
of a deal of it and they do it on MX
