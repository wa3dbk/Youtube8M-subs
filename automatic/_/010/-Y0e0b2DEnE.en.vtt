00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.179 
tube the tube coming up out of the fork
in<00:00:30.090> order<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> bike<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.529> fit<00:00:31.769> into<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
in order for the bike to fit into the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.139 
in order for the bike to fit into the
case<00:00:33.559> just<00:00:34.559> holding<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.219> stem<00:00:37.520> leaves<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:38.969> of

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
case just holding the stem leaves all of

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.049 
case just holding the stem leaves all of
this<00:00:39.329> up<00:00:40.110> top<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.800> won't<00:00:41.250> fit<00:00:41.520> into<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> case

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
this up top that won't fit into the case

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.880 
this up top that won't fit into the case
so<00:00:42.390> if<00:00:42.870> you<00:00:42.989> need<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.230> get<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.440> into<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.680> case

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
so if you need to get this into the case

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.010 
so if you need to get this into the case
the<00:00:44.160> first<00:00:44.309> step<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.850> fold<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.780> stem<00:00:45.989> just

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
the first step is to fold the stem just

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.850 
the first step is to fold the stem just
like<00:00:46.379> we've<00:00:46.559> seen<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:48.469> six<00:00:49.469> millimeter

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
like we've seen here six millimeter

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.720 
like we've seen here six millimeter
allen<00:00:50.010> wrench<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.660> this<00:00:51.660> bolt<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.730> will

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
allen wrench and this bolt here will

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.799 
allen wrench and this bolt here will
loosen<00:00:54.000> up<00:00:55.070> which<00:00:56.070> allows<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:57.270> aluminum

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
loosen up which allows the aluminum

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.049 
loosen up which allows the aluminum
folding<00:00:58.500> stem<00:00:59.010> section<00:00:59.629> to<00:01:00.629> lift<00:01:00.840> out<00:01:01.109> of<00:01:02.059> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
folding stem section to lift out of the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.820 
folding stem section to lift out of the
lower<00:01:03.600> steel<00:01:04.489> steerer<00:01:05.489> collar<00:01:06.409> this<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.560> still

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
lower steel steerer collar this is still

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.350 
lower steel steerer collar this is still
a<00:01:07.860> little<00:01:08.159> bit<00:01:08.310> tall<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.700> fit<00:01:08.729> into<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.150> case

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
a little bit tall to fit into the case

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.010 
a little bit tall to fit into the case
so<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.320> need<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.650> remove<00:01:10.890> this<00:01:11.130> collar<00:01:11.520> yet

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
so we need to remove this collar yet

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.340 
so we need to remove this collar yet
using<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.290> same<00:01:13.530> six<00:01:14.159> millimeter<00:01:14.549> wrench<00:01:15.350> we

up<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.790> trick<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.830> take<00:02:35.830> a<00:02:36.130> bit<00:02:36.580> of

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
up the trick to this is take a bit of

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.290 
up the trick to this is take a bit of
paint<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:38.310> make<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> couple<00:02:39.670> small<00:02:39.940> little

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
paint and make a couple small little
