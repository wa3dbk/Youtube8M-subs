00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:08.510
 his arrival you left us a whole 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.760
 enjoy your vista in you seasonally 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.820
 good feet but now also good 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.970
 head into this you succeed I have to 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.550
 admit I had no intention at all 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.589
 to go into a duel or something 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.199
 no need that just four 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:27.710
 on my head and cabin 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.720
 so eh yes braces and well deserved 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.789
 yes i think i think yes 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.100
 then certainly to the 2nd half based on 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.870
 two praising over earning take it 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.840
 closed as free 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.060
 The squad pretty well but I think 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.690
 that also had the better chance 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.010
 and then wanting to get ahead 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.860
 but I that well yes that we create 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.420
 wa just wait they are busy trying 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.790
 it when it could have them duels 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.410
 I think won and 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.240
 and those things as little or none 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.900
 have a chance that I think 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.270
 few long balls but for the rest yes 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:05.030
 deserved victory and it seemed that way 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.920
 all amazingly easy to go 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.480
 of a team already come first as standard 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.850
 the position yes you could do more 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.260
 expect resistance 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.480
 too bad I think our merits 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.930
 corners I think we stood for everyone 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:20.990
 His duties say that there are too many 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.050
 commitment was one thing that starts with that 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.520
 those duos look forward to good for good 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.350
 can play 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.140
 it starts with that and then I have to 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.120
 say that also want to control the ball 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.890
 why do you have to show things 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.530
 it's such a big cliché in football but 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.600
 the bank is incredibly important 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.870
 when you see 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.210
 theo bongonda who now comes to watch sila 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.979
 they also say full development 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.020
 but that promises for the rest of that 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.140
 play-offs no that's right and I think so 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.119
 they did that in it there is a little 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.530
 miss that everyone will be happy 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.180
 Waregem may have had a short time 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.490
 but you have to say we have a real one 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.770
 a very good core 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.479
 me many good players also those on that on 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.909
 sit on the couch that do it the new one 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.189
 it good and it would always be Karel 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:08.000
 must play immediately or so too 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.710
 a blog 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.330
 for those boys quality above 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.340
 quantity between 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.680
 yes I think you want good group 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.230
 everyone can play everyone does 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.400
 best on training and then you will be fine 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.930
 in front of 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.030
 for the boys who play because that 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.890
 keeps us sharp and they have to be fine 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.070
 achieve 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.180
 the play-offs then 10 games 2 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.360
 passed 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.180
 Twice connected to go off and on 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.380
 where energy then where let us start 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.770
 with third place 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.180
 it will be beautiful and everything is better 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.420
 is nice but I think we are 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.190
 are still four points behind the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.980
 First, they must be realistic 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.040
 have to see that we have the 3rd place 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.440
 then see and still not at home 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.510
 reputation undamaged not yet lost 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.370
 at home on the gaverbeek 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.570
 wonderful audience again today 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.060
 behind your sand 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.620
 yes absolutely that sometimes when you see 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.780
 also the second half as one to it 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.340
 the public wants us to do something again 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.239
 more than we can again 2 goals 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.440
 on that side 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.870
 So yes again wants a plan that public 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.220
 animals again throughout the entire competition 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.900
 stand behind you 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.030
 give you some for the competition 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.370
 play certain trust of god 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.530
 at home today is also something 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.970
 easier than outside, absolutely 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.860
 against that certainly plays a role in the oven 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.320
 who have not lost here yet 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.080
 public anyway the right city ​​and then 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.130
 yes, whatever song is beautiful then 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.709
 also be said 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.959
 so you can play good football here 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.709
 and another home match next week 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:45.260
 so again without losses 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.780
 that is the intention let's those who already 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.329
 hold intact sets and 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.230
 from the round I let a little more show 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.230
 thank you so much of art
