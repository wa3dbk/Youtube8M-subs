here<00:00:31.560> is<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.850> map<00:00:33.059> chambers<00:00:33.630> here<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
here is the the map chambers here and

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.340 
here is the the map chambers here and
you<00:00:34.559> can<00:00:34.739> get<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.130> my<00:00:35.250> file<00:00:35.489> share<00:00:36.350> right

you can get it in my file share right
here<00:00:38.450> the<00:00:39.450> game<00:00:40.020> type<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.620> chambers<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.090> urn

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
here the game type is chambers and urn

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.630 
here the game type is chambers and urn
though<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.230> game<00:00:43.410> type<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.800> sandy<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
though the game type of sandy and the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:54.369 
though the game type of sandy and the
map<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.030> chambers<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:47.420> so<00:00:48.420> here's<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.050> map

00:00:54.369 --> 00:00:54.379 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:56.900 

okay<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.440> this<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> map<00:00:56.430> this<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.789> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
okay so this is the map this is the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.720 
okay so this is the map this is the
beginning<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.660> map<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.520> I'm<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.640> going

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
beginning of the map and I'm just going

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.330 
beginning of the map and I'm just going
to<00:00:59.850> delete<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.149> right<00:01:00.480> here<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.989> as<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.190> can

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
to delete this right here and as you can

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.189 
to delete this right here and as you can
see<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.149> whole<00:01:03.629> map<00:01:03.930> right<00:01:04.170> here

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
see this is the whole map right here

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.359 
see this is the whole map right here
it's<00:01:04.530> pretty<00:01:04.799> big<00:01:05.479> all<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.470> may<00:01:07.740> may<00:01:08.189> look

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
it's pretty big all to you may may look

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.810 
it's pretty big all to you may may look
small<00:01:08.549> but<00:01:09.890> once<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.040> actually<00:01:11.250> do<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.640> map

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
small but once you actually do the map

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.560 
small but once you actually do the map
it's<00:01:12.500> pretty<00:01:13.500> big<00:01:13.650> so<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.760> type<00:01:15.090> of<00:01:15.119> map<00:01:15.390> is

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
it's pretty big so this type of map is

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.870 
it's pretty big so this type of map is
like<00:01:16.700> Indiana<00:01:17.700> Jones<00:01:17.820> or<00:01:18.540> kingdom<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.650> raw<00:01:19.880> so

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
like Indiana Jones or kingdom of raw so

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.609 
like Indiana Jones or kingdom of raw so
there's<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.509> whole<00:01:21.810> bunch<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.110> traps<00:01:22.380> in

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
there's like a whole bunch of traps in

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.980 
there's like a whole bunch of traps in
here<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.790> trip<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.570> stuff<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
here that you can trip and stuff and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.249 
here that you can trip and stuff and
each<00:01:25.560> trap<00:01:26.009> has<00:01:26.250> its<00:01:26.430> own<00:01:26.729> way<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> pass<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:28.049> get

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
each trap has its own way to pass or get

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.280 
each trap has its own way to pass or get
through<00:01:28.770> without<00:01:29.070> dying<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.960> i'm<00:01:30.960> not<00:01:31.110> going

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
to show you any gameplay because if i

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.990 
to show you any gameplay because if i
showed<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.290> any<00:01:34.500> gameplay<00:01:34.860> then<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.700> know

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
showed you any gameplay then you know

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.560 
showed you any gameplay then you know
how<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> get<00:01:36.810> past<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.320> map<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> but<00:01:39.000> here's

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
how to get past the map so but here's

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.840 
how to get past the map so but here's
the<00:01:39.689> map<00:01:39.960> but<00:01:40.200> i<00:01:40.259> can<00:01:40.530> at<00:01:40.650> least<00:01:40.799> explain<00:01:41.430> how<00:01:41.820> i

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
the map but i can at least explain how i

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.950 
the map but i can at least explain how i
did<00:01:42.329> some<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.780> traps<00:01:43.079> whew<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.810> here<00:01:45.810> i'm

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
said he helped me with the map but I

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.130 
said he helped me with the map but I
added<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.490> block<00:02:15.730> large<00:02:16.060> right<00:02:16.360> here<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.810> i<00:02:16.870> set

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
added a block large right here and i set

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.930 
added a block large right here and i set
the<00:02:17.320> respond<00:02:17.770> rate<00:02:18.070> at<00:02:18.280> one<00:02:18.580> hundred<00:02:18.670> eighty

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
the respond rate at one hundred eighty

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.420 
the respond rate at one hundred eighty
percent<00:02:19.240> shirt<00:02:19.780> no<00:02:19.990> and<00:02:20.320> then<00:02:21.190> I<00:02:21.220> just

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
percent shirt no and then I just

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.360 
percent shirt no and then I just
basically<00:02:21.970> added<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.840> fusion<00:02:23.230> coil<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.980> a<00:02:24.160> man

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
basically added a fusion coil and a man

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.790 
basically added a fusion coil and a man
cannon<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.240> pallet<00:02:25.720> so<00:02:26.080> once<00:02:26.350> they<00:02:26.590> touch

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
cannon and a pallet so once they touch

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.340 
cannon and a pallet so once they touch
the<00:02:27.040> pallet<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.640> stuff<00:02:27.910> it<00:02:28.120> sets<00:02:28.690> up<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.020> trap

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
the pallet and stuff it sets up the trap

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.540 
the pallet and stuff it sets up the trap
and<00:02:29.650> then<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.630> then<00:02:31.740> you<00:02:32.740> get<00:02:32.920> killed<00:02:33.250> or

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
and then and then you get killed or

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.050 
couple seconds right here but what the
basically<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.270> game<00:02:46.540> type<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.940> when<00:02:48.940> you

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
basically the game type is is when you

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.560 
basically the game type is is when you
play<00:02:49.240> the<00:02:49.390> game<00:02:49.540> type<00:02:49.870> here<00:02:50.560> all<00:02:51.540> your<00:02:52.540> life

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
does not regenerate so you have to be

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.600 
does not regenerate so you have to be
careful<00:02:56.220> with<00:02:57.220> that<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:59.440> that's<00:02:59.980> basically<00:03:00.190> it

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
careful with that so that's basically it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.120 
careful with that so that's basically it
