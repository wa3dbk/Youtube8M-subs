00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 Talk guys who are not part of it anymore. 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.359
 New Theater 2 and the story I 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.849
 no more than one thing happens in the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.910
 regional umberto death matches 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.759
 Capture A Yes But I Would Say Zalf I 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.820
 I think this one pronounces them 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.670
 and I said in the last video that that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.310
 would be the longest but not here in the bad 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.550
 which is the most annoying to find that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.310
 cave sucks and I came back 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.470
 now the time this video will last 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.719
 enough time because now beyond 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.030
 unlock it it only has a message to 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.239
 each of them will fade the 32 and the 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.350
 three were for a single channel rather than 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.160
 vai fashion understands life and now it goes 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:50.610
 jump right in to fly my motivation 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:56.550
 track was magic destined a pokÃ©mon box 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:59.100

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.710
 I'm going to nakane the city hand. 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.439

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.990
 able to feel a mysterious presence in 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.570
 some places is totally ours 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:17.009
 but there are reports that found in 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.560

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.430

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.689

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.520
 released before you will see the game 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.650
 because you could count on on the way 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.400

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.490

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.830
 and I'll catch more 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.000
 I know if it's going to hurt you, it's not serious. 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.800

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.460

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:15.330
 You will count on it, I want to go back 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:20.730
 type of injury takes 65 strokes and we suffer 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.370
 how it is with the emotion of wisdom and 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.890

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.410
 I took it off. It's going to happen. 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.500
