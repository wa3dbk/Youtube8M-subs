00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.010
 it's too easy to know who follows 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.140
 so magali we will discover a strap my 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.939
 custom cream for that you have to do 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.349
 a diagnosis that will allow you to 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.480
 to know the needs 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.430
 your skin and we can have several 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.539
 good answers to every eiffel tower 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.340
 there are several possibilities 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.009
 I tell you immediately shine 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.890
 and tightness ok but do not repeat it 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.590
 is not what we do that concerns you 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.260
 not want a lot I'm going to have the eight 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:47.870
 month you know in my opinion earlier and 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:50.670
 climbs to fine lines 6-4 5-2 golden 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.329
 that's otherwise I like of course the impression 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.870
 to give me a present in fact 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:00.780
 then everyone must prepare the cream 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.789
 we have a small spatula the case a shape 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.610
 particular since adapted there actually to 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.440
 the end of the pot here is slowly 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.030
 because in fact it does not fit 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.000
 perfect so I go to you you see that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.409
 slides lay go we go we see 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.490
 that it takes over everything is very hyper 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.490
 quickly made me train 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.600
 beautiful it's good crÃ©mant 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.899
 it's like 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.340
 it's not I'm good in my cream 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.340
 that's it 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.410
 great idea in the sense that we can 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.570
 really treat things does not treat 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.670
 not usually with just a product 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.200
 and I like us is to do my 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.970
 little tramp like that to have my 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.110
 little cream to me to watch and that's 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.650
 true it's this note yvon the 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.650
 cream falling me I am 4 5 6 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.360
 I have never been so excited by 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.360
 creamery
