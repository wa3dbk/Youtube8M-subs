00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.809
 hello and welcome her too 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.750
 this video today is about the 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.500
 cpu cooler from the house rage in day and 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:16.400
 I hope I have it right 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.840
 pronounced 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.199
 and in this case it's about that 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.850
 top model wintek is fresh 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.960
 founded and now launches one 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.369
 offensive against thermalright and co 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.500
 this processor kilo how to get it here 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.930
 looks is the top middle of the cpu 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.000
 cooler series also offers this form 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.250
 but also in addition housing as 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.360
 also power supplies 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.129
 but before it starts, a big one 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.540
 thank you a rainy day for me that 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.850
 Product is kindly available 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.910
 have put up well and then we look 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.289
 let's have the race day cpu cooler next to 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.510
 the clear similarity to 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.629
 alternative product of thermalright the 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.809
 hr 02 macho offers the agent tag 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.780
 also a cinetower design 140 mm 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.120
 fan with pwm control and of course 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.789
 a heatpipe construction in u-shape with 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.979
 a total of six heatpipes paired with 

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:09.680
 a huge cooling surface becomes the agent 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:12.610
 jack for optimal alternative in the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.229
 Comparison to the thermalright hr 02 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.850
 the special highlight of this cpu 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.420
 cooler is the new in this case 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.479
 designed cpu fan which in the 140 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.390
 mm format is with a fabulous us 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.650
 of just 13 centimeters one 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:34.340
 width of 1 58 mm and a length of 1 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.500
 48 mm, this fan is a newcomer in the 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.600
 cpu cooler area of ​​the fan is going through 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.270
 a four pwm connection connected 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.810
 and has a speed range of 700 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.850
 up to 1400 pm 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:50.180
 the fan is under maximum 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.829
 speed about 96 cubic meters the hour 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.229
 as already mentioned we have one 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.360
 heatsink in single core design this 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.670
 is equipped with a total of six 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.799
 heatpipes which are down here in the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.259
 mediated copper base and ducks 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.409
 in total, they have a strength of 6 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.209
 millimeter as well we have the option 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.310
 in addition a fan here in front or 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.940
 can be positioned at the back and thus can 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.090
 we use a push and pull system 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.459
 the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.560
 heat sink even with built-in fan 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.680
 is there still relatively big that means 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.489
 we have a height of 160 millimeters 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:28.150
 a width of 1 place and 24 mm and one 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.799
 length of 51 millimeters 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.110
 Overall, the heatsink brings together 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.299
 then fan a total weight of north 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.370
 and seven grams on the scales and thus 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.530
 we have a relatively heavy cdu 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.599
 Klop for the easy and simple 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.549
 Installation of the cpu cooler will be in the 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.620
 final version of the reggae caribus 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:47.540
 this screwdriver in addition 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.700
 included among others 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.660
 following intel as well as amd socket 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.090
 systems supports intel lga 775 as 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.160
 also 11 50 and thus it's the support 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.739
 guaranteed for the latest intel 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.340
 slot cpu s of course will be older 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:08.930
 systems supported like 11 55 and 11 56 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:10.760
 of course also 13 66 and 2011 at amd 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.079
 behaves the identical to inter 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.510
 Here we have the support for 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.040
 older socket systems as well for the 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.620
 latest among others here for example 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:24.470
 on the 2 and evening two plus 33 plus m1 m2 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.239
 as well as 11 2 plus to determine the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.889
 maximum cooling capacity on one 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.310
 current systems became following 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:33.799
 test environment uses the intelli 747 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.109
 70 km from the hesse generation was 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.889
 partly with 3.5 ghz standard clock 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:41.690
 operated as overclocked to 4 2 ghz 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.930
 the mainboard was in this case the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.790
 asus z 87 per working memory in this 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.609
 fall corsa wendels in the loh profi 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.609
 version with a basic clock of 1600 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.340
 meter with a total of 16 gb in addition 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.169
 you can get a pellet gtx 77 here 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.060
 jetstream edition for use 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:02.239
 the net itself in this case the be 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:06.530
 quite straight power e9 with 500 watts as 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.989
 also a samsung 48 per with 256 gb and 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.019
 windows 7 professional in the 64 bit 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.120
 version of the agent jerry buss cpu cooler 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:15.829
 was in the standard configuration 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.560
 that means the fan was used 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.630
 fastened in front so that this then in 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.270
 Push operation works and the fan 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.090
 generally ran at 100 percent with approx 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.190
 1400 revolutions 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.199
 minute well then let's have a look 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.990
 test results was among others 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:35.590
 the cpu as already mentioned on 3 5 ghz 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.050
 Chilled in the past and under load 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.720
 of course also over clock on 4 2 ghz 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.229
 Of course there always as well as under 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.229
 load 

00:05:07.639 --> 00:05:13.199
 we come to the conclusion of course had 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.940
 it's the regent ex-boss cpu-cooler in 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.590
 This test is not very easy 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:20.009
 because of the fact that we are here 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.960
 hitzkopf 47 70 cards as well 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.630
 established brands in comparison to 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.560
 race day including for example be quite 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.030
 or terminal 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.919
 Basically, I had the question 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.870
 is now because the combination of 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.910
 old new or 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.370
 classic cooler as well as new 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.220
 designed fan because so powerful 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.039
 like the established brands or products 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.199
 from be quiet as well as from the 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.820
 results will be pretty clear in the 

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.860
 it is not high end today 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.599
 mandatory a cpu cooler too 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.970
 choose the especially by its high 

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.310
 Price also shines cheap products like 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.990
 for example, the agent jack the same 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.000
 the high end area counts here 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.270
 a good alternative between 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.620
 established cpu coolers by be quiet as 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.630
 often overath and co 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.490
 Nevertheless, I was at the beginning after all 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:08.580
 quite skeptical if for example the 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:10.770
 newly designed rainy day fan that 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.639
 can perform in what normal cdu air 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.039
 to do there 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.810
 Nevertheless, the intec has me positive 

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:18.120
 surprised in spite of the special fan 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.310
 construction and he is as good as 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.110
 classic cpu fan at the 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.699
 Cooling performance is definitely not there 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.820
 it has also been seen that 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:29.360
 one up to a few degrees to the top 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:31.889
 model of tom wright the server extreme 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.469
 rankommt and thus secures the 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:37.590
 Airbus takes its place next to the well-known ones 

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:39.570
 products like dark rock 2 and hr 02 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:41.550
 the installation, however, is very simple 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.210
 and are no problem for beginners 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.130
 represent 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.380
 above all, the compatibility to 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.570
 older as well as mostly ecosystem 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.159
 a very good feature among others 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.780
 not with any cpu cooler these days 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:53.219
 more is offered 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.440
 so you can also this 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:58.770
 cpu cooler of the latest generation 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:02.759
 older systems such as Intel 13 66 or 

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.770
 amd am2 or 1 2 plus easy to install 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:06.180
 both the quality of workmanship 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.590
 also the materials used are 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.330
 at a very high level 

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.969
 there may be another here and there 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.430
 few optimization possibilities eg the 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:15.810
 stiffness of the aluminum lamella something 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.370
 improve that they are not so easy 

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:18.810
 can move here and there 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:21.479
 can it ever happen if you have the 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:22.889
 It can be cool or wrong 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:25.040
 Occasionally that one or two 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:26.880
 Slats slightly bent 

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:29.010
 In terms of performance, one has seen that 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:31.440
 the agent day in no way in 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.970
 shadow of other cpu-coolers is the 

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.800
 may have been on for a while now 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:37.020
 are the market and the same applies 

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.699
 same for the price here it is 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.470
 interesting to see that a new one 

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:41.550
 Product not necessarily more free 

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:43.800
 as older products 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.080
 so it's nice to know that 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.960
 the airbus is cheaper than the 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.850
 example of the a2 of thermalright and 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:53.430
 So of course I can give a recommendation 

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.830
 for the day of the race, he passed it on 

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.289
 because we have a very much here 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.240
 good performance but also a lot 

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:01.770
 low price and there we are too 

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.419
 already at the end I thank you 

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.490
 at this point first for watching 

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:07.860
 if you have any questions or suggestions 

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.720
 like to know about the contact form 

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:11.699
 my website as well as via youtube 

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.050
 Of course I would be happy if you 

00:08:11.699 --> 00:08:15.210
 the video just a thumb after 

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:19.070
 there is yes and then we see that 

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.070
 next time, it's pure and goodbye
