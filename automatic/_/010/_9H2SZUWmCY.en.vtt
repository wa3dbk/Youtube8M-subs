a combination and I'll first start off

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.999 
a combination and I'll first start off
with<00:01:57.060> dishsoap<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.840> I'll<00:01:57.959> just<00:01:58.319> punch<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
with dishsoap and I'll just punch the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.010 
with dishsoap and I'll just punch the
bore<00:01:59.280> till<00:01:59.939> it's<00:02:00.090> like<00:02:00.209> pretty<00:02:00.479> much<00:02:00.539> clean

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
bore till it's like pretty much clean

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.769 
bore till it's like pretty much clean
with<00:02:01.380> dish<00:02:01.590> soap<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:02.009> then<00:02:02.880> rinse<00:02:03.179> it<00:02:03.329> out<00:02:03.479> and

00:02:03.769 --> 00:02:03.779 
with dish soap and then rinse it out and

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:05.359 
with dish soap and then rinse it out and
then<00:02:03.899> use<00:02:04.139> a<00:02:04.170> little<00:02:04.380> bit<00:02:04.439> of<00:02:04.560> ballast<00:02:04.889> all<00:02:05.069> and

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
then use a little bit of ballast all and

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.699 
then use a little bit of ballast all and
do<00:02:05.789> that<00:02:05.969> so<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.359> really<00:02:06.450> clean<00:02:06.959> and<00:02:07.229> then

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
do that so it's really clean and then

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:12.980 
do that so it's really clean and then
use<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.660> blue<00:02:09.660> wonder<00:02:10.160> bore<00:02:11.160> cleaner<00:02:11.990> and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
use the blue wonder bore cleaner and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.949 
use the blue wonder bore cleaner and
then<00:02:13.550> once<00:02:14.550> you're<00:02:14.700> done<00:02:14.730> with<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.720> let

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
then once you're done with that you let

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.410 
then once you're done with that you let
it<00:02:16.110> dry<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.950> reason<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.489> use<00:02:17.519> really<00:02:18.180> hot

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
it dry and the reason you use really hot

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.770 
it dry and the reason you use really hot
water<00:02:18.780> is<00:02:18.989> because<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:19.500> heats<00:02:19.709> up<00:02:19.830> the<00:02:19.980> barrel

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
water is because it heats up the barrel

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.840 
water is because it heats up the barrel
to<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.900> point<00:02:22.140> where<00:02:22.530> like<00:02:22.920> my<00:02:23.130> hot<00:02:23.430> water<00:02:23.610> in

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
to the point where like my hot water in

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.280 
to the point where like my hot water in
my<00:02:23.940> house<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.360> almost<00:02:24.570> can't<00:02:24.900> touch<00:02:25.110> the

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
my house you almost can't touch the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.170 
my house you almost can't touch the
barrel<00:02:25.590> it<00:02:25.710> for<00:02:26.010> more<00:02:26.160> than<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> half<00:02:27.090> a

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
barrel it for more than a like a half a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.300 
barrel it for more than a like a half a
second<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.660> really<00:02:27.930> hot<00:02:28.110> but<00:02:28.860> they<00:02:28.980> heat<00:02:29.190> it

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
second it's really hot but they heat it

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.680 
second it's really hot but they heat it
up<00:02:29.400> barrel<00:02:29.820> then<00:02:29.970> once<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.270> take<00:02:30.450> it<00:02:30.570> out<00:02:30.630> and

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
up barrel then once you take it out and

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.170 
up barrel then once you take it out and
dry<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.050> that<00:02:31.410> heat<00:02:31.800> helps<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.580> water<00:02:32.850> to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
dry it that heat helps the water to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.110 
dry it that heat helps the water to
dissipate<00:02:33.750> or<00:02:34.020> evaporate<00:02:34.830> off<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.310> barrel<00:02:35.640> so

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
dissipate or evaporate off the barrel so

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
dissipate or evaporate off the barrel so
it<00:02:36.270> gets<00:02:36.450> all<00:02:36.600> that<00:02:36.750> moisture<00:02:36.930> off<00:02:37.380> right<00:02:38.010> away

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
it gets all that moisture off right away

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.450 
it gets all that moisture off right away
so<00:02:40.140> then<00:02:40.470> after<00:02:40.710> I'm<00:02:40.920> done<00:02:41.070> with<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.280> then

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
so then after I'm done with that then

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.220 
so then after I'm done with that then
I'll<00:02:41.580> take<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.850> board<00:02:42.090> butter<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.630> punch<00:02:43.080> it

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
I'll take the board butter and punch it

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.870 
I'll take the board butter and punch it
one<00:02:43.410> more<00:02:43.590> time<00:02:43.830> just<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.130> put<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> nice<00:02:44.550> coating

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
one more time just to put a nice coating

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.180 
one more time just to put a nice coating
on<00:02:45.090> there<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:46.260> boar<00:02:46.470> butter<00:02:46.710> kind<00:02:46.980> of

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
on there and the boar butter kind of

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.320 
on there and the boar butter kind of
after<00:02:47.580> you've<00:02:47.700> been<00:02:47.850> shooting<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.210> for<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
after you've been shooting it for a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.990 
after you've been shooting it for a
while<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.540> kind<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.750> seasons<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.950> barrel<00:02:50.550> much

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
while it kind of seasons the barrel much

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.620 
while it kind of seasons the barrel much
like<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.480> cast-iron<00:02:52.230> frying<00:02:52.650> pan<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.220> I<00:02:54.180> found

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
like a cast-iron frying pan and I found

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.990 
like a cast-iron frying pan and I found
that<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.990> use<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.440> hot<00:02:55.650> water<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.610> the

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
that the use of the hot water is the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.480 
that the use of the hot water is the
same<00:02:57.240> principle<00:02:57.570> that's<00:02:57.990> used<00:02:58.200> with<00:02:58.410> a

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
same principle that's used with a

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.670 
same principle that's used with a
cast-iron<00:02:59.490> pot<00:02:59.940> or<00:03:00.180> pan<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.470> heat

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
cast-iron pot or pan and that you heat

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.810 
cast-iron pot or pan and that you heat
it<00:03:01.710> up<00:03:01.860> to<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.100> point<00:03:02.310> where<00:03:02.460> it<00:03:02.520> helps<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
it up to the point where it helps the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.010 
it up to the point where it helps the
water<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.300> evaporate<00:03:03.780> off<00:03:05.120> so<00:03:06.120> that's<00:03:06.390> a<00:03:06.720> a

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
water to evaporate off so that's a a

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:32.910 
water to evaporate off so that's a a
little<00:03:07.620> bit<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.330> cleaning<00:03:09.330> tips

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.740 

in<00:03:33.920> some<00:03:34.250> ways<00:03:34.430> cleaning<00:03:35.269> a<00:03:35.359> muzzleloader<00:03:35.900> is

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
in some ways cleaning a muzzleloader is

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.970 
in some ways cleaning a muzzleloader is
you<00:03:38.750> can<00:03:38.959> you<00:03:39.230> kind<00:03:39.409> of<00:03:39.469> feel<00:03:39.650> like<00:03:39.680> it's

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
you can you kind of feel like it's

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.280 
you can you kind of feel like it's
dirtier<00:03:40.549> than<00:03:40.879> conventional<00:03:41.750> cleaning<00:03:42.109> just

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
dirtier than conventional cleaning just

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.009 
dirtier than conventional cleaning just
because<00:03:42.439> of<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.620> black-powder<00:03:43.099> involved<00:03:44.090> but

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
because of the black-powder involved but

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.020 
because of the black-powder involved but
it's<00:03:45.620> also<00:03:46.629> simpler<00:03:47.629> than<00:03:48.109> cleaning<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:49.030> modern

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
it's also simpler than cleaning a modern

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.300 
it's also simpler than cleaning a modern
firearm<00:03:50.510> there's<00:03:50.659> just<00:03:50.840> a<00:03:51.019> lot<00:03:51.349> less<00:03:51.379> parts<00:03:52.159> to

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
firearm there's just a lot less parts to

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:00.039 
firearm there's just a lot less parts to
it<00:03:52.459> lot<00:03:53.000> less<00:03:53.269> stuff<00:03:57.849> now<00:03:58.849> some<00:03:59.359> of<00:03:59.389> the<00:03:59.629> gear

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
it lot less stuff now some of the gear

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.500 
it lot less stuff now some of the gear
that<00:04:00.500> you'll<00:04:00.859> need<00:04:01.129> to<00:04:01.189> start<00:04:01.819> muzzleloading

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
that you'll need to start muzzleloading

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.110 
that you'll need to start muzzleloading
and<00:04:03.370> one<00:04:04.370> of<00:04:04.489> them<00:04:04.609> you'll<00:04:04.760> need<00:04:04.939> is<00:04:05.090> a

the with my kit that I bought from
Cabela's<00:04:23.360> came<00:04:23.720> with<00:04:23.840> this<00:04:24.020> and<00:04:24.259> this<00:04:24.620> here<00:04:24.860> is

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
Cabela's came with this and this here is

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.140 
Cabela's came with this and this here is
the<00:04:25.070> nipple<00:04:25.400> like<00:04:25.520> I<00:04:25.639> was<00:04:25.759> showing<00:04:25.970> you<00:04:26.090> that

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
the nipple like I was showing you that

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.170 
the nipple like I was showing you that
you<00:04:26.539> used<00:04:26.840> with<00:04:27.199> hollow<00:04:27.530> points<00:04:27.889> so<00:04:28.580> you<00:04:28.639> put

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
you used with hollow points so you put

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.040 
you used with hollow points so you put
the<00:04:29.270> bullet<00:04:29.419> in<00:04:29.599> the<00:04:31.060> muzzle<00:04:32.060> loader<00:04:32.240> and<00:04:32.509> you

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
the bullet in the muzzle loader and you

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.930 
the bullet in the muzzle loader and you
use<00:04:33.259> this<00:04:33.470> to<00:04:33.650> start<00:04:33.889> it<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.190> then<00:04:34.250> you<00:04:34.910> use

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
use this to start it and then you use

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.490 
use this to start it and then you use
this<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.360> push<00:04:35.539> it<00:04:35.659> a<00:04:35.720> little<00:04:35.750> bit<00:04:35.930> further<00:04:36.260> and

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500 
this to push it a little bit further and

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.469 
this to push it a little bit further and
then<00:04:36.590> you<00:04:36.919> use<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.280> big<00:04:37.460> ramrod<00:04:37.909> to<00:04:38.120> push<00:04:38.330> it

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
then you use the big ramrod to push it

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.420 
then you use the big ramrod to push it
all<00:04:38.659> the<00:04:38.690> way<00:04:38.900> in<00:04:39.050> so<00:04:39.229> you<00:04:39.800> start<00:04:40.099> with<00:04:40.250> this

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
all the way in so you start with this

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.879 
all the way in so you start with this
and<00:04:40.699> then<00:04:41.150> finish<00:04:41.449> off<00:04:41.599> with<00:04:41.659> that<00:04:41.960> and<00:04:42.260> then

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
and then finish off with that and then

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.490 
and then finish off with that and then
in<00:04:43.250> unlike<00:04:43.789> when<00:04:44.389> you<00:04:44.510> load<00:04:44.750> it<00:04:44.930> unlike<00:04:45.320> what

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
in unlike when you load it unlike what

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.140 
in unlike when you load it unlike what
they<00:04:45.620> show<00:04:45.860> you<00:04:45.919> a<00:04:46.039> lot<00:04:46.250> of<00:04:46.370> times<00:04:46.550> on<00:04:46.699> TV<00:04:46.880> you

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
they show you a lot of times on TV you

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.120 
they show you a lot of times on TV you
don't<00:04:47.210> want<00:04:47.510> to<00:04:47.599> tamp<00:04:47.870> it<00:04:48.020> in<00:04:48.199> you<00:04:48.830> want<00:04:49.039> to

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
don't want to tamp it in you want to

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.129 
don't want to tamp it in you want to
push<00:04:49.340> it<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.699> with<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.360> smooth<00:04:50.750> them<00:04:50.990> as

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
push it is with the smooth them as

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.110 
push it is with the smooth them as
motion<00:04:51.530> as<00:04:51.650> possible<00:04:52.159> and<00:04:52.370> then<00:04:52.760> when<00:04:52.909> it<00:04:53.000> gets

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
motion as possible and then when it gets

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.149 
motion as possible and then when it gets
to<00:04:53.270> the<00:04:53.479> end<00:04:53.659> then<00:04:54.409> you<00:04:54.560> want<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.800> just<00:04:55.010> give<00:04:55.130> it

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:55.159 
to the end then you want to just give it

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:57.640 
to the end then you want to just give it
a<00:04:55.280> couple<00:04:55.400> quick<00:04:55.760> taps<00:04:56.210> now<00:04:56.900> sometimes<00:04:57.409> you

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
a couple quick taps now sometimes you

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.260 
a couple quick taps now sometimes you
might<00:04:57.800> have<00:04:57.949> a<00:04:58.010> harder<00:04:58.370> time<00:04:58.400> loading<00:04:58.849> it<00:04:59.060> like

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
might have a harder time loading it like

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.950 
might have a harder time loading it like
for<00:04:59.479> example<00:04:59.570> for<00:05:00.340> me<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.970> best<00:05:02.210> loading<00:05:02.720> is

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
for example for me the best loading is

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.899 
for example for me the best loading is
when<00:05:03.199> it's<00:05:03.349> just<00:05:03.800> main<00:05:03.979> cleaned<00:05:04.310> if<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.639> cleaned

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 
when it's just main cleaned if I cleaned

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:06.760 
when it's just main cleaned if I cleaned
it<00:05:05.000> between<00:05:05.210> every<00:05:05.509> shot<00:05:05.780> that<00:05:06.080> would<00:05:06.500> be<00:05:06.620> the

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
it between every shot that would be the

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.890 
it between every shot that would be the
easiest<00:05:07.009> to<00:05:07.159> load<00:05:07.310> once<00:05:07.940> I<00:05:08.060> fired<00:05:08.419> at<00:05:08.599> once

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
easiest to load once I fired at once

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.870 
easiest to load once I fired at once
it's<00:05:09.259> a<00:05:09.320> lot<00:05:09.530> more<00:05:09.710> difficult<00:05:09.889> to<00:05:10.190> load<00:05:10.400> I<00:05:10.639> can

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
it's a lot more difficult to load I can

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.089 
it's a lot more difficult to load I can
get<00:05:11.270> it<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.509> about<00:05:11.720> here<00:05:12.110> but<00:05:12.560> then<00:05:12.800> need<00:05:13.009> to

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
get it to about here but then need to

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:14.920 
get it to about here but then need to
breed<00:05:13.400> is<00:05:13.580> kind<00:05:13.789> of<00:05:13.849> builds<00:05:14.150> up<00:05:14.270> and<00:05:14.419> it's<00:05:14.659> it's

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:14.930 
breed is kind of builds up and it's it's

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.450 
breed is kind of builds up and it's it's
hard<00:05:15.110> to<00:05:15.169> push<00:05:15.380> it<00:05:15.560> in<00:05:15.680> especially<00:05:16.220> the<00:05:16.280> last

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
hard to push it in especially the last

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.330 
hard to push it in especially the last
couple<00:05:16.789> of<00:05:17.300> inches<00:05:17.449> I<00:05:17.780> got<00:05:18.409> to<00:05:18.500> whack<00:05:18.949> it<00:05:19.009> a

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
couple of inches I got to whack it a

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.320 
couple of inches I got to whack it a
couple<00:05:19.580> of<00:05:19.699> good<00:05:19.849> times<00:05:20.090> so<00:05:21.050> and<00:05:21.580> one<00:05:22.580> tip<00:05:22.970> also

is<00:05:23.900> to<00:05:24.349> when<00:05:25.159> you<00:05:25.280> load<00:05:25.490> it<00:05:25.639> for<00:05:25.759> the<00:05:25.849> first

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
is to when you load it for the first

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.480 
is to when you load it for the first
time<00:05:26.300> with<00:05:26.479> a<00:05:26.509> clean<00:05:26.810> barrel<00:05:27.199> and<00:05:27.650> everything
