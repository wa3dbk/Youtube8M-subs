went ahead and did was I stopped my my
local<00:02:21.220> craft<00:02:21.310> store<00:02:21.489> Joanne's<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.569> I<00:02:22.900> got

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
local craft store Joanne's and I got

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.380 
local craft store Joanne's and I got
something<00:02:23.410> called<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.739> flexi<00:02:24.190> lace<00:02:24.489> hem<00:02:25.030> tape

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
something called the flexi lace hem tape

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.530 
something called the flexi lace hem tape
and<00:02:25.660> this<00:02:26.440> is<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.680> material<00:02:27.160> here<00:02:27.489> I<00:02:27.670> was

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
and this is the material here I was

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.720 
and this is the material here I was
worried<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.050> lace<00:02:29.230> would<00:02:29.560> rip<00:02:29.830> but<00:02:30.550> so

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
worried that the lace would rip but so

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.120 
worried that the lace would rip but so
far<00:02:31.000> I<00:02:31.360> haven't<00:02:31.390> had<00:02:31.780> any<00:02:31.989> issue<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.830> makes<00:02:33.010> it

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
far I haven't had any issue it makes it

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.380 
far I haven't had any issue it makes it
a<00:02:33.190> little<00:02:33.250> more<00:02:33.400> sturdy<00:02:33.730> once<00:02:33.940> I<00:02:34.030> add<00:02:34.180> the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
a little more sturdy once I add the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.380 
a little more sturdy once I add the
super<00:02:34.720> glue<00:02:34.900> so<00:02:35.709> it<00:02:36.280> comes<00:02:36.519> on<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:36.970> little<00:02:37.030> roll

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
super glue so it comes on a little roll

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
super glue so it comes on a little roll
like<00:02:37.630> this<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.690> it's<00:02:40.930> about<00:02:41.110> a<00:02:41.140> dollar

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
like this and it's about a dollar

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.800 
like this and it's about a dollar
ninety-nine<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.459> I've<00:02:42.819> pretty<00:02:43.180> much<00:02:43.269> done<00:02:43.780> a

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
ninety-nine and I've pretty much done a

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.050 
ninety-nine and I've pretty much done a
whole<00:02:44.049> head<00:02:44.380> of<00:02:44.410> clip<00:02:44.950> ins<00:02:45.160> with<00:02:45.670> just<00:02:45.940> this

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
whole head of clip ins with just this

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.320 
whole head of clip ins with just this
one<00:02:46.269> roll<00:02:46.510> here<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:47.470> mean<00:02:48.100> two<00:02:48.819> bucks<00:02:49.090> you

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
one roll here so I mean two bucks you

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.080 
one roll here so I mean two bucks you
really<00:02:49.540> can't<00:02:49.750> beat<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:50.519> so<00:02:51.519> then<00:02:51.790> that's

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
really can't beat that so then that's

00:02:52.090 --> 00:03:00.270 
really can't beat that so then that's
what<00:02:52.329> i<00:02:52.390> do<00:02:56.130> is<00:02:57.780> i<00:02:58.780> take<00:02:58.810> my<00:02:59.200> track<00:02:59.560> and<00:02:59.799> i<00:03:00.130> go

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
what i do is i take my track and i go

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.979 
what i do is i take my track and i go
ahead<00:03:00.519> and<00:03:00.670> measure<00:03:00.820> across<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.450> lace<00:03:01.660> and

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
ahead and measure across the lace and

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.259 
ahead and measure across the lace and
i've<00:03:02.440> already<00:03:02.590> pre-cut<00:03:03.130> these<00:03:03.400> just<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.060> save

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
i've already pre-cut these just to save

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:07.349 
i've already pre-cut these just to save
time<00:03:05.220> but<00:03:06.220> i<00:03:06.280> just<00:03:06.489> kind<00:03:06.640> of<00:03:06.670> measure<00:03:06.910> across

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:07.359 
time but i just kind of measure across

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:10.650 
time but i just kind of measure across
the<00:03:07.600> lace<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:08.140> i<00:03:08.799> cut<00:03:09.070> about<00:03:09.400> three<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:10.359> four

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
the lace and i cut about three to four

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.020 
the lace and i cut about three to four
pieces<00:03:11.200> just<00:03:12.190> because<00:03:12.430> i<00:03:12.519> noticed<00:03:12.850> when<00:03:12.970> i

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
pieces just because i noticed when i

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.060 
pieces just because i noticed when i
counted<00:03:13.660> how<00:03:13.840> many<00:03:13.870> west's<00:03:14.350> were<00:03:14.440> on<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.890> lace

hair<00:03:40.090> i'm<00:03:40.329> just<00:03:40.480> going<00:03:40.660> to<00:03:40.690> use<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:40.959> basic

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
hair i'm just going to use the basic

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.059 
hair i'm just going to use the basic
supplies<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.750> that's<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.989> and<00:03:44.290> let's<00:03:44.980> go

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
supplies so that's that and let's go

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.870 
supplies so that's that and let's go
ahead<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.370> get<00:03:45.519> started

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.660 

so<00:03:50.750> what<00:03:51.080> I<00:03:51.110> do<00:03:51.200> is<00:03:51.530> I<00:03:51.620> take<00:03:51.980> my<00:03:52.190> glue<00:03:52.400> and<00:03:52.580> apply

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
so what I do is I take my glue and apply

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.720 
so what I do is I take my glue and apply
it<00:03:52.880> I<00:03:53.210> usually<00:03:54.200> use<00:03:54.470> the<00:03:54.830> packaging<00:03:55.340> that<00:03:55.370> the

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
it I usually use the packaging that the

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.690 
it I usually use the packaging that the
hair<00:03:55.970> came<00:03:56.330> in<00:03:56.690> just<00:03:57.530> because<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:58.310> noticed<00:03:58.610> when

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
hair came in just because I noticed when

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.400 
hair came in just because I noticed when
I<00:03:58.760> put<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.030> on<00:03:59.120> paper<00:03:59.360> or<00:03:59.720> cardboard<00:04:00.080> or

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
I put it on paper or cardboard or

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.470 
I put it on paper or cardboard or
anything<00:04:00.770> like<00:04:00.800> that<00:04:00.950> type<00:04:01.460> of<00:04:01.490> surface<00:04:02.060> the

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
anything like that type of surface the

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.390 
anything like that type of surface the
paper<00:04:02.660> ends<00:04:02.990> up<00:04:03.080> coming<00:04:03.410> off<00:04:03.500> on<00:04:03.740> my<00:04:03.950> lace<00:04:04.130> so

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
paper ends up coming off on my lace so

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.640 
paper ends up coming off on my lace so
to<00:04:04.460> avoid<00:04:04.850> that<00:04:04.910> i<00:04:05.390> use<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.110> packaging<00:04:06.620> that

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
to avoid that i use the packaging that

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.670 
to avoid that i use the packaging that
the<00:04:06.920> hair<00:04:07.070> comes<00:04:07.340> in<00:04:08.170> so<00:04:09.170> I'm<00:04:09.260> what<00:04:09.440> I'm<00:04:09.530> going

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
the hair comes in so I'm what I'm going

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.930 
the hair comes in so I'm what I'm going
to<00:04:09.710> do<00:04:09.830> is<00:04:09.980> just<00:04:10.010> go<00:04:10.250> ahead<00:04:10.370> and<00:04:10.520> apply<00:04:10.730> the

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:10.940 
to do is just go ahead and apply the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:18.970 
to do is just go ahead and apply the
glue<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:16.820> it<00:04:17.030> comes<00:04:17.300> out<00:04:17.630> pretty<00:04:18.170> easy<00:04:18.739> i

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
glue and it comes out pretty easy i

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.040 
glue and it comes out pretty easy i
