yeah<00:00:10.740> there's<00:00:11.519> this<00:00:11.639> regular<00:00:12.210> technology

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
yeah there's this regular technology

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.419 
yeah there's this regular technology
that<00:00:13.259> this<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.650> one<00:00:13.860> of<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.009> ways<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.309> can

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
that this is one of the ways that we can

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.799 
that this is one of the ways that we can
do<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.730> can<00:00:14.910> build<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.299> we<00:00:15.509> could<00:00:15.690> build

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
do it you can build that we could build

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.480 
do it you can build that we could build
a<00:00:15.960> building<00:00:16.260> we're<00:00:16.650> building<00:00:17.039> if<00:00:17.130> we<00:00:17.220> wanted

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
a building we're building if we wanted

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.830 
a building we're building if we wanted
to<00:00:17.640> there's<00:00:17.880> just<00:00:17.970> different<00:00:18.390> ways<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.750> we

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
to there's just different ways that we

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.500 
to there's just different ways that we
can<00:00:19.080> can<00:00:19.740> do<00:00:19.890> this<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.250> was<00:00:20.520> economical

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
can can do this and this was economical

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.029 
can can do this and this was economical
to<00:00:21.600> do<00:00:21.720> we<00:00:21.840> can<00:00:21.960> hide<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:22.740> don't<00:00:22.830> want

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
to do we can hide that if you don't want

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.609 
to do we can hide that if you don't want
to<00:00:23.100> looks<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.430> asylum<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:23.910> your<00:00:24.029> property<00:00:24.619> and

feeding this you can tell me again how

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230 
feeding this you can tell me again how
this<00:00:28.320> looks<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:28.800> difficult<00:00:29.550> thing<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:30.029> put

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
this looks like a difficult thing to put

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.630 
this looks like a difficult thing to put
stuff<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.260> tell<00:00:31.470> me<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.710> isn't<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.520> is

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
the same way is putting grain into a

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.229 
the same way is putting grain into a
tank<00:00:34.380> when<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> farmers<00:00:35.130> put<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.340> wood<00:00:36.059> grain

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
into the tank it's getting stuff that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.590 
into the tank it's getting stuff that
everybody<00:00:44.129> would<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.420> rural

unit<00:01:14.570> friday<00:01:15.570> friday<00:01:16.259> morning<00:01:16.740> they<00:01:17.640> got<00:01:17.790> here

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
unit friday friday morning they got here

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.670 
unit friday friday morning they got here
with<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.090> crane<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.479> set<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.750> down<00:01:24.200> by<00:01:25.200> Saturday

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
with a crane we set it down by Saturday

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.289 
with a crane we set it down by Saturday
afternoon<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:26.250> had<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.520> bar<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:27.030> into<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
afternoon we had to bar going into the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.300 
afternoon we had to bar going into the
boiler<00:01:27.479> that's<00:01:27.689> pretty<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> whole<00:01:29.009> theory

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
boiler that's pretty so the whole theory

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.420 
boiler that's pretty so the whole theory
is<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.869> comes<00:01:31.110> in<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> container<00:01:31.799> if

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
is it just comes in the container if

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.120 
is it just comes in the container if
you've<00:01:32.700> done<00:01:32.939> your<00:01:32.970> path<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.079> your<00:01:34.200> silo<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
you've done your path and your silo and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.200 
you've done your path and your silo and
you've<00:01:35.220> got<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.520> plumbing<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.090> your

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
you've got your plumbing and your

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.210 
you've got your plumbing and your
electricity<00:01:36.600> way<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.020> hook<00:01:37.320> up<00:01:37.500> yeah<00:01:37.860> you're

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
electricity way to hook up yeah you're

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.609 
electricity way to hook up yeah you're
you're<00:01:38.549> in<00:01:38.700> business<00:01:39.170> this<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.229> one<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.500> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
you're in business this is one of the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.899 
you're in business this is one of the
ways<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.250> them<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.579> be<00:01:41.700> quicker

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
ways that we can get them to be quicker

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.880 
ways that we can get them to be quicker
there's<00:01:42.780> different<00:01:43.110> ways<00:01:43.200> again<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.619> can<00:01:43.770> get

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
there's different ways again I can get

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.100 
there's different ways again I can get
the<00:01:43.979> boarders<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.399> we<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.790> most<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.869> them

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
the boarders and we can do most of them

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.060 
the boarders and we can do most of them
now<00:01:46.229> while<00:01:46.409> we'll<00:01:46.590> probably<00:01:46.740> be<00:01:46.950> doing

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
now while we'll probably be doing

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.520 
now while we'll probably be doing
inherited<00:01:48.140> plumbing<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.229> stuff<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.470> the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
inherited plumbing and stuff in the

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.139 
inherited plumbing and stuff in the
first<00:01:49.680> one<00:01:49.950> we<00:01:50.130> got<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.399> coming<00:01:50.670> in<00:01:51.060> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
first one we got it coming in a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.670 
first one we got it coming in a
container

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
container

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.690

pellets inside all the time okay okay it
just<00:02:19.269> feeds<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:19.870> pellets<00:02:20.170> speeds<00:02:20.650> above<00:02:20.890> in

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
just feeds the pellets speeds above in

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.880 
just feeds the pellets speeds above in
this<00:02:21.280> every<00:02:23.430> no<00:02:24.430> right<00:02:24.970> just<00:02:25.420> piece<00:02:25.890> yeah

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
this every no right just piece yeah

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.890 
this every no right just piece yeah
that's<00:02:27.459> right<00:02:27.640> so<00:02:28.060> for<00:02:28.330> people<00:02:28.420> who<00:02:28.569> worry

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
that's right so for people who worry

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.830 
that's right so for people who worry
about<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:30.040> environmental<00:02:30.489> issues<00:02:30.849> here<00:02:31.299> what

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
about the environmental issues here what

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.530 
about the environmental issues here what
would<00:02:31.989> you<00:02:32.110> say<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.349> that<00:02:32.519> it's<00:02:33.519> there's<00:02:34.329> no

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
would you say to that it's there's no

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:46.740 
would you say to that it's there's no
it's<00:02:35.260> very<00:02:35.410> very<00:02:35.829> clean<00:02:44.190> regulates<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.450> do<00:02:46.450> to

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
it's very very clean regulates the do to

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.000 
it's very very clean regulates the do to
all<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.989> time<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.410> should<00:02:47.530> just<00:02:47.650> like<00:02:47.860> the

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
all the time it should just like the

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.190 
all the time it should just like the
flame<00:02:48.220> justice<00:02:48.790> so<00:02:49.209> if<00:02:49.329> it<00:02:49.450> starts<00:02:49.569> to<00:02:49.959> send

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
flame justice so if it starts to send

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.300 
flame justice so if it starts to send
something<00:02:50.500> coming<00:02:50.650> out<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.769> the<00:02:50.860> stack<00:02:51.099> he'll

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
something coming out of the stack he'll

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.759 
something coming out of the stack he'll
it'll<00:02:51.610> alter<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.540> mix<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:52.989> put<00:02:53.140> more<00:02:53.290> oxygen

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
it'll alter the mix and put more oxygen

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.229 
it'll alter the mix and put more oxygen
and<00:02:53.920> run<00:02:54.220> it<00:02:54.400> alter<00:02:54.790> them<00:02:55.000> yeah<00:02:56.160> guys

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
and run it alter them yeah guys

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.729 
and run it alter them yeah guys
recirculating<00:02:58.239> that<00:02:58.600> goes<00:02:58.780> into<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.290> too<00:02:59.500> that

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
recirculating that goes into it too that

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.250 
recirculating that goes into it too that
helps<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.010> fireman<00:03:00.370> uber<00:03:00.579> driver<00:03:00.940> material

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.569 

there's<00:03:05.260> two<00:03:05.500> cleaning<00:03:05.920> keeps<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.340> border

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
there's two cleaning keeps the border

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:15.380 
there's two cleaning keeps the border
efficient<00:03:07.079> just<00:03:09.870> two<00:03:10.870> cleaning<00:03:11.319> here

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.699 

so<00:03:16.390> does<00:03:16.569> that<00:03:16.599> keep<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.080> maintenance<00:03:17.500> right

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
so does that keep the maintenance right

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:18.949 
so does that keep the maintenance right
there<00:03:17.920> because<00:03:18.010> I'm<00:03:18.190> into<00:03:18.580> cleaning

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
there because I'm into cleaning

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.360 
there because I'm into cleaning
traditionally<00:03:19.959> when<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:20.770> were<00:03:20.980> running<00:03:21.130> an

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
traditionally when you were running an

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.880 
traditionally when you were running an
old<00:03:21.520> steam<00:03:21.819> engine<00:03:22.349> you'd<00:03:23.349> have<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.650> take<00:03:23.830> the

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
old steam engine you'd have to take the

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.570 
old steam engine you'd have to take the
whole<00:03:24.599> steam<00:03:25.599> engine<00:03:25.930> apart<00:03:26.200> every<00:03:26.620> year<00:03:27.430> or

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
whole steam engine apart every year or

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.460 
whole steam engine apart every year or
so<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.880> clean<00:03:28.239> it<00:03:28.420> up<00:03:28.569> you<00:03:28.870> don't<00:03:28.989> have<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.230> do

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
so to clean it up you don't have to do

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.880 
so to clean it up you don't have to do
those<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.830> left<00:03:30.099> to<00:03:30.310> after<00:03:30.930> after<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.050> many<00:03:32.140> so

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
those the left to after after so many so

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.540 
those the left to after after so many so
many<00:03:32.980> weeks<00:03:33.280> from<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.580> ours<00:03:35.370> about<00:03:36.370> a

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
many weeks from the ours about a

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.680 
many weeks from the ours about a
thousand<00:03:37.060> hours<00:03:38.550> once<00:03:39.550> we<00:03:39.670> got<00:03:39.819> 1,700<00:03:40.540> and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
thousand hours once we got 1,700 and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.750 
thousand hours once we got 1,700 and
it's<00:03:40.810> still<00:03:41.019> running<00:03:41.170> very<00:03:41.830> efficient<00:03:42.370> you're

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
it's still running very efficient you're

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.430 
it's still running very efficient you're
moving<00:03:43.120> great<00:03:43.390> two-speed<00:03:43.930> different

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
moving great two-speed different

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.290 
moving great two-speed different
different<00:03:44.890> pellets<00:03:45.220> we<00:03:45.400> can<00:03:45.550> burn<00:03:45.700> chips<00:03:46.060> or

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
different pellets we can burn chips or

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.809 
different pellets we can burn chips or
pellets<00:03:46.690> with<00:03:46.840> it<00:03:46.930> oh<00:03:47.110> I<00:03:47.830> can<00:03:48.010> set<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.489> moving

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
pellets with it oh I can set the moving

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.420 
pellets with it oh I can set the moving
grades<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.330> feed<00:03:49.600> for<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:50.650> speed<00:03:50.890> that<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.160> want

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
grades to feed for the speed that I want

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.789 
grades to feed for the speed that I want
so<00:03:51.760> this<00:03:51.970> is<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.150> very<00:03:52.450> flexible<00:03:52.750> fuel<00:03:53.410> furnace

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
so this is a very flexible fuel furnace

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.039 
so this is a very flexible fuel furnace
as<00:03:54.130> well<00:03:54.340> so<00:03:54.610> if<00:03:54.910> we<00:03:55.000> could<00:03:55.239> go<00:03:55.420> to<00:03:55.450> chips<00:03:55.840> which

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
as well so if we could go to chips which

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.140 
as well so if we could go to chips which
would<00:03:56.200> be<00:03:56.290> a<00:03:56.319> lot<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.560> these<00:03:56.680> in<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.280> end<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.819> lot

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
would be a lot of these in the end a lot

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.350 
would be a lot of these in the end a lot
easier<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.690> source<00:03:58.959> yes<00:03:59.920> your<00:04:00.580> source<00:04:00.910> here<00:04:01.209> on

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
easier to source yes your source here on

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.270 
easier to source yes your source here on
PEI<00:04:01.630> yeah<00:04:03.150> yeah<00:04:04.150> yeah<00:04:04.690> I<00:04:05.410> mean<00:04:05.590> I'm<00:04:05.950> paying

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
about I mean if you go down to the you

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.020 
about I mean if you go down to the you
know<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.799> hardware<00:04:09.099> store<00:04:09.519> it's<00:04:09.790> between

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
know the hardware store it's between

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.610 
know the hardware store it's between
five<00:04:10.989> and<00:04:11.019> eight<00:04:11.349> dollars<00:04:11.799> a<00:04:11.830> 40<00:04:12.640> kilo<00:04:13.030> bag

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
five and eight dollars a 40 kilo bag

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.469 
five and eight dollars a 40 kilo bag
what's<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.769> equivalent<00:04:15.069> price<00:04:15.819> that<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.239> get

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
what's the equivalent price that you get

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:18.569 
what's the equivalent price that you get
for<00:04:16.720> a<00:04:16.750> hopper<00:04:17.139> fill<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.769> know<00:04:17.889> with<00:04:18.100> tons<00:04:18.370> of

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
for a hopper fill you know with tons of

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.759 
for a hopper fill you know with tons of
the<00:04:18.700> stuff

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
the stuff

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.400 
the stuff
the<00:04:20.769> average<00:04:21.070> is<00:04:21.190> 320<00:04:21.940> from<00:04:22.210> 340<00:04:22.810> trees<00:04:23.020> if<00:04:23.289> you

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
the average is 320 from 340 trees if you

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.350 
the average is 320 from 340 trees if you
are<00:04:23.470> a<00:04:23.500> ton<00:04:23.830> yeah<00:04:24.250> we<00:04:24.460> can<00:04:24.610> get<00:04:24.789> it<00:04:24.940> there<00:04:25.060> ball

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
are a ton yeah we can get it there ball

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.090 
are a ton yeah we can get it there ball
-<00:04:25.510> no<00:04:25.600> from<00:04:25.900> -<00:04:26.590> depends<00:04:27.039> on<00:04:27.070> the<00:04:27.160> delivery<00:04:27.720> from

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
- no from - depends on the delivery from

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.410 
- no from - depends on the delivery from
220<00:04:30.100> to

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
220 to

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.780 
220 to
okay<00:04:32.320> so<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:32.620> get<00:04:32.980> this<00:04:33.130> a<00:04:33.190> lot<00:04:33.430> cheaper<00:04:33.640> than

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
okay so you get this a lot cheaper than

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.480 
okay so you get this a lot cheaper than
I<00:04:34.000> do<00:04:35.970> yeah<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.180> we<00:04:37.270> so<00:04:37.780> tell<00:04:38.260> me<00:04:38.380> about<00:04:38.470> how<00:04:38.800> we

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
I do yeah and we so tell me about how we

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.060 
I do yeah and we so tell me about how we
can<00:04:39.790> keep<00:04:40.090> more<00:04:40.390> money<00:04:40.420> in<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.290> island<00:04:41.680> if<00:04:41.890> we

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
can keep more money in the island if we

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.700 
can keep more money in the island if we
move<00:04:42.280> towards<00:04:42.910> heating<00:04:43.660> like<00:04:43.840> this<00:04:44.110> but<00:04:44.530> from

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
move towards heating like this but from

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.960 
move towards heating like this but from
from<00:04:44.980> working<00:04:45.250> in<00:04:45.340> the<00:04:45.430> forestry<00:04:45.880> industry

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
from working in the forestry industry

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.910 
from working in the forestry industry
for<00:04:46.630> about<00:04:47.080> 15<00:04:47.590> years<00:04:47.670> I<00:04:48.930> can<00:04:49.930> I<00:04:50.260> can<00:04:50.590> see<00:04:50.620> that

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
for about 15 years I can I can see that

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:58.620 
for about 15 years I can I can see that
there's<00:04:51.130> we<00:04:51.520> had<00:04:51.640> a<00:04:51.670> lot<00:04:51.850> of<00:04:51.880> product<00:04:57.450> that<00:04:58.450> we

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
there's we had a lot of product that we

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.030 
there's we had a lot of product that we
couldn't<00:04:59.080> sell<00:04:59.260> this<00:04:59.410> pup<00:04:59.650> food<00:04:59.860> it<00:04:59.950> was

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
couldn't sell this pup food it was

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.580 
couldn't sell this pup food it was
rotting<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.550> was<00:05:00.670> that<00:05:01.660> was<00:05:01.810> dry<00:05:02.140> that<00:05:02.470> was

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
rotting that was that was dry that was

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:04.200 
rotting that was that was dry that was
dead<00:05:02.770> wood<00:05:03.040> that<00:05:03.370> was<00:05:03.460> still<00:05:03.670> sound<00:05:03.940> enough

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
dead wood that was still sound enough

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.230 
dead wood that was still sound enough
that<00:05:04.390> we<00:05:04.510> could<00:05:04.720> use<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.830> let<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.160> Sun<00:05:06.370> dry<00:05:06.550> out

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
that we could use to let the Sun dry out

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.370 
that we could use to let the Sun dry out
here<00:05:07.450> for<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.690> summer<00:05:07.900> and<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.350> fall

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
different sizes out there but a school

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.190 
different sizes out there but a school
that<00:05:27.940> was<00:05:28.060> burned<00:05:28.300> or<00:05:28.510> a<00:05:28.540> building<00:05:28.960> that<00:05:29.050> would

have<00:05:32.950> those<00:05:33.100> numbers<00:05:33.340> in<00:05:33.550> my<00:05:33.730> head<00:05:33.880> because<00:05:34.000> I

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
have those numbers in my head because I

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.980 
have those numbers in my head because I
did<00:05:34.330> some<00:05:34.930> of<00:05:35.050> them<00:05:36.150> by<00:05:37.150> going<00:05:37.330> with<00:05:37.600> oil<00:05:37.750> or

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
did some of them by going with oil or

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.420 
did some of them by going with oil or
chips<00:05:38.320> you<00:05:38.440> could<00:05:38.590> save<00:05:38.770> a<00:05:38.800> hundred<00:05:39.100> thousand

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
chips you could save a hundred thousand

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.330 
chips you could save a hundred thousand
a<00:05:39.520> year<00:05:40.020> right<00:05:41.020> by<00:05:41.380> going<00:05:41.560> with<00:05:41.710> pallet<00:05:42.250> wood

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
a year right by going with pallet wood

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.220 
a year right by going with pallet wood
pellet<00:05:42.700> wood<00:05:42.850> chips<00:05:43.120> with<00:05:43.390> chips<00:05:43.630> compared<00:05:44.020> to

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230 
pellet wood chips with chips compared to

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:46.320 
pellet wood chips with chips compared to
oil<00:05:44.260> over<00:05:44.920> chips<00:05:45.220> is<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.580> best<00:05:45.790> wood<00:05:46.090> chips

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
oil over chips is the best wood chips

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.530 
oil over chips is the best wood chips
would<00:05:46.540> be<00:05:46.660> the<00:05:46.750> cheapest<00:05:47.370> or<00:05:48.370> 100,000<00:05:49.300> per

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
would be the cheapest or 100,000 per

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.800 
would be the cheapest or 100,000 per
school<00:05:49.840> with<00:05:50.380> a<00:05:51.120> school<00:05:52.120> that<00:05:52.420> would<00:05:52.570> burn<00:05:52.780> up

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
school with a school that would burn up

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.840 
school with a school that would burn up
to<00:05:53.080> two<00:05:53.200> hundred<00:05:53.230> thousand<00:05:53.770> liters<00:05:54.040> yet<00:05:54.280> that

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:54.850 
to two hundred thousand liters yet that

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.180 
to two hundred thousand liters yet that
is<00:05:55.060> wood<00:05:56.020> chips<00:05:56.320> you<00:05:56.470> could<00:05:56.620> you<00:05:56.950> could<00:05:57.160> see

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
is wood chips you could you could see

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.730 
is wood chips you could you could see
and<00:05:58.030> so<00:05:58.240> what<00:05:58.480> would<00:05:58.600> be<00:05:58.660> the<00:05:58.780> payback<00:05:59.320> then<00:05:59.560> on

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
and so what would be the payback then on

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.860 
and so what would be the payback then on
the<00:05:59.890> furnace<00:06:00.280> like<00:06:00.490> this<00:06:00.760> for<00:06:01.150> a<00:06:01.480> school<00:06:01.840> that

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
the furnace like this for a school that

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.770 
the furnace like this for a school that
was<00:06:02.170> doing<00:06:02.320> that<00:06:02.520> just<00:06:03.520> cooled<00:06:03.880> out<00:06:04.060> sighs<00:06:04.330> and

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
was doing that just cooled out sighs and

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.450 
was doing that just cooled out sighs and
do<00:06:05.110> you<00:06:05.170> know<00:06:05.290> what<00:06:05.560> their<00:06:05.770> payback<00:06:06.010> would<00:06:06.280> be

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
do you know what their payback would be

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.540 
do you know what their payback would be
roughly<00:06:06.760> in<00:06:06.850> three<00:06:07.540> to<00:06:07.630> four<00:06:07.810> years<00:06:08.550> that

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:09.550 
roughly in three to four years that

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.600 
roughly in three to four years that
would<00:06:09.940> be<00:06:10.560> there<00:06:11.560> isn't<00:06:11.860> an<00:06:12.010> investment<00:06:12.580> you

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
would be there isn't an investment you

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.149 
would be there isn't an investment you
could<00:06:12.880> make<00:06:13.030> today

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
could make today

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:16.969 
could make today
-<00:06:14.339> exactly<00:06:14.969> so<00:06:15.059> there<00:06:15.449> is<00:06:15.599> that's<00:06:16.439> that's<00:06:16.800> what

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
- exactly so there is that's that's what

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.409 
- exactly so there is that's that's what
it<00:06:17.069> would<00:06:17.189> be<00:06:17.339> by<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.550> hundred<00:06:17.849> thousand<00:06:18.360> a

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
it would be by a hundred thousand a

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.729 
it would be by a hundred thousand a
hundred<00:06:18.509> thousand<00:06:19.050> for<00:06:19.229> a<00:06:19.259> baby<00:06:19.439> backward

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:19.739 
hundred thousand for a baby backward

00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:23.119 
hundred thousand for a baby backward
that<00:06:19.889> size<00:06:20.189> in<00:06:20.759> fact
