00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
implants and wrinkling I get on there

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920 
implants and wrinkling I get on there
the<00:00:20.039> implant<00:00:20.580> forms<00:00:20.910> quite<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.150> baton<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.869> do

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the implant forms quite a baton and I do

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.689 
the implant forms quite a baton and I do
hear<00:00:22.289> from<00:00:22.320> some<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.769> my<00:00:22.800> consult<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.310> people

are concerned about the issue of breast
implants<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:26.970> wrinkling<00:00:27.330> now<00:00:28.109> there<00:00:29.099> are

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
implants and wrinkling now there are

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.120 
implants and wrinkling now there are
some<00:00:29.609> types<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.060> implants<00:00:30.449> which<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:31.560> tend<00:00:31.859> to

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
some types of implants which do tend to

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.430 
some types of implants which do tend to
cause<00:00:32.340> or<00:00:32.850> actually<00:00:33.719> have<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.170> bit<00:00:34.260> more

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
cause or actually have a little bit more

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.620 
cause or actually have a little bit more
visible<00:00:34.670> wrinkling<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.790> those<00:00:36.270> are<00:00:36.450> the

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
visible wrinkling and those are the

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.660 
visible wrinkling and those are the
saline<00:00:37.020> implants<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.739> you<00:00:38.010> can<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.399> here

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
saline implants and you can see here

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.310 
saline implants and you can see here
when<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:39.329> hold<00:00:39.510> up<00:00:39.690> just<00:00:39.930> holding<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
when you hold up just holding the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.990 
when you hold up just holding the
implant<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.100> see<00:00:41.280> those<00:00:41.430> wrinkles<00:00:41.700> on

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
implant up you can see those wrinkles on

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.700 
implant up you can see those wrinkles on
the<00:00:42.120> surface<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.809> that's<00:00:43.079> pretty<00:00:43.379> much<00:00:43.530> how

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the surface and that's pretty much how

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.560 
the surface and that's pretty much how
the<00:00:43.770> implant<00:00:44.160> behaves<00:00:44.910> when<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.149> stuck<00:00:45.450> on

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the implant behaves when it stuck on

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.660 
the implant behaves when it stuck on
your<00:00:45.690> chest<00:00:45.930> wall<00:00:46.050> there<00:00:46.410> will<00:00:46.590> be<00:00:46.670> some

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
your chest wall there will be some

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.569 
your chest wall there will be some
wrinkling<00:00:48.270> visible<00:00:48.719> now<00:00:49.230> does<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.950> show<00:00:50.219> on

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
wrinkling visible now does it show on

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.310 
wrinkling visible now does it show on
every<00:00:50.879> patient<00:00:51.289> no<00:00:52.730> now<00:00:53.730> we<00:00:54.000> take<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.860> more

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
every patient no now we take the more

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.830 
every patient no now we take the more
gel<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.590> silicone<00:00:59.550> and<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.239> see<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.690> it's

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
gel like silicone and you see that it's

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.460 
gel like silicone and you see that it's
still<00:01:01.109> also<00:01:01.530> wrinkles<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:03.030> gel<00:01:03.809> implants<00:01:04.320> are

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
still also wrinkles so gel implants are

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.190 
still also wrinkles so gel implants are
not<00:01:04.949> immune<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.729> wrinkle<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.020> matter<00:01:07.170> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
not immune to wrinkle and as a matter of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.429 
not immune to wrinkle and as a matter of
fact<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.590> one<00:01:08.040> patient<00:01:08.490> who's<00:01:08.700> very

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
fact I have one patient who's very

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.760 
fact I have one patient who's very
skinny<00:01:10.439> with<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.710> very<00:01:10.920> thin<00:01:11.460> tissue<00:01:12.060> cover

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
skinny with a very thin tissue cover

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.249 
skinny with a very thin tissue cover
whose<00:01:13.770> implant<00:01:14.570> wrinkles<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.720> it's<00:01:15.840> visible

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
whose implant wrinkles and it's visible

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.920 
whose implant wrinkles and it's visible
okay<00:01:17.250> now<00:01:17.700> does<00:01:17.759> every<00:01:18.390> patient<00:01:18.810> with

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
okay now does every patient with

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.950 
okay now does every patient with
silicone<00:01:19.850> have<00:01:20.850> visible<00:01:21.540> invisible

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
silicone have visible invisible

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.880 
silicone have visible invisible
wrinkling<00:01:22.740> no<00:01:23.310> no<00:01:24.180> there's<00:01:24.990> another<00:01:25.470> type<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
wrinkling no no there's another type of

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.179 
wrinkling no no there's another type of
implant<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.670> has<00:01:27.150> even<00:01:27.750> less<00:01:28.619> wrinkling<00:01:29.040> as

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
implant that has even less wrinkling as

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.380 
implant that has even less wrinkling as
a<00:01:29.220> matter<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.490> fact<00:01:29.670> it's<00:01:29.820> recommended<00:01:30.360> for

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
a matter of fact it's recommended for

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.359 
a matter of fact it's recommended for
patients<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.020> breast<00:01:31.259> reconstruction<00:01:31.890> who

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
patients with breast reconstruction who

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
patients with breast reconstruction who
have<00:01:32.549> very<00:01:32.880> little<00:01:33.150> soft<00:01:33.509> tissue<00:01:33.720> cover<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
have very little soft tissue cover and

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.929 
have very little soft tissue cover and
that's<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.710> gummy<00:01:34.950> bear<00:01:35.189> implant<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.850> a

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
that's a gummy bear implant it's a

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.620 
that's a gummy bear implant it's a
stiffer<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.380> silicone<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.479> this<00:01:39.479> is

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
stiffer kind of a silicone and this is

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.160 
stiffer kind of a silicone and this is
for<00:01:39.780> example<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.200> Botox<00:01:40.770> implant<00:01:41.869> not<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> gummy

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
for example a Botox implant not a gummy

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.800 
for example a Botox implant not a gummy
bear<00:01:43.259> implant<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.119> thickness

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
bear implant but you know the thickness

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.870 
bear implant but you know the thickness
and<00:01:46.229> consistency<00:01:46.860> is<00:01:47.040> similar<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.700> it's

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
and consistency is similar in that it's

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.240 
and consistency is similar in that it's
very<00:01:48.030> stiff<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.990> doesn't<00:01:49.500> wrinkle<00:01:49.770> but

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
very stiff and it it doesn't wrinkle but

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.069 
very stiff and it it doesn't wrinkle but
you<00:01:50.700> know<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:50.850> pay<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> price<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.689> implant

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you know you pay a price the implant

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.230 
you know you pay a price the implant
does<00:01:52.259> feel<00:01:52.470> hard<00:01:52.770> or<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.040> doesn't<00:01:53.280> feel<00:01:53.909> like<00:01:54.180> a

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
does feel hard or it doesn't feel like a

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.999 
does feel hard or it doesn't feel like a
nice<00:01:54.509> soft<00:01:55.170> breast

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
nice soft breast

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.399 
nice soft breast
now<00:01:57.829> the<00:01:58.829> two<00:01:59.040> things<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.700> really<00:01:59.939> matter

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
now the two things that really matter

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.889 
now the two things that really matter
then<00:02:01.409> are<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.549> consistency<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.659> soft

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
then are the consistency of the soft

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.620 
then are the consistency of the soft
tissue<00:02:04.110> cover<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:05.790> material<00:02:06.299> itself

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
tissue cover and the material itself

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.809 
tissue cover and the material itself
know<00:02:07.049> for<00:02:07.350> example<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.829> you<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.099> thicker

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
know for example if you have thicker

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.130 
know for example if you have thicker
skin<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:09.569> fat

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
skin and fat

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.170 
skin and fat
you<00:02:11.380> will<00:02:11.530> tend<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:11.800> see<00:02:11.890> wrinkling<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.880> little

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
you will tend to see wrinkling a little

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.470 
you will tend to see wrinkling a little
bit<00:02:13.270> less<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:14.760> muscles<00:02:15.760> also<00:02:16.030> are<00:02:16.240> very

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
bit less and muscles also are very

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.380 
bit less and muscles also are very
important<00:02:17.020> because<00:02:17.310> muscles<00:02:18.310> have<00:02:18.610> tone<00:02:19.030> a

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
important because muscles have tone a

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.410 
important because muscles have tone a
muscle<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.170> active<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.490> forms<00:02:21.970> a<00:02:22.120> kind<00:02:22.300> of

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
muscle is active and it forms a kind of

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.410 
muscle is active and it forms a kind of
barrier<00:02:22.990> to<00:02:23.440> the<00:02:23.590> wrinkling<00:02:24.310> so<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.760> even

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
barrier to the wrinkling so that even

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.420 
barrier to the wrinkling so that even
though<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:26.290> implant<00:02:26.709> might<00:02:26.860> be<00:02:26.980> wrinkling

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
though the implant might be wrinkling

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.180 
though the implant might be wrinkling
underneath<00:02:27.880> if<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.630> muscle<00:02:29.200> itself<00:02:29.770> has<00:02:29.980> some

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.280 
underneath if the muscle itself has some
tone<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:31.000> won't<00:02:31.209> necessarily<00:02:31.390> see<00:02:32.140> them

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
tone you won't necessarily see them

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.690 
tone you won't necessarily see them
wrinkling<00:02:32.709> now<00:02:34.980> let's<00:02:35.980> take<00:02:36.130> an<00:02:36.250> illustration

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
wrinkling now let's take an illustration

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.640 
wrinkling now let's take an illustration
of<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.000> chest<00:02:37.239> wall<00:02:37.420> here<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:38.200> know<00:02:38.320> what<00:02:38.530> do

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
of the chest wall here you know what do

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.470 
of the chest wall here you know what do
people<00:02:38.860> mean<00:02:39.130> when<00:02:39.310> they<00:02:39.340> say<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:40.360> the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
people mean when they say that the

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.540 
people mean when they say that the
implant<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.900> under<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.410> muscle<00:02:41.739> well<00:02:42.160> you

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
implant is under the muscle well you

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.370 
implant is under the muscle well you
know<00:02:42.640> it's<00:02:42.790> not<00:02:42.910> really<00:02:43.120> totally<00:02:43.870> under<00:02:44.260> the

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
know it's not really totally under the

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.900 
know it's not really totally under the
muscle<00:02:44.709> because<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.070> muscles<00:02:45.370> are<00:02:45.489> stuck<00:02:45.760> to

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
muscle because the muscles are stuck to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.120 
muscle because the muscles are stuck to
the<00:02:46.000> chest<00:02:46.270> cage<00:02:46.480> so<00:02:47.020> it's<00:02:47.140> impossible<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:47.920> fit

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
the chest cage so it's impossible to fit

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.790 
the chest cage so it's impossible to fit
an<00:02:48.220> implant<00:02:48.610> totally<00:02:49.510> underneath<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.470> muscle

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
an implant totally underneath the muscle

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.070 
an implant totally underneath the muscle
so<00:02:51.280> what<00:02:51.519> we<00:02:51.640> do<00:02:51.790> is<00:02:51.910> we<00:02:52.120> make<00:02:52.300> an<00:02:52.690> incision

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
so what we do is we make an incision

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.130 
so what we do is we make an incision
over<00:02:53.470> here<00:02:53.769> on<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.130> PEC<00:02:54.340> major<00:02:54.519> muscle<00:02:55.140> to

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
over here on the PEC major muscle to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.650 
over here on the PEC major muscle to
slip<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.650> implant<00:02:57.040> underneath<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.790> now<00:02:58.330> in

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
slip the implant underneath it now in

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.490 
slip the implant underneath it now in
the<00:02:58.810> routine<00:02:59.320> case<00:02:59.820> that<00:03:00.959> implant<00:03:01.959> is<00:03:02.140> only

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
the routine case that implant is only

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.070 
the routine case that implant is only
really<00:03:03.010> partially<00:03:03.880> over<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.390> muscle<00:03:04.810> in

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
really partially over the muscle in

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.690 
really partially over the muscle in
other<00:03:05.290> words<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.680> covered<00:03:05.980> on<00:03:06.100> the<00:03:06.220> top<00:03:06.489> by

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
other words it's covered on the top by

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.330 
other words it's covered on the top by
the<00:03:06.730> muscle<00:03:07.209> but<00:03:07.600> below<00:03:08.050> is<00:03:08.350> not<00:03:08.650> covered<00:03:09.160> by

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
the muscle but below is not covered by

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.910 
the muscle but below is not covered by
muscle<00:03:09.730> it's<00:03:09.850> just<00:03:10.060> skin<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:11.080> whatever<00:03:11.320> fatty

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
muscle it's just skin and whatever fatty

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.860 
muscle it's just skin and whatever fatty
tissues<00:03:12.400> you<00:03:12.519> have<00:03:12.700> underneath<00:03:13.150> it<00:03:13.360> no<00:03:15.870> let's

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
tissues you have underneath it no let's

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.660 
tissues you have underneath it no let's
take<00:03:17.049> this<00:03:17.230> mock-up<00:03:17.709> of<00:03:17.829> an<00:03:17.980> implant<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.489> here

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
take this mock-up of an implant in here

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.729 
take this mock-up of an implant in here
so<00:03:18.850> here's<00:03:19.299> an<00:03:19.450> implant<00:03:19.810> that's<00:03:19.989> not<00:03:20.200> wrinkled

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
so here's an implant that's not wrinkled

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.890 
so here's an implant that's not wrinkled
or<00:03:20.890> anything<00:03:21.130> with<00:03:21.549> its<00:03:21.700> shell<00:03:21.940> but<00:03:22.570> let's<00:03:22.750> say

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
or anything with its shell but let's say

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.550 
or anything with its shell but let's say
here<00:03:23.290> it<00:03:23.470> wrinkles<00:03:24.010> okay<00:03:24.430> now<00:03:25.120> if<00:03:25.540> your<00:03:26.140> skin

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
here it wrinkles okay now if your skin

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.740 
here it wrinkles okay now if your skin
and<00:03:26.829> fat<00:03:27.160> is<00:03:27.370> thin<00:03:27.670> more<00:03:28.180> or<00:03:28.269> less<00:03:28.390> like<00:03:28.600> in

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
and fat is thin more or less like in

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.830 
and fat is thin more or less like in
this<00:03:28.900> line<00:03:29.140> here<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:30.180> you<00:03:31.180> see<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.510> wrinkle

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
this line here and you see the wrinkle

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.120 
this line here and you see the wrinkle
will<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.170> skin<00:03:32.410> is<00:03:32.530> pretty<00:03:32.739> much<00:03:32.920> gonna

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
will the skin is pretty much gonna

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.130 
will the skin is pretty much gonna
follow<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.730> wrinkle<00:03:34.150> and<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:34.600> it's<00:03:34.840> gonna<00:03:34.959> be

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
follow the wrinkle and and it's gonna be

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.280 
follow the wrinkle and and it's gonna be
very<00:03:35.320> visible<00:03:35.670> now<00:03:36.670> if<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.510> have<00:03:37.660> a<00:03:37.690> thicker

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
very visible now if you have a thicker

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.120 
very visible now if you have a thicker
skin<00:03:38.650> up<00:03:39.130> fat<00:03:39.370> coverage<00:03:40.410> well<00:03:41.410> it's<00:03:41.680> not<00:03:41.890> gonna

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
skin up fat coverage well it's not gonna

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.400 
skin up fat coverage well it's not gonna
show<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.549> wrinkle<00:03:42.910> as<00:03:43.030> much<00:03:43.329> and<00:03:43.690> you<00:03:44.200> know<00:03:44.230> of

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
show the wrinkle as much and you know of

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.340 
show the wrinkle as much and you know of
course<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.860> more<00:03:45.100> as<00:03:45.570> fat<00:03:46.570> and<00:03:46.870> breast<00:03:47.140> tissue

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
course the more as fat and breast tissue

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.310 
course the more as fat and breast tissue
you<00:03:47.560> have<00:03:47.590> under<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.700> less<00:03:49.630> amount<00:03:50.079> of

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
you have under the less amount of

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.259 
you have under the less amount of
wrinkling<00:03:51.040> you're<00:03:51.370> gonna<00:03:51.549> be<00:03:51.670> able<00:03:51.760> to<00:03:51.910> see

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
wrinkling you're gonna be able to see

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.270 
wrinkling you're gonna be able to see
but<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.510> know<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:52.780> could<00:03:53.019> still<00:03:53.320> see<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.739> so

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
but you know you could still see it so

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.640 
but you know you could still see it so
if<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:54.489> had<00:03:54.640> a<00:03:54.670> choice<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.420> would<00:03:55.510> rather<00:03:55.780> use

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
if you had a choice you would rather use

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.220 
if you had a choice you would rather use
a<00:03:56.680> silicone<00:03:57.670> implant<00:03:57.700> because<00:03:58.239> it's<00:03:59.019> not

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
a silicone implant because it's not

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.199 
a silicone implant because it's not
gonna<00:03:59.350> be<00:03:59.560> seen<00:03:59.769> as<00:03:59.950> easily<00:04:00.459> but<00:04:00.910> you're<00:04:01.090> not

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
gonna be seen as easily but you're not

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.490 
gonna be seen as easily but you're not
totally<00:04:01.660> immune<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:01.989> it<00:04:02.380> now<00:04:04.170> if<00:04:05.170> you're

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
totally immune to it now if you're

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.949 
totally immune to it now if you're
covering<00:04:05.920> with<00:04:06.190> muscle<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:07.180> muscle<00:04:07.510> has

covering with muscle the muscle has

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:08.610 
covering with muscle the muscle has
toned

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
toned

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.520

it's<00:04:09.070> active<00:04:09.760> independently<00:04:10.660> of<00:04:10.870> what<00:04:11.380> the

it's active independently of what the

it's active independently of what the
implant<00:04:11.950> is<00:04:12.130> doing<00:04:12.430> so<00:04:12.850> although<00:04:13.150> you<00:04:13.510> may

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
implant is doing so although you may

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.110 
implant is doing so although you may
have<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.930> very<00:04:14.440> thin<00:04:14.859> skin<00:04:15.459> and<00:04:15.640> fat<00:04:15.970> tissue

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
have a very thin skin and fat tissue

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.569 
have a very thin skin and fat tissue
covered<00:04:16.600> if<00:04:16.840> you<00:04:17.260> have<00:04:17.410> a<00:04:17.440> good<00:04:17.769> muscle<00:04:18.310> cover

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
covered if you have a good muscle cover

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.940 
covered if you have a good muscle cover
it'll<00:04:19.269> tend<00:04:19.510> to<00:04:19.660> camouflage<00:04:20.019> the<00:04:20.560> wrinkling

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
it'll tend to camouflage the wrinkling

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.600 
it'll tend to camouflage the wrinkling
very<00:04:21.489> well<00:04:21.849> now<00:04:22.780> for<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.590> reason

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
very well now for this reason

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.270 
very well now for this reason
I<00:04:24.669> have<00:04:24.939> modified<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.599> way<00:04:25.750> I<00:04:25.990> do<00:04:26.110> my<00:04:26.620> quote

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
I have modified the way I do my quote

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.020 
I have modified the way I do my quote
under<00:04:27.580> the<00:04:27.879> muscle<00:04:28.270> unquote<00:04:28.750> implants<00:04:30.030> now

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
under the muscle unquote implants now

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.230 
under the muscle unquote implants now
let's<00:04:31.689> take<00:04:31.930> for<00:04:32.530> example<00:04:32.729> here's<00:04:33.729> the<00:04:33.969> case

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
let's take for example here's the case

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.469 
let's take for example here's the case
of<00:04:34.509> the<00:04:35.020> implant<00:04:36.009> that's<00:04:36.219> partially<00:04:36.939> under

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
of the implant that's partially under

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.170 
of the implant that's partially under
the<00:04:37.599> muscle<00:04:38.020> but<00:04:38.770> then<00:04:38.919> exposed<00:04:39.099> in<00:04:39.669> here

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
the muscle but then exposed in here

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.499 
the muscle but then exposed in here
now<00:04:40.659> what<00:04:41.020> happens<00:04:41.500> is<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:43.000> area<00:04:43.330> that's

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
now what happens is the area that's

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.170 
now what happens is the area that's
under<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.139> muscle<00:04:44.500> is<00:04:44.650> well<00:04:45.039> covered<00:04:45.400> so

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
under the muscle is well covered so

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.450 
under the muscle is well covered so
these<00:04:46.750> implants<00:04:47.319> usually<00:04:47.770> don't<00:04:48.039> show<00:04:48.250> much

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
these implants usually don't show much

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.640 
these implants usually don't show much
wrinkling<00:04:48.939> above<00:04:49.270> which<00:04:49.870> is<00:04:50.050> okay<00:04:50.469> because

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
wrinkling above which is okay because

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.290 
wrinkling above which is okay because
most<00:04:51.039> people<00:04:51.340> when<00:04:51.520> they're<00:04:51.669> dressed<00:04:52.030> that's

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
most people when they're dressed that's

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.300 
most people when they're dressed that's
the<00:04:52.479> area<00:04:52.840> that's<00:04:53.319> uncovered<00:04:53.949> so<00:04:54.129> they're

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
the area that's uncovered so they're

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.080 
the area that's uncovered so they're
gonna<00:04:54.490> have<00:04:54.759> their<00:04:55.629> implants<00:04:56.520> not<00:04:57.520> showing<00:04:57.909> a

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
gonna have their implants not showing a

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.260 
gonna have their implants not showing a
wrinkling<00:04:58.569> however<00:04:59.199> on<00:04:59.349> the<00:04:59.500> side<00:05:00.270> where

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
wrinkling however on the side where

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.740 
wrinkling however on the side where
there<00:05:01.509> is<00:05:01.659> very<00:05:02.050> thin<00:05:02.620> tissue<00:05:02.979> coverage<00:05:03.750> you

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
there is very thin tissue coverage you

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.050 
there is very thin tissue coverage you
may<00:05:04.960> see<00:05:05.020> wrinkling<00:05:05.650> not<00:05:06.069> on<00:05:06.340> the<00:05:06.520> other<00:05:06.699> hand

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
may see wrinkling not on the other hand

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.869 
may see wrinkling not on the other hand
if<00:05:07.569> the<00:05:07.960> patient<00:05:08.500> has<00:05:08.770> a<00:05:08.800> little<00:05:09.189> bit<00:05:09.279> more<00:05:09.550> fat

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:09.879 
if the patient has a little bit more fat

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:12.510 
if the patient has a little bit more fat
and<00:05:09.909> subcutaneous<00:05:10.750> tissue<00:05:10.990> you<00:05:11.740> may<00:05:11.919> not<00:05:12.219> see

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:12.520 
and subcutaneous tissue you may not see

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.149 
and subcutaneous tissue you may not see
the<00:05:12.699> wrinkling<00:05:13.029> as<00:05:13.270> much<00:05:14.400> no<00:05:15.750> let's<00:05:16.750> take<00:05:17.159> the

00:05:18.149 --> 00:05:18.159 
the wrinkling as much no let's take the

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:23.369 
the wrinkling as much no let's take the
case<00:05:19.379> of<00:05:20.379> an<00:05:20.650> implant<00:05:21.039> that's<00:05:22.199> under<00:05:23.199> the

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
case of an implant that's under the

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.019 
case of an implant that's under the
muscle<00:05:23.710> in<00:05:23.830> here<00:05:24.159> I<00:05:24.310> drew<00:05:24.759> a<00:05:26.279> wedge<00:05:27.279> of<00:05:27.610> where<00:05:28.000> I

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:28.029 
muscle in here I drew a wedge of where I

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:31.350 
muscle in here I drew a wedge of where I
slip<00:05:28.449> the<00:05:28.629> implant<00:05:29.110> underneath<00:05:29.379> the<00:05:30.360> serratus

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
slip the implant underneath the serratus

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.899 
slip the implant underneath the serratus
muscles<00:05:31.389> which<00:05:32.110> are<00:05:32.259> here<00:05:32.650> and<00:05:32.800> the<00:05:33.310> external

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
muscles which are here and the external

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.999 
muscles which are here and the external
oblique<00:05:34.210> muscles<00:05:34.690> and<00:05:35.050> under<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.620> pectoralis

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:36.009 
oblique muscles and under the pectoralis

00:05:36.009 --> 00:05:37.019 
oblique muscles and under the pectoralis
major<00:05:36.490> muscle

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:37.029 
major muscle

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:39.570 
major muscle
so<00:05:37.629> this<00:05:37.779> implant<00:05:38.169> is<00:05:38.349> not<00:05:38.379> totally<00:05:39.279> under<00:05:39.550> the

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
so this implant is not totally under the

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.050 
so this implant is not totally under the
muscle<00:05:40.029> but<00:05:40.509> it's<00:05:41.009> mostly<00:05:42.009> under<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.520> muscle

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
muscle but it's mostly under the muscle

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.269 
muscle but it's mostly under the muscle
okay<00:05:43.659> so<00:05:43.719> this<00:05:44.139> is<00:05:44.319> the<00:05:44.440> only<00:05:44.560> area<00:05:44.889> that's

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:45.279 
okay so this is the only area that's

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.399 
okay so this is the only area that's
exposed<00:05:45.729> but<00:05:46.389> you<00:05:46.509> know<00:05:46.629> most<00:05:46.870> of<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.110> breast

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:47.409 
exposed but you know most of the breast

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:49.439 
exposed but you know most of the breast
mass<00:05:47.680> is<00:05:47.919> in<00:05:48.099> here<00:05:48.430> and<00:05:48.550> the<00:05:48.639> nipple<00:05:49.029> areolar

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:49.449 
mass is in here and the nipple areolar

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.200 
mass is in here and the nipple areolar
complex<00:05:49.810> are<00:05:50.199> here<00:05:50.560> now<00:05:51.339> what<00:05:51.729> happens<00:05:52.150> here

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 
complex are here now what happens here

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.019 
complex are here now what happens here
is<00:05:52.449> that<00:05:52.599> all<00:05:53.050> the<00:05:53.500> areas<00:05:54.009> that<00:05:54.490> might<00:05:54.729> wrinkle

00:05:55.019 --> 00:05:55.029 
is that all the areas that might wrinkle

00:05:55.029 --> 00:05:57.779 
is that all the areas that might wrinkle
are<00:05:55.659> covered<00:05:56.139> by<00:05:56.319> muscle<00:05:56.830> and<00:05:57.370> since<00:05:57.669> the

00:05:57.779 --> 00:05:57.789 
are covered by muscle and since the

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:00.540 
are covered by muscle and since the
muscle<00:05:58.240> has<00:05:58.330> tone<00:05:59.009> it<00:06:00.009> will<00:06:00.069> tend<00:06:00.460> to

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
muscle has tone it will tend to

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.999 
muscle has tone it will tend to
camouflage<00:06:00.939> it<00:06:01.330> very<00:06:01.539> well<00:06:01.810> so<00:06:02.680> I<00:06:02.710> feel<00:06:02.979> that

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 
camouflage it very well so I feel that

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.769 
camouflage it very well so I feel that
this<00:06:03.400> technique<00:06:03.909> is<00:06:04.150> much<00:06:05.110> better<00:06:05.500> at

00:06:06.769 --> 00:06:06.779 
this technique is much better at

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:12.050 
this technique is much better at
camouflaging<00:06:07.779> wrinkles<00:06:08.500> that<00:06:09.129> the<00:06:09.969> other

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
camouflaging wrinkles that the other

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.779 
camouflaging wrinkles that the other
so-called<00:06:13.080> soft<00:06:14.080> muscular<00:06:14.680> technique<00:06:15.159> now

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
so-called soft muscular technique now

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:17.610 
so-called soft muscular technique now
this<00:06:16.029> technique<00:06:16.449> you<00:06:16.750> know<00:06:16.870> like<00:06:17.110> everything

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
this technique you know like everything

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.339 
this technique you know like everything
it<00:06:17.740> has<00:06:17.889> a<00:06:17.919> pros<00:06:18.400> and<00:06:18.430> cons<00:06:18.729> now<00:06:19.689> it<00:06:19.900> does<00:06:20.110> tend

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
it has a pros and cons now it does tend

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:21.959 
it has a pros and cons now it does tend
to<00:06:20.439> be<00:06:20.500> a<00:06:20.589> little<00:06:20.860> bit<00:06:21.009> more<00:06:21.189> painful<00:06:21.460> because

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:21.969 
to be a little bit more painful because

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:24.689 
to be a little bit more painful because
you<00:06:22.089> elevate<00:06:22.629> more<00:06:22.900> muscle<00:06:23.439> and<00:06:23.620> that<00:06:24.310> in<00:06:24.610> a

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
you elevate more muscle and that in a

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:26.279 
you elevate more muscle and that in a
sense<00:06:24.729> is<00:06:25.120> why<00:06:25.300> you<00:06:25.839> know<00:06:25.930> I'm<00:06:26.050> such<00:06:26.259> a

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:26.289
