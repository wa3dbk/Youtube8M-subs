00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.330
 Hello everyone and welcome to a new one 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.550
 video of the site of the grafts today of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.890
 what are we going to talk about today we will go to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.950
 talk about the after graft which means 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.439
 after grafting in later it means 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:34.200
 the care of the graft 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.510
 gem that is split to crown 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.640
 then after taking root then 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.260
 when the shoots have lengthened by 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.390
 about 40 50 cm also, in short, you are 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.030
 stretched even 23 centimeters later 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.949
 graft is always necessary stand 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.159
 making this video with a bit of 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:54.809
 late but in the end not so much 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:57.149
 because I believe the size of this 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.800
 graft is just right for maintaining 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.739
 this type of video 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.309
 if you remember this is the graft a 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.110
 made gem this summer if you 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.620
 remember this agreement we did it 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.650
 during the video called how to do 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.320
 the graft line massacre this is a port 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.680
 in an almond tree where it has been 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.920
 grafted to a dormant gem a variety 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.579
 apricot tree let's see how to proceed 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.670
 post graft care 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.950
 let's say you first need to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.680
 remove the tie because like 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.840
 we can see is creating is creating 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.799
 a bottleneck here at the base of the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.549
 so let's proceed by removing tie 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:47.329
 made with the raffia ara feces 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:51.200
 will be particularly let's say 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:02:02.420
 degraded and therefore it will be very easy 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:04.340
 intervene in the binding phase one 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.890
 time if they tie the graft we must 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.649
 proceed to remove all the sprouts 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.709
 that come out on the graft portal 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.480
 because in fact they are wild so if 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.750
 we will grow these sprouts 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:22.090
 tiqui we will get wild twigs 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:25.370
 that go to attract nourishment from 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.860
 from the port ns therefore eliminating the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.950
 therefore nutritive resources to graft 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:37.150
 let's proceed by cleaning all the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.150
 buds present on the nestor portal 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:43.910
 the other operation to perform that 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:47.900
 of the elimination of the leaves 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.870
 at the base this will allow us to 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.090
 better visualize the engraftment 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:59.750
 then to see how to proceed 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:03.730
 take root you see that one results 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.730
 cleaner graft area 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.049
 then we can see that they come out 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.190
 all these early twigs 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.590
 we can pay for these items 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.510
 take them off because they will never serve us 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.130
 to create enpa the scaffolding one 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.579
 once planted because we see that 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.650
 it is found that they are around 40 50 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.620
 inches to the ground and not usually 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.200
 scaffolding is not done at 40 or 50 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.239
 centimeters from the ground 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.900
 so we can decide from the base 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:42.099
 these twigs without removing the leaves 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.099
 underlying therefore in this way 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.580
 in this way we will give the possibility to 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.830
 this to this one- year-old boat 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.230
 then to grow and then to imphal carlo 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:16.220
 we can remove all these ramen 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.220
 tini leaving about 2 or 3 per 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.250
 bridget well the graft will have to turn out 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:27.440
 in this way with only the leaves 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:30.949
 to the main stony and buds 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.600
 ethical will create branches at the apex 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.910
 because they are still small we make them 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.850
 stretch some more and those to 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.830
 base let's say along the li axis 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.520
 we have removed we have taken some leaves 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.919
 here to better discover the area 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.750
 grafted area and we have removed all the 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.289
 shoots that form on the door 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.720
 wild graft once this is done 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:57.260
 There is nothing else for us to do 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.270
 than waiting for the autumn or the next 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.280
 winter to plant 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.510
 this plant which of course there 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:08.570
 gianni ficcata will appear and in the 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.190
 in the winter that will come in two years 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.430
 we will proceed with pruning 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.340
 of breeding in which we will address the 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.580
 branches in their direction and we will choose 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.470
 better ones if you have some 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.599
 question sign up on our forum 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.700

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.340
