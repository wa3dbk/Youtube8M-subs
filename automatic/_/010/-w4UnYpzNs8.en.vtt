00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.190
 Well, nothing will I explain to you 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.090
 little the difference of surfboards and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.070
 explain a little what comes to be a 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.980
 longboard table is worth the opposite of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.360
 what people can think of a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.770
 Language table requires a lot of technique 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.920
 it's very easy so it's at the time of 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.449
 stand on top of her because the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.070
 East area was very well take a 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.260
 mogollÃ³n of inertia to be a little 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.420
 more and have so much volume and be so 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.370
 wide they take a lot of energy then it 's 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.480
 super easy what it is to get well 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.120
 on top of her 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.190
 the difference between a table of 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.989
 mini malibu station is that with the 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.970
 minimal and box basically super easy 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.220
 stand up also but does not require 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.400
 so much technique because in this table for 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:04.000
 to be able to maneuver with her you need to step on 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.809
 the backwards forward this table of 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.809
 surf not friday 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.259
 and if you look here this would be like the 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:15.570
 point the table 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:19.100
 the piecitos are drawn and it would be for 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.010
 what it is to walk to the table 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.250
 crossing the feet 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:30.080
 until you get here to the tip of the table 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.500
 and get to get what would be one of 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.270
 the maneuvers that score the most in 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.060
 on the board of what would be a 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.500
 classic maneuver at the same time for 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.680
 to be able to maneuver with it would have to leave 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.540
 up behind the whole to do well of 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.510
 pressure on the back leg to be able 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.610
 put the plank in what is the wave and 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.880
 then you can go superclassic by the 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.480
 half of the plank and it's a super surfing 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.790
 relaxed very pure very natural 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.150
 and good at the beginning everyone 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.950
 started with these big boards and 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.830
 it's like I eat the cleanest the most 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:14.260
 purist of everything 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:14.260
 of safar loin that would be a great bank 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.610
 your
