00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
so this thing tuned it's I think the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.200 
so this thing tuned it's I think the
original<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.739> played<00:00:50.070> by<00:00:50.340> two<00:00:50.370> Steelman<00:00:51.059> on

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
the chromatic harmonica so for real

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.060 
the chromatic harmonica so for real
authenticity<00:00:54.449> use<00:00:55.410> a<00:00:55.440> chromatic<00:00:55.739> harmonica

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
authenticity use a chromatic harmonica

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.770 
authenticity use a chromatic harmonica
however<00:00:56.789> if<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.210> playing<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
however if you like playing on a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.110 
however if you like playing on a
diatonic<00:00:58.469> let's<00:00:58.859> have<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> go<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.820> if<00:00:59.879> we<00:00:59.969> can

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
diatonic let's have a go see if we can

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.600 
diatonic let's have a go see if we can
do<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:01.789> now<00:01:02.789> we're<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.239> play<00:01:03.449> this<00:01:03.660> tune

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
do it now we're going to play this tune

do it now we're going to play this tune
starting<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.790> six<00:01:06.270> blow<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.979> reason<00:01:11.310> for

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
starting on six blow and the reason for

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.630 
starting on six blow and the reason for
that<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.970> because<00:01:12.950> I've<00:01:13.950> got<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.310> into<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:14.520> head

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that is because I've got it into my head

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.999 
that is because I've got it into my head
that<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> key<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.680> played

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
that that was the key that it's played

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.300 
that that was the key that it's played
on<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.869> movie<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.950> fact<00:01:20.130> I'm

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
on the on the movie and in fact I'm

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:29.140 
on the on the movie and in fact I'm
wrong<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.790> starts<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> four<00:01:22.799> draw<00:01:27.860> but

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
wrong it's starts on a four draw but

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.850 
wrong it's starts on a four draw but
I'll<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:30.229> just<00:01:31.229> for<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.470> sake<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I'll just just for the sake of the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.100 
I'll just just for the sake of the
exercise<00:01:31.939> I'll<00:01:32.939> show<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.240> how<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.540> do<00:01:33.810> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
exercise I'll show you how to do it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.530 
exercise I'll show you how to do it
starting<00:01:34.799> on<00:01:34.920> six<00:01:35.729> play<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.210> see<00:01:36.420> how

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
starting on six play on a see how

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.840 
starting on six play on a see how
Hanukkah<00:01:39.829> and<00:01:40.829> then<00:01:40.979> I'll<00:01:41.040> do<00:01:41.189> another<00:01:41.520> video

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
Hanukkah and then I'll do another video

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.219 
Hanukkah and then I'll do another video
possibly<00:01:44.850> add<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:46.200> show

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
possibly add it on to this one to show

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.289 
possibly add it on to this one to show
you<00:01:46.439> how<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.130> done<00:01:47.220> in<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:48.619> correct<00:01:49.619> key

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
you how it's done in the the correct key

00:01:50.299 --> 00:02:13.870 
you how it's done in the the correct key
all<00:01:51.299> right<00:01:51.409> stay<00:01:52.409> tuned

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.790 

so<00:02:14.880> then<00:02:15.000> if<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.330> hear<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.569> there's<00:02:16.440> one

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
so then if you can hear it there's one

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.400 
so then if you can hear it there's one
rather<00:02:17.489> strange<00:02:17.880> note<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.330> it<00:02:18.420> I'm<00:02:19.019> trying<00:02:19.349> to

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
rather strange note in it I'm trying to

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.780 
rather strange note in it I'm trying to
disguise<00:02:19.709> it<00:02:19.980> but<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.220> probably<00:02:20.340> heard<00:02:20.610> it

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
disguise it but you probably heard it

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:29.920 
disguise it but you probably heard it
okay<00:02:21.780> so<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.019> first<00:02:22.050> bit<00:02:23.870> cz6<00:02:24.870> blow<00:02:26.959> five<00:02:27.959> draw

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
okay so the first bit cz6 blow five draw

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.559 
okay so the first bit cz6 blow five draw
fire<00:02:30.930> blow-for-blow<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.090> can<00:02:36.239> put<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.420> bit

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
fire blow-for-blow and you can put a bit

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.479 
fire blow-for-blow and you can put a bit
of<00:02:36.660> vibrato<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:37.200> bit<00:02:37.380> of<00:02:37.470> bending<00:02:37.890> on<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.160> few

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
of vibrato a bit of bending on that few

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:47.170 
of vibrato a bit of bending on that few
or<00:02:39.060> if<00:02:39.209> you<00:02:39.299> like<00:02:39.480> their<00:02:39.739> campfire<00:02:40.739> thing<00:02:44.930> I

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
or if you like their campfire thing I

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:56.800 
or if you like their campfire thing I
don't<00:02:48.180> personally<00:02:48.510> but<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:49.049> might<00:02:49.230> love<00:02:49.380> it

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.110 

to<00:02:57.810> commend<00:02:58.140> those<00:02:58.230> so<00:02:58.470> it's<00:02:58.590> six<00:02:58.829> blow<00:02:59.120> five

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
to commend those so it's six blow five

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.170 
to commend those so it's six blow five
draw<00:03:00.510> five<00:03:01.440> blow<00:03:01.769> for<00:03:02.459> blow<00:03:02.489> that's<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.940> first

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
draw five blow for blow that's the first

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.069 
draw five blow for blow that's the first
bit<00:03:03.360> easy-peasy

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
bit easy-peasy

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.009 
bit easy-peasy
so<00:03:04.799> come<00:03:04.950> it's<00:03:05.099> less<00:03:05.459> easy<00:03:05.870> starts<00:03:06.870> with<00:03:06.959> a

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
so come it's less easy starts with a

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:15.740 
so come it's less easy starts with a
four<00:03:07.230> over<00:03:07.530> blow<00:03:11.989> then<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.079> four<00:03:13.290> draw<00:03:14.630> in<00:03:15.630> the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
four over blow then a four draw in the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:24.480 
four over blow then a four draw in the
four<00:03:15.930> blow<00:03:17.870> three<00:03:18.870> draw<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.109> single<00:03:19.440> Bend

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.360 

some<00:03:24.850> of<00:03:24.910> these<00:03:24.970> are<00:03:25.120> quite<00:03:25.210> hard<00:03:25.510> to<00:03:25.600> pitch<00:03:26.370> so

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
some of these are quite hard to pitch so

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.590 
some of these are quite hard to pitch so
playing<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.730> round<00:03:27.940> and<00:03:28.060> round<00:03:28.120> will<00:03:28.390> help

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
playing it round and round will help

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.690 
playing it round and round will help
playing<00:03:29.050> it<00:03:29.140> in<00:03:29.230> context<00:03:29.770> will<00:03:30.010> help<00:03:30.220> if

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
playing it in context will help if

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:31.830 
playing it in context will help if
someone's<00:03:31.000> playing<00:03:31.210> the<00:03:31.330> other<00:03:31.450> part<00:03:31.690> on<00:03:31.780> a

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
someone's playing the other part on a

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.080 
someone's playing the other part on a
piano<00:03:32.050> or<00:03:32.460> some<00:03:33.460> other<00:03:33.610> point<00:03:33.880> of<00:03:33.940> reference

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
piano or some other point of reference

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.490 
piano or some other point of reference
it's<00:03:34.480> gone<00:03:34.630> already<00:03:34.750> so<00:03:35.080> let's<00:03:35.170> just<00:03:35.380> play

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
it's gone already so let's just play

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:58.260 
it's gone already so let's just play
through<00:03:35.680> the<00:03:35.830> tune<00:03:36.280> a<00:03:36.310> couple<00:03:36.640> times<00:03:57.270> there's

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 
through the tune a couple times there's

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.670 
through the tune a couple times there's
probably<00:03:58.540> other<00:03:58.690> ways<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:59.110> playing<00:03:59.320> it<00:03:59.530> on

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
probably other ways of playing it on

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.140 
probably other ways of playing it on
different<00:03:59.890> harmonicas<00:04:00.610> in<00:04:00.760> different

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
different harmonicas in different

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.610 
different harmonicas in different
positions<00:04:01.930> so<00:04:03.450> see<00:04:04.450> how<00:04:04.570> you<00:04:04.630> go<00:04:04.870> with<00:04:05.080> that<00:04:05.230> if

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
positions so see how you go with that if

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.230 
positions so see how you go with that if
you<00:04:05.770> can<00:04:05.950> if<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.400> can<00:04:06.520> do<00:04:06.640> this<00:04:06.760> overblowing

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
you can if you can do this overblowing

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.150 
you can if you can do this overblowing
thing<00:04:07.570> it's<00:04:08.170> really<00:04:08.530> handy<00:04:08.830> because<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:09.070> means

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
thing it's really handy because it means

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.880 
thing it's really handy because it means
you<00:04:09.310> can<00:04:09.370> just<00:04:09.640> play<00:04:09.820> in<00:04:10.380> whatever<00:04:11.380> key<00:04:11.860> you

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
you can just play in whatever key you

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.600 
you can just play in whatever key you
want<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.450> if<00:04:13.450> you<00:04:13.630> can<00:04:14.170> do<00:04:14.320> it<00:04:14.410> and<00:04:14.560> maybe<00:04:15.400> you

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
want to if you can do it and maybe you

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.520 
want to if you can do it and maybe you
should<00:04:15.640> learn<00:04:16.570> it<00:04:18.150> possibility<00:04:19.150> okay<00:04:20.140> I'll

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
should learn it possibility okay I'll

should learn it possibility okay I'll
leave<00:04:20.769> you<00:04:20.830> to<00:04:20.980> it<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.220> see<00:04:21.670> you<00:04:21.760> next<00:04:21.820> time
