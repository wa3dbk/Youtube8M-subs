00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.780
 hello pilots with you tamil sour and 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.330
 Today there will be a review in German 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.700
 focke-wolf fighter 190 modifications 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.980
 again the text is prepared and he moved out 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.290
 shwarts clan aces with my little 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.330
 additions and impressions are also 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.730
 You can read and other reviews of the author 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.590
 by following the link to the website pattern in general it 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.960
 my favorite plane even before 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.880
 how I started to play already knew on what 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.310
 I want to fly, I want it and I was 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.560
 Focke-Wulf 190 Let's go to 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.329
 historically it happened so that 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.700
 the beginning of the war, Germany did not need 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.740
 any new fighters since 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.660
 the Luftwaffe already had the newest 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.410
 meanwhile messerschmitt fighters 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.600
 bf-109 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.520
 tested in civil war battles 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.619
 spain seasoned in the sky of Poland and 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.060
 france he established himself as 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.670
 first-class and supremely 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.680
 reliable car in the light of these events 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.600
 need for new and set or just 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.670
 but there was no battle for Britain 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.740
 made alarming conclusions 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.959
 first Messerschmitt met by 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.789
 least equal rival and only 

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:34.319
 thanks to high flying qualities 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.560
 new english fighter spitfire 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.810
 the sky of england remained unconquered and even 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.640
 in the forty first year new bf-109 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.910
 Frederick struggled to cope with 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.830
 me spitfire suffering heavy losses 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.899
 the appearance of Focke Woolf in August 41 in 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.459
 France greatly changed the balance of power and 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.200
 now the British have celebrated 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.770
 the inability of the spitfires to deal with 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.910
 new german fighters 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.259
 Focke-Wulf 190 series 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.240
 and the first is really hard 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.580
 armed german fighter 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.520
 available to the player already at level 11 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.140
 able to solve a wide range of tasks from 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.450
 destruction of aircraft of any class 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.490
 the size of the ground attack ground attack equipment 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.599
 the plane has a good speed 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.730
 for your level 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:17.280
 very strong weapons with capacious 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.230
 ammunition and decent survivability he 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.790
 much more obedient to manage when 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.130
 damage than 109 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.470
 Jurgis can also carry a bomb and 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.110
 rocket load and not bad shows 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.870
 ourselves as an attack aircraft, our bird carries 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.630
 two machine guns mg 17 caliber 792 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.210
 1800 rounds of ammunition with ammunition 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.850
 900 per barrel and two guns m 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.120
 151 caliber 20 millimeters with ammunition 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.830
 in 500 shells 250 per barrel also 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.900
 it is possible to hang on the console 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.940
 Wing four guns but it is only 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.950
 if you want to storm the ground or 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.900
 hail sprinkle opponents mineshossy 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.370
 In other cases, I have enough 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.800
 armament and default 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.450
 must recognize ammunition lessons in truth 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.490
 infinity with such a huge 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:01.170
 ammunition is quite possible to destroy 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.690
 eight opponents without reloading 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.520
 the presence of machine guns is also a big plus so 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.500
 how do they let you target 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.100
 before you open fire from the main 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.080
 caliber 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.610
 it's great saves ammunition 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.100
 increases combat effectiveness 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.230
 Foca can also carry up to 500 kilograms 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.940
 bombs and two rockets they 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.040
 may well be needed in the destruction 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.870
 fortified points on the ground or for 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.360
 destruction of armored vehicles in those cases 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.760
 when the battle threatens to be merged on the ground 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.160
 a bit like a drink review at the same time 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.740
 excellent and terrible on the positive side 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.450
 at 6 you can see anyone but 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.580
 glancing ahead you can and beaver 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.560
 the course does not notice a huge beam and 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.720
 a hefty motor blocks huge 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.010
 part of the entire front cockpit the pilot himself 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.050
 sits quite high therefore 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.020
 look around and back quite 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:48.030
 convenient only having long enough 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.310
 run and not too briskly starts 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.920
 take off is recommended typing 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.200
 200 220 kilometers per hour after which 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.360
 gain speed to 300 and set 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.490
 optimal angle to either in order 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.620
 this speed did not fall climb we did not 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.840
 so that very ahtung but not super 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.380
 so it is recommended to climb higher 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.700
 in landing the plane is tight it is extremely 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.950
 clumsy at low speeds so 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.320
 get out on the glide path in advance 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.160
 follows at speeds from 200 to 180 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.950
 kilometers an hour 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.870
 boarding mileage is also decent so 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.090
 when landing on the filds short strip 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.530
 don't forget about this moment not inclined 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.080
 nosing but still try 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.120
 squeeze the handle on yourself and do not brake until 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.880
 stop if you overdo it you can finish 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.920
 belly up cocoon record holder on the blade 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.480
 and very dependent on height margin 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.760
 due to poor maneuverability 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.160
 but God forbid someone to be below her 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.780
 for the bird dives aki beast and catch up 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.060
 her after the attack is very, very 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.790
 problematic but more on that later 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.750
 first you need to say that again not far 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.060
 invulnerable and 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.280
 a wife for her rank and fly her 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.800
 highly recommended only by link 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.320
 but the tapes of it are bad for her 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.360
 successfully resist la-5 yak-3 and more 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.640
 high level spitfire and typhoon 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.920
 typhoons in particular are able to catch up 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.230
 us peak what makes their rank more 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.030
 dangerous opponent and more serious 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.460
 machines are not worth mentioning for example 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.560
 american corsairs berkat sentence for 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.840
 burgher flocks are very different from 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.360
 mr he tight reminds locomotive 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.980
 long accelerates but as a locomotive if 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.380
 he will pick up speed then throw it off 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.480
 will be long in this all day play 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.820
 energy to attack the enemy only with 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.680
 exceeding in height alone or 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.050
 cut the enemy on the aisles only 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.760
 slightly turning to it if 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.890
 you play with wine or just having 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.690
 superiority in the number of our weapons 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.130
 allows you to do this with a high 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.080
 efficiency even if 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.240
 the duration of the firing decision share 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.770
 seconds immediately need to say with 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.200
 the corsair should behave very 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.150
 carefully and still better to jam it 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.250
 group as if the situation starts 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:49.740
 develop not in our favor you are not 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.690
 will not be able to get away from him in a straight line 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.850
 not in Beijing in klim bio in maneuverable combat 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.360
 the corsair will even give a shop or a shelton 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.910
 to light up 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.130
 what to say about falke however he is very 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.080
 sensitive damage and if you 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:02.970
 managed to hit his cannon a couple of times 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.670
 then it already becomes many times less 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:08.220
 dangerous juice for falke 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:10.260
 these are heavy fighters and attack aircraft here 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.000
 there is where to roam our powerful guns 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.490
 and it is here that the plane shows itself 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.530
 in the best way if the team is 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.090
 a pair of handy pops then win on 

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:21.060
 the land of the enemy will be very, very 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.620
 hard by the way about the typhoon yes he's bad klim 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:25.200
 fight till he logs but it brings 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.480
 to maneuver her us this quickly and log and 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.340
 this log dives no worse than so 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.810
 no excess height for typhoon on 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:32.670
 file is strictly prohibited 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:34.890
 here are twenty millimeter spanish 

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.350
 quickly make you a chicken with nuts 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:40.020
 the hardest foki comes with benches 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.940
 and yak-3 is strictly obligatory here 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.040
 game skill to cover each other and 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.070
 remove the enemy from the buddy's tail and 

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.810
 no creeping land there Soviet 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:51.120
 fighters feel best 

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:53.370
 but the height we can easily leave 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.350
 from them in the fiction breakup the mind-blowing 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.420
 the speed is 900 kilometers per hour 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.220
 making sharp turns at speeds up to 705 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.410
 kilometer per hour without the risk of something yourself 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.780
 tear that course available 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.630
 opponent except this if you see 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:09.730
 enemy uncertainty with yaks except 9 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.650
 you can safely go to the head-they 

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:14.260
 crumble from a pair of good hits 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.330
 minengossy fock machine multi-purpose 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.500
 therefore, if necessary, it can easily 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.360
 work as an attack aircraft 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.640
 of course she is not so effective in this 

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.800
 plan as p-47 thunderbolt or zil 2 

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.820
 truck but still having bomb 

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.950
 rocket load 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.480
 as well as an impressive machine gun on a cannon 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:30.820
 ammunition allows you to make 

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.130
 thirty to forty ground for 1 b to and all 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.620
 don't forget 195 first 

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:38.200
 a fighter and much better for attack 

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:39.850
 F8 modification with even more 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.770
 powerful weapons and improved 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:42.640
 booking about which we'll talk in 

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.490
 next review 

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.530
 Foka until the plane is very specific and to 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.360
 he needs to get used to it as usual 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:51.150
 fighter behavior on it will not roll 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.650
 but the one who knows him completely 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.940
 will train the shutter speed and feelings 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:57.730
 trigger exactly at the right moment 

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:58.900
 fire solution then become very strong 

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.880
 nutlet for the enemy 

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.460
 I'd add myself that I play mostly 

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.740
 one if the team ally merges the 

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:08.140
 boy to drag very hard because fock 

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.030
 needs helpers fly in a link and 

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.160
 feel the power to the full 

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:14.320
 this plane and that's it 

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.610
 thanks for watching subscribe to 

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.610
