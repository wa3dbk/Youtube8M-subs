 2 and managed to turn something 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.200
 would naturally be sad in a 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.930
 happiness because everyone taking 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.250
 pie in the face was a total pie and 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:42.090
 we got the same love for 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.910
 even care until the end of the year 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.170
 the joy of the computers they wanted 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.030
 so thyroid 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.760
 I think more than for 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.960
 I think the profession is 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.090
 each one of us, right? 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.760
 an experience of love someone who brings 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.070
 a very great love that spreads this 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.380
 love in such a genuine way so beautiful 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.700
 we can only be grateful and take this 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.420
 for the lives of people with an experience 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.180
 of life 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:10.260
 We were a family, my family. 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:13.290
 Mother zone is is the same family I played 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.240
 with them as motto the grandmother and we had 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.950
 very lucky that's what we got 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.739
 around and everyone wanted to have that 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.389
 time 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.389
 today it is no longer the same person who dies of 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:25.090
 envy and uendel stupid people title of 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.009
 to know you but is the next you are 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.720
 an arrogant person talking super 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:31.060
 now few people have the 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.979
 power to turn co-workers 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.560
 and eternal friends, right? 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.960
 in one of its main achievements a 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.849
 great actor made a point of coming here to give 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:46.300
 A kiss he just received is already here. 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:49.780
 Up the goal you look Brazil made 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.620
 to come here personally to the 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.620
 Will it be your house? 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.620
 You can sit down without JosÃ©. 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:05.620
 that both already beat with the return of edward 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:14.530
 Good, I had the privilege of working. 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.730
 with zica often on television 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:20.060
 privilege to work often in 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:24.200
 theaters for long and long years always 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:27.890
 an extraordinary actress and Zilca does 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:31.900
 part of these rare friends for the 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:35.660
 love of generosity for complicity 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.000
 should deal with zica as one who deals with 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.630
 the flowers 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:45.140
 I think I realized in this trajectory 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:48.140
 all the love that his kadett 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:51.770
 family love their work their 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.320
 profession dignifying the love of their 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.740
 colleagues and friends 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.570
 I feel privileged to be able to 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.560
 here at this time to provide this 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.400
 tribute 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:07.910
 I think it's a very appropriate thing. 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:12.440
 Why did you spread so much love? 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:15.080
 it is naive and so poor that it is 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:18.200
 very suitable a program called people 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:23.440
 innocent of paying this tribute to a 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.440
 grandmother and a mother so innocent to believe 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.160
 the family including income and gives 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.600
 kiss 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.670
 today with working 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.340
 enjoy everybody lol and let's 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.870
 to watch the show nice people 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.840
 I know if you can sit down then the next 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:45.630
 to end our homage to people 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.760
 will have a mix of tap dance and in the accounts 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:50.760
 must continue with ballet directly from the 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.910
 the yellow picapau's place, her friends and 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.140
 Viscondes in the version innocent people are going 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:58.010
 get that one had to abandon 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:58.010
 Holy shit, let's go. 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.350
 the thrashing 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:21.180
 elvira by the lawyer of a native father 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:27.360
 and I do not have the words to 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:30.720
 to thank this wonderful idea for 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:32.250
 This homage is fantastic that was 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:38.450
 made 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:42.200
 I'll tell you one thing I do not want 

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:42.200
 but do not die now
