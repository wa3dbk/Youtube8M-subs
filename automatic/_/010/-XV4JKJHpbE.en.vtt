00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
of the spark figures you can see this

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.430 
of the spark figures you can see this
has<00:01:06.310> the<00:01:06.789> Autobot<00:01:07.390> symbol<00:01:07.420> just<00:01:08.050> at<00:01:08.200> the<00:01:08.289> back

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
has the Autobot symbol just at the back

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.020 
has the Autobot symbol just at the back
there<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:10.450> really<00:01:10.780> call<00:01:11.140> a<00:01:11.350> locking

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
there and they really call a locking

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
figure is just a one-piece molded figure

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.539 
figure is just a one-piece molded figure
with<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.030> very<00:01:25.570> large<00:01:25.780> sword<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:27.040> doesn't<00:01:27.369> have

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:27.549 
with a very large sword it doesn't have

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:30.330 
with a very large sword it doesn't have
any<00:01:27.790> articulation<00:01:28.210> but<00:01:29.079> it<00:01:29.229> will<00:01:29.470> sit<00:01:29.829> just<00:01:30.040> on

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
any articulation but it will sit just on

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.929 
any articulation but it will sit just on
the<00:01:30.460> top<00:01:30.640> there<00:01:30.850> is<00:01:30.880> a<00:01:30.970> groove<00:01:31.299> we<00:01:32.020> will<00:01:32.170> see

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
the top there is a groove we will see

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.490 
the top there is a groove we will see
part<00:01:33.939> of<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.119> subtle<00:01:34.540> portion<00:01:35.110> there<00:01:35.320> and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
part of a subtle portion there and

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.080 
part of a subtle portion there and
Alessi's<00:01:36.369> where<00:01:36.579> that<00:01:36.729> figure<00:01:37.119> will<00:01:38.020> sit<00:01:39.090> but

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
Alessi's where that figure will sit but

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.899 
Alessi's where that figure will sit but
let's<00:01:40.780> have<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:40.990> look<00:01:41.049> at<00:01:41.470> that's<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.430> spark

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
let's have a look at that's a spark

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.410 
let's have a look at that's a spark
feature<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.100> action<00:01:45.549> on<00:01:45.820> that<00:01:45.970> this<00:01:46.119> toy

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
feature so the action on that this toy

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.289 
feature so the action on that this toy
is<00:01:46.659> a<00:01:46.810> pullback<00:01:47.170> and<00:01:47.619> go<00:01:47.979> if<00:01:48.549> you<00:01:48.729> pull<00:01:49.090> back

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:49.299 
is a pullback and go if you pull back

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.840 
is a pullback and go if you pull back
you<00:01:49.540> can<00:01:49.750> feel<00:01:50.079> the<00:01:50.799> wheels<00:01:50.979> tightening<00:01:51.640> and

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
you can feel the wheels tightening and

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.120 
you can feel the wheels tightening and
tightening<00:01:52.149> and<00:01:52.659> then<00:01:53.170> you<00:01:53.320> let<00:01:53.619> go<00:01:53.860> and<00:01:53.890> it

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
tightening and then you let go and it

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.940 
tightening and then you let go and it
will<00:01:54.549> go<00:01:54.759> flying<00:01:55.149> off<00:01:55.509> let's<00:01:56.380> bring<00:01:56.649> that<00:01:56.710> back

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
will go flying off let's bring that back

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.359 
will go flying off let's bring that back
into<00:01:57.460> play<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.450> you<00:01:59.350> get<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.649> spots<00:01:59.979> to<00:02:00.189> work

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
into play so you get the spots to work

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.700 
into play so you get the spots to work
such<00:02:01.270> a<00:02:01.420> small<00:02:01.750> space<00:02:02.020> you<00:02:02.049> can<00:02:02.409> just<00:02:02.530> keep

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
such a small space you can just keep

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.429 
such a small space you can just keep
pulling<00:02:02.979> back<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.850> then<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:04.930> can<00:02:05.110> see<00:02:05.290> the

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
pulling back and then you can see the

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.600 
pulling back and then you can see the
spot<00:02:06.210> firing<00:02:07.210> up<00:02:07.360> in<00:02:07.539> the<00:02:07.719> middle

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
spot firing up in the middle

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.060 
spot firing up in the middle
of<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.420> toy-boata<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:10.259> see<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.710> a<00:02:10.740> little

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
of the toy-boata to see that a little

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.930 
of the toy-boata to see that a little
better<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.370> will<00:02:11.760> turn<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.630> log<00:02:12.900> set<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.700> now

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
better I will turn the log set so now

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.640 
better I will turn the log set so now
