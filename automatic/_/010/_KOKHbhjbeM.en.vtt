now<00:00:08.090> as<00:00:08.690> Lipan<00:00:09.200> is<00:00:09.440> the<00:00:09.860> first<00:00:10.760> one<00:00:11.719> of<00:00:11.840> the

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
now as Lipan is the first one of the

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.549 
now as Lipan is the first one of the
three<00:00:12.230> ways<00:00:12.680> of<00:00:13.100> mass<00:00:13.850> construction<00:00:14.210> in<00:00:14.809> 3ds

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:15.559 
three ways of mass construction in 3ds

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.700 
three ways of mass construction in 3ds
max<00:00:16.029> so<00:00:17.029> I'm<00:00:17.090> just<00:00:17.240> going<00:00:17.450> to<00:00:17.510> show<00:00:17.750> off<00:00:18.080> the

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
max so I'm just going to show off the

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.570 
max so I'm just going to show off the
edge<00:00:19.130> living<00:00:19.779> first<00:00:20.920> so<00:00:21.920> I'm<00:00:22.070> just<00:00:22.279> going<00:00:22.460> to

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
edge living first so I'm just going to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.010 
edge living first so I'm just going to
make<00:00:23.270> a<00:00:23.680> cylinder<00:00:24.680> here<00:00:24.920> and<00:00:25.480> just<00:00:26.480> take<00:00:26.810> down

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
make a cylinder here and just take down

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.849 
make a cylinder here and just take down
the<00:00:27.189> height<00:00:28.189> segments<00:00:29.320> I'm<00:00:30.320> gonna<00:00:30.529> go<00:00:30.650> to

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
the height segments I'm gonna go to

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.780 
the height segments I'm gonna go to
modifiers<00:00:31.360> and<00:00:32.360> drop<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.379> inbox<00:00:33.680> here<00:00:33.860> there

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
modifiers and drop the inbox here there

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.960 
modifiers and drop the inbox here there
is<00:00:34.940> a<00:00:35.330> editable<00:00:36.260> poly

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
is a editable poly

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.110 
is a editable poly
you<00:00:38.300> can't<00:00:38.510> just<00:00:38.660> convert<00:00:38.960> to<00:00:39.110> editable<00:00:39.230> poly

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
you can't just convert to editable poly

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.910 
you can't just convert to editable poly
but<00:00:41.120> using<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.510> modifier<00:00:41.960> means<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:42.469> you

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
but using the modifier means that you

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.970 
but using the modifier means that you
can<00:00:43.420> just<00:00:44.420> one<00:00:44.570> cheese<00:00:44.780> once<00:00:45.469> you<00:00:45.530> convert<00:00:45.829> it

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 
can just one cheese once you convert it

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.440 
can just one cheese once you convert it
you<00:00:46.100> can't<00:00:46.309> bring<00:00:46.489> it<00:00:46.610> back<00:00:46.790> so<00:00:46.820> if<00:00:47.180> you<00:00:47.300> use<00:00:47.420> a

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
you can't bring it back so if you use a

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.990 
you can't bring it back so if you use a
modifier<00:00:47.960> to<00:00:48.410> convert<00:00:49.280> it<00:00:49.399> to<00:00:49.430> an<00:00:49.550> algo<00:00:49.790> poly

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
modifier to convert it to an algo poly

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.330 
modifier to convert it to an algo poly
you<00:00:50.809> can't<00:00:51.050> just<00:00:51.200> go<00:00:51.320> back<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:51.710> change<00:00:52.129> the

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
you can't just go back and change the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.229 
you can't just go back and change the
parameters<00:00:52.899> so<00:00:53.899> I'm<00:00:54.230> just<00:00:54.440> going<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:55.239> select

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
parameters so I'm just going to select

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.279 
parameters so I'm just going to select
the<00:00:56.570> polygons<00:00:57.110> and<00:00:57.850> delete<00:00:58.850> these<00:00:59.270> top<00:00:59.780> faces

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
the polygons and delete these top faces

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.090 
the polygons and delete these top faces
here<00:01:01.960> and<00:01:03.250> then<00:01:04.250> I'm<00:01:04.910> going<00:01:05.270> to<00:01:05.300> select<00:01:05.630> the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
here and then I'm going to select the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.359 
here and then I'm going to select the
edge<00:01:08.170> it's<00:01:09.170> only<00:01:09.289> going<00:01:09.470> to<00:01:09.560> select<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:10.039> edges

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
edge it's only going to select the edges

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.359 
edge it's only going to select the edges
within<00:01:10.670> the<00:01:11.390> cylinder<00:01:11.830> and<00:01:12.830> I'm<00:01:13.070> just<00:01:13.220> going

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
within the cylinder and I'm just going

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.039 
within the cylinder and I'm just going
to<00:01:13.520> click<00:01:13.760> on<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.150> top<00:01:14.360> of<00:01:14.510> the<00:01:14.570> sounder<00:01:14.930> and

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
to click on the top of the sounder and

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.490 
to click on the top of the sounder and
collect<00:01:15.740> the<00:01:16.460> loop<00:01:16.700> which<00:01:17.299> will<00:01:17.600> select<00:01:18.110> all

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
collect the loop which will select all

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.149 
collect the loop which will select all
the<00:01:18.740> edges<00:01:19.010> around<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.210> circle<00:01:20.770> in<00:01:21.770> a

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
the edges around the circle in a

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.999 
the edges around the circle in a
selected<00:01:22.610> area<00:01:22.970> and<00:01:23.150> so<00:01:23.990> they<00:01:24.380> are<00:01:24.530> selected

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
selected area and so they are selected

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.580 
selected area and so they are selected
they<00:01:25.880> are<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.540> Konrad's<00:01:27.080> that<00:01:27.350> means<00:01:27.500> they're

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
they are the Konrad's that means they're

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.010 
they are the Konrad's that means they're
selected<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.909> let's<00:01:29.150> go<00:01:29.270> ahead<00:01:29.390> Tavia<00:01:29.750> the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
selected and let's go ahead Tavia the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.429 
selected and let's go ahead Tavia the
translate<00:01:30.500> them<00:01:30.650> have<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.700> holding<00:01:32.000> shift

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
translate them have a holding shift

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.370 
translate them have a holding shift
and<00:01:33.799> drag<00:01:34.189> up<00:01:34.369> it<00:01:35.090> will<00:01:35.299> create<00:01:35.630> I<00:01:37.360> add<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:39.170> the

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
and drag up it will create I add to the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.389 
and drag up it will create I add to the
cylinder<00:01:41.500> yeah<00:01:42.500> so<00:01:43.180> if<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.299> keep<00:01:44.509> dragging<00:01:44.869> up

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
cylinder yeah so if I keep dragging up

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.240 
cylinder yeah so if I keep dragging up
that'll<00:01:46.399> keep<00:01:46.549> written<00:01:46.940> more<00:01:47.119> I<00:01:47.360> can<00:01:47.810> also

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
that'll keep written more I can also

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:56.350 
that'll keep written more I can also
scale<00:01:49.509> if<00:01:50.509> I<00:01:50.659> want<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:50.960> get<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.200> crack<00:01:51.440> size

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.140 

so<00:01:57.080> this<00:01:57.350> would<00:01:57.500> be<00:01:57.650> if<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:58.070> were<00:01:58.130> if<00:01:58.790> I<00:01:58.940> had

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
so this would be if you were if I had

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.030 
so this would be if you were if I had
like<00:01:59.360> a<00:02:01.150> template<00:02:02.150> of<00:02:02.180> a<00:02:02.270> human<00:02:02.570> leg<00:02:02.780> I<00:02:03.080> didn't

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
like a template of a human leg I didn't

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.370 
like a template of a human leg I didn't
make<00:02:04.130> it<00:02:04.370> make<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:04.850> like<00:02:05.000> here<00:02:05.330> it's<00:02:05.990> simply

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
make it make the like here it's simply

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.600 
make it make the like here it's simply
by<00:02:06.500> using<00:02:06.680> the<00:02:06.830> edge<00:02:06.920> lip<00:02:07.190> all<00:02:07.820> from<00:02:08.360> one<00:02:08.540> mesh

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
by using the edge lip all from one mesh

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
by using the edge lip all from one mesh
