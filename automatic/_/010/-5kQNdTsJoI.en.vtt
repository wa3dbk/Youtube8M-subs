00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.420
 hello people and welcome to 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.480
 a little rowling video and that is 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.860
 The idea for the and one waits as 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.740
 In a nutshell, I have to stop here for a short time 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.480
 screw down sounds a bit 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.310
 otherwise it is because of recent recordings 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.400
 that the pig is loud by a few 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.820
 noise makes yes and what do I want you 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.029
 show now or 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.760
 yes I found a nice idea 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.750
 how you all really cool on the server 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.420
 already what can I already here this 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.850
 yes uranium blog is it you can not 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.100
 Destroying glue now stops 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.190
 broken how do you put it here 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.489
 you need new uranium he has 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.579
 already and after the current one 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.270
 I would be a little bit dangerous for you 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:57.809
 Consulting is easy to do 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:00.120
 It can not be very practical 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.210
 happen and is quite easy you have 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.790
 already a compressor and now is 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:15.020
 just the uranium in the compressors 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:18.080
 then polly fan radio came out and then 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:23.850
 somehow too much 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:27.590
 I wanted to fit everyone again 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.570
 case already make so short 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:33.710
 Just fill each field with uranium 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.420
 and you have your oranien block 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.270
 and after the creative mode I can 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.049
 It could show it 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.299
 definitely on the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.100
 make a plot because then everyone thinks 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.070
 oh well you shit the practical 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.720
 Once again the nuclear weapons will be out 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.509
 really cool practical is constant 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.180
 and nothing happens like that and now only 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.439
 so as an idea did not have to do 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.070
 you do it for example as input 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.229
 use 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.780
 you all have these double widths 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.670
 and if you hinhaut so 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.880
 I think that looks very funny 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.170
 left and right still fence but 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:16.320
 well and for the fence I have too 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:20.850
 an idea that's that's me there 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.600
 spontaneously invaded their fans ok 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.610
 so strong 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.410
 So if the show called up, top up 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.739
 or I think now too and I think 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:35.730
 then you get 12 1 and very short 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:38.700
 look as well see also very nice 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.670
 and after you iron a lot 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.230
 you have in the last recording yes 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.170
 seen that you alone 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:53.150
 I think a half-stack brandstetter 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:57.630
 16 you have people with iron 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.640
 unprocessed unfair works speaks 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.550
 it should be pretty good 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.670
 can make from their own fans 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:11.670
 that too and that's me again 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.120
 and then to say and see you 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.120
 next time
