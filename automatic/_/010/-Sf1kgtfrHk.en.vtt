00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.820
 Talk to me, everyone, beauty with you. 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.410
 Welcome to another good video this time. 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.029
 People on this day here I 'm going to teach. 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.029
 You do this here. 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.300
 Good people, you double dip. 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.760
 if this is not so difficult but 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.430
 it's also something you need to practice 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.730
 pretty sure I advise you, it's not 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.730
 rule and nor standard but much easier 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.129
 you have a mechanical keyboard because 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.769
 because the mechanical keyboard has a time 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.360
 answer less salary then to you 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.760
 For example , it is again very 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.830
 fast it has to be really fast even 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.280
 the mechanical keyboard will make your 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.189
 life is an observation is that I have to 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.680
 to say you some people think that 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.710
 so you can only do this with 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.310
 which is not the easiest because you 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.079
 goes the stick that is theoretically walquer 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.909
 You'll give too much giving so you will. 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.700
 get to kill with your very enemy 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.450
 faster sure right but if you 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.979
 dick is for example you go pro dick is go 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.259
 stay very strong you can do this 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.079
 also with ipod if you can do this with the 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.689
 inad may also be inactive if 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.700
 know the damage and exactly what time it 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.520
 the guy is going to die can make him mad 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.290
 also has no problem right 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.960
 The important thing is you know that it will 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.729
 dying during your audience this is more 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.090
 easy to make right 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:05.729
 silval silval is neodi anp to stay 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.920
 and then you can do it 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.550
 This is much easier as you 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.390
 can use other species without any 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.090
 problem 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.430
 so it's basically this galera I hope 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.990
 you enjoyed the video spoke 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.990
 A hug, I went.
