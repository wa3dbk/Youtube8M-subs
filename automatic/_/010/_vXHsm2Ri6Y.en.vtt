00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
okay I'd like to talk to you about the

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.059 
okay I'd like to talk to you about the
grip<00:00:03.270> of<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.480> muscle<00:00:03.899> track<00:00:04.140> and<00:00:04.410> why<00:00:05.009> the

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
grip of the muscle track and why the

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.400 
grip of the muscle track and why the
grip<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.759> important<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.690> not<00:00:06.930> only<00:00:07.230> the

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
grip is important and not only the

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.919 
grip is important and not only the
assessment<00:00:08.099> or<00:00:08.189> evaluation<00:00:08.240> of<00:00:09.240> myofascial

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
assessment or evaluation of myofascial

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.459 
assessment or evaluation of myofascial
tissue<00:00:10.349> but<00:00:11.099> also<00:00:11.309> therapeutically<00:00:12.469> it's

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
tissue but also therapeutically it's

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.200 
tissue but also therapeutically it's
important<00:00:13.980> with<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.280> treatment<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.000> how<00:00:15.150> you

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
important with the treatment and how you

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.950 
important with the treatment and how you
treat<00:00:15.830> mile<00:00:16.830> fast<00:00:17.070> restrictions<00:00:17.960> other

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
treat mile fast restrictions other

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.750 
treat mile fast restrictions other
therapy<00:00:19.439> devices<00:00:19.770> because<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.550> very

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
therapy devices because of the very

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.550 
therapy devices because of the very
nature<00:00:21.090> of<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.810> device<00:00:22.619> are<00:00:22.920> more<00:00:23.609> rounded

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
nature of the device are more rounded

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.689 
nature of the device are more rounded
because<00:00:25.560> it's<00:00:25.769> rounded<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.430> they're<00:00:26.580> almost

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
because it's rounded and they're almost

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.330 
because it's rounded and they're almost
like<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:27.060> rolling<00:00:27.570> pin<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.769> either<00:00:28.949> have<00:00:29.310> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
like a rolling pin you either have to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.659 
like a rolling pin you either have to
use<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> very<00:00:30.090> very<00:00:30.359> firm<00:00:31.230> grip<00:00:31.619> with<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.309> heck<00:00:32.640> of

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
use a very very firm grip with a heck of

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.209 
use a very very firm grip with a heck of
a<00:00:32.910> lot<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.210> pressure<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:34.170> requires<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:35.010> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
a lot of pressure that requires you to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.880 
a lot of pressure that requires you to
dig<00:00:35.489> into<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> tissue<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.500> treat<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
dig into the tissue to treat it and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.940 
dig into the tissue to treat it and
assess<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.600> or<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.809> requires<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.620> use

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
assess it or it requires that you use

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.049 
assess it or it requires that you use
full<00:00:41.219> body<00:00:41.489> weight<00:00:41.820> to<00:00:42.260> roll<00:00:43.260> across<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:44.059> to

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
full body weight to roll across it to

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.440 
full body weight to roll across it to
basically<00:00:45.420> do<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.660> same<00:00:45.870> thing<00:00:47.450> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
basically do the same thing the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.330 
basically do the same thing the
difference<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.989> by<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> very<00:00:49.680> nature<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
difference is by the very nature of the

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.189 
difference is by the very nature of the
design<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.940> muscle<00:00:51.300> track<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.870> muscle

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
design of the muscle track the muscle

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.889 
design of the muscle track the muscle
track<00:00:52.789> because<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> patent<00:00:54.480> design<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
track because of the patent design the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.069 
track because of the patent design the
wheels<00:00:55.640> penetrates<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.789> tissue<00:00:57.030> so<00:00:57.390> penetrates

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
wheels penetrates a tissue so penetrates

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.610 
wheels penetrates a tissue so penetrates
the<00:00:58.320> fascia<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.550> underlying<00:00:59.850> muscle

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
the fascia and the underlying muscle

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.770 
the fascia and the underlying muscle
which<00:01:01.620> aids<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.100> not<00:01:02.579> only<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.910> evaluation

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
which aids in not only the evaluation

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.429 
which aids in not only the evaluation
but<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> treatment<00:01:05.060> so<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.180> grip<00:01:06.479> therefore

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
but the treatment so the grip therefore

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.399 
but the treatment so the grip therefore
is<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> lighter<00:01:08.070> grip<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.729> rather<00:01:08.970> than<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.659> firm

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
is a lighter grip so rather than a firm

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.590 
is a lighter grip so rather than a firm
grip<00:01:10.680> with<00:01:10.950> fists<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.729> using<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.390> lot<00:01:12.570> of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
grip with fists and using a lot of

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.990 
grip with fists and using a lot of
pressure<00:01:12.960> through<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.470> arms<00:01:13.890> I'm<00:01:14.520> using<00:01:14.790> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
pressure through the arms I'm using a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.999 
pressure through the arms I'm using a
lighter<00:01:15.240> grip<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.900> lighter<00:01:16.140> grip<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.770> as

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
lighter grip the lighter grip then as

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.670 
lighter grip the lighter grip then as
used<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.909> might<00:01:18.090> apply<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:18.900> fingers<00:01:19.409> in

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
used we might apply with my fingers in

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.370 
used we might apply with my fingers in
and<00:01:20.040> any<00:01:20.670> pressure<00:01:21.030> i<00:01:21.210> use<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.720> applied<00:01:22.350> with

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
and any pressure i use is applied with

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
and any pressure i use is applied with
my<00:01:22.950> thumbs<00:01:23.450> so<00:01:24.450> as<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.869> scan<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.320> muscle<00:01:25.890> from

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
my thumbs so as I scan the muscle from

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.609 
my thumbs so as I scan the muscle from
origin<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.240> insertion<00:01:27.659> from<00:01:28.170> top<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.439> bottom

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
origin to insertion from top to bottom

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.120 
origin to insertion from top to bottom
then<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:30.420> muscle<00:01:30.780> track<00:01:31.020> will<00:01:31.740> penetrate

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
then the muscle track will penetrate

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.240 
then the muscle track will penetrate
that<00:01:32.549> tissue<00:01:32.880> lightly<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.659> magnifies<00:01:34.320> my<00:01:34.350> my

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
that tissue lightly it magnifies my my

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.969 
that tissue lightly it magnifies my my
tactile<00:01:35.790> sensation<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.350> do<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.920> I

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
tactile sensation and as I do that I

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.490 
tactile sensation and as I do that I
know<00:01:38.310> exactly<00:01:38.640> where<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.630> problems<00:01:40.079> are<00:01:40.259> if

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
know exactly where the problems are if

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.179 
know exactly where the problems are if
I'm<00:01:41.070> using<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.549> an<00:01:41.850> athlete<00:01:42.509> as<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:43.470> therapist

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
I'm using on an athlete as a therapist

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.730 
I'm using on an athlete as a therapist
as<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:44.490> sports<00:01:45.090> talk<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.630> an<00:01:46.140> athletic<00:01:46.590> trainer

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
as a sports talk as an athletic trainer

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.859 
as a sports talk as an athletic trainer
it's<00:01:47.729> going<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.000> feel<00:01:48.210> almost<00:01:48.390> feel<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.720> a

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
it's going to feel almost feel like a

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.260 
it's going to feel almost feel like a
speed<00:01:49.259> bump<00:01:49.439> so<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> can<00:01:50.430> tell<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.820> athlete

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
speed bump so I can tell the athlete

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.649 
speed bump so I can tell the athlete
pretty<00:01:51.540> much<00:01:51.750> worst<00:01:52.079> problem<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:53.030> if<00:01:54.030> he's<00:01:54.509> an

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
pretty much worst problem is if he's an

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.109 
pretty much worst problem is if he's an
athlete<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.350> he's<00:01:55.979> using<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.399> himself<00:01:56.549> it's

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
athlete and he's using on himself it's

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.410 
athlete and he's using on himself it's
going<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.360> feel<00:01:58.430> like<00:01:59.430> an<00:01:59.610> area<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.939> soreness

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
going to feel like an area of soreness

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.749 
going to feel like an area of soreness
stiffness<00:02:00.450> whatever<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.310> very<00:02:02.460> quickly

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
stiffness whatever and so very quickly

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.910 
stiffness whatever and so very quickly
you<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.659> assess<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:04.259> tissue<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.799> you're

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
you can assess that tissue and you're

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.350 
you can assess that tissue and you're
going<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.130> find<00:02:05.399> trigger<00:02:05.759> points<00:02:06.210> you're

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
going to find trigger points you're

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.660 
going to find trigger points you're
going<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.540> find

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
going to find

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.920 
going to find
adhesions<00:02:08.270> you're<00:02:08.660> going<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.869> find

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
adhesions you're going to find

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.180 
adhesions you're going to find
non-compliant<00:02:11.930> muscle<00:02:12.230> tissue<00:02:12.470> of<00:02:12.920> course

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
non-compliant muscle tissue of course

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.500 
non-compliant muscle tissue of course
you're<00:02:13.310> going<00:02:13.400> to<00:02:13.489> find<00:02:13.700> symptomatic<00:02:14.360> the

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
you're going to find symptomatic the

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.360 
you're going to find symptomatic the
areas<00:02:14.690> of<00:02:14.810> soreness<00:02:15.200> stiffness<00:02:15.370> tenderness

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
areas of soreness stiffness tenderness

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.620 
areas of soreness stiffness tenderness
things<00:02:16.730> like<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:19.489> grip<00:02:19.819> then<00:02:20.120> again

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
things like that so the grip then again

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.199 
things like that so the grip then again
is<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.140> lighter<00:02:21.680> grip<00:02:22.099> then<00:02:22.819> from<00:02:23.090> the

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
is a lighter grip then from the

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.199 
is a lighter grip then from the
treatment<00:02:23.720> end<00:02:24.069> when<00:02:25.069> I<00:02:25.100> treat<00:02:25.610> I'm<00:02:25.880> the

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
treatment end when I treat I'm the

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.690 
treatment end when I treat I'm the
pressures<00:02:26.660> apply<00:02:26.989> with<00:02:27.200> my<00:02:27.350> thumbs<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.370> based

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
pressures apply with my thumbs so based

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.640 
pressures apply with my thumbs so based
on<00:02:28.880> the<00:02:29.030> amount<00:02:29.209> of<00:02:29.360> pressure<00:02:29.630> i'm<00:02:29.870> using<00:02:30.380> then

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
on the amount of pressure i'm using then

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.580 
on the amount of pressure i'm using then
that<00:02:31.010> allows<00:02:31.280> me<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:32.000> either<00:02:32.480> penetrate<00:02:33.470> the

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
that allows me to either penetrate the

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.580 
that allows me to either penetrate the
tissue<00:02:33.830> more<00:02:34.340> superficially<00:02:35.180> or<00:02:35.390> deeper<00:02:36.380> and

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
tissue more superficially or deeper and

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.920 
tissue more superficially or deeper and
that's<00:02:37.459> a<00:02:37.640> difference<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.330> that's<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.780> way

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
that's a difference and that's the way

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.950 
that's a difference and that's the way
you<00:02:38.989> apply<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.560> grip
