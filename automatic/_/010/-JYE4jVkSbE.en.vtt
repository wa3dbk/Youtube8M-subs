00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:09.030
 welcome to mona jimÃ©nez today we are going 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.300
 to learn how to cut glass bottles and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.400
 make some very nice steps 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.950
 we're going to need a bucket of cold water 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.350
 where the bottle bottle divided the 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.260
 world small alcohol 90 cotton yarn 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.820
 degrees fire paper sanding scissors and 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.110
 protection 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.110
 let's cut 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.800
 more or less to hit two laps 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.100
 it's a small milestone 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.440
 so it has to stay the same 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.360
 let's use a funnel to make it 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.089
 easier to put the water and that we do not 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.089
 the thread because otherwise it will not work anymore 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.700
 the water up to the height of the nest 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.060
 we take 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.300
 this is not going to help the nest 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.820
 he also has more 20 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:30.700
 Well, we started with alcohol. 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.430
 have very important protection giving 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.940
 the casualties like the gloves are worth open 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.590
 the alcohol and we place it on the thread 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.590
 you have to be careful not to squirt 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.880
 it is very important the liquid that comes 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.550
 the 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.720
 With people 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.410
 clean and lack and I can alcohol or 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.410
 we have 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.640
 ah 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:12.390
 Can be done 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.390
 with an easier lighter 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.709
 Y 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.709
 I do not know if they can observe psb 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.650
 when it goes out is when we put the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.650
 bottle inside 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.920
 Y 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.920
 Y 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.860
 nothing happens we go back 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.690
 d 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.400
 if the first one has not worked like me 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.799
 has happened make sure to dry the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.989
 bottle and put a new thread well dry 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:13.819
 since if you use the wet the water 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.159
 will absorb the heat energy and the 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.900
 bottle will not break remember 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.900
 moisten the thread well in alcohol 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.890
 so we can use the glass is 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.870
 necessary to sand the edges well 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.170
 using a 100 grit wood 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.060
 of 150 make sure you do it carefully 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.250
 and of not scratching below the edges 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.820
 so that our new glass stays a lot 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.820
 prettier 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.570
 well here we have our steps 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.300
 finished we have been a little bit 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.440
 scratched below the edge but look what 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.440
 health work well 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.970
