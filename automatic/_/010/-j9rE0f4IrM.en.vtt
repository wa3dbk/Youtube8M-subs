 reappear in the same session 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.820
 but below the below the roof of the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.470
 garage in the little secret room 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.090

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.829
 genius so the the pnj in story mode

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.450
 calm ship a little bit pretty 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.500
 cool anyway to show your buddies and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.319
 so we'll go straight to 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.780
 two 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.489
 secret place so is right here in the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.469
 desert so there I quickly show you 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.480
 on the map where is that if you know 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.549
 right here above the airport of 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.769
 at trevor in the plaster of the small shop 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.299
 who's right here so here you have to 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.760
 are you at this place you place a 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.900
 vehicle like me in the video next 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.629
 here look over a small 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.230
 window you break it and will on 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.689
 your vehicle 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.040
 then you climb the little ones 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.959
 small fans there that on the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.969
 wall and then you get back into order 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.739
 in the building by the window and there we 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:46.629
 going to get into the lab from May so is 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.609
 very strong in story mode and a lot of 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.980
 time in in this room the 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.480
 m laboratory so to you can see 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.189
 we have a lot of little things that we 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.129
 allow to do drugs 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.120
 to use little pitiful prove 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.829
 centrifuges small trials 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.280
 weird stuff but frankly I 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.439
 think it's really stylish here 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.239
 then for this third secret purpose 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.919
 will go here so all right 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.590
 really where all the right of the map 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:13.750
 so right next to the activity that has 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.209
 here look in this kind of small 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.469
 base there bim so you come back makes you 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.540
 the same path as me in the video 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:22.629
 watch live here you stop at 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.310
 door number 2 which is right here there 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:26.049
 you get off of your vehicle and you 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.549
 go up the stairs and you will see 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.939
 that it's the rush too is really 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.620
 not bad 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.329
 the hut either you will go up the 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.459
 stairs you go left until 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.810
 basically I'm going to enjoy it for you 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.650
 invite to join us on our 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.599
 facebook group 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.759
 if you ever have any questions 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.799
 trick if you are looking for people for 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:43.599
 duplication or activities at 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.620
 failures do not hesitate you like them 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.750
 links in the description 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.699
 once you arrive here you 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.290
 so get on this on these little tricks 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:51.790
 electric there and you go between 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.799
 these two blue poles that's right here 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.569
 like me in the video 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.069
 there you stand between once you 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.449
 are placed between you get out your 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.040
 phone and we will go on 

00:03:58.449 --> 00:04:01.449
 internet and I think that there you 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.250
 start to know the manipulation 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.989
 so I'm going to spend it on time 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.829
 for not that it is too long and there 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.840
 you will see that when we go 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.729
 reappear in the session we are going 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.500
 reappear in the laboratory at 

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:13.719
 loved ones took me vote actually the one 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.459
 it's really huge and really 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:17.259
 a lot of stuff to see so some 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.519
 secret labs 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.630
 full of small pieces that opens 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.330
 full of doors that open 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.320
 frankly it's really huge 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:25.090
 then here for the case 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.380
 tryane little secret places so this one 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.420
 it is still a little more for too much 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:30.190
 players online mode or Troll 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.000
 your friends you will have to go in front of 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:35.470
 the garage at 400,000 so there is justice there 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.060
 is so to be able to do this little 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.530
 walrus you are already going to have to go 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.270
 once in your garage like me 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.970
 in the video once you're 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.440
 back home you go directly and there 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.940
 in fact when you come out look at this 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.450
 that I'm going to do my bums there my 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.920
 character 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.960
 he gets out of the garage and has it directly 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.420
 you run faster and more 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.070
 quickly in the air to re enter and 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:55.840
 then look here I went back in the 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.280
 garage is there in fact you can 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.510
 really role and your friends look at their 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.990
 shoot at it and will try to you 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.850
 to shoot on 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.430
 they will not be able to kill you so did 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.860
 a mini godmode guide we'll say where you 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.240
 can not bother other players 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.190
 and if we end up then for the 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.230
 last little secret place of the video 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.090
 so this one too and not either 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.010
 huge is not going to put everything in the 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.440
 same video you will come out of it in a 

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.060
 another episode including this one it takes 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.760
 do justice there so left in the middle 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.780
 of the map in in the forest and you 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.580
 see here that there is a small 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.740
 cave hidden so right behind me 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.960
 here look at a little crevices in 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.430
 the cliff look right here there you 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.410
 go inside and also you 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.210
 can have fun hiding yourself so 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.770
 your buddies will not find you and 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.850
 here we come to the end of the video 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.960
 anyway I really hope that this 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.790
 episode you will have liked 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.470
 do not hesitate to drop a little thumb 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:43.240
 purpose if that's the case and to subscribe if 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.690
 it's not already done it will really do 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.370
 pleasure 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.870
 so I know that there is already 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.670
 a lot of people who know these 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.960
 spots but considering that in addition to a new 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.100
 method for walt breach that one is 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.350
 really it was interesting to them 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.730
 go up and here I am I'll go 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.280
