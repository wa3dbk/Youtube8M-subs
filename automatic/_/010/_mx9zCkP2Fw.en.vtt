00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.169
 interesting at the same time curious that 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:28.480
 As you can see in the title to 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.220
 little mac does not want it even in japan 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.590
 What is this good? 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.480
 as you know in the last nintendo 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.309
 Direct little mac was introduced to him as 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.890

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.210
 bros that will come out both Paraguay and Cobra 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.480
 nintendo 3ds many have already celebrated 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.789
 many disappeared great but those of 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.190
 in middle law in off location have 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.920
 started to inquire and have gone beyond 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.690
 they have gone to the street they have asked and 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.510
 especially since the main 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.309
 consumers of this game and where 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.379
 nintendo and nintendo wii u is power 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.760
 number one which is the japan have 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.440
 asked japan and the truth that the 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.300
 people are not very happy about this 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.690
 new new 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.880
 new character not in the things that have 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.260
 said among others not the comments that 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.120
 they have heard from the people of japan 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.740
 they are too niche should have 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.090
 left as a trophy they would have to catch 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.760
 characters from another company before 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.130
 I do not know who should have 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.690
 listen used to the boy of kung fu is very 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.060
 popular in the West has been swarming 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.520
 there from the Danish I knew him is I 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.990
 I did not know him this captain rainbow the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.520
 punch out guy is really so 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.010
 important as appearing in smash bros 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.360
 is the punch out truth just the guys 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.880
 middle-aged as I know who is 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.320
 is even taking seriously the 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.280
 election of new nintendo fighters 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.440
 It really is a character that has been 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.560
 given enough ball is not from nintendo 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.120
 direct is really as important as 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.450
 to appear in a super smash bros 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.910
 nintendo does not know what characters 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.400
 choose for your new game and it's 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.060
 taking where you can from nintendo 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.580
 really dedicate your time in improving 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.770
 scenarios improve graphics or improve 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.500
 the characters that already exist with new 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.420
 techniques skills or new combos or 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.900
 like invent a new modality of 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.700
 game 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.489
 rather than waste time getting 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.989
 other characters that nobody really goes 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.819
 to use or they will use them to make 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:25.010
 grace and then they will stay in the 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.000
 you forget what you think the last 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.090
 comment that has made me quite 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.650
 grace is forgiveness who is this uncle and yes 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.989
 in Japan as I said it is 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.000
 power the number one in nintendo that 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.609
 there say super smash bros has to 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.120
 be like here in Spain say football or 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.670
 in argentina tell me if it is 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.500
 if they do not know who they are or do not really 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.870
 they think it's a good addition to 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.019
 team of characters that you can 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.940
 select in super smash bros 4 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.280
 really nintendo had it raised 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.319
 He has done it to do or what is happening 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.879
 here good I leave you with this news the 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.579
 true very interesting price 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.230
 my personal opinion is that I 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:04.030
 I would like characters to improve 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.739
 previous ones or by adding the new ones 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.659
 techniques or that will improve the scenarios 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.209
 that they did some extraordinary way 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.890
 of game before I put 30-40 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.440
 characters because in the end always only 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.680
 the 10 or 15 of always those that are chosen 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.480
 those that people choose and everyone else 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.180
 they tend to be forgotten 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.980
 or that only the lame ones when you say 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.870
 to catch us the worst players and 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.250
 let's make a stale game 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.049
 nothing that 's all very many thanks for 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.530
 have seen the video and subscribe or 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.530
 go dead
