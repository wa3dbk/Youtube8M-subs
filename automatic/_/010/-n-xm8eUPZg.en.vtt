 will perform in a new role in 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.350
 as a virtual operator given 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.330
 the project is called google project fay 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.490
 the company will use the network

 will use wi-fi 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.970
 proprietary technology will allow the smartphone 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.990
 switch between three sources 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.120
 choosing the one that is at the moment 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.630
 provides the highest quality 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:49.160
 signal and without interrupting the conversation 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.200
 transmitted data will be automatically 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.850
 curious also curious
