00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.790
 Go 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.860
 bell ringer 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.679
 indoor plants need periodically repotting 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:26.339
 both to give more space to the roots using a container in little more 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.149
 great 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.399
 and to check the health of the root system 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.329
 get yourself a bag of such good green soil mold 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:36.130
 quality 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.660
 it is a bit of expanded clay that is used to create a layer on the bottom of the vase 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.130
 draining 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.670
 keep a watering can with fresh water but not at hand 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.870
 chilly 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:47.910
 How many 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.080
 panetta the other small tools 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.330
 in this case the plant to bounce is a bit like a very tropical species 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.130
 easy resistant from beautiful foliage with hanging branches can creepers 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.280
 check the vessel size before transplanting 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.930
 ideal for the container to be slightly larger 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.640
 in this case a terracotta container was chosen which guarantees 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.630
 good radical breathing with a hole in the fire 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.070
 such photo 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.600
 it must be covered with a small piece of crock to let the excess water flow out 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.640
 preventing the soil from escaping 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.640
 some clay balls on the bottom 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.260
 and then put the soil 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.400
 which has previously been removed from the bag 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.690
 poured a saucer into a basin and manipulated to crumble the clods well 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.470
 milk red milk 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.510
 fill without getting to the rim of the jar 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.690
 married photos 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.990
 you can help me with a pencil to push the root out 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.890
 from the vase by removing the photo 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.020
 in fact in this case, as often happens, the roots had grown 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.980
 arranging itself as a ring 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.329
 it was certainly time to knead 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.279
 place the plant in the new container and add a little earth 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.189
 sliding it on all sides 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.879
 help yourself with your hands to place the plant together by compacting the soil 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.919
 around the roots 

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.899
 to the water tell me you can add a dose of liquid fertilizer 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:31.089
 universal or for green plants 

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:35.909
 the operation will have to be done every 10 15 days for the whole spring period 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.049
 and summer 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.220
 via gandolfo suspending the shooting 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.809
 between autumn and winter 

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:44.149
 a suggestion 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:48.729
 at least once a week take a beneficial foliage shower using 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:50.069
 a sprayer 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.499
 to eliminate dust and maintain a good humidity that favors development 

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:58.729
 of the plant and avoids the formation of dry spots on the foliage 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.700
 the beautiful white variegations on the leaves are more evident if the plant 

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.239
 it is kept in full light 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.299
 but not in direct sunlight
