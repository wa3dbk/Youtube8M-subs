 I would like to remember for those who did not know 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:18.610
 the yolk is the red one finally while 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.680
 calm vanilla that I don't have and therefore 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.359
 you can use vanillin 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.159
 particular we would like the grain of 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.170

 however we start immediately with the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:39.329
 proceeding that the first thing that 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.000

 let's roll out our pasta 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.739
 browse and sometimes you are if we have to 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:52.389
 take a hip and even sympathetic 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.819
 devil incarnate and let's cut 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.470

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.150

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.540
 I had said a twist 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.239
 we have to push the pasta strips 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.060

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.609

 to see each other again and to make a cannoli 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.449
 on the cross 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.159

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.920
 we take the silver paper and then 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.600
 let's fold it this way in 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.540
 so as to create a paper cone 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.790

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.650
