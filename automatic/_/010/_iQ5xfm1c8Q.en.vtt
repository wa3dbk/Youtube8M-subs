00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.460
 hello that such friends my name is Jorge and 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.750
 you are in your channel review apple what 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.400
 that we take in this video is something very 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.980
 interesting probably already you know him 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.200
 probably not and I wanted to explain 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.180
 all in a summarized way so that 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.860
 You can apply this in your daily life and 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.079
 realize that your hearing aids can 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.210
 make a lot more one of the first 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:24.880
 functions is that if we press the button 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.500
 to upload volume our iphone 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.210
 it will automatically take a photo takes 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.640
 note that this only works in the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.070
 active and in some apps that always 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.719
 direct to be able to do this since 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.850
 some applications that help you 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.620
 take pictures with either effects or as 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.329
 you want that does not work 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.850
 simply press the volume up 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.010
 with the calls if we press once 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.559
 as you know the calls are going to hang 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.739
 if we are listening to music and we are 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.480
 calling if we leave pressed we are going to 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.969
 listen to all vips and this is going to say 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.350
 that we ignore the call or yes if you are 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:58.850
 a busy person and you have two 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.219
 calls at the same time from your 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.469
 hearing aids just pressing you're going to 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.720
 able to exchange calls but 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.729
 also if you leave pressed you are going to hang 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.900
 the last one of the parts that we most 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.630
 Interested in 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.360
 of music you know that the middle button 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.490
 will happen or play the music two 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.890
 pulsations let's move on to the next 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.740
 song two beats and we keep the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.410
 second let's move forward a bit in the 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.120
 song until you find the nose in the 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.400
 part that you wanted to hear from the song 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.950
 three presses we are going to put the 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.690
 previous song three beats and 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.090
 we leave merged the third one is going to 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.830
 back the song and then the buttons 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.840
 of volume as he says it because they serve 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.310
 to increase the volume is also going to 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.380
 allow to activate siri if you are 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.150
 listening to music and suddenly you need 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.310
 know something like the weather or any 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.200
 thing that you can ask if you leave it 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.390
 simply pressed him and what 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.740
 you want to ask sidi do not touch him 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.020
 and if it will respond automatically 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.220
 being a little bit but he answers you and 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.680
 microphone for mac 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.060
 ips say that encourage him any mac what 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.920
 you will be able to use with a microphone 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.840
 but that also works for you 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.450
 computers with windows that do not have 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.209
 separate the microphone and the for 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.100
 listening to music there are some computers and 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.600
 you already have it together you can try 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.010
 put the image right now in the video 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.360
 to know if your computer is 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.990
 compatible with that but anyway 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.970
 if you connect it 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.010
 the microphone is going to serve you without any 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.690
 problem and well I hope that I have 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.280
 liked your advice the sconces you 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.280
 like me and I have the next
