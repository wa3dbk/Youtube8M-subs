00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.880
 after she hurries downloaded 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.540
 create a folder 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.540
 called statements 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.970

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.980
 firmware 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.050
 we transfer two files this file and here from itself 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.150
 firmware file million 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.390
 second and third 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.390
 we are waiting for the end of the value 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.240
 now we don't have a bob rule 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.180
 multiplayer open 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.180
 go to the program 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.210

 and there we will start our little speed 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.030
 and indicate our staff who we 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.509
 removed from the older firmware it is 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.119
 floppy drive attempts

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.639
 checkmarks should be next to the next 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.329
 point 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.789
 re partition 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:41.129
