southern part of the state we have very
intense<00:02:01.920> sunlight<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:03.179> a<00:02:03.210> lot<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.539> times

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
intense sunlight so a lot of times

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.889 
intense sunlight so a lot of times
having<00:02:04.020> plants<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.799> are<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:06.030> little<00:02:06.749> bit

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
having plants that are in a little bit

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.990 
having plants that are in a little bit
less<00:02:08.269> full<00:02:09.269> exposure<00:02:09.720> situation<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:11.640> plants

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
less full exposure situation the plants

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.460 
less full exposure situation the plants
actually<00:02:12.360> do<00:02:12.540> better<00:02:12.780> because<00:02:13.019> they<00:02:13.230> still

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
actually do better because they still

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.740 
actually do better because they still
get<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.650> good<00:02:13.890> amount<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.879> sunlight<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.540> yet

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
get a good amount of sunlight and yet

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.210 
get a good amount of sunlight and yet
they<00:02:15.930> get<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> little<00:02:16.409> protection<00:02:16.739> from<00:02:17.040> the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
they get a little protection from the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.210 
they get a little protection from the
real<00:02:17.400> hot<00:02:17.670> part<00:02:18.510> of<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.659> day<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.860> plants

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
real hot part of the day so the plants

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.820 
real hot part of the day so the plants
do<00:02:20.370> great<00:02:20.670> these<00:02:21.569> will<00:02:21.840> last<00:02:22.050> you<00:02:22.769> know

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
do great these will last you know

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.910 
do great these will last you know
basically<00:02:23.310> forever<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:24.440> these<00:02:25.440> are<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.709> seed

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
basically forever and these are the seed

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.770 
basically forever and these are the seed
pod<00:02:26.159> again<00:02:26.459> and<00:02:26.760> as<00:02:26.879> you<00:02:27.000> put<00:02:27.209> them<00:02:27.269> up<00:02:27.420> against

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
pod again and as you put them up against

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.170 
pod again and as you put them up against
lights<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.440> see<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.830> seats<00:02:29.180> showing

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
lights you can see the seats showing

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.820 
lights you can see the seats showing
through<00:02:30.480> them<00:02:30.629> so<00:02:30.930> they're<00:02:31.200> they're<00:02:31.560> quite

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
through them so they're they're quite

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.710 
through them so they're they're quite
attractive<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:32.670> for<00:02:33.060> several<00:02:33.269> different
