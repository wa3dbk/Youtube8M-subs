00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hey people martin might have here 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.069
 it will get some of you with it 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.069
 at least those who follow me to punishment 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.360
 or maybe hang out with me that 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.580
 I did a little tour with 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.340
 two mates are by Germany 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.330
 just in five days from Munich to 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.690
 drove hamburg 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.359
 a total of 750 kilometers per day in the 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.570
 So cut 150 kilometers from the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.220
 cut was not that is due 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.810
 from technical problems and couple 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.929
 Other things we had in the worst 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.989
 case was 60 kilometers and on the last day 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.450
 another 300 kilometers and in this 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.920
 video is just about the 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.690
 So that's what I ate 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.520
 I think so will 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.719
 transfer to other history 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.969
 all degrees for the people who maybe 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.820
 somewhere longer in the road 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.379
 the mountains when hiking etc 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.940
 and what I ate I want 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.379
 we have to introduce ourselves in principle we have 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.760
 Similar pour but it was still a few 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.860
 differences but I just want 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.109
 Report what I did 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.000
 So basically I have the morning 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.530
 starting with oatmeal 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.390
 yes, I have about halfway here 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.159
 pack so 250 300 grams dry mass 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.439
 Oatmeal more soaked in water 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.909
 maybe some orange juice too 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.090
 a few dried fruit here too 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.869
 example raw food rosin and that was it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.189
 yes, yes 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.659
 and that's how you get along 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.740
 a few hours and is a very 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.210
 solid base 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.220
 whatever you could take it to 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.689
 Example buckwheat or other 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.299
 For example , mixed cereals were used 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.710
 Examined amaranth ic in it is that 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.979
 I do not now in my opinion 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.740
 that is just the hottest thing I still 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.030
 ate it very much 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.700
 been dry fruits 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.380
 and although the things are really mine 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.420
 eventually to halse out back 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.040
 so i could not man you can not 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.210
 See more sweet things at some point 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.220
 you just shut up 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.140
 but you know exactly what I have 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.520
 actually eaten too little and what you 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.409
 definitely want to avoid 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.720
 especially with his hunger who so 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.909
 a long tour in hungry hast thou 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.710
 never really want to be that different 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.420
 that will then just critical then have 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.759
 you no longer do not lust any more 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.990
 more and it wants that I wanted 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.960
 avoid any case that means I have 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.439
 then sometimes just eaten yes hey 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.140
 come over 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.580
 this still needs to be done in quantity 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.160
 although i do not mind anymore 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.569
 had still are my 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.770
 I get dried fruits very well 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.620
 have now the rohkost them 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.150
 just said I also have cowards 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.490
 the guests did relatively many dates 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.900
 and always drunk directly 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.260
 So then I always have it immediately 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.270
 Drunk what I did too 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.730
 I'm self- absorbed every day 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.620
 have orange juice often but so too 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.450
 other mixing why mango juice or something 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.060
 for example and I have you every day 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.560
 one to two liters of juice still drunk 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.380
 otherwise I do not even drink for that 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.940
 a week and you have already 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.959
 seen in others because a degree 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.610
 maybe if you are a little bit like that 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.310
 Active may not be so essential 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.140
 so appetizing but has since again 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.670
 little bit gets in and he says 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.680
 has me right so that's right 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.550
 once so weighed one to two liters 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.800
 Orange juice, what else do I have 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.190
 still eaten but of course then 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.110
 Again, potatoes just vegetables 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.880
 such things and then always 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.920
 only after feeling 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.420
 So, so to speak, none of us has 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.790
 started the calories too 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.170
 count or something I have me too 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.090
 wanted as a happen with the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.660
 tomato also brought that I have now times 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.870
 everything is organic 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.700
 organic dom panic is clearly because 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.760
 you just do not always just that, so to speak 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.190
 Sweet only the dried fruit is what I am 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.489
 I realized after the first day 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.860
 So on the first day I have practical 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.329
 No fruits eaten and I have 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.100
 Immediately noticed on the second day I 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.930
 I need the right flight 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.829
 Keeper and then I have the rest 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:49.650
 pulled through the week and raspberries me 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:51.989
 bananas blueberries and such things 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.200
 Also sometimes brought nectarines or much 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.760
 sure and that's easy for me 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.340
 great foot and when I still have 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.049
 I also packed it 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.870
 bow bow wow I'm fine now 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:06.180
 Now it's fun to do that , of course 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.459
 germany very easily because you have 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.620
 every corner supermarkets and shops and 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.390
 any vegetable stalls for my sake 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.950
 you can get the stuff if now 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.570
 On the go, that would be more difficult 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.340
 you would need even more dried fruit 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.660
 Harp etc eat 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.490
 but that's what I did 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.840
 according to the name so the gps 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.610
 what I had with us we have 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.430
 worst case 8000 calories 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.710
 additionally consumes what beliefs per day 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.139
 I'm not quite right but so 5000 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.729
 calories five to six thousand 1000 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.530
 Calories can have been 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.750
 just at the last 300 kilometers 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.030
 that means that day needs you 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:46.620
 already 5,000 to 7,000 kilocalories 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.319
 yes that is of course in the 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.199
 order of a certain simple of 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.180
 the amount of brutally much and much 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:55.919
 what i have eaten but really 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.830
 moderately kept even the last 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.380
 two evenings is avocados I have ne 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.990
 fat avocado eaten once each 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.819
 that's it for the day and music 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.830
 It does not matter if always up to more fat 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:10.530
 it left and right and any 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.659
 beans or vegetables you use that 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.860
 all so good of the metabolism so active 

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:17.009
 and you just need it 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.289
 in that sense, I am with it 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:22.470
 got along great by the 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:24.180
 come tour and perhaps was the 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.009
 one or two tips for you 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.110
 and if you still have great suggestions 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.639
 Write me and I would like to 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.280
 this place really stress again 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.860
 how cool and how important the fruits are 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.289
 So really fresh fruits have 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.750
 for me really feeling again 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.039
 So push right until then 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.219
 Thank you for watching 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.219
 ciao
