00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960

that<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.230> picked<00:00:28.439> out<00:00:29.480> aren't<00:00:30.480> lining<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.930> for

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
that I picked out aren't lining up for

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.400 
that I picked out aren't lining up for
matching<00:00:31.470> the<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.430> hubs<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.700> I've<00:00:32.820> got<00:00:33.030> I

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
matching the the hubs that I've got I

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.930 
matching the the hubs that I've got I
wouldn't<00:00:34.410> expect<00:00:34.559> an<00:00:34.800> app<00:00:34.950> when<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.520> when<00:00:35.850> I've

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
wouldn't expect an app when I when I've

wouldn't expect an app when I when I've
got<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.239> wheels<00:00:37.790> just<00:00:38.790> wasn't<00:00:39.120> something<00:00:39.210> I

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
got the wheels just wasn't something I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.150 
got the wheels just wasn't something I
was<00:00:39.540> thinking<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.470> bolt<00:00:40.650> pattern<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
was thinking of the bolt pattern is the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.670 
was thinking of the bolt pattern is the
same<00:00:41.390> but<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> design<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.900> the<00:00:43.110> wheel<00:00:43.260> itself

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
same but the design of the wheel itself

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.140 
same but the design of the wheel itself
is<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.010> real<00:00:44.250> inset<00:00:44.640> will<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.830> it<00:00:46.830> the<00:00:47.519> hub<00:00:47.820> has

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
is a real inset will so it the hub has

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.540 
is a real inset will so it the hub has
to<00:00:48.269> go<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.540> deeper<00:00:48.900> into<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.170> wheel<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.620> order

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
to go in deeper into the wheel in order

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.390 
to go in deeper into the wheel in order
for<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> bolts<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.510> go<00:00:51.540> through<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.309> give<00:00:53.309> you

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
for the bolts to go through and give you

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.710 
for the bolts to go through and give you
enough<00:00:53.640> bite<00:00:53.909> and<00:00:55.010> it<00:00:56.010> adapt<00:00:56.400> I<00:00:56.820> can't<00:00:57.269> machine

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
enough bite and it adapt I can't machine

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.100 
enough bite and it adapt I can't machine
out<00:00:57.900> the<00:00:58.650> wheel<00:00:59.370> is<00:01:00.269> probably<00:01:00.629> wouldn't<00:01:00.960> run

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
out the wheel is probably wouldn't run

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.170 
out the wheel is probably wouldn't run
the<00:01:01.229> wheel<00:01:01.409> and<00:01:01.650> I<00:01:02.190> can't<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.580> crap<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the wheel and I can't do crap to the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.810 
the wheel and I can't do crap to the
frickin<00:01:03.540> hub<00:01:03.720> so<00:01:04.680> I'm<00:01:05.220> gonna<00:01:05.339> take<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.670> hub

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
frickin hub so I'm gonna take the hub

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.899 
frickin hub so I'm gonna take the hub
down<00:01:06.030> now<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.570> tire<00:01:07.049> place<00:01:07.729> where<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.790> got

down now to the tire place where I got
these<00:01:09.060> custom<00:01:09.420> wheels<00:01:09.570> from<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.560> we

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
these custom wheels from and see if we

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.230 
these custom wheels from and see if we
can't<00:01:10.950> find<00:01:11.159> another<00:01:11.460> nice<00:01:11.670> set<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.970> custom

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
can't find another nice set of custom

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.630 
can't find another nice set of custom
wheels<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:13.530> these<00:01:13.799> hubs<00:01:14.130> will<00:01:14.340> actually

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
wheels that these hubs will actually

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.000 
wheels that these hubs will actually
match<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.330> work<00:01:15.930> so<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.470> my<00:01:16.590> man<00:01:16.830> I'm
