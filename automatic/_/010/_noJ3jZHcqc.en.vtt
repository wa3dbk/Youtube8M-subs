spell the aircraft's undoing but in fact
the<00:01:10.670> first<00:01:11.000> flight<00:01:11.210> was<00:01:11.240> very<00:01:11.750> uneventful<00:01:12.110> and

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
the first flight was very uneventful and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.800 
the first flight was very uneventful and
the<00:01:12.710> only<00:01:12.890> thing<00:01:13.070> that<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:13.250> can<00:01:13.490> remember<00:01:13.810> about

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
the only thing that I can remember about

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.859 
the only thing that I can remember about
the<00:01:15.020> snag<00:01:15.409> list<00:01:15.680> was<00:01:16.009> the<00:01:16.580> criticize<00:01:17.479> the

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
the snag list was the criticize the

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.690 
the snag list was the criticize the
position<00:01:18.259> of<00:01:18.350> two<00:01:18.500> electrical<00:01:19.009> switches<00:01:19.460> oh

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
position of two electrical switches oh

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.609 
position of two electrical switches oh
and<00:01:20.360> he<00:01:20.479> said<00:01:20.689> he<00:01:20.780> wanted<00:01:21.049> a<00:01:21.140> clock<00:01:21.380> in<00:01:21.530> the

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
and he said he wanted a clock in the

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:22.990 
and he said he wanted a clock in the
aircraft<00:01:22.009> I<00:01:22.159> guess<00:01:22.310> he<00:01:22.430> wanted<00:01:22.670> to<00:01:22.729> come<00:01:22.970> down

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
aircraft I guess he wanted to come down

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:35.310 
aircraft I guess he wanted to come down
in<00:01:23.330> time<00:01:23.479> for<00:01:23.720> lunch

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.010 

the<00:01:36.320> arrow<00:01:37.690> was<00:01:38.690> really<00:01:39.200> very<00:01:39.470> advanced<00:01:41.020> its

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
the arrow was really very advanced its

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.640 
the arrow was really very advanced its
performance<00:01:42.710> altitude<00:01:43.610> is<00:01:44.540> actually<00:01:45.470> better

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
performance altitude is actually better

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:48.040 
performance altitude is actually better

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
than the present-day jet fighters its

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.180 
than the present-day jet fighters its
capability<00:01:48.650> of<00:01:49.240> steep<00:01:50.240> turns<00:01:50.540> and

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
they had very long range and very heavy

they had very long range and very heavy

cut up to because they just cut the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
and and to see the six airplanes just

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.510 
and and to see the six airplanes just
copy<00:03:20.210> the<00:03:20.510> chunks<00:03:20.810> where<00:03:20.990> it<00:03:21.080> said<00:03:21.350> it<00:03:22.340> was
