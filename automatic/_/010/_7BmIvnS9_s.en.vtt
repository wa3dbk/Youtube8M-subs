00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
 Hello, I have a little nail today 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:10.160
 video for you 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.160
 and for that you only need a pair of scissors 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:18.230
 tesafilm and your nail polish I have 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.789
 now just a white one blue 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.220
 and taken a dark red 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.890
 and yes I have a hand on mine 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.590
 so my fingers are painted too 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.480
 always in the picture then you take yourself 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.660
 just in tesafilm and cuts 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.079
 just thin strips of it ever 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.760
 after how many streets you want 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.250
 you have to stop the strips thinner or 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.390
 cut thicker 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.670
 I have my nails before now 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.440
 simply completely painted the white 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.500
 should, however, dried very well 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.000
 it's best the day before so yes 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.670
 nothing s.Tesafilm gets stuck and then 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.020
 you just stick yours 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:03.780
 Cut to size on the 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:07.130
 nail it should you best on it 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.360
 pay attention that it is relatively straight and 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.010
 then you just take yours 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.270
 nail polish I just have one now 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.900
 blue is taken from kiko and then fills 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.900
 the gaps 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.720
 Of course, that does not have to be that special either 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.540
 be neat because he will be with the rest 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.159
 masked tesafilm have only s.den 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.380
 You have to pay attention to that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:37.740
 they themselves are not his skin on 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:40.200
 Of course you can also paint each one 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.810
 take other color you like 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:47.250
 but I found blue and white now 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.360
 nice and that's what you just teach 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.360
 your whole fingers 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.230
 and then the whole thing just has to be done 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.960
 dry 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.180
 to pass your time you can 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.220
 just flip through a magazine 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.840
 but best take care that you 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.840
 no German in the nails skin 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.480
 or you just play a game 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:29.890
 your mobile phone i can hugo you very much 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.990
 I really recommend the game 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.610
 I love you and I'll show you 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:41.410
 now how best not to do it 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:44.280
 such museums can I am today 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.280
 unbelievable good 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:03:10.180
 or you just listen to some music if 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.709
 the whole thing is then dried well 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.190
 her just the tesa filmstrip 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.190
 pull it off 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.150
 you should have something on the sides 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.760
 be careful with that too 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:29.860
 nothing of the white a succeeded nail polish 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:31.780
 get stuck on it and if you do that then 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.790
 should have done with all the hedgehogs 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.790
 whole look like this 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.670
 to take care of the heart, I suppose 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.900
 now just a dark red 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.570
 nail polish and a bobby pins and with 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.530
 the tip of it, if I'm three points 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.450
 on my finger and then try that way 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.600
 to connect that in the end like 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.370
 It looks like a heart at first 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.480
 hard but after a while it works 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.459
 actually quite good and it could be 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.150
 on a nail or on all nails 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:16.669
 do as you like it best and 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.380
 the whole looks then so I hope 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.640
 you liked the video and would 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.470

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.190

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.190
