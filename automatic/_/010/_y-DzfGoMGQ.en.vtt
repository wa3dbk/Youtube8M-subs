00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.780
 the morning has gold in the morning 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.219
 has gold in its mouth and buoys in publishing in 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.660
 this period publishes this period 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.940
 is experiencing this beautiful moment 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.180
 we all know how it is in 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.180
 crisis 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.820
 among other things the publishing industry has discovered 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.099
 that there is really a lot of photography 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.590
 in the world there is a lot on the net ce 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.689
 there is a lot available easily to 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.520
 very advantageous prices even 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.140
 free you can make to realize 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.210
 photography people who do it 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.710
 gladly also for the sake of it and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.510
 so there is this great overabundance 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.420
 of images and images at last 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.829
 at a cost close to zero 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.920
 finally everyone can be filled 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.140
 these holes in the magazines that is that 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.850
 inter qalche interspersing the pieces of 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.870
 journalistic communication that I am 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.780
 those registered who have is really 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.730
 something to say because it doesn't work 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.199
 so why should it not work that way 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:05.549
 because this way of seeing things 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.560
 ignore or pretend that there is no one 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.070
 reality that is undeniable and is 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.450
 disruptive to be honest if 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.689
 this morning the hood with the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.380
 brioche and there was the daily quanta 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.939
 stuff 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.369
 you read about that communication from 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.619
 quality that is made of journalists by 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.750
 that written communication of that 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.580
 mare magnum of information on how many you 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.530
 he paused to the point of reading the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.390
 nudge the content 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.079
 or if there is a monthly magazine that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.060
 you have at home and that is also bought how much 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.860
 time you used to read 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.659
 really what you're content with 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.640
 yes it is surely read it reads if 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.649
 not if you are not illiterate you did with 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:49.140
 read but honestly everything is not 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.060
 reads what matches me like 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.820
 target is what matches me 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.009
 as a target, I am notified by one 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.380
 communication that partially did 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.509
 of titles and partly in part 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.280
 still greater than the images because 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.659
 images have the face to ease 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.469
 the ability to communicate 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.910
 immediately yes in the media 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.140
 the set of concepts that are then 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.870
 those that 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.910
 is interested in meeting in detail in the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.890
 detailed quality communication that 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.520
 the journalist the journalist is in 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.490
 written piece but much more than the title 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:27.410
 that uses words and therefore has gods 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.410
 limits related to words the image 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.090
 let me explain dog the word dog is yes 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.770
 descriptive of the concept of dog 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.440
 of the cannes archetype is stuff 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:41.190
 four legs but says little I should 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.530
 to tell instead the photograph of 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.830
 a dog if used intelligently 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.230
 a beautiful image can be the dog 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.620
 soft cuddly that should be kept indoors 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.790
 to play with them tender or the dog with 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.360
 sickly languid eyes 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.470
 abused that therefore must be 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.420
 safe 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.400
 or the rabid asshole dog who 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:06.750
 he bites my son at the playground and makes a 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.030
 poo on the driveway you understand are kaka ne 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.769
 it is little the photograph of a dog describes 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.150
 a whole universe of a whole dog 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.549
 universe of interests and a whole 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.019
 universe below subtended elements 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.870
 which I then go to read in 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.160
 communication then in communication 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.880
 of quality that for charity and that 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.410
 written but to devote time to 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.239
 to read 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.400
 there must be a mechanism that goes off 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.780
 and it makes me understand that I desire to 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.840
 read that thing is desire 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.000
 because it touches the strings that are those 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.610
 that which vibrate that live in me comes 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.579
 communicated by images because 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.130
 use in this game a 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.060
 professional to realize for for per 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.500
 The photos 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.989
 since there are so many photographs in 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.410
 general but because a professional all 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.480
 combines two elements that help 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.070
 really in the communication that I am 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.049
 the ability to make good 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:59.850
 images and this is a widespread ability 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:02.250
 now he does n't know the whole world but widespread 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.140
 enough and more as in time 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.200
 head and heart but time because he lives there 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.459
 this thing plus the knowledge of the 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.170
 things he is telling in pictures 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.900
 why a journalist who works for 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.480
 images does not make four clicks 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.299
 Sunday and then you live on a completely different life 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.950
 lives within the topic that the 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.269
 his specialization within 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.740
 that company he describes inside 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.540
 of those sports specialization that 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.550
 describes inside 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.560
 of that world and therefore combines the 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.960
 ability to narrate through images and 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.310
 this introductory narrative 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.650
 very important for the reason there 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.630
 we said before also adds the 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.370
 knowledge of that world and therefore with 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.170
 a story design ability that 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.580
 otherwise you can't have it because it's not there 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:47.030
 there is no time the subject of time goes 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.790
 having said that publishing is partly in 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.310
 crisis also because people together 

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.760
 some people prefer to dedicate the 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.580
 little time that it is to the channels that 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.520
 transmit more interesting elements 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.780
 then if you are watching a video on 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.940
 youtube instead of reading an article 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.260
 between taking these things are summarized 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.420
 and a page of our website 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.000
 which you can find below and then 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.300
 read but you are watching a video e 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.310
 because the reading ended up falling 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.650
 in publishing finished falling a bit into a 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.140
 corner for the lost capacity of 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.530
 attract attention but we said to each other 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.460
 attention is not attracted by the 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.200
 of the set of gray stripes 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.390
 attention is drawn to some 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.090
 what catches you while you pass and the 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.800
 photography for this serves attention 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.290
 inside the magazine means 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.420
 time that is dedicated dedicated time 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.520
 dedicated means interest for 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:41.480
 advertising advertiser 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.600
 advertising advertiser means 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.980
 money to keep up with publishing 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.980
 let's help each other here
