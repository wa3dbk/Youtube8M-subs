00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.589 
down
and<00:03:01.180> aji

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
and aji

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.920 
and aji
d

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.430 

the<00:03:09.830> only<00:03:10.100> exception<00:03:10.580> to<00:03:10.850> the<00:03:11.090> DGD<00:03:11.630> a<00:03:11.870> call

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
the only exception to the DGD a call

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.110 
the only exception to the DGD a call
sequence<00:03:12.890> is<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.130> build<00:03:13.340> up<00:03:13.460> to<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.760> chorus

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
sequence is to build up to the chorus

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.610 
sequence is to build up to the chorus
from<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.510> verse<00:03:14.690> which<00:03:15.020> lives<00:03:15.350> on<00:03:15.500> the<00:03:15.590> a

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
from the verse which lives on the a

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.820 
from the verse which lives on the a
chord<00:03:16.100> for<00:03:16.370> four<00:03:16.580> bars<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.570> lyrics<00:03:18.350> over

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
chord for four bars and the lyrics over

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.610 
chord for four bars and the lyrics over
that<00:03:19.010> are<00:03:19.490> thee<00:03:19.790> and<00:03:20.030> I'll<00:03:20.660> shout<00:03:21.170> it<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.530> the

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
that are thee and I'll shout it to the

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.770 
that are thee and I'll shout it to the
blue<00:03:21.800> summer<00:03:22.100> sky<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.880> so<00:03:23.060> it<00:03:23.210> sort<00:03:23.510> of<00:03:23.570> is

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
blue summer sky and so it sort of is

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:44.170 
blue summer sky and so it sort of is
here<00:03:24.260> just<00:03:24.410> a<00:03:24.620> major<00:03:24.890> new<00:03:25.220> can<00:03:25.490> go

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.640 

so<00:03:45.180> that's<00:03:45.360> solver<00:03:45.780> chord<00:03:45.990> strumming<00:03:46.320> stuff

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
so that's solver chord strumming stuff

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.370 
so that's solver chord strumming stuff
for<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.370> song

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
for the song

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.870 
for the song
so<00:03:49.380> the<00:03:49.500> third<00:03:49.710> part<00:03:49.740> for<00:03:50.250> throw<00:03:50.430> your<00:03:50.580> arms

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
so the third part for throw your arms

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.510 
so the third part for throw your arms
around<00:03:51.000> me<00:03:51.300> is<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.990> intro<00:03:52.770> which<00:03:52.980> basically

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
around me is the intro which basically

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.110 
around me is the intro which basically
is<00:03:53.910> using<00:03:54.510> our<00:03:54.600> PJs<00:03:55.020> using<00:03:55.560> this<00:03:55.710> D<00:03:56.400> triangle

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
is using our PJs using this D triangle

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.580 
is using our PJs using this D triangle
shape<00:03:57.360> here<00:03:58.050> which<00:03:58.620> plays<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.310> chords<00:03:59.520> D<00:04:00.590> we

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
shape here which plays the chords D we

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.210 
shape here which plays the chords D we
slide<00:04:01.860> this<00:04:02.190> up<00:04:02.400> here<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:03.500> is<00:04:04.500> G<00:04:04.890> in<00:04:05.100> this

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
slide this up here that is G in this

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.370 
slide this up here that is G in this
little<00:04:05.460> slide<00:04:05.910> up<00:04:06.090> to<00:04:06.360> here<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:06.930> position

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
little slide up to here in this position

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.380 
little slide up to here in this position
which<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.650> your<00:04:08.280> third<00:04:08.460> finger<00:04:08.610> now<00:04:08.850> where<00:04:09.300> the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
which is your third finger now where the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.510 
which is your third finger now where the
twelfth<00:04:09.660> fret<00:04:09.750> is<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:12.230> and<00:04:13.230> so<00:04:13.890> within<00:04:14.190> that

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
twelfth fret is is a and so within that

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.980 
twelfth fret is is a and so within that
I'll<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:14.910> play<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.240> played<00:04:15.660> the<00:04:15.810> whole

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
thing you can sort of watch the closeup

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:28.720 
thing you can sort of watch the closeup
of<00:04:18.090> what's<00:04:18.360> happening

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 
hammer lick off so within the arpeggio

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.570 
hammer lick off so within the arpeggio
of<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.560> chord

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.330 

one<00:05:07.090> more<00:05:07.240> time

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.850 

so<00:05:12.000> just<00:05:12.210> a<00:05:12.270> little<00:05:12.480> bit<00:05:12.870> on<00:05:12.990> top<00:05:13.170> icing<00:05:13.680> on<00:05:13.770> the

cake sort of stuff and the same thing

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.550 
cake sort of stuff and the same thing
will<00:05:15.360> happen<00:05:15.630> when<00:05:15.750> we<00:05:15.780> get<00:05:15.960> up<00:05:16.050> to<00:05:16.170> the<00:05:16.320> G

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
will happen when we get up to the G

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.220 
will happen when we get up to the G
chord<00:05:17.400> up<00:05:18.240> here<00:05:18.630> which<00:05:18.810> is<00:05:18.930> again<00:05:19.110> the<00:05:19.140> same

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:30.950 
the very final piece of the puzzle is

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.370 
the very final piece of the puzzle is
the<00:05:31.550> a<00:05:31.730> chord<00:05:32.150> using<00:05:32.360> this<00:05:32.600> D<00:05:32.750> triangle<00:05:33.200> shape

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
the a chord using this D triangle shape

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
your pickling direction as you play

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.010 
your pickling direction as you play
through<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.710> arpeggio<00:05:54.250> so<00:05:54.490> all<00:05:54.760> so<00:05:55.630> avoid

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
through the arpeggio so all so avoid

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.600 
through the arpeggio so all so avoid
just<00:05:56.290> going<00:05:56.500> all<00:05:56.590> the<00:05:56.710> way<00:05:56.740> down<00:05:56.830> with<00:05:57.460> each

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
just going all the way down with each

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:58.860 
just going all the way down with each
pick<00:05:57.910> all<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.240> way<00:05:58.360> up<00:05:58.419> so<00:05:58.600> when<00:05:58.720> it<00:05:58.810> gets

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
pick all the way up so when it gets

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.470 
pick all the way up so when it gets
faster<00:05:59.370> becomes<00:06:00.370> more<00:06:00.580> smooth<00:06:00.880> and<00:06:01.030> efficient

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:01.480 
faster becomes more smooth and efficient

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.540 
faster becomes more smooth and efficient
as<00:06:01.600> I<00:06:01.750> say<00:06:01.900> efficient<00:06:02.350> picking<00:06:02.680> so<00:06:02.950> the

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
as I say efficient picking so the

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.659 
as I say efficient picking so the
picking<00:06:03.910> is<00:06:04.620> down<00:06:05.620> down<00:06:06.190> up<00:06:06.730> down<00:06:07.450> oh<00:06:07.720> oh<00:06:08.669> I

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:09.669 
picking is down down up down oh oh I

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.690 
picking is down down up down oh oh I
change<00:06:10.630> the<00:06:10.780> next<00:06:11.020> one<00:06:11.169> same<00:06:11.470> thing<00:06:11.500> down<00:06:12.100> down

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:12.700 
change the next one same thing down down

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.879 
change the next one same thing down down
up<00:06:13.060> down<00:06:13.750> up<00:06:14.139> up<00:06:15.570> and<00:06:16.570> then<00:06:16.990> the<00:06:17.169> last<00:06:17.350> one<00:06:17.650> down
