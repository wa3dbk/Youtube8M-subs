vertical when you're hitting your
topspin<00:00:34.090> approach<00:00:34.480> now<00:00:35.289> this<00:00:35.469> the<00:00:35.829> mistake

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:36.220 
topspin approach now this the mistake

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.819 
topspin approach now this the mistake
usually<00:00:36.880> happens<00:00:37.329> on<00:00:37.480> the<00:00:37.870> players<00:00:38.140> backswing

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
usually happens on the players backswing

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.250 
usually happens on the players backswing
well<00:00:39.430> I'll<00:00:39.640> show<00:00:39.790> you<00:00:39.820> what<00:00:40.030> I<00:00:40.060> mean<00:00:40.300> from<00:00:41.079> the

ready position the racket face is closed
now<00:00:43.750> sometimes<00:00:44.230> when<00:00:44.350> players<00:00:44.590> come<00:00:44.860> back

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
now sometimes when players come back

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.729 
now sometimes when players come back

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
the elbow drops in notice the racket

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.130 
the elbow drops in notice the racket
face<00:00:50.350> is<00:00:50.410> open<00:00:50.950> now<00:00:51.579> you<00:00:51.970> have<00:00:52.390> to<00:00:52.540> close<00:00:52.870> the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
side view okay I'm in my ready position

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.020 
side view okay I'm in my ready position
and<00:00:59.500> bring<00:00:59.649> the<00:00:59.800> racket<00:01:00.130> back<00:01:00.160> but<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.670> elbow

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
drops in the racket opens up now as you

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.179 
drops in the racket opens up now as you
swing<00:01:04.210> forward<00:01:04.570> your<00:01:05.140> racket<00:01:05.530> face<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.770> laid

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
back you have to flick the wrist just at

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.129 
back you have to flick the wrist just at
the<00:01:09.100> right<00:01:09.249> moment<00:01:09.759> to<00:01:09.850> be<00:01:09.969> vertical<00:01:10.420> this<00:01:10.929> is

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:11.139 
the right moment to be vertical this is

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:14.219 
the right moment to be vertical this is
very<00:01:11.469> risky<00:01:11.950> business<00:01:13.079> sometimes<00:01:14.079> you'll

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
very risky business sometimes you'll

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:15.779 
very risky business sometimes you'll
hear<00:01:14.319> players<00:01:14.619> say<00:01:14.859> yeah<00:01:15.069> no<00:01:15.130> problem<00:01:15.700> I'll

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829 
just roll the racket over the ball for

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.489 
just roll the racket over the ball for
topspin<00:01:18.369> that's<00:01:19.029> a<00:01:19.240> common<00:01:19.659> myth<00:01:19.869> you<00:01:20.079> cannot

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:20.499 
topspin that's a common myth you cannot

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:23.249 
topspin that's a common myth you cannot
do<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:21.789> ball<00:01:22.060> is<00:01:22.329> only<00:01:22.509> on<00:01:22.779> the<00:01:22.929> strings

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
do that the ball is only on the strings

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.800 
do that the ball is only on the strings
for<00:01:23.529> milliseconds<00:01:24.490> so<00:01:24.969> you're<00:01:25.179> swinging<00:01:25.659> up

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
for milliseconds so you're swinging up

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.169 
for milliseconds so you're swinging up
with<00:01:25.990> an<00:01:26.079> open<00:01:26.229> face<00:01:26.619> all<00:01:26.950> these<00:01:27.670> shots<00:01:27.969> are

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
with an open face all these shots are

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:31.980 
with an open face all these shots are
long<00:01:28.420> long<00:01:29.139> long<00:01:29.829> long<00:01:30.369> long<00:01:30.429> boom<00:01:31.270> when<00:01:31.869> you

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
long long long long long boom when you

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.199 
long long long long long boom when you
get<00:01:32.139> there<00:01:32.380> okay<00:01:32.649> that<00:01:32.829> one<00:01:32.979> stays<00:01:33.249> in<00:01:33.279> but

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
get there okay that one stays in but

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.929 
get there okay that one stays in but
then<00:01:34.389> all<00:01:34.569> these<00:01:34.810> are<00:01:34.869> in<00:01:35.139> the<00:01:35.349> net<00:01:35.939> really

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
then all these are in the net really

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.870 
then all these are in the net really
that<00:01:37.119> rolling<00:01:37.659> over<00:01:38.049> can<00:01:39.039> really<00:01:39.520> hurt<00:01:39.670> your

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
that rolling over can really hurt your

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.669 
that rolling over can really hurt your
consistency<00:01:40.450> on<00:01:40.749> your<00:01:40.929> topspin<00:01:41.349> approach

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
consistency on your topspin approach

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.889 
consistency on your topspin approach
shots<00:01:41.979> so<00:01:42.880> this<00:01:43.029> is<00:01:43.209> what<00:01:43.359> you<00:01:43.479> want<00:01:43.689> to<00:01:43.779> do

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:43.899 
shots so this is what you want to do

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.559 
shots so this is what you want to do

I<00:02:17.110> drop<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.590> down<00:02:17.710> a<00:02:17.770> foot<00:02:18.100> below<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.340> ball

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
I drop it down a foot below the ball

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.170 
I drop it down a foot below the ball
swing<00:02:19.570> up<00:02:19.780> now<00:02:20.140> there's<00:02:20.590> my<00:02:20.800> contact<00:02:21.180> okay

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
swing up now there's my contact okay

swing up now there's my contact okay
it's<00:02:22.360> okay<00:02:22.480> for<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.110> risk<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.560> go<00:02:23.740> this<00:02:24.130> way<00:02:24.430> on

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
it's okay for the risk to go this way on

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.540 
it's okay for the risk to go this way on
a<00:02:24.790> topspin<00:02:25.690> shot<00:02:26.020> your<00:02:26.680> wrist<00:02:26.860> goes<00:02:27.070> this<00:02:27.310> way

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
a topspin shot your wrist goes this way

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.430 
a topspin shot your wrist goes this way
you'll<00:02:27.730> generate<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.240> little<00:02:28.600> more<00:02:28.750> spin<00:02:29.200> a

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
you'll generate a little more spin a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.100 
you'll generate a little more spin a
little<00:02:29.830> more<00:02:30.100> RPMs<00:02:30.940> on<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> ball<00:02:31.360> which<00:02:31.900> will

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
little more RPMs on the ball which will

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.050 
little more RPMs on the ball which will
cause<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.350> ball<00:02:32.710> to<00:02:32.920> come<00:02:33.070> down<00:02:33.370> sooner<00:02:33.880> and

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
cause the ball to come down sooner and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.270 
cause the ball to come down sooner and
that's<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.660> good<00:02:34.900> thing<00:02:34.960> on<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.590> topspin

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
that's a good thing on a topspin

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.220 
that's a good thing on a topspin
approach<00:02:36.610> shot<00:02:36.940> because<00:02:37.630> you're<00:02:37.810> hitting<00:02:38.020> the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
approach shot because you're hitting the

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.530 
approach shot because you're hitting the
ball<00:02:38.380> in<00:02:38.530> the<00:02:38.590> mid<00:02:38.830> court<00:02:39.130> area<00:02:39.520> so<00:02:40.030> it's<00:02:40.210> tough

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
ball in the mid court area so it's tough

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.110 
ball in the mid court area so it's tough
to<00:02:40.780> hit<00:02:40.930> it<00:02:41.080> hard<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.560> keep<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:42.220> in<00:02:42.400> so<00:02:42.970> it's

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
to hit it hard and keep it in so it's

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.510 
to hit it hard and keep it in so it's
good<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.570> think<00:02:43.600> spin<00:02:44.560> on<00:02:44.830> that<00:02:44.980> topspin

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
good to think spin on that topspin

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:53.809 
good to think spin on that topspin
approach<00:02:45.850> shot

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.879
