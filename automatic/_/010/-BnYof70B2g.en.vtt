00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
out and eat McDonald's like that but it

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.920 
out and eat McDonald's like that but it
just<00:02:52.920> goes<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.310> show<00:02:53.460> you<00:02:53.520> that<00:02:53.820> your<00:02:54.510> daily

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
just goes to show you that your daily

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.310 
just goes to show you that your daily
portion<00:02:55.440> size<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:56.430> probably<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.270> greatest

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
portion size is probably the greatest

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.650 
portion size is probably the greatest
contributor<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:59.040> obesity<00:02:59.430> in<00:02:59.730> my<00:02:59.880> opinion<00:03:00.240> and

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
contributor to obesity in my opinion and

contributor to obesity in my opinion and
something<00:03:01.050> that<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.380> see<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.190> Koreans<00:03:02.580> have<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
something that I see the Koreans have a

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.120 
something that I see the Koreans have a
firm<00:03:03.209> grasp<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.790> Korean<00:03:05.790> state<00:03:06.000> dinner<00:03:06.209> for
