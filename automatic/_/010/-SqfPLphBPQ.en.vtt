 get it finished here I use O 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.920
 I thought it was not right here and there 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.590
 it was right 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.290
 I'm just going to make the electrical connection now. 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:11.040
 it's already in the place it does not fit right 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.680
 and read who will do the installation 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:20.070
 This one is a little stick that goes 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:26.790
 embedded in the courtesy pick up here 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:29.820

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.460
 will fit right now you're giving 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:38.189
 To get it cool, I fit here. 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.950
 so in the gm 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:45.000
 every pomegranate movie is the land, okay, that's it 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.500

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.290
 volts ok so you call there on the 12th and 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.390
 Then you call the brown one here I go. 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.200
 to leave thus I did not cut or 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.000
 filter only did one did not get to cut the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.070
 wire to amend actually I did one to 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.430
 bridge it here I am putting this 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.530
 another ribbon here is a ribbon forgot the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.550
 It is insulation tape but it is 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.670
 fabric 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.610
 it is not normal insulation tape, right? 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.360
 what's up 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.010
 you link here in the negative because at 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.980
 Sometimes we get confused thinking that the 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.170
 black is the negative on gm not brown is the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.310
 negative here is the land 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.540
 beauty not only a touch for the galley was 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:34.610
 make a video here is the installation of 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.720
 jigsaw sun is already setting star 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.240
 installed dinho beauty is but who was 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.860
 install 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:46.100
 despite the size that if I also myself 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.110
 do not note had to take another that is 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.580
 this one is original 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:57.709
 O then his size right 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:01.550
 It's the same as the astral. 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.310
 same of the star but this finish 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.459
 here the fitting you put a screw 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:10.820
 is smaller then this one is the screw 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.870
 original right here is that the screw 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:17.060
 meriva is also philips and the 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.830
 His head is very big then when 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.880
 You try to put here 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:27.130
 you hurt, think if you hit me there 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.930
 I went to the auto parts in the key there and bought 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.410
 This unique steel bolt covers a 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.450
 only 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.560
 only to promote the diameter of it right 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.120
 this here 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.950
 All right, so is Philip and his head. 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.489
 come in right here 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.769
 in the finish but the thickness of it not 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:48.489
 Hold him right there too. 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:52.130
 the thickness of it did not learn that I did 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:56.630
 I went with both of you and bought this one. 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:00.220
 this one that you can see that screw 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:03.560
 here is what gives is what will work there 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.650
 however he is not philips he is head 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.780
 Normal to normal slit however I bought 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.420
 I'll tell you how I'm going to change the other too. 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.450
 on the other side I bought four then already 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:19.250
 It is placed a good fixing the trapped 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:24.440
 right beauty and there is already installed 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:27.680
 so here it is gets covered for just né 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.560
 it is here mirror roberto 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.610
 the meriva he has and if it fits here 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.620
 O right government in this meriva rafinha 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.160
 slider here 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.669
 this is a cover there when 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.110
 You open it and light up my face. 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:50.539
 Fat beauty, but it's already lit. 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.680
 placed right is giving to pick up 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:54.350
 cool huh 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:58.460
 then it is already illuminated when you 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:02.990
 closes here it automatically turns off 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.660
 you put it back on the spot is actually 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.060
 the cost benefit is not worth it because 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.060
 It's expensive here finishing here on the gem 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:15.139
 It is expensive and you think of mothers only that it is 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:17.690
 much sambado is all messed up burnt 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:20.570
 of the sun this here all yellow 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.160
 I went there I order it , look, it has 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.009
 here in Sao Paulo 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.650
 so look at a gm distributor 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:30.919
 and it was cool because there was a scheme 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.260
 that I took a side at a good price 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.510
 I'll put it in the video description 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.460
 so this side here is a bit more 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.169
 Cheap right side to slightly more expensive 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.909
 do not ask me why the difference 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:44.690
 I do not know how to respond 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.349
 it must be because the right side breaks 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.630
 but no 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:50.300
 in thesis is the most used then if 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.729
 more likely to have the demand 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.210
 bigger I believe 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:58.490
 I believe that this is the reason 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:02.539
 beauty but it's a really cool mustache for 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.580
 the car is not comfort is more comfort 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.500
 even if you do not use it 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.090
 and I find a more exquisite car I think 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.909
 which in my opinion was a car more 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.310
 exquisite beauty so I'll leave it at 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:15.380
 description of the video there ever 1 op 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.570
 I placed it on the right side of the 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.240
 left side of the driver who already had 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.360
 arrived and one on the right side will arrive 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.460
 this week and I can there I do not 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.659
 I'll make another video is not the same as 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:30.310
 same effect 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:30.310
 beauty worth
