probe<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.520> scoffer

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
probe the scoffer

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.480 
probe the scoffer
it's<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:41.980> lot<00:01:42.980> more<00:01:43.190> comfortable<00:01:44.090> it<00:01:44.600> doesn't

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
it's a lot more comfortable it doesn't

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.730 
it's a lot more comfortable it doesn't
know<00:01:46.490> it<00:01:46.930> holds<00:01:47.930> it<00:01:48.200> absorbs<00:01:48.770> right<00:01:49.070> but<00:01:49.400> it<00:01:50.740> it

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
know it holds it absorbs right but it it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.620 
know it holds it absorbs right but it it
gives<00:01:52.010> you<00:01:52.130> more<00:01:52.430> grip<00:01:52.730> it<00:01:52.940> like<00:01:52.970> it<00:01:53.240> doesn't

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
gives you more grip it like it doesn't

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.110 
gives you more grip it like it doesn't
it<00:01:53.780> doesn't<00:01:53.990> you<00:01:54.260> don't<00:01:54.470> slip

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.500 

it's<00:01:59.660> very<00:02:00.410> good<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:01.010> don't<00:02:01.910> think<00:02:02.060> it<00:02:02.210> costs

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
it's very good I don't think it costs

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:04.330 
it's very good I don't think it costs
that<00:02:02.630> much<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.990> add<00:02:03.080> it<00:02:03.229> on<00:02:03.350> either<00:02:03.680> so<00:02:03.979> it's

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
that much to add it on either so it's

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:10.660 
that much to add it on either so it's
it's<00:02:04.610> it's<00:02:04.910> worth<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.660> have<00:02:08.740> yeah<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:10.459> best

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
it's it's worth it to have yeah the best

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.920 
it's it's worth it to have yeah the best
grip<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.030> Wi-Fi<00:02:11.450> us<00:02:11.660> is<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.320> scoff<00:02:13.070> program

analog<00:04:13.510> sticks<00:04:13.750> because<00:04:14.410> I<00:04:14.800> prefer<00:04:15.400> them

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
analog sticks because I prefer them

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.759 
analog sticks because I prefer them
because<00:04:16.120> it's<00:04:16.359> easier<00:04:16.660> for<00:04:16.810> me<00:04:16.900> to<00:04:16.930> transition

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
because it's easier for me to transition

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:24.600 
because it's easier for me to transition
between<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:19.090> wall<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.329> the<00:04:20.100> 367<00:04:21.100> height<00:04:23.610> then

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
between the wall and the 367 height then

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.980 
between the wall and the 367 height then
it<00:04:24.730> cost<00:04:24.970> around<00:04:25.450> a<00:04:26.260> hundred<00:04:26.440> pound<00:04:27.990> by

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
it cost around a hundred pound by

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.420 
it cost around a hundred pound by
usually<00:04:29.740> ones<00:04:29.919> discount<00:04:30.280> code<00:04:30.490> both<00:04:31.120> yeah<00:04:32.430> so

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
usually ones discount code both yeah so

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.870
