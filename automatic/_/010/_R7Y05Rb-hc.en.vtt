 hello today we are here to demonstrate 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.110
 how to use the bias part in your 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.150
 sewing machine being simple 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.220
 domestic or industrial 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.720
 we will show here that all the 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.949
 sewing machines 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.640
 they come with a little hole here where they have 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.710
 a place to put the screw 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.750
 where do we go to use the piece and 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.570
 depending on the sewing machine of the 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.600
 The model you have is this little hole. 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.570
 he will be in different places 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.610
 so why the bias part comes 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.559
 with these two screws where 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.500

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:54.140
 You're going to open that screw, will you? 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:01:00.110
 drop it and then you can move it 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:01:02.210
 it according to the location where the 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.280

 it is necessary to use a 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:07.060
 pinch to help you 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.060

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.950
 fit into the fabric 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.200
 so it's time to sew it now let's go 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.680
 have to regulate our feet to see if 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.230
 is the right slim that we are 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:33.710
 We need to put the 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:36.920
 tissue inside bias down to the foot 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.860
 machine and needle to see if it is in the 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.580
 right place that agents want you to quit

 sensitivity the sensor is shirred 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.930
 elastic then remembering that this piece 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.090
 What are you looking at here is a screw 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.150
 where if you tighten it more 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.310
 furrowed will get bigger than tc 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.670
 elastic will grow more wrinkled if you 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.170
