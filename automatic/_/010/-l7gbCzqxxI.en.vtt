issues with the design I think first of
all<00:01:17.630> when<00:01:17.840> you<00:01:17.930> lay<00:01:18.049> it<00:01:18.140> down<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.409> you<00:01:18.500> tap<00:01:18.740> it

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
all when you lay it down and you tap it

battery and then put in the additional
storage<00:01:35.060> it<00:01:35.360> just<00:01:35.600> seems<00:01:35.780> like<00:01:35.840> kind<00:01:36.290> of

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
storage it just seems like kind of

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.719 
storage it just seems like kind of
sloppy<00:01:36.590> design<00:01:36.950> for<00:01:37.130> me<00:01:37.220> at<00:01:37.280> this<00:01:37.430> point<00:01:37.670> in

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
sloppy design for me at this point in

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.340 
sloppy design for me at this point in
the<00:01:37.790> game<00:01:37.820> sure<00:01:38.330> it<00:01:38.720> has<00:01:38.930> an<00:01:39.080> 8<00:01:39.320> megapixel

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
the game sure it has an 8 megapixel

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.649 
the game sure it has an 8 megapixel
camera<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.520> does<00:01:40.790> video<00:01:41.119> how<00:01:41.479> do<00:01:41.540> they

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
camera and does video how do they

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.810 
camera and does video how do they
compare<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.110> other<00:01:42.259> phone<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:43.340> pictures

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
compare to the other phone the pictures

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.670 
compare to the other phone the pictures
are<00:01:44.060> average<00:01:44.540> but<00:01:44.720> there's<00:01:44.869> no<00:01:45.049> automatic

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
are average but there's no automatic

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.530 
are average but there's no automatic
camera<00:01:46.040> flash<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:46.729> I<00:01:46.939> just<00:01:47.180> kind<00:01:47.330> of<00:01:47.360> want<00:01:47.509> to

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
camera flash so I just kind of want to

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.480 
camera flash so I just kind of want to
run<00:01:47.630> down<00:01:47.689> what<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.409> have<00:01:48.619> to<00:01:48.770> do<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:49.070> take<00:01:49.460> a
