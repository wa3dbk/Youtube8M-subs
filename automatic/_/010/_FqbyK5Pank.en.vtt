00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:21.859
 be careful there and cement 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.689
 Talk to people, they see the interest for you. 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.279
 a somewhat different video than 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.169
 If you like the idea, I can 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.880
 bring more videos in style 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.759
 in this video I want to talk about a weapon 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.380
 dlc weak and strong points and 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:41.210
 class tips for anyone who wants to 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:42.470
 test the gun then there 's riff 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.510
 old West 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.400
 this weapon was my first choice 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.560
 mainly due to the peculiarity of 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.900
 stun with two shots pressing me 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.240
 much the risk of the old west does not need 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.220
 be bought for pesos and as every weapon 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.860
 denis and it does not appear in the campaign 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.140
 of the game only in factions mode 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.670
 the weapon highlights are great and even 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.829
 being classified as a weapon of 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.840
 long distance works well on average and 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:07.790
 fairly short distance 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.680
 needing maybe some weapon to 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.260
 short range as in forster by 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.110
 example iff of the old west has a damage 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.120
 a very good shot in the body of 1 66% of 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.370
 life of the enemy and shot in the head took 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.500
 98% of the enemy's life 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.510
 even if you need two shots to 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.550
 all to the enemy the head shot damage is 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.890
 so loud that even partially 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.300
 injured and stunned with head shot 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.640
 so if you realize that your enemy 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:35.680
 He jumped from a high place and took the damage 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.680
 just a head shot for you to stun him 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.450
 this is a great recommendation to all 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.159
 world that likes to play with sni and 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.320
 also for those who want to play with 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.630
 the shotgun but they can not is a 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.030
 excellent entrance door besides being 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.640
 also an excellent weapon to maintain a 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.500
 very clear indentation without being updated 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.530
 this is practically imperceptible 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.049
 after the first and second update 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.180
 authorizations improve the cadence of 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.880
 I shoot the speed of loading the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.399
 clip size plus ammunition at birth 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.150
 occurrence and accuracy of the old riff 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.190
 west 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.440
 as well as semi automatic riff 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.020
 Old West needs 400 pieces with 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.819
 first upgrade and 800 pieces for the 2nd 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.350
 taking a little while to 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.600
 then it 's just joy 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.239
 neither of the breaks the owner of the weapon is 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.160
 changed it remains the same 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.410
 remembering that you need to take two 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.480
 times in the head and one in the body of your 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.880
 enemy in any case he is 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:58.190
 wearing vest because the first shot 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:03:00.290
 vest protects immediately classified as 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.390
 a long-range weapon by itself 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.549
 play it is highly recommended to use a 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.260
 class where you have to support yourself if 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.420
 enemy appears in front of you 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.489
 the riff of the old west can do the trick 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.709
 short-range combat but it is 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.840
 much better to prevent with a weapon of its own 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.070
 for this type of combat that are many 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.079
 in the game 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.670
 the basic strategy with this weapon is 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:21.650
 forcing your enemy to hurt himself 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.019
 any shape be a nail pump 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.940
 molotov of scratching or even falling from 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.459
 high places with this you have to 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.650
 advantage of a stun gun it is in the 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.660
 head or even depending on the damage 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:41.000
 that he was shot in the body already 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:54.980
 solve stealing there a result 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:56.600
 the short-range combat to 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.489
 stun with two shots 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.590
 the river of the old west is deadly if your 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.600
 wrong enemy the first shot in a 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.250
 combat medium distance you can 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.980
 suffer a little to teach the first 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.840
 upgrades but then the sight barely moves 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.690
 You have the advantage of aiming your head. 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.220
 of the enemy quickly and mortally 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.140
 kombat long distance id 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.790
 for this weapon since with silencer the 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.610
 enemies will not even know where 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.049
 came styles 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.970
 even the most bullets that there is a 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.530
 can not be too loud yet 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.090
 this will not be a problem since the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.790
 West is not a weapon. 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.890
 bought for finding bullets in boxes and 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.210
 the bodies of the enemies you stunned 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.280
 and killed him 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.410
 the best way to play with the riff of the 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.160
 old west is being stealthy since before 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.410
 grey saints 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.300
 there is enough time to recharge and 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:44.030
 also to take away and can give the 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.250
 for your enemy to kill then play 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.170
 with caution nothing to go out kamikaze for 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.090
 You want to have someone on your side because 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.250
 You have a chance to kill but your 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:54.860
 chances of dying are much higher 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:56.660
 my final considerations of the weapon 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.250
 Its great and I really enjoyed playing 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.110
 with the riff of the old west and 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.150
 possibly I will not take this one will 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.950
 of my classes for a good time 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.870
 she is highly recommended to anyone 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:07.850
 wants to improve his life and also to all 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.130
 that are in order to test a good weapon 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:12.310
 before the two upgrades it is already a good 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.900
 weapon and improve in many ways 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.510
 as you upgrade it being 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.150
 reasonable in good walking distance on average 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.919
 distance and insane in long distance the 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.200
 greatest negative point of the weapon is 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.120
 speed trigger that even in the 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.640
 third and there are many other great 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.320
 weapons much faster than she but still 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.940
 so playing with caution with 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.010
 sure it will work out 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.740
 I recommend these three classes that I 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.260
 I tried and I liked it but do not arrest 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.400
 they mounts suzy test any way you like 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.400
 the riff of the old west
