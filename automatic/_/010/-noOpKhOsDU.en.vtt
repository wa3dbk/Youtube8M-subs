00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
today I'm going to do a workout which is

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.800 
today I'm going to do a workout which is
one<00:01:31.390> kilometre<00:01:32.050> repeat<00:01:32.500> and<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.789> first<00:01:34.060> 600

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
one kilometre repeat and the first 600

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.219 
one kilometre repeat and the first 600
meters<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.740> first<00:01:35.950> lap<00:01:36.220> and<00:01:36.399> a<00:01:36.490> half<00:01:36.520> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
meters so the first lap and a half is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.550 
meters so the first lap and a half is
hard<00:01:38.229> paste<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:38.890> then<00:01:39.479> 200<00:01:40.479> meters<00:01:40.780> half<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.380> a

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
hard paste and then 200 meters half of a

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.330 
hard paste and then 200 meters half of a
lap<00:01:42.310> is<00:01:43.240> going<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:43.750> be<00:01:43.899> floating<00:01:44.709> which<00:01:45.100> is

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
lap is going to be floating which is

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.309 
lap is going to be floating which is
just<00:01:45.970> kind<00:01:46.270> of<00:01:46.500> maintaining<00:01:47.500> my<00:01:48.720> momentum<00:01:49.720> but

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:50.319 
just kind of maintaining my momentum but

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.699 
just kind of maintaining my momentum but
easing<00:01:50.920> off<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.130> bit<00:01:51.429> letting<00:01:51.700> my<00:01:52.000> my<00:01:52.630> heart<00:01:53.560> and

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
easing off a bit letting my my heart and

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:55.949 
easing off a bit letting my my heart and
lungs<00:01:53.950> kind<00:01:54.490> of<00:01:54.580> in<00:01:54.850> my<00:01:55.000> muscles<00:01:55.390> recover<00:01:55.750> a

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:55.959 
lungs kind of in my muscles recover a

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.440 
lungs kind of in my muscles recover a
bit<00:01:56.200> from<00:01:56.500> the<00:01:56.619> first<00:01:56.890> hard<00:01:57.220> 600<00:01:57.819> meters<00:01:58.149> and

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
bit from the first hard 600 meters and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.490 
bit from the first hard 600 meters and
then<00:01:59.289> the<00:01:59.440> last<00:01:59.619> 200<00:02:00.280> meters<00:02:00.580> half<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:01.090> lap

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
then the last 200 meters half a lap

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:09.180 
then the last 200 meters half a lap
the<00:02:02.590> full-on<00:02:03.490> all-out<00:02:04.860> sprint<00:02:08.100> absolutely<00:02:09.100> as

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
the full-on all-out sprint absolutely as

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.070 
the full-on all-out sprint absolutely as
hard<00:02:09.399> as<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.640> can<00:02:09.700> go<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.060> finish<00:02:10.570> off<00:02:10.780> one

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
hard as I can go to finish off one

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.880 
hard as I can go to finish off one
kilometer<00:02:11.710> and<00:02:11.920> then<00:02:12.720> another<00:02:13.720> 200<00:02:14.350> meters<00:02:14.620> of

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
kilometer and then another 200 meters of

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.120 
kilometer and then another 200 meters of
walking<00:02:15.870> recovery<00:02:16.870> back<00:02:17.470> to<00:02:17.710> the<00:02:17.800> start<00:02:18.070> line

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
walking recovery back to the start line

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.280 
walking recovery back to the start line
and<00:02:18.490> do<00:02:18.850> it<00:02:18.970> all<00:02:19.120> over<00:02:19.150> again<00:02:19.420> about<00:02:19.900> five

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
and do it all over again about five

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.740 
and do it all over again about five
times<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.760> reason<00:02:22.030> why<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.209> do<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.480> like

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
times and the reason why I do it like

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.920 
times and the reason why I do it like
this<00:02:22.959> is<00:02:23.260> because<00:02:24.090> it<00:02:25.090> really<00:02:25.330> trains<00:02:25.720> your

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
this is because it really trains your

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.699 
this is because it really trains your
body<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.860> run<00:02:27.070> really<00:02:27.490> hard<00:02:28.170> but<00:02:29.170> gives<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.590> a

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
body to run really hard but gives it a

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.060 
body to run really hard but gives it a
nice<00:02:29.860> little<00:02:29.920> break<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.760> in<00:02:31.750> between<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.890> one

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
nice little break of in between the one

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.660 
nice little break of in between the one
kilometer<00:02:33.550> effort<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.690> recover<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.670> finish

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
kilometer effort to recover and finish

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.210 
kilometer effort to recover and finish
strong<00:02:37.150> with<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.510> sprint<00:02:38.050> so<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.680> trains<00:02:39.070> your

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
strong with a sprint so it trains your

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.520 
strong with a sprint so it trains your
body<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.580> run<00:02:39.820> hard<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.420> then<00:02:41.020> be<00:02:41.260> able<00:02:41.380> to

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
body to run hard and then be able to

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.699 
body to run hard and then be able to
sprint<00:02:42.100> hard<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.600> hard<00:02:43.840> workout<00:02:44.260> all<00:02:44.560> at

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
sprint hard in a hard workout all at

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.210 
sprint hard in a hard workout all at
once<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.320> really<00:02:47.530> good<00:02:47.800> way<00:02:47.980> of

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
once so it's a really good way of

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.090 
once so it's a really good way of
training<00:02:48.760> your<00:02:49.030> sprint<00:02:49.390> training<00:02:49.870> your<00:02:50.290> your

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
training your sprint training your your
