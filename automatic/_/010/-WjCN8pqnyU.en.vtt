the middle position when you are in here
this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.510> not<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.690> tone<00:01:12.900> knob<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.650> a

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
this is not a tone knob this is a

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.710 
this is not a tone knob this is a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
selector switch it goes from a normal

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.290 
selector switch it goes from a normal
belly<00:01:16.409> configuration<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.370> this<00:01:17.520> creates<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:18.300 
belly configuration and this creates a

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.860 
belly configuration and this creates a
mid-range

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
mid-range

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.800

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.930 

okay<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:04.500> we'll<00:02:05.340> move<00:02:05.460> along<00:02:05.610> from<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
okay so we'll move along from the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.060 
okay so we'll move along from the
guitars<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.570> my<00:02:06.780> effects<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.860> there's<00:02:07.980> only

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
guitars to my effects and there's only

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.330 
guitars to my effects and there's only
one<00:02:08.400> the<00:02:08.820> while<00:02:09.060> back<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.740> was<00:02:10.740> approached<00:02:11.130> by

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
one the while back I was approached by

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.210 
one the while back I was approached by
zoom<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:12.630> some<00:02:12.870> programs<00:02:13.350> for<00:02:13.710> their<00:02:13.860> pedal

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
zoom to do some programs for their pedal

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.990 
zoom to do some programs for their pedal
the<00:02:14.340> g2r

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
the g2r

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.930 
the g2r
and<00:02:15.330> i<00:02:15.810> like<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.200> sound<00:02:16.440> of<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.740> pedal<00:02:16.940> it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
and i like the sound of the pedal it

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.060 
and i like the sound of the pedal it
didn't<00:02:18.510> get<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.990> way<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.200> what<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.680> wanted

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
didn't get in the way of what I wanted

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.280 
didn't get in the way of what I wanted
out<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.250> my<00:02:20.430> amp<00:02:20.640> and<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.690> brought<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.140> with

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
out of my amp and so I brought it with

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.140 
out of my amp and so I brought it with
me<00:02:22.440> live<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.310> run<00:02:23.520> it<00:02:23.610> through<00:02:23.640> my<00:02:23.880> effects

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
me live and I run it through my effects

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.390 
me live and I run it through my effects
loop<00:02:24.390> primarily<00:02:25.350> what<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.590> use<00:02:25.830> it<00:02:25.980> for<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.220> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
loop primarily what I use it for is a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.310 
loop primarily what I use it for is a
reverb<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.300> a<00:02:27.900> delay<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.470> I<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.610> program<00:02:30.320> d9

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
reverb and a delay so I have program d9

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.560 
reverb and a delay so I have program d9
it's<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.740> delay<00:02:32.010> setting<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:33.060> reason<00:02:33.360> I<00:02:33.420> have

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
it's a delay setting the reason I have

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.030 
it's a delay setting the reason I have
it<00:02:33.600> on<00:02:33.720> top<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.170> amp<00:02:34.320> is<00:02:34.470> because<00:02:34.710> I<00:02:34.830> use

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
it on top of the amp is because I use

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.770 
it on top of the amp is because I use
the<00:02:35.220> tap<00:02:35.430> button<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.940> set<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.180> tempo<00:02:36.630> of<00:02:36.720> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
the tap button to set the tempo of the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.800 
the tap button to set the tempo of the
delay<00:02:37.080> for<00:02:37.860> my<00:02:37.980> songs<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.550> then<00:02:39.270> what<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.540> don't

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
delay for my songs and then what I don't

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.600 
delay for my songs and then what I don't
want<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.050> lay<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.440> got<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.890> reverb<00:02:41.220> setting

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
want to lay I got the reverb setting

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.830 
want to lay I got the reverb setting
right<00:02:41.760> under<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.390> could<00:02:42.540> go<00:02:42.630> back<00:02:42.810> and

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
right under it so I could go back and

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.740 
right under it so I could go back and
forth<00:02:43.170> delay<00:02:43.740> reverb<00:02:44.250> I<00:02:44.850> want<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.210> bypass<00:02:45.600> that

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
forth delay reverb I want to bypass that

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.050 
forth delay reverb I want to bypass that
I<00:02:45.810> press<00:02:46.050> both<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.470> same<00:02:46.710> time<00:02:46.980> it's<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.850> real

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
I press both the same time it's a real

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.540 
I press both the same time it's a real
clean<00:02:48.360> device<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.590> for<00:02:49.770> me<00:02:49.920> somebody<00:02:50.400> that

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
clean device and for me somebody that

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.520 
clean device and for me somebody that
wanted<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.880> have<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> little<00:02:51.390> delay<00:02:51.510> and<00:02:52.440> a

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
wanted to have a little delay and a

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.470 
wanted to have a little delay and a
little<00:02:52.770> reverb<00:02:53.100> from<00:02:53.340> time<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.670> time<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:54.300> works

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
little reverb from time to time it works

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.120 
little reverb from time to time it works
out<00:02:54.720> really<00:02:54.900> well<00:02:55.230> so<00:02:55.440> that's<00:02:55.650> kind<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:55.950> what<00:02:56.070> I

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
out really well so that's kind of what I

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.949 
out really well so that's kind of what I
use<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.430> for<00:02:56.640> it's<00:02:57.120> capable<00:02:57.300> of<00:02:57.570> a<00:02:57.690> lot<00:02:57.720> more

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
use it for it's capable of a lot more

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.030 
use it for it's capable of a lot more
but<00:02:58.800> that's<00:02:58.950> my<00:02:59.280> application<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:01.620> app<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.950> I

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
but that's my application the app that I

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.920 
but that's my application the app that I
use<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:02.520> made<00:03:02.730> by<00:03:02.850> a<00:03:02.880> company<00:03:02.970> called<00:03:03.270> Cornford

well unfortunately here I don't have
that<00:03:10.440> with<00:03:10.590> me<00:03:10.650> I'm<00:03:11.040> claiming<00:03:11.400> one<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.790> their

that with me I'm claiming one of their
standard<00:03:12.959> amps<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:13.440> it's<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.709> first<00:03:13.890> stamp

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.190 
standard amps and it's the first stamp
that<00:03:14.280> they<00:03:14.400> actually<00:03:14.550> gave<00:03:15.420> me<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:15.840> hooked
