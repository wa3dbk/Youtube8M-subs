00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.349 
but it's very it's very nice for spring
because<00:00:17.340> you<00:00:17.460> don't<00:00:17.640> want<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.850> kick<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.150> too

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.060 
much makeup especially if it's very hot
outside<00:00:20.670> here<00:00:21.570> it's<00:00:21.779> not<00:00:21.930> hot<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.859> will

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
outside here it's not hot but it will

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.490 
outside here it's not hot but it will

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
get hot eventually so it's just a very

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.460 
get hot eventually so it's just a very
glowing<00:00:26.330> foundation<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.570> not<00:00:27.750> dewy<00:00:28.019> as<00:00:28.320> you

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470

think this one would suit many different
skin<00:00:36.420> types<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:36.930> um<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:38.100> not<00:00:38.250> dewy<00:00:38.520> its

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
but it's just because I I got a pink

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.240 
but it's just because I I got a pink
tone<00:00:53.340> foundation<00:00:53.550> but<00:00:54.480> my<00:00:54.660> neck<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.559> yellow<00:00:55.920> so

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
shade pink and it just blends again I'm

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.880 
shade pink and it just blends again I'm
using<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.420> word<00:02:00.659> way<00:02:01.140> too<00:02:01.200> much<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
using this word way too much but it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.160 
using this word way too much but it
blends<00:02:02.250> flawlessly<00:02:02.450> because<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.750> very

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
blends flawlessly because it's very

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.469 
blends flawlessly because it's very
creamy<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:05.009> not<00:02:05.250> thick<00:02:05.579> but<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.030> not<00:02:06.240> too

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
creamy it's not thick but it's not too

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.320 
creamy it's not thick but it's not too
thin<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.429> basically<00:02:08.429> when<00:02:08.580> you<00:02:08.700> blend<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.179> it

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
thin it basically when you blend it it

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.940 
thin it basically when you blend it it
looks<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.750> skin<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.379> because<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
looks like skin so because the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.270 
looks like skin so because the
foundation<00:02:11.250> is<00:02:11.640> very<00:02:11.879> natural<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:12.720> then

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
foundation is very natural and then

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.910 
foundation is very natural and then
is<00:02:13.640> very<00:02:13.819> natural<00:02:13.940> -<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:15.200> find<00:02:15.560> that<00:02:15.650> cream

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
is very natural - I find that cream

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.490 
is very natural - I find that cream
blush<00:02:16.270> first<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.450> all<00:02:17.569> is<00:02:17.720> very<00:02:17.810> natural<00:02:18.380> and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
blush first of all is very natural and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.890 
blush first of all is very natural and
this<00:02:18.709> one<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.160> just<00:02:19.970> looks<00:02:20.360> like<00:02:20.450> your<00:02:20.690> skin

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
this one it just looks like your skin

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.330 
this one it just looks like your skin
when<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.110> blend<00:02:21.410> it<00:02:21.530> if<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.770> blend<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.160> well

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
when you blend it if you blend it well

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.360 
when you blend it if you blend it well
I'm<00:02:22.550> using<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.290> f40<00:02:24.290> brush<00:02:24.530> from<00:02:24.800> Sigma

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
it helps do the job very well but um

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.699
