00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
that kind of speed are you

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.660 
that kind of speed are you
you<00:01:29.619> just<00:01:29.829> contract<00:01:30.189> on<00:01:30.280> getting<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.579> the

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
you just contract on getting to the

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
over the years we've been speed key we

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.599 
over the years we've been speed key we
get<00:01:34.329> used<00:01:34.539> to<00:01:34.630> a<00:01:34.960> certain<00:01:35.350> speed<00:01:35.619> and<00:01:35.890> up<00:01:36.399> to

get used to a certain speed and up to

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:39.090 
get used to a certain speed and up to
let's<00:01:36.969> say<00:01:37.060> 230<00:01:37.780> kilometres<00:01:38.350> it<00:01:38.560> on<00:01:38.770> it

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
let's say 230 kilometres it on it

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.249 
let's say 230 kilometres it on it
doesn't<00:01:39.429> bother<00:01:39.549> us<00:01:39.700> once<00:01:40.689> you<00:01:40.869> start<00:01:41.140> going

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
doesn't bother us once you start going

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.499 
doesn't bother us once you start going
over<00:01:41.439> 230<00:01:41.950> 240<00:01:42.369> Daniel<00:01:43.060> you're<00:01:43.359> in<00:01:43.450> a

over 230 240 Daniel you're in a

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.450 
over 230 240 Daniel you're in a
different<00:01:43.689> world<00:01:43.869> here<00:01:44.109> gravity<00:01:44.950> is<00:01:45.009> taking<00:01:45.249> a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
different world here gravity is taking a

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.039 
different world here gravity is taking a
bit<00:01:45.609> of<00:01:45.640> control<00:01:45.909> over<00:01:46.210> you<00:01:46.329> yeah<00:01:46.659> you<00:01:46.929> know

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
bit of control over you yeah you know

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.539 
bit of control over you yeah you know
before<00:01:47.380> you've<00:01:47.590> got<00:01:47.799> control<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.130> gravity's

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
before you've got control of gravity's

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:50.940 
before you've got control of gravity's
there<00:01:48.909> no<00:01:49.179> it's<00:01:49.899> the<00:01:50.049> rush<00:01:50.259> I<00:01:50.469> mean<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:50.829> know

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
there no it's the rush I mean you know

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.440 
there no it's the rush I mean you know
we<00:01:51.189> wouldn't<00:01:51.399> be<00:01:51.490> doing<00:01:51.640> if<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:51.969> wasn't<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.299> bit

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
we wouldn't be doing if it wasn't a bit

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.230 
we wouldn't be doing if it wasn't a bit
of<00:01:52.569> rustle<00:01:53.560> or<00:01:54.130> drilling<00:01:54.549> involving<00:01:55.119> it

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
of rustle or drilling involving it

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.459 
of rustle or drilling involving it
because<00:01:55.509> you<00:01:55.600> know<00:01:55.780> what's<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.140> point

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
because you know what's the point

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.950 
because you know what's the point
looking<00:01:57.310> good<00:01:57.460> mark<00:01:57.759> I<00:01:57.969> think<00:01:58.299> it's<00:01:58.539> over<00:01:58.689> but
