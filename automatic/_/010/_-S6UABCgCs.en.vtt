00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
for next-gen of course it was routed out

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.830 
for next-gen of course it was routed out
to<00:00:55.800> previous<00:00:56.190> gen<00:00:56.430> systems<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:57.719> know

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
to previous gen systems with you know

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.630 
to previous gen systems with you know
different<00:00:58.050> color<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.680> different<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:59.520> know

different color and different you know
obvious<00:01:00.090> textures<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.690> everything<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.590> if

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
obvious textures and everything but if

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.060 
obvious textures and everything but if
this<00:01:02.579> next<00:01:02.940> Call<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.270> Duty<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.870> mainly<00:01:04.739> for

this next Call of Duty is mainly for

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.859 
this next Call of Duty is mainly for
next-gen<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.909> they<00:01:06.030> don't<00:01:06.210> even<00:01:06.299> make<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
next-gen like if they don't even make a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.280 
next-gen like if they don't even make a
current<00:01:07.229> gen<00:01:07.470> version<00:01:08.450> there's<00:01:09.450> no<00:01:09.630> reason<00:01:10.140> to

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
current gen version there's no reason to

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.380 
current gen version there's no reason to
make<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> theater<00:01:11.010> mode<00:01:11.130> because<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.880> next-gen

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
make a theater mode because the next-gen

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.289 
make a theater mode because the next-gen
systems<00:01:12.900> have<00:01:13.439> recording<00:01:14.340> softwares<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.030> ps4

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
systems have recording softwares the ps4

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.749 
systems have recording softwares the ps4
has<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:16.200> recording<00:01:16.710> software<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.340> record

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
has a recording software you can record

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.770 
has a recording software you can record
in<00:01:18.119> 720p<00:01:18.780> so<00:01:19.560> there's<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.400> no<00:01:20.729> reason<00:01:21.119> for

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
in 720p so there's really no reason for

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.420 
in 720p so there's really no reason for
a<00:01:22.049> theater<00:01:22.320> mode<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.770> next<00:01:22.950> call<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.130> duty

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
a theater mode in the next call of duty

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.100 
a theater mode in the next call of duty
now<00:01:23.610> I've<00:01:24.030> been<00:01:24.240> getting<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.570> lot<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.720> tweets

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110

shown on von der Herr's Twitter but like

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.179 
shown on von der Herr's Twitter but like
I<00:01:33.060> said<00:01:33.119> there's<00:01:33.450> no<00:01:33.570> reason<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.770> theater

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
I said there's no reason for theater

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.039 
I said there's no reason for theater
mode<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.490> come<00:01:35.790> into<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> next<00:01:36.570> game<00:01:36.780> whether

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
mode to come into the next game whether

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.200 
mode to come into the next game whether
it<00:01:37.200> be<00:01:37.259> black<00:01:37.500> ops<00:01:37.710> 3<00:01:37.979> call<00:01:38.549> of<00:01:38.579> duty<00:01:38.880> world<00:01:39.000> at

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it be black ops 3 call of duty world at

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.480 
it be black ops 3 call of duty world at
two<00:01:39.479> or<00:01:39.780> whatever<00:01:40.170> there's<00:01:40.770> really<00:01:40.950> no<00:01:41.220> reason

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
two or whatever there's really no reason

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.480 
two or whatever there's really no reason
because<00:01:41.939> next<00:01:42.240> gen<00:01:42.600> has<00:01:43.280> recording<00:01:44.280> software

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
because next gen has recording software

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.330 
because next gen has recording software
is<00:01:44.850> built<00:01:45.210> into<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.750> systems<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.409> it's

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
is built into the systems and it's

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.210 
is built into the systems and it's
pretty<00:01:48.270> obvious<00:01:48.750> from<00:01:48.930> this<00:01:49.049> point<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.619> that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
pretty obvious from this point on that

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.310 
pretty obvious from this point on that
they're<00:01:50.490> gonna<00:01:50.579> focus<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.360> next<00:01:51.750> gen<00:01:51.899> consoles

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
they're gonna focus on next gen consoles

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.170 
they're gonna focus on next gen consoles
more<00:01:52.500> than<00:01:52.649> current<00:01:52.920> gen<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.250> there<00:01:53.520> isn't<00:01:53.850> if

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
more than current gen if there isn't if

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.749 
more than current gen if there isn't if
there<00:01:54.540> is<00:01:54.720> even<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.500> current<00:01:56.250> gen<00:01:56.490> version

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
there is even a current gen version

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
there is even a current gen version
sorry<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.390> like<00:01:57.540> stuttered<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> staring
