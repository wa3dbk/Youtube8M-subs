00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
still has some of the glass in it from

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.639 
still has some of the glass in it from
our<00:01:32.560> another<00:01:33.310> melt<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:33.850> we<00:01:33.970> did<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:34.869> so<00:01:35.530> what

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
our another melt that we did and so what

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.200 
our another melt that we did and so what

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
I'm just gonna slowly burn around the

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.800 
I'm just gonna slowly burn around the
outer<00:03:06.370> edges<00:03:06.640> I<00:03:06.850> don't<00:03:07.030> want<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.330> crank<00:03:07.690> the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
outer edges I don't want to crank the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.810 
outer edges I don't want to crank the
flame<00:03:08.080> up<00:03:08.290> on<00:03:08.470> this<00:03:08.620> thing<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.130> I<00:03:09.459> know<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.610> lot

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
flame up on this thing and I know a lot

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.250 
flame up on this thing and I know a lot
of<00:03:09.850> guys<00:03:10.000> use<00:03:10.239> acetylene<00:03:10.570> but<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.019> got<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.200> be

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
of guys use acetylene but you got to be

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.570 
of guys use acetylene but you got to be
careful<00:03:11.650> because<00:03:11.709> if<00:03:11.920> you<00:03:11.980> exceed<00:03:12.430> the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
careful because if you exceed the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.740 
careful because if you exceed the
temperature<00:03:13.030> too<00:03:13.209> much<00:03:13.360> you'll<00:03:13.540> actually

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
temperature too much you'll actually

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.660 
temperature too much you'll actually
vaporize<00:03:14.470> that<00:03:14.650> gold<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.220> don't<00:03:15.400> want<00:03:15.580> to

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
vaporize that gold you don't want to

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.640 
vaporize that gold you don't want to
lose<00:03:15.790> your<00:03:15.970> gold<00:03:16.209> up<00:03:16.330> into<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.600> air<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.049> what

lose your gold up into the air so what
I'm<00:03:17.769> gonna<00:03:17.890> do<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.130> I'm<00:03:18.220> going<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.400> slowly<00:03:18.670> heat

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
I'm gonna do is I'm going to slowly heat

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.759 
I'm gonna do is I'm going to slowly heat
it<00:03:19.090> up<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.630> you'll<00:03:20.140> start<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.500> see<00:03:20.530> the

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
it up and you'll start to see the

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.280 
it up and you'll start to see the
bubbles<00:03:21.070> forming<00:03:21.430> up<00:03:21.580> out<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.940> there<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.390> then

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
bubbles forming up out of there and then
