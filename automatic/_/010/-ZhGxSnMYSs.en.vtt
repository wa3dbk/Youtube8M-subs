Robert

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.640 

with<00:01:58.120> those<00:01:58.330> tires<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.930> gives<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.440> higher

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
with those tires it gives it to higher

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.500 
with those tires it gives it to higher
gear<00:02:00.040> ratio<00:02:00.400> so<00:02:00.610> it's<00:02:00.730> like<00:02:00.850> taking<00:02:01.210> off<00:02:01.330> in
