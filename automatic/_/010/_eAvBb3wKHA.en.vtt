muscle building course what I got from
it<00:00:12.210> what<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:12.630> learned<00:00:12.960> some<00:00:13.259> insights<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.040> how

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
it what I learned some insights and how

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.760 
it what I learned some insights and how
you<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.360> take<00:00:15.480> advantage<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.170> also<00:00:16.529> if

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
you can take advantage of it also if

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.769 
you can take advantage of it also if
you're<00:00:16.890> interested<00:00:17.369> basically<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.300> sum<00:00:18.330> it<00:00:18.570> up

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
you're interested basically to sum it up

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.260 
you're interested basically to sum it up
maybe<00:00:19.350> it's<00:00:19.560> catch<00:00:19.740> easy<00:00:20.070> but<00:00:20.430> basically<00:00:21.000> it's

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
maybe it's catch easy but basically it's

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.109 
maybe it's catch easy but basically it's
a<00:00:21.420> two<00:00:21.779> word<00:00:22.080> phrase<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.160> that's<00:00:23.609> real

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
a two word phrase and that's real

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.150 
a two word phrase and that's real
results<00:00:24.930> one<00:00:25.439> thing<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.830> liked<00:00:26.070> about

Anthony's<00:00:26.970> course<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.660> that<00:00:28.019> he<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.160> always

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
Anthony's course was that he was always

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.160 
Anthony's course was that he was always
about<00:00:29.789> not<00:00:30.330> necessarily<00:00:30.779> what<00:00:30.869> everyone<00:00:31.109> else

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
about not necessarily what everyone else

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.479 
about not necessarily what everyone else
was<00:00:31.349> doing<00:00:31.439> he<00:00:31.830> went<00:00:32.009> against<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.460> grain

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
was doing he went against the grain

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.790 
was doing he went against the grain
sometimes<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.540> really<00:00:33.960> focused<00:00:34.350> on<00:00:34.469> results

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
sometimes and really focused on results

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.459 
sometimes and really focused on results
I<00:00:35.309> could<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.420> tell<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.690> he<00:00:37.140> went<00:00:37.320> out<00:00:37.410> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
I could just tell that he went out and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.190 
I could just tell that he went out and
he<00:00:37.879> experienced<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.030> he<00:00:39.210> told<00:00:39.420> his<00:00:39.660> story<00:00:39.930> he

mistakes like not doing legs legs

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.140 
mistakes like not doing legs legs
actually<00:02:43.170> helped<00:02:43.710> build<00:02:44.550> some<00:02:44.820> muscle

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
actually helped build some muscle

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.720 
actually helped build some muscle
throughout<00:02:45.420> your<00:02:45.480> entire<00:02:45.540> body<00:02:46.550> certain<00:02:47.550> ways

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
time so you have that pump that way I

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.800 
time so you have that pump that way I

girls would always have bigger arms than

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.640 
girls would always have bigger arms than
me<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.790> mean<00:03:00.120> they<00:03:00.240> weren't<00:03:00.390> fat<00:03:00.690> girls<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.350> mean

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
don't get me wrong I mean maybe a few of

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.000 
don't get me wrong I mean maybe a few of
them<00:03:03.570> were<00:03:03.720> but<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.170> know<00:03:04.470> these<00:03:04.680> were<00:03:04.830> like

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
them were but you know these were like

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.530 
them were but you know these were like
somewhat<00:03:05.550> skinny<00:03:05.790> girls<00:03:06.120> they<00:03:06.300> would<00:03:06.420> just

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
somewhat skinny girls they would just

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.610 
somewhat skinny girls they would just
have<00:03:06.630> bigger<00:03:06.840> arms<00:03:07.200> than<00:03:07.260> me<00:03:07.410> just<00:03:07.530> because

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
have bigger arms than me just because

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.860 
have bigger arms than me just because
they<00:03:07.800> had<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.950> little<00:03:08.070> more<00:03:08.250> fat<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:08.670> guess<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.150> I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
they had a little more fat I guess and I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.630 
they had a little more fat I guess and I
was<00:03:10.260> always<00:03:10.440> kind<00:03:10.710> of<00:03:10.770> like<00:03:10.950> embarrassed<00:03:11.460> by

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
was always kind of like embarrassed by

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.300 
was always kind of like embarrassed by
it<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:12.390> Anthony<00:03:12.930> took<00:03:13.440> my<00:03:13.590> confidence<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.280> a

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
it so Anthony took my confidence to a

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.400 
it so Anthony took my confidence to a
new<00:03:14.520> level<00:03:14.730> new<00:03:15.600> confidence<00:03:16.020> level<00:03:16.260> not<00:03:16.380> just

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
new level new confidence level not just

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.620 
new level new confidence level not just
with<00:03:16.740> girls<00:03:17.100> but<00:03:17.340> also<00:03:17.640> work<00:03:18.000> feeling<00:03:18.390> good

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
with girls but also work feeling good

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.060 
with girls but also work feeling good
you<00:03:18.750> know<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:18.900> could<00:03:19.050> talk<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.260> my<00:03:19.500> boss<00:03:19.709> better

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
you know I could talk to my boss better

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.010 
you know I could talk to my boss better
I<00:03:20.340> could<00:03:20.850> you<00:03:20.940> know<00:03:21.000> interact<00:03:21.510> with<00:03:21.690> people

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
I could you know interact with people

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.570 
I could you know interact with people
and<00:03:22.170> I<00:03:22.200> had<00:03:22.320> more<00:03:22.470> energy<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.980> I'd<00:03:23.100> feel<00:03:23.340> good

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
and I had more energy and I'd feel good

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.760 
and I had more energy and I'd feel good
so<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.150> really<00:03:24.270> a<00:03:24.420> synergistic<00:03:25.170> effect<00:03:25.590> of
