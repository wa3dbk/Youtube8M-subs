okay so let me just show you how easy it
is<00:03:23.829> to<00:03:24.129> double<00:03:24.579> side<00:03:24.939> photo<00:03:25.299> so<00:03:25.780> here<00:03:25.989> is<00:03:26.199> one

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
is to double side photo so here is one

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.920 
is to double side photo so here is one
of<00:03:26.620> our<00:03:26.709> samples<00:03:27.310> it's<00:03:27.939> double-sided<00:03:28.269> now

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
of our samples it's double-sided now

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.119 
of our samples it's double-sided now
ordinarily<00:03:30.090> you'd<00:03:31.090> have<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.359> put<00:03:31.540> put<00:03:31.959> the

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
ordinarily you'd have to put put the

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.890 
ordinarily you'd have to put put the
document<00:03:33.129> into<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.729> ADF<00:03:34.090> you<00:03:34.299> may<00:03:34.540> have<00:03:34.780> to

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
document into the ADF you may have to

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.679 
document into the ADF you may have to
turn<00:03:35.109> it<00:03:35.319> round<00:03:35.470> or<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:36.549> device<00:03:36.939> itself<00:03:37.329> might

00:03:37.679 --> 00:03:37.689 
turn it round or the device itself might

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.509 
turn it round or the device itself might
turn<00:03:38.019> it<00:03:38.229> around<00:03:38.349> but<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:38.769> usually<00:03:39.009> takes

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
turn it around but it usually takes

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.580 
turn it around but it usually takes
quite<00:03:39.879> a<00:03:39.939> long<00:03:40.209> time<00:03:40.419> to<00:03:40.750> do<00:03:40.989> that<00:03:41.019> but<00:03:41.349> not

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
quite a long time to do that but not

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.080 
quite a long time to do that but not
with<00:03:41.739> this<00:03:41.889> machine<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:42.549> I'm<00:03:42.729> going<00:03:42.909> to<00:03:42.970> select

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:08.119 
machine once and that's done that's
scanned<00:04:06.459> both<00:04:06.849> sides<00:04:07.209> of<00:04:07.449> the<00:04:07.509> page

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129 
scanned both sides of the page

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.230 
scanned both sides of the page
simultaneously

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
simultaneously

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.690 
simultaneously
and<00:04:11.240> now<00:04:11.420> it's<00:04:11.600> a<00:04:11.660> new<00:04:11.810> print<00:04:12.200> both<00:04:12.560> sides<00:04:15.700> and

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
and now it's a new print both sides and

and now it's a new print both sides and
there<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.239> go<00:04:17.359> there's<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.720> copy<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.500> the

folders<00:04:29.030> things<00:04:29.419> like<00:04:29.570> that<00:04:29.720> then<00:04:30.110> definitely

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
folders things like that then definitely

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.350 
folders things like that then definitely
get<00:04:31.070> one<00:04:31.220> of<00:04:31.310> these<00:04:31.430> machines<00:04:31.880> it<00:04:32.180> will

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
get one of these machines it will

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.650 
get one of these machines it will
actually<00:04:32.540> scan<00:04:32.960> in<00:04:33.200> color<00:04:33.230> as<00:04:33.710> well<00:04:34.450> but<00:04:35.450> don't

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
actually scan in color as well but don't

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.570 
actually scan in color as well but don't
forget<00:04:35.870> it<00:04:35.960> is<00:04:36.050> only<00:04:36.230> a<00:04:36.350> mono<00:04:36.770> printer<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:37.520> it

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
forget it is only a mono printer so it

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.730 
forget it is only a mono printer so it
will<00:04:37.730> only<00:04:37.880> copy<00:04:38.240> in<00:04:38.600> black<00:04:38.870> and<00:04:39.050> white<00:04:39.200> okay

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
will only copy in black and white okay

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.650 
will only copy in black and white okay

okay so first thing to be aware of is

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.800 
okay so first thing to be aware of is
this<00:04:57.860> is<00:04:57.919> a<00:04:58.040> 50<00:04:58.490> sheet<00:04:58.730> automatic<00:04:59.390> document

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810
