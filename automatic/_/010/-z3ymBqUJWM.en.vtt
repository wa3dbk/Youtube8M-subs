I've<00:02:15.600> actually<00:02:15.870> went<00:02:16.530> ahead<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.980> put<00:02:17.069> a

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
I've actually went ahead and put a

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.490 
I've actually went ahead and put a
thermometer<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.790> just<00:02:18.120> shortly<00:02:18.690> after<00:02:19.170> I

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
thermometer in it just shortly after I

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.250 
thermometer in it just shortly after I
put<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.459> turkey<00:02:20.970> on<00:02:21.120> because<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.750> want<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.049> make

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
put the turkey on because I want to make

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.440 
put the turkey on because I want to make
sure<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:22.890> know<00:02:22.950> what<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.970> temperature

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
sure that I know what the temperature

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.320 
sure that I know what the temperature
inside<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:25.200> breast<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.970> we're<00:02:26.970> looking<00:02:27.209> at

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
inside that breast is we're looking at

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.449 
inside that breast is we're looking at
about<00:02:27.420> 132<00:02:28.290> degrees<00:02:28.410> right<00:02:28.890> now<00:02:29.069> so<00:02:29.280> that's

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
about 132 degrees right now so that's

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.240 
about 132 degrees right now so that's
real<00:02:29.910> good<00:02:30.230> that's<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:31.530> about<00:02:31.739> perfect<00:02:34.250> so

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
real good that's just about perfect so

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.070 
real good that's just about perfect so
anyway<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:35.970> did<00:02:36.299> want<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.569> say<00:02:36.750> if<00:02:36.959> you're

anyway I did want to say if you're
having<00:02:37.319> trouble<00:02:37.709> with<00:02:37.799> this<00:02:37.890> Brinkman<00:02:38.340> if

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
having trouble with this Brinkman if

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.240 
having trouble with this Brinkman if
you're<00:02:38.970> having<00:02:39.180> trouble<00:02:39.720> getting<00:02:40.200> it<00:02:40.769> up<00:02:41.010> to

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
you're having trouble getting it up to

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.979 
you're having trouble getting it up to
the<00:02:41.370> temperature<00:02:41.640> you<00:02:42.329> might<00:02:42.600> want<00:02:42.900> to

the temperature you might want to

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.310 
the temperature you might want to
consider<00:02:43.910> just<00:02:44.910> barely<00:02:45.390> putting<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.989> little

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
consider just barely putting a little

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.259 
consider just barely putting a little
bit<00:02:46.470> of<00:02:46.560> water<00:02:46.769> in<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.160> water<00:02:47.310> pan<00:02:47.670> some

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
bit of water in the water pan some

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.420 
bit of water in the water pan some
people<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:48.540> feel<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.780> water<00:02:49.140> pan<00:02:49.410> out<00:02:49.590> what

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
people just feel that water pan out what

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.130 
people just feel that water pan out what
happens<00:02:50.820> when<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.030> do<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.299> is<00:02:51.480> it<00:02:51.510> blocks<00:02:51.930> a

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
happens when you do that is it blocks a

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140 
happens when you do that is it blocks a
lot<00:02:52.320> of<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.590> heat<00:02:52.799> a<00:02:53.070> lot<00:02:53.579> of<00:02:53.640> those<00:02:53.760> meat<00:02:54.000> to

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
lot of that heat a lot of those meat to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.270 
lot of that heat a lot of those meat to
use<00:02:54.299> are<00:02:54.510> going<00:02:54.750> for<00:02:55.019> heating<00:02:55.859> that<00:02:56.010> water

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
use are going for heating that water

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.660 
use are going for heating that water
instead<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.769> actually<00:02:58.769> becoming<00:02:58.859> heat<00:02:59.340> that

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
instead of actually becoming heat that

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.729 
instead of actually becoming heat that
surrounds<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.630> turkey<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.109> cooks<00:03:01.530> this

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
surrounds the turkey and cooks this

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.550 
surrounds the turkey and cooks this
muscle<00:03:02.100> turkey<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.989> what<00:03:03.989> I've<00:03:04.140> actually<00:03:04.350> done

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
muscle turkey so what I've actually done

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.460 
muscle turkey so what I've actually done
I've<00:03:04.980> got<00:03:05.250> probably<00:03:05.930> probably<00:03:06.930> a<00:03:06.959> half<00:03:07.230> inch

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
I've got probably probably a half inch

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.400 
I've got probably probably a half inch
of<00:03:07.620> water<00:03:07.920> in<00:03:08.160> my<00:03:08.340> water<00:03:08.790> pan<00:03:09.420> right<00:03:09.690> now<00:03:09.750> and

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
of water in my water pan right now and

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.500 
of water in my water pan right now and
if<00:03:13.410> earlier<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.370> had<00:03:14.609> actually<00:03:14.940> more<00:03:15.150> than<00:03:15.299> that

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
if earlier I had actually more than that

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.300 
if earlier I had actually more than that
the<00:03:15.690> temperature<00:03:16.019> started<00:03:16.320> dropping<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.220> I've

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
the temperature started dropping so I've

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.710 
the temperature started dropping so I've
let<00:03:17.519> it<00:03:17.609> cook<00:03:17.820> down<00:03:18.000> a<00:03:18.060> little<00:03:18.299> bit<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.660> I

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
let it cook down a little bit and I

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.020 
let it cook down a little bit and I
haven't<00:03:19.019> added<00:03:19.230> any<00:03:19.500> more

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
haven't added any more

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.240 
haven't added any more
so<00:03:21.030> these<00:03:21.959> Brinkmann<00:03:22.500> water<00:03:22.739> smokers<00:03:23.130> are

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
so these Brinkmann water smokers are

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.250 
so these Brinkmann water smokers are
good<00:03:23.459> smokers<00:03:23.910> but<00:03:24.120> they<00:03:24.390> favor<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.989> bar<00:03:25.230> a

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
good smokers but they favor the bar a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.949 
good smokers but they favor the bar a
lot<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.620> bit<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:26.150> peddling<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.569> get<00:03:27.720> you<00:03:27.810> know<00:03:27.930> to

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
lot a bit of peddling to get you know to

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.710 
lot a bit of peddling to get you know to
get<00:03:28.230> them<00:03:28.319> not<00:03:28.560> to<00:03:28.680> do<00:03:28.799> what<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.040> wanted<00:03:29.250> to<00:03:29.340> do

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
get them not to do what you wanted to do

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.540 
get them not to do what you wanted to do
there<00:03:31.260> are<00:03:31.350> other<00:03:31.530> smokers<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.190> are<00:03:32.340> that

there are other smokers that are that

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.460 
there are other smokers that are that
are<00:03:32.610> much<00:03:32.820> better<00:03:33.060> but<00:03:33.420> for<00:03:33.870> someone<00:03:34.050> starting

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
are much better but for someone starting

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.620 
are much better but for someone starting

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
can you can use these they're cheap

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.820 
can you can use these they're cheap
smokers<00:03:39.780> but<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.080> can<00:03:40.290> use<00:03:40.500> them<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.770> can

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
smokers but you can use them you can

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.640 
smokers but you can use them you can
produce<00:03:41.310> some<00:03:41.610> good<00:03:41.760> food<00:03:41.970> on<00:03:42.180> them<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.650> today
