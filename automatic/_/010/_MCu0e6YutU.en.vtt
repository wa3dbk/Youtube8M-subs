 which won the hearts of many in that 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.779
 among schoolchildren some of which 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.460
 began to shoot their videos on youtube so 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.080
 most causing burning farts and 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.090
 the righteous wrath of an ordinary viewer 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.730
 who wants to watch something 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.590

 enemies for we are the wrath of the emperor 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:56.019
 drove this video called tv series 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:06.880
 but in the first seconds I would call 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:09.340
 his test of sound recording from the ass why 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.960
 I generally continue to show it to you yes 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.390
 for you to feel the same 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:18.280
 more than that, I especially liked it 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.890
 this moment it is perfect 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.569
 any of the films in the genre 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.819
 shaking hands but you know there 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:29.180
 paranormal and so on who 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:35.870
 you 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:38.480
 how was he still for some reason decided 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:48.770
 add your own voice acting while running 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:50.810
 character and surprisingly near the end 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.970
 it even becomes audible for a while 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.830
 true but that's enough for it 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:10.970
 to appreciate the great acting 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:13.100
 the game in the end I came to the conclusion that he 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.110
 plays the role of a person suffering from 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:23.739
 asthma and strong paranoid 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:26.030
 schizophrenia and woodpecker 1 series of this masterpiece 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.950
 ends with the fact that he falls asleep in 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.989
 some kind of son hangar and 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.370
 this sudden happens without any 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:37.010
 explanations but as they say if there is 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.410
 the first series then there are 2 in which 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.690
 he still has a fart microphone but 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:49.220
 third series all have much better and 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:51.170

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.780
 Great for shitty 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.360
 screenwriter but there is no script at all and 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.100
 I also noticed that the main character clearly 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:04.130
 big problems with using 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:06.440

 the stranger thing is that it is hell 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.980
 to her inserted music from 3 battlefield in 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:19.959
 moments where it seemed to him that behind him 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.959
 someone is chasing the score lie down 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.150
 but when he found a revolver emotion 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:38.180
 just flowed over the edge then is it really yours

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:58.320
 happily and happily end 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.900

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.900

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.300
