00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.730
 let be 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.050
 I why 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.500
 you know, and I'm still the same naive child with 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.800
 eyes of the color of the sky and all believe in miracles 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.140
 I believe you know the truth is not every word 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.870
 requires someone to explain something in return 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.690
 I have changed my fault this half a year and 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.460
 something pounding differently inside well 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.980
 here again on the internet I look at yours 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.350
 photo and arbitrarily hands write these 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.220
 poems when you cry i hardly see 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.770
 native 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.750
 not because i don't want to see i turn away 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.940
 you know we don't let in like 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.220
 origami just sometimes hide the whole 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.770
 the detector of your senses stand once 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.960
 end our story you forget me 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.810
 rarely become remember but my heart 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.119
 forever in your palms and my life I 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:34.950
 I can not imagine without you connect 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:40.220
 our sorrow let go of the loops our people do not 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.220
 may remain the soul of emptiness 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.670
 I will be next to it all on the verge 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.979
 fiction in the ranks of mine with a spit alarm clock 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.100
 not yet rang I see so clearly see 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.410
 eyes and smile a little and dangerous clean 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.360
 sincerely good just for me gray 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.700
 the colors of the sky will cease to frown on 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.410
 wire simple truths are you yours 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.899
 cool breeze 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.600
 smoked kosyachok guys twisted slats 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.100
 a little if no no no do not specify yet though 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.590
 half an hour not more 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.110
 let it soak in perfume 2nd house wallpaper 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.270
 you know my world now and your world and under 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.090
 there will be enough strength i will continue with you 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.340
 target if angels from heaven cry in rain 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.410
 know vod to k as there is a particle of ours 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.780
 cycle and just relax nice and 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.830
 choke yes all that was earlier let 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.610
 you burn with fire to the ground no stronger than mine 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.580
 palm 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.110
 Our sorrows are released and I am ready to endure 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.760
 this pain 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:42.830
 you leg our people if you do not have the strength 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.830
 and perhaps soul emptiness 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.710
 is always 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.240
 all those pages from maybe soul 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:06.570
 emptiness 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.110
 unlikely I will take i will be with you next 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.480
 is always 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.760
 why do you think such lines 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:15.850
 may i be we were still there something 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.310
 there is no script sensual and emotion 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.440
 the truth of my life is dear to the scaffold 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.720
 whose public smile was watching me in 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.910
 eyes i think happy you laughed 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.910
 chose to outside our joint 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.920
 photos you want me to spit though 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:34.270
 No, it is unlikely that everything seemed to me 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:36.760
 or i'm sleeping but if this is a dream you deliver 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.830
 you say I 'm sorry drank was not 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.040
 maybe so early the first and foremost 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.170
 no love i confess or i'm a loser 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.290
 Rather, the second now I play in the box 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:51.180
 damn it epithets beautiful freedom 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.180
 lost love and afraid forever 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:06.280
 for neck and semester 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.280
 may soul emptiness 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.470
 special 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:14.710
 simply 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:18.459
 strengthen my palm and further sorrow 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:23.680
 let go and I'm ready to endure this pain 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:27.760
 leg of our people if no strength 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:32.760
 perhaps in the soul emptiness went and 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.760
 sadness i will stay near forever
