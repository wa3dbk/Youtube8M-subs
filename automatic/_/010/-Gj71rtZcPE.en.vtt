00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.700
 Hello, this is the second episode with Easter eggs from Batman. 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.700
 Knight Arkham. 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.620
 The game, if you did not have time to buy it from the very beginning, 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.180
 still not available in the incentive ever since Rocksteady 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.280
 decided to finish the game to a more acceptable state. 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.040
 That, in general, well, it is a pity that you can not 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.280
 play it yourself. 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.280
 I really liked the game. 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.240
 In this issue will be all that I missed or left 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.240
 for later. 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.000
 And although I had already played as much as 20 hours, I passed 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.020
 only about 30%. 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.390
 True, half of this time I took the search 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.610
 and recording easter eggs. 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.170
 Remember the monster Solomon Grandi? 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.899
 In Arkham City, he was one of the bosses. 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.540
 Grandi got his name in honor of the children’s counting 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.399
 he is a zombie supervillain who at first was an adversary 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.550
 only the Golden Lantern, but later it was added 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.139
 also Superman with Batman. 

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:47.079
 As I recall, in Arkham City, you kill him completely. 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.899
 But, nevertheless, there is a mention of Solomon in this game. 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.159
 Such a tattered poster on one of the walls of the city. 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.129
 It also has the name Burt Weston. 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.209
 There is such a supervillain in the DC universe. 

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:59.920
 But some believe that this is a reference to the 60s show, 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.170
 whose actor Robin was named Burt Ward, and the actor Batman 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.170
 Adam West. 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.400
 But this is not all interesting things related to Grandi. 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.940
 There is still a very strange and creepy room with 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.440
 memorial to this monster. 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.710
 It is not clear only whose hands this thing. 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.660
 John Henry Irons (not to be confused with John Henry who 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.780
 mythological hero of the United States) - ballistics expert 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.040
 and ingenious weapon maker who worked for Amertek 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.030
 Industries - a military-industrial firm - until 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.930
 one of his guns did not fall into the wrong hands and did not cause 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.210
 death of the innocent. 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.860
 After different plot twists, he eventually becomes a superhero 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.860
 - Steel. 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.060
 In general, the office building of his former employers 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.610
 can be found in Gotham. 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.440
 In one of the tasks of the Riddler you can find something interesting. 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.930
 I do not know how much this can be considered Easter eggs, but all 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.930
 same 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.750
 Climbing on the Wayne Enterprise building in the distance can 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.000
 see cities from past parts of Arkham. 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.690
 Here and Arkham City and Arkham Healing. 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.920
 And aside you can see part of the city that was in Arkham. 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.920
 Origins 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.920
 Recall Bane. 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.880
 In Arkham Healing He is one of the bosses with whom to 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.070
 will fight 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.159
 He uses a suit that enhances his strength. 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.310
 And in Arkham City, Bane gives Batman an extra mission. 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.210
 to destroy canisters with Titan. 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.069
 In this game, there is no Bane himself. 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.790
 But there are cool easter eggs in his honor. 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.209
 A bit of his background. 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.349
 As a child, Bane was in prison in Santa Priska, serving his sentence 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.349
 for your father. 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.920
 In this conclusion, he had only one friend - a teddy 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.920
 bear. 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.599
 He can be found in the evidence section of the police station. 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.599
 Gotham 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.090
 And two more bears can be found playing chess 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.349
 near the railway and also in the stands at the boxing 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.409
 the ring next to another Easter egg, about which later. 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.879
 But the coolest is in the warehouse of containers. 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.609
 There, in one of the containers labeled Santa Priska 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.650
 there is a wooden box with the letters DC (interestingly), 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.680
 You can open it using the hook. 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.879
 Inside will be a real Bane costume. 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.219
 Thomas Eliot - also known by the name of Hash - supervillain 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.430
 and the enemy of batman. 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.200
 But at first, Thomas and Bruce were childhood friends. 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.769
 Thomas even taught Bruce to think like opponents 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.999
 that will be very much in place when the second will be 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:01.999
 superhero 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:04.580
 Without going into the character's long story - Eliot, 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.389
 After studying at Harvard, he became a successful surgeon. 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.549
 Billboard with his clinic can be found on the streets of Gotham. 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.250
 Booster Gold or Golden Accelerator - born in Gotham City in 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.250
 25th century. 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.629
 A hero who used his knowledge of the future 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.019
 and the technology of the future to create your image. 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.680
 Later, he still becomes a real superhero. 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.760
 A small poster with him can be found on the showcase. 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.719
 store comics blaze. 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.819
 Surely everyone knows the character of the publisher. 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.620
 Vertigo - John of Constantine. 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.129
 If not in comics, then exactly either in the film or 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:36.919
 on the new series, the future of which is never understood. 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:40.739
 Occultist and sorcerer, an exorcist with a baggage of mystical knowledge. 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.650
 With all this, he is also a detective. 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.280
 It is his name that can be found on the doors of detective 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.430
 agencies in Gotham. 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.859
 There is a possible reference to the Blue Beetle. 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.989
 Not Dan Garrett, but his former student - Ted Kord - to whom 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.950
 first committed to being the Blue Beetle, right 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.170
 without a magical scarab. 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.469
 The city has a car shop called Kord. 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.099
 But I am not sure about this sending, I could not find any information. 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.859
 that Ted ever owned one. 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.250
 But Easter eggs, next to which are plush 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.489
 Bane's bears, which I talked about earlier. 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.519
 On an island with a huge statue there is a boxing ring with 

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.310
 posters of the canceled Albert King and Ted bout 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:17.310
 Grant. 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.310
 The second is interesting to us. 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.390
 An ordinary person who once got nine 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.540
 lives became a wildcat. 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.850
 He coached several superheroes, among which 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.090
 Batman, Black Canary and even Superman. 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.550
 Earl Cooper is a mechanical engineer once saved by Batman. 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.220
 Earl was not happy with the company in which he worked. 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.040
 They did not listen to his safety warnings. 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.560
 One day the manager broke down and hired a thug 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.850
 beat Cooper, but Batman saved him. 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.510
 Feeling gratitude to the hero, he came to him 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.000
 and received an order to create a Batmobile. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.670
 Ted auto-shop can be found in the city. 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.920
 There were two supervillains named King of watches. 

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.560
 Only the second had abilities, but we are interested in 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.170
 the first is the enemy of Batman, Robin, and Green Arrow, William 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:59.200
 Tokman. 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.450
 The game has “Tokman Watch Shop” which says 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:02.450
 for myself. 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.250
 In the original Batman, Bruce Wayne uses a switch, 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.730
 which is hidden inside the bust of Shakespeare to open 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:10.250
 hidden entrance to the cave. 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.120
 Here in the chapel there is a great reference to this. 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.700
 In the chapel, to activate computers Oracle Bruce 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.440
 uses exactly the same bust. 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.000
 The truth is now there is not a simple button, but the whole system. 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.880
 recognition.
