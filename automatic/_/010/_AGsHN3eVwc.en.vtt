into<00:00:17.220> small<00:00:17.789> intestine<00:00:18.240> where<00:00:18.359> this<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.570> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
into small intestine where this is the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:28.279 
into small intestine where this is the
file<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:25.099> no<00:00:26.099> need<00:00:26.310> rope<00:00:26.750> and<00:00:27.750> here's<00:00:28.080> night

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
file and no need rope and here's night

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.130 
file and no need rope and here's night
and<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:29.580> your<00:00:29.670> small<00:00:29.910> intestine<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.599> mixes

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
and to your small intestine and mixes

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.889 
and to your small intestine and mixes
with<00:00:31.289> file<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.329> there<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.690> small

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
with file and there in the small

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.479 
with file and there in the small
intestine<00:00:34.320> it's<00:00:34.469> processed<00:00:34.860> further<00:00:35.160> and

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
intestine it's processed further and

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.799 
intestine it's processed further and
then<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.760> absorbed<00:00:36.300> into<00:00:36.480> your<00:00:36.600> bloodstream

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
then it's absorbed into your bloodstream

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.950 
then it's absorbed into your bloodstream
now<00:00:37.800> all<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.640> stuff<00:00:38.879> goes<00:00:39.120> into<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.600> portal

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
now all the stuff goes into the portal

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.600 
now all the stuff goes into the portal
vein<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.379> then<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> portal<00:00:41.129> vein<00:00:41.160> goes

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
vein and then the portal vein goes

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.209 
vein and then the portal vein goes
straight<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.120> your<00:00:42.180> liver<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:43.100> what<00:00:44.100> your

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219

straight to your liver and what your
liver<00:00:44.399> does<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.570> takes<00:00:45.930> all<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.739> new

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
liver does is it takes all of this new

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
as as quickly as possible now the liver

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.479 
as as quickly as possible now the liver
has<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> few<00:01:03.120> different<00:01:03.210> tools<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.080> and

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
has a few different tools to do this and

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.920 
has a few different tools to do this and
you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.090> as<00:01:07.280> flagging<00:01:08.930> after

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
you can think of it as flagging after

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.780 
you can think of it as flagging after
there's<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.229> fly<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.710> liver<00:01:10.890> says<00:01:11.130> okay<00:01:11.549> if

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
there's a fly the liver says okay if

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.880 
there's a fly the liver says okay if
this<00:01:12.000> is<00:01:12.210> water-soluble<00:01:12.689> I'm<00:01:13.200> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.650> put

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
this is water-soluble I'm going to put

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.800 
this is water-soluble I'm going to put
it<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> bloodstream<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.570> going<00:01:15.750> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
it in the bloodstream and it's going to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.180 
it in the bloodstream and it's going to
get<00:01:16.049> excreted<00:01:16.439> by<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.710> kidneys

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
get excreted by the kidneys

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.060 
get excreted by the kidneys
it's<00:01:18.400> a<00:01:18.580> fat-soluble<00:01:19.390> then<00:01:20.260> it's<00:01:20.650> going<00:01:20.950> to

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
it's a fat-soluble then it's going to

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.610 
it's a fat-soluble then it's going to
get<00:01:21.640> mixed<00:01:21.880> into<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:22.390> file<00:01:22.600> go<00:01:23.050> back<00:01:23.350> and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:23.620 
get mixed into the file go back and

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.340 
get mixed into the file go back and
again<00:01:23.980> I<00:01:24.460> and<00:01:25.450> since<00:01:25.720> it's<00:01:25.870> got<00:01:26.020> this<00:01:26.170> pretty

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
again I and since it's got this pretty

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.470 
again I and since it's got this pretty
little<00:01:26.560> flag<00:01:26.920> on<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.160> the<00:01:27.790> intestines<00:01:28.270> know

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
little flag on it the intestines know

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.380 
little flag on it the intestines know
not<00:01:28.870> to<00:01:29.110> reabsorb<00:01:29.410> it<00:01:29.770> and<00:01:29.980> exact<00:01:30.400> treated<00:01:31.210> I

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.400 
normally you would have a collection of
flags<00:02:06.340> for<00:02:06.729> any<00:02:06.880> one<00:02:07.180> of<00:02:07.479> these<00:02:09.990> or<00:02:10.990> any<00:02:11.050> one<00:02:11.350> of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
flags for any one of these or any one of

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.070 
flags for any one of these or any one of
these<00:02:11.620> pathways<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:13.090> what<00:02:13.360> can<00:02:13.480> happen<00:02:13.690> and

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
these pathways but what can happen and

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.410 
these pathways but what can happen and
what<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.860> happening<00:02:15.280> with<00:02:15.460> allergies<00:02:16.210> and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
what is happening with allergies and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.380 
what is happening with allergies and
autism<00:02:16.840> in<00:02:16.960> who<00:02:17.110> knows<00:02:17.260> what<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.790> you<00:02:19.150> run

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
autism in who knows what is that you run

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.820 
autism in who knows what is that you run
out<00:02:19.570> of<00:02:19.600> some<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.990> these<00:02:20.050> flags<00:02:20.380> you<00:02:20.680> don't

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
out of some of these flags you don't

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.010 
out of some of these flags you don't
have<00:02:20.980> enough<00:02:21.220> to<00:02:21.370> go<00:02:21.520> around<00:02:21.660> and<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:22.870> this

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
have enough to go around and so this

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.250 
have enough to go around and so this
toxin<00:02:23.590> that<00:02:24.100> was<00:02:24.220> supposed<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.850> be<00:02:25.260> flagged

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
toxin that was supposed to be flagged

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.410 
toxin that was supposed to be flagged
and<00:02:26.560> excreted<00:02:27.160> instead<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.940> floating<00:02:28.300> around

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
and excreted instead is floating around

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.810 
and excreted instead is floating around
your<00:02:28.690> bloodstream<00:02:28.959> and<00:02:29.520> nothing<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.640> saying

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
your bloodstream and nothing is saying

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.880 
your bloodstream and nothing is saying
that<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.120> shouldn't<00:02:31.390> be<00:02:31.480> there<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.900> so<00:02:32.500> it<00:02:32.709> can

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
that it shouldn't be there and so it can

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.470 
that it shouldn't be there and so it can
cause<00:02:33.100> all<00:02:33.370> sorts<00:02:33.430> of<00:02:33.730> problems<00:02:33.940> and<00:02:34.360> that's

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
cause all sorts of problems and that's

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.820 
cause all sorts of problems and that's
where<00:02:34.660> you<00:02:34.720> get<00:02:34.840> reactions<00:02:35.380> that's<00:02:35.620> where<00:02:35.739> you

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
where you get reactions that's where you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:42.510 
where you get reactions that's where you
get<00:02:35.980> things<00:02:36.220> like<00:02:36.430> eczema<00:02:37.090> or<00:02:40.440> autism<00:02:41.440> or<00:02:41.830> any

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
get things like eczema or autism or any

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.330 
get things like eczema or autism or any
of<00:02:42.580> your<00:02:42.670> issues<00:02:42.790> or<00:02:43.150> anything<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.600> when<00:02:43.750> these

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
of your issues or anything is when these

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.650 
of your issues or anything is when these
little<00:02:45.340> boxes<00:02:45.489> that<00:02:45.910> are<00:02:45.940> not<00:02:46.120> flying<00:02:46.330> are

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
little boxes that are not flying are

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:55.520 
little boxes that are not flying are
getting<00:02:47.590> in<00:02:47.680> places<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.010> they<00:02:48.190> should

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.770 

and<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.430> now<00:02:56.850> let's<00:02:57.060> talk<00:02:57.180> about<00:02:57.240> these<00:02:57.540> six

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
and so now let's talk about these six

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.559 
and so now let's talk about these six
different<00:02:58.110> pathways<00:02:58.940> I'm<00:02:59.940> sort<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.240> are<00:03:00.390> here

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
different pathways I'm sort of are here

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.050 
different pathways I'm sort of are here
there's<00:03:00.840> amino<00:03:01.200> acid<00:03:01.590> conjugation<00:03:02.430> where<00:03:02.850> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
there's amino acid conjugation where the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.890 
there's amino acid conjugation where the
flag<00:03:03.270> is<00:03:03.540> literally<00:03:04.170> just<00:03:04.440> an<00:03:04.680> amino<00:03:05.190> acid<00:03:05.550> and

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
flag is literally just an amino acid and

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.850 
flag is literally just an amino acid and
glycine<00:03:06.900> is<00:03:07.020> the<00:03:07.170> favourite<00:03:07.500> one<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:07.770> it

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
glycine is the favourite one that it

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.680 
glycine is the favourite one that it
likes<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.190> use<00:03:08.340> but<00:03:08.819> it<00:03:09.030> doesn't<00:03:09.330> always<00:03:09.450> get

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
likes to use but it doesn't always get

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.360 
likes to use but it doesn't always get
to<00:03:09.810> use<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.080> on<00:03:10.200> sometimes<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.740> uses<00:03:11.040> other<00:03:11.160> one

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
to use it on sometimes it uses other one

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.120 
to use it on sometimes it uses other one
but<00:03:12.300> that<00:03:12.450> one's<00:03:12.569> pretty<00:03:12.690> basic<00:03:12.930> then<00:03:13.920> there's

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
but that one's pretty basic then there's

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:22.940 
but that one's pretty basic then there's
acetyl<00:03:14.700> coenzyme<00:03:14.940> a<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.680> that<00:03:16.680> flag<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:21.950> what

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
acetyl coenzyme a and that flag is what

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.150 
acetyl coenzyme a and that flag is what
you<00:03:23.100> need<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.400> order<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.640> make<00:03:23.850> those<00:03:24.060> flags<00:03:24.360> is

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
you need in order to make those flags is

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.100 
you need in order to make those flags is
coenzyme<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.670> pantothenic<00:03:27.510> acid<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:28.080> a

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
coenzyme a and pantothenic acid is a

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.050 
coenzyme a and pantothenic acid is a
precursor<00:03:28.500> to<00:03:28.680> vitamin<00:03:29.070> b5<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.640> a<00:03:29.670> precursor

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
precursor to vitamin b5 is a precursor

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.560 
precursor to vitamin b5 is a precursor
to<00:03:30.269> coenzyme<00:03:30.660> a<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.230> you<00:03:32.160> need<00:03:32.340> Simon<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.030> you

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
to coenzyme a and you need Simon and you

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.440 
to coenzyme a and you need Simon and you
need<00:03:33.810> vitamin<00:03:34.530> C<00:03:34.739> and<00:03:34.920> as<00:03:35.730> long<00:03:36.090> as<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:36.300> have

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
need vitamin C and as long as you have

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.479 
need vitamin C and as long as you have
all<00:03:36.600> those<00:03:36.780> you<00:03:37.110> can<00:03:37.290> make<00:03:37.470> these<00:03:38.190> slides

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
all those you can make these slides

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.130 
all those you can make these slides
right<00:03:38.760> here<00:03:39.000> and<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.330> you<00:03:39.420> can<00:03:39.570> use<00:03:39.720> those<00:03:39.900> to

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
right here and so you can use those to

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.949 
right here and so you can use those to
detoxify<00:03:40.739> things<00:03:41.120> there's<00:03:42.120> glue<00:03:42.630> current

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
detoxify things there's glue current

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.160 
detoxify things there's glue current
assets<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.760> that<00:03:44.760> slide<00:03:45.090> is<00:03:45.390> pretty<00:03:45.780> easy<00:03:45.989> to

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
assets and that slide is pretty easy to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.530 
assets and that slide is pretty easy to
make<00:03:46.319> it's<00:03:46.530> made<00:03:46.680> out<00:03:46.800> of<00:03:46.830> glucose<00:03:47.280> and<00:03:47.540> your

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
make it's made out of glucose and your

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.150 
make it's made out of glucose and your
body<00:03:48.660> can<00:03:48.930> make<00:03:49.080> glucose<00:03:49.500> even<00:03:49.890> if<00:03:49.980> you're<00:03:50.069> not

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
body can make glucose even if you're not

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.070 
body can make glucose even if you're not
eating<00:03:50.459> glucose<00:03:51.000> that<00:03:51.209> can<00:03:51.330> turn<00:03:51.480> protein<00:03:51.900> or

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
eating glucose that can turn protein or

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.400 
eating glucose that can turn protein or
fat<00:03:52.110> into<00:03:52.530> glucose<00:03:53.510> so<00:03:54.510> those<00:03:54.720> flags<00:03:55.019> seem<00:03:55.290> to

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
fat into glucose so those flags seem to

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.050 
fat into glucose so those flags seem to
be<00:03:55.500> around<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.860> abundant<00:03:56.220> but<00:03:56.550> that<00:03:56.700> line<00:03:56.880> is

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
be around and abundant but that line is

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.229 
be around and abundant but that line is
special<00:03:57.680> okay<00:03:58.680> the<00:03:59.340> problem<00:03:59.700> will<00:03:59.940> encourage

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
special okay the problem will encourage

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.300 
special okay the problem will encourage
acid<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:00.930> when

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
acid is when

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.870 
acid is when
these<00:04:03.239> enzymes<00:04:03.950> come<00:04:04.950> and<00:04:05.250> take<00:04:05.489> your<00:04:05.640> black

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
these enzymes come and take your black

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.880 
these enzymes come and take your black
box<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.480> then<00:04:06.750> you've<00:04:06.870> got<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:07.110> tossing<00:04:07.560> to

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
box and then you've got the tossing to

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.690 
box and then you've got the tossing to
suddenly<00:04:09.709> in<00:04:10.709> your<00:04:10.860> small<00:04:11.099> intestine<00:04:11.489> gets

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
suddenly in your small intestine gets

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.790 
suddenly in your small intestine gets
reabsorbed<00:04:11.970> and<00:04:12.450> now<00:04:12.660> it<00:04:13.230> has<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.380> put<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.680> new

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
reabsorbed and now it has to put a new

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.490 
reabsorbed and now it has to put a new
flag<00:04:13.980> on<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.190> all<00:04:14.430> over<00:04:14.700> again<00:04:15.139> and<00:04:16.139> they'll<00:04:16.470> go

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
flag on it all over again and they'll go

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.069 
flag on it all over again and they'll go
get<00:04:17.190> dumped<00:04:18.150> in<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.269> bile<00:04:18.510> into<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.900> small

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
get dumped in the bile into the small

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.319 
get dumped in the bile into the small
time<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.590> then<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:19.799> bacteria<00:04:20.310> come<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:20.850> take

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
time and then a bacteria come and take

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.730 
time and then a bacteria come and take
the<00:04:21.450> flag<00:04:21.630> box<00:04:21.900> when<00:04:22.079> you<00:04:22.169> can<00:04:22.320> see<00:04:22.470> this<00:04:22.530> is

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
the flag box when you can see this is

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.320 
the flag box when you can see this is
going<00:04:22.889> to<00:04:22.980> be<00:04:23.070> an<00:04:23.160> endlessly<00:04:23.490> repeating<00:04:24.000> cycle

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
going to be an endlessly repeating cycle

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.180 
going to be an endlessly repeating cycle
and<00:04:24.630> you're<00:04:25.169> gonna<00:04:25.260> have<00:04:25.410> all<00:04:25.590> these<00:04:25.710> toxins

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
and you're gonna have all these toxins

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.980 
and you're gonna have all these toxins
floating<00:04:26.850> around<00:04:26.910> your<00:04:27.180> body<00:04:27.270> that<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.750> don't

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
floating around your body that you don't

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.360 
floating around your body that you don't
really<00:04:28.110> want<00:04:28.350> and<00:04:28.680> so<00:04:28.919> this<00:04:29.040> is<00:04:29.220> where

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
really want and so this is where

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.100 
really want and so this is where
probiotics<00:04:30.000> are<00:04:30.090> really<00:04:30.330> helpful<00:04:30.600> you<00:04:30.960> get

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
probiotics are really helpful you get

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.390 
probiotics are really helpful you get
rid<00:04:31.200> of<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:31.470> bad<00:04:31.620> bacteria<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:32.340> are

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
rid of the bad bacteria that are

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.960 
rid of the bad bacteria that are
following<00:04:32.669> the<00:04:32.790> foil<00:04:32.940> off<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:34.850> replace<00:04:35.850> them

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
following the foil off and replace them

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.790 
following the foil off and replace them
with<00:04:36.030> good<00:04:36.270> bacteria<00:04:36.479> that<00:04:37.080> don't<00:04:37.410> make<00:04:37.590> that

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
with good bacteria that don't make that

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.640 
with good bacteria that don't make that
enzyme<00:04:38.250> there's<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.180> shortcut<00:04:39.510> you<00:04:39.870> can<00:04:40.080> get<00:04:40.440> a

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
enzyme there's a shortcut you can get a

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.530 
enzyme there's a shortcut you can get a
supplement<00:04:41.340> that's<00:04:41.850> also<00:04:42.150> naturally

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
supplement that's also naturally

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.930 
supplement that's also naturally
occurring<00:04:42.870> in<00:04:42.960> something<00:04:43.320> called<00:04:44.010> calcium<00:04:44.400> d

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
occurring in something called calcium d

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.460 
occurring in something called calcium d
glue<00:04:45.210> crates<00:04:45.510> and<00:04:45.720> what<00:04:46.260> that<00:04:46.440> does<00:04:46.620> is<00:04:46.889> it

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
glue crates and what that does is it

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.659 
glue crates and what that does is it
even<00:04:49.470> if<00:04:49.590> there's<00:04:49.770> bacteria<00:04:49.979> that<00:04:50.430> are<00:04:50.490> making

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
even if there's bacteria that are making

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.969 
even if there's bacteria that are making
the<00:04:50.880> enzyme<00:04:51.210> that<00:04:51.360> pull<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.660> apart<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:52.680> keeps

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
the enzyme that pull it apart it keeps

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.879 
the enzyme that pull it apart it keeps
the<00:04:53.130> enzyme<00:04:53.820> busy<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.540> that<00:04:54.720> this<00:04:55.200> flag<00:04:55.380> stays

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
the enzyme busy so that this flag stays

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.070 
the enzyme busy so that this flag stays
on<00:04:56.070> your<00:04:56.100> toxins<00:04:56.639> and<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.419> toxin<00:04:57.810> has<00:04:57.840> been

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
on your toxins and the toxin has been

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.620 
on your toxins and the toxin has been
excreted<00:04:59.660> now

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
excreted now

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.070 
excreted now
next<00:05:02.440> we've<00:05:02.710> got<00:05:02.740> these<00:05:03.640> three<00:05:04.020> these<00:05:05.020> three

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.080 
next we've got these three these three

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.690 
next we've got these three these three
other<00:05:05.530> ones<00:05:05.680> that<00:05:05.770> were<00:05:05.920> most<00:05:05.980> interested<00:05:06.370> in

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
other ones that were most interested in

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.020 
other ones that were most interested in
right<00:05:06.910> now<00:05:07.170> there's<00:05:08.170> methyl<00:05:08.590> group<00:05:08.740> which<00:05:09.700> is

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
right now there's methyl group which is

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.220 
right now there's methyl group which is
literally<00:05:10.570> a<00:05:11.010> carbon<00:05:12.010> and<00:05:12.220> three<00:05:12.490> hydrogen

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
literally a carbon and three hydrogen

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.500 
literally a carbon and three hydrogen
except<00:05:14.230> for<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.470> methyl<00:05:14.710> group<00:05:14.860> is<00:05:14.980> and<00:05:15.510> that

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:16.510 
except for the methyl group is and that

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.120 
except for the methyl group is and that
makes<00:05:16.960> up<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.230> flag<00:05:17.440> and<00:05:18.870> then<00:05:19.870> there's

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
makes up the flag and then there's

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.920 
makes up the flag and then there's
glutathione<00:05:21.130> which<00:05:21.370> is<00:05:21.970> three<00:05:22.570> different

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
glutathione which is three different

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.670 
glutathione which is three different
amino<00:05:23.080> acids<00:05:23.530> hooked<00:05:23.920> together<00:05:24.160> and<00:05:25.680> then

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
amino acids hooked together and then

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.610 
amino acids hooked together and then
there's<00:05:26.950> sulfation<00:05:27.640> which<00:05:28.300> is<00:05:28.480> sulfate<00:05:29.110> as<00:05:29.440> in

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
there's sulfation which is sulfate as in

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.300 
there's sulfation which is sulfate as in
magnesium<00:05:30.220> sulfate<00:05:30.610> as<00:05:30.820> in<00:05:30.970> Epsom<00:05:31.390> salt<00:05:31.600> bath

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
magnesium sulfate as in Epsom salt bath

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.040 
magnesium sulfate as in Epsom salt bath
what<00:05:33.310> makes<00:05:33.520> these<00:05:33.700> special<00:05:34.210> is<00:05:34.360> that<00:05:34.630> they're

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
what makes these special is that they're

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.040 
what makes these special is that they're
all<00:05:35.230> linked<00:05:36.480> the<00:05:37.480> place<00:05:37.660> that<00:05:37.840> you<00:05:37.900> make

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
all linked the place that you make

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:39.900 
all linked the place that you make
methyl<00:05:38.380> groups<00:05:38.560> is<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:39.070> methyl<00:05:39.370> cycle<00:05:39.700> and

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
methyl groups is the methyl cycle and

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.330 
methyl groups is the methyl cycle and
that<00:05:40.450> cycle<00:05:40.930> feeds<00:05:41.260> into<00:05:41.590> to<00:05:42.250> the

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
that cycle feeds into to the

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.360 
that cycle feeds into to the
transpiration<00:05:43.030> process<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:43.900> glutathione<00:05:44.890> in

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
transpiration process and glutathione in

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.480 
transpiration process and glutathione in
sulfation<00:05:46.080> sulfates<00:05:47.080> are<00:05:47.230> both<00:05:47.560> products<00:05:48.370> of

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
sulfation sulfates are both products of

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.530 
sulfation sulfates are both products of
the<00:05:49.390> transformation<00:05:49.930> process<00:05:50.400> so<00:05:51.400> if<00:05:51.670> this

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
the transformation process so if this

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.740 
the transformation process so if this
isn't<00:05:53.020> working<00:05:53.320> right<00:05:53.350> or<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:55.360> feeding

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
isn't working right or the feeding

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.420 
isn't working right or the feeding
mechanism<00:05:55.930> isn't<00:05:56.440> working<00:05:56.860> right<00:05:56.920> then<00:05:57.340> you

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
mechanism isn't working right then you

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.150 
mechanism isn't working right then you
can<00:05:57.610> get<00:05:57.870> all<00:05:58.870> sorts<00:05:59.170> of<00:05:59.350> weird<00:05:59.620> numbers<00:05:59.980> of

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 
can get all sorts of weird numbers of

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.830 
can get all sorts of weird numbers of
these<00:06:00.370> flags<00:06:00.700> and<00:06:01.000> if<00:06:01.270> you<00:06:01.360> don't<00:06:01.570> have<00:06:01.720> the

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
these flags and if you don't have the

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.330 
these flags and if you don't have the
right<00:06:01.870> numbers<00:06:02.260> of<00:06:02.410> those<00:06:02.500> slides<00:06:02.800> that's

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:03.340 
right numbers of those slides that's

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
right numbers of those slides that's
where<00:06:03.520> you<00:06:03.640> get<00:06:03.760> issues<00:06:04.060> so<00:06:04.990> in<00:06:06.150> another<00:06:07.150> video

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
where you get issues so in another video

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.650 
where you get issues so in another video
I'm<00:06:07.780> going<00:06:07.990> to<00:06:08.050> talk<00:06:08.110> about<00:06:09.090> how<00:06:10.090> this<00:06:10.390> process

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:10.660 
I'm going to talk about how this process

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.990 
I'm going to talk about how this process
works
