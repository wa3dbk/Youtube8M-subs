00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.510
 Messina 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.070
 There are many dog trainers out there 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.830
 standards for certification for 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.109
 dog trainer meanwhile yes it is 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.340
 so far been that the profession, so to speak 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.630
 not everyone is protected 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.060
 could call himself that and everyone could 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.189
 on different versions and variants 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.900
 In the meantime it is working like that 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.090
 An official certification from the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.800
 veterinary chamber gives and that means it 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.840
 There are quality standards after those now 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.239
 good trainer can be selected 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.610
 but who ensures the quality in this 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.200
 occupation that is actually the 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.610
 Veterinarians can be seen in the professional committee 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.260
 sit veterinarians as well 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.059
 scientific examiner as well as 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.829
 also dog trainer then the 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.020
 respective examine the dog trainer 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.450
 Test and test in theory and practice 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.860
 as well as in a technical discussion and then 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.620
 communicate the result 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.280
 you're correct how long does it last 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.260
 training 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.820
 that depends on which provider 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 So you can go here too 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.890
 no correct standards or none 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.809
 regulations 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.370
 that means there are providers one is after 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.290
 a few weeks finished, however, there are 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.600
 also providers in which the education 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.650
 training takes you three years 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.650
 Be aware of it for this job 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.210
 decided yes ten years ago I have 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.590
 I decided to dog trainer 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.540
 I will have a long training 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.680
 also made to behave advisors 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.479
 I also have myself official 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.520
 get certified and work 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.180
 be happy and be happy ten years 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.240
 in this book 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.799
 ok then my question would be after the 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.869
 future and future security 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.790
 actually totally irrelevant 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.650
 no, that's not one 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.750
 very good question for that yet 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.549
 Of course, there were no standards 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.290
 different views one with one 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.909
 dog works and there are those 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.350
 scientific component after the 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.579
 latest scientific 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.329
 knowledge to work or after 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.979
 bauchgefühl 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.180
 I also like to have mine 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.770
 belly feeling but there must be 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.630
 relevant expertise behind to be 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.189
 to be a good dog trainer and that 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.409
 should just by the certification 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.700
 be mixed together now 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.829
 mainly in dogs 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.110
 it gives it for problem behavior 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.360
 dogs what is there for core topics 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.070
 ever the biggest problem is 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.810
 actually the amateur aggression the 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.520
 that means for him on the leash of 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.619
 So, dog pulls or smells 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.420
 through the area and just when 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.729
 It looks like this when you meet other dogs 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.349
 from that the dogs then 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.090
 pull one even stronger on the leash 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.019
 and also show aggression and in the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.920
 worst case happens 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.390
 bite injuries 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.159
 and then of course we are back again 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.720
 in the area where it is difficult for the 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.280
 he becomes public with such 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.239
 to handle dogs because of course one 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.410
 Harassment dasteht is recommended 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.209
 for people who are now out of the 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:32.360
 shelter just from the shelter new 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.310
 fetch animal to go to an un school 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.049
 In any case, because they learn there 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.239
 the little one-dog learns that 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.099
 little ones of dog training and 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.930
 it is so you just stand again 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.209
 advice and did just the dog owners 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.250
 on the side and keep coming back 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.660
 Ask on a dog like a child that 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.370
 means he also goes through different 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.049
 live and in different times and 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.549
 that's good if you just go to the 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.319
 side has we already have it 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:56.239
 addressed this mobbing on a leash 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.780
 this tug this bite this 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.790
 grab 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.620
 how long does the knowledge take that away 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.000
 that has come here too 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.859
 to the dog because every dog ​​is 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.440
 individually and naturally also the 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:08.989
 holder that means how much time does he have ? 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.310
 training to invest with the dog 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.530
 to do exercises like his 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.760
 receptiveness that is one 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.959
 We can not help with that 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.970
 but it depends on the respective 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.470
 team 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.150
 but of course we need it too 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.889
 a dog handler license how long it takes 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.290
 something like that and you can do things like Troy 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:25.790
 That's the way it will be again 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.650
 here are very different 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.569
 possible preparation courses these are 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.220
 no obligation but the holder has the 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.930
 possibility in theory as well 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.099
 practice to be trained again 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.980
 this often happens too 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.530
 education courses then the exam runs 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.930
 about two hours from one hour time 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.000
 for the theory exam and then with time 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.230
 later also 60 minutes for 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.209
 the practical exam 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.590
 wherein the holder is being tested and 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.190
 it depends on the holder so not 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.349
 on the dog 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.019
 that means the respective expertise 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.150
 is checked by the holder what offer 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.620
 addressed or become 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.930
 various areas addressed that 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.790
 The topic of legal foundations is important 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.959
 is called 100 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.659
 we are who is responsible 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.090
 the dog feces to the hair and what 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.340
 rights come into force when I'm with you 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.959
 my dog ​​so not through the city 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.640
 it's just nice for the people 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.319
 is still the need to be 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.760
 Dog owner rearing puppies 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.130
 know expressive behavior 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.660
 communication and a bit natural 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.070
 even the dogs gag that is what 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.539
 I do when my dog ​​runs free and 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.220
 For example, we meet children 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:25.690
 Of course, the dog owners have to 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.560
 accordingly know that your dog immediately 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.660
 is initiated 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.830
 this sounds more like theory 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.870
 what does the practice look like? 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.910
 the practice looks like we as 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.590
 Checkers as the participants look at the 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.960
 Dog owner like you with your dog 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.389
 We will work the basic signals 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.280
 ask that we have a seat a place 1 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.860
 so here is the safe call the 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.110
 linen and, of course, like that 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.300
 Dog owner communicates with his dog 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.370
 how does he react to the stress situation? 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.630
 both dog and old and the 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.669
 Examination is done in two different places 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.560
 that means once in one 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.690
 fenced area 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.690
 plot but the second part finds 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.789
 then in public instead of why 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.080
 there it is that the dog owner 

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:06.699
 of course his dog in the 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.750
 public can lead without others 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:09.970
 to harass people 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.440
 and of course stress-free and accurate 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.240
 That's why you go to the 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.889
 place of action and that means off 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.720
 to the city 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:17.460
 Since you always have to be afraid of cost yourself 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.840
 to say that 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.099
 it is different so afraid of 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.110
 cost of course costs the 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.760
 dog handler's license but the fees 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.550
 Actually, they are still in the frame 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.949
 are between 40 and 120 euros 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.570
 here could be the dog school 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:35.310
 decide how expensive the whole fun 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.389
 and there is no firm for 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.310
 if we liked that now I have 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.139
 now without a driver's license and think human 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.180
 I can continue now however to 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.770
 Dog trainer is that possible that is 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.419
 possible here that means we train 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.099
 and we also form that out 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:49.750
 the official certification of the 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.370
 veterinary chamber in Lower Saxony as 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.229
 also to prepare schleswig holstein 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.849
 that means our protégé will be after 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.229
 the latest scientific 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:58.120
 knowledge trained so that we can 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.020
 with good feeling also accordingly 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.020
 to send the camera
