will work for PC pcs settings look a
little<00:00:34.170> bit<00:00:34.380> different<00:00:34.770> but<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:36.000> general

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
little bit different but and in general

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.709 
little bit different but and in general
they're<00:00:37.140> pretty<00:00:37.530> much<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.739> same<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.700> when<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
they're pretty much the same so when I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.990 
they're pretty much the same so when I
start<00:00:40.110> off<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.290> first<00:00:40.500> thing<00:00:40.829> I<00:00:40.950> do<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.520> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
start off the first thing I do is I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.819 
start off the first thing I do is I
right-click<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:42.930> my<00:00:43.020> torrent<00:00:43.440> whatever<00:00:43.710> it

may be
I<00:00:44.370> go<00:00:44.910> down<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.180> bandwidth<00:00:45.570> allocation<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I go down to bandwidth allocation you

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.470 
I go down to bandwidth allocation you
can<00:00:46.620> set<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.190> high<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.670> doesn't<00:00:48.210> really

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
can set this to high it doesn't really

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.330 
can set this to high it doesn't really
do<00:00:48.840> much<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.260> be<00:00:49.379> honest<00:00:49.649> but<00:00:49.980> what<00:00:50.160> really

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
do much to be honest but what really

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.010 
do much to be honest but what really
makes<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.760> difference<00:00:51.090> is<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> you<00:00:51.809> go<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
makes a difference is it you go to

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660 
makes a difference is it you go to
bandwidth<00:00:52.379> allocation<00:00:52.710> go<00:00:52.920> set<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.460> load

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
bandwidth allocation go set up load

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.000 
bandwidth allocation go set up load
limit<00:00:53.940> set<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.809> five<00:00:55.140> which<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> lowest

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
limit set it to five which is the lowest

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
know what scheduler does I'm pretty sure

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.790 
know what scheduler does I'm pretty sure
you<00:02:24.390> can<00:02:24.510> choose<00:02:24.750> at<00:02:24.960> certain<00:02:25.230> points<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.740> the

day<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:26.850> would<00:02:26.940> like<00:02:27.060> stuff<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.390> be

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
day that you would like stuff to be

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.560 
day that you would like stuff to be
downloaded<00:02:27.960> remote<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.830> have<00:02:29.490> no<00:02:29.730> idea<00:02:30.060> so

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
downloaded remote I have no idea so

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.540

generally what you need is just to go to

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.760 
generally what you need is just to go to
bandwidth<00:02:33.000> bandwidth<00:02:33.810> do<00:02:34.080> exactly<00:02:34.440> what<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.680> do

this<00:02:39.210> you<00:02:40.080> need<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.410> check<00:02:40.740> everything

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
this you need to check everything

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
want to have seeding to - I don't know

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.460 
want to have seeding to - I don't know
why<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:50.820> found<00:02:51.270> this<00:02:51.360> from<00:02:51.630> another<00:02:51.810> video<00:02:52.050> and

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
why I found this from another video and

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.530 
why I found this from another video and
it<00:02:53.040> seems<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.340> work<00:02:53.459> for<00:02:53.580> me<00:02:53.640> perfectly<00:02:54.330> well

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
it seems to work for me perfectly well

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.690 
it seems to work for me perfectly well
but<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.500> do<00:02:55.709> not<00:02:55.860> want<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.130> set<00:02:56.280> your<00:02:56.340> upload

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
but you do not want to set your upload

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.610 
but you do not want to set your upload
limit<00:02:56.880> to<00:02:57.060> 0<00:02:57.300> and<00:02:57.570> keep<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.900> checked<00:02:58.170> because

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
limit to 0 and keep it checked because

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.710 
limit to 0 and keep it checked because
if<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:58.860> do<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.070> it<00:02:59.610> just<00:02:59.910> doesn't<00:03:00.209> work<00:03:00.450> it's

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
if you do that it just doesn't work it's

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.510 
if you do that it just doesn't work it's
just<00:03:01.020> weird<00:03:01.680> with<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.070> bandwidth<00:03:02.370> and

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
just weird with the bandwidth and

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.270 
just weird with the bandwidth and
everything<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.120> it<00:03:04.020> gives<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:04.680> less<00:03:04.950> fast

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
everything and it gives you less fast

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.860 
everything and it gives you less fast
speeds<00:03:05.850> I<00:03:06.150> don't<00:03:06.300> know<00:03:06.360> if<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.540> make<00:03:06.660> sense

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
speeds I don't know if that make sense

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.930 
speeds I don't know if that make sense
whatever<00:03:07.110> so<00:03:07.950> next<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.580> want<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.790> go<00:03:08.850> into

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
whatever so next you want to go into

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.880 
whatever so next you want to go into
BitTorrent<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:09.750> I<00:03:10.260> don't<00:03:10.620> feel<00:03:10.770> like
