an Nvidia 8800 series was a concern
whether<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:12.040> would<00:02:12.160> fit<00:02:12.370> in<00:02:12.460> your<00:02:12.580> case<00:02:12.790> or<00:02:13.030> not

whether it would fit in your case or not

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.170 
whether it would fit in your case or not
it<00:02:13.780> goes<00:02:14.770> to<00:02:14.920> show<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.610> development

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
it goes to show you that the development

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.200 
it goes to show you that the development

featured plastic looking suitcase then

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.070 
featured plastic looking suitcase then
you<00:02:27.640> don't<00:02:27.820> really<00:02:28.030> need<00:02:28.240> to<00:02:28.300> redo<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:28.750> for

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
you don't really need to redo it for

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:35.430 
you don't really need to redo it for
quite<00:02:29.680> some<00:02:30.010> time<00:02:32.460> all<00:02:33.460> right<00:02:33.900> here<00:02:34.900> it<00:02:35.050> is<00:02:35.080> the

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
quite some time all right here it is the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.490 
quite some time all right here it is the
300<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.820> find<00:02:37.120> first<00:02:37.570> of<00:02:37.720> all<00:02:37.840> the<00:02:38.200> mesh

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
300 so you find first of all the mesh

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.380 
300 so you find first of all the mesh
front<00:02:38.830> you've<00:02:39.190> got<00:02:39.220> three<00:02:39.880> five<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.330> a

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
front you've got three five and a

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.480 
front you've got three five and a
quarter<00:02:40.570> inch<00:02:40.720> bays<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.410> then<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.950> have<00:02:42.160> dual

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
quarter inch bays and then you have dual

in<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:45.160> front<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.580> case<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:45.970> these<00:02:46.090> are

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
in the front of the case so these are

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.360 
in the front of the case so these are
filtered<00:02:46.720> intakes<00:02:47.160> although<00:02:48.160> I'm<00:02:48.250> not

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
filtered intakes although I'm not

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.010 
filtered intakes although I'm not
actually<00:02:48.850> sure<00:02:49.000> how<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.270> filters<00:02:49.690> come<00:02:49.900> out

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
actually sure how the filters come out

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.710 
actually sure how the filters come out
for<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.320> particular<00:02:50.860> one<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.910> does<00:02:52.120> not<00:02:52.360> come

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
for this particular one it does not come

for this particular one it does not come
preloaded<00:02:53.020> with<00:02:53.470> fans<00:02:53.770> there<00:02:54.190> but<00:02:54.790> at<00:02:55.030> least

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
preloaded with fans there but at least

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.940 
preloaded with fans there but at least
it<00:02:55.540> does<00:02:55.720> give<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.290> option<00:02:56.709> of<00:02:56.800> adding

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
it does give you the option of adding

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.890 
it does give you the option of adding
them<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:57.940> have<00:02:58.150> airflow<00:02:58.600> going

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
them so that you have airflow going

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.890 
them so that you have airflow going
directly<00:02:59.320> over<00:02:59.650> your<00:02:59.770> graphics<00:03:00.220> cards<00:03:00.640> or

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
directly over your graphics cards or

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.180 
directly over your graphics cards or
graphics<00:03:01.900> card<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.410> guess<00:03:02.560> if<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:02.800> don't<00:03:02.830> run

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
graphics card I guess if you don't run

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.670 
graphics card I guess if you don't run
to<00:03:03.220> which<00:03:03.790> most<00:03:04.060> people<00:03:04.360> don't<00:03:04.650> from<00:03:05.650> the

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
to which most people don't from the

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.490 
to which most people don't from the
front<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.640> chassis<00:03:06.870> nice<00:03:07.870> thumb<00:03:08.140> screws

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
front of the chassis nice thumb screws

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.530 
front of the chassis nice thumb screws
those<00:03:09.220> nice<00:03:09.400> wide<00:03:09.700> thumb<00:03:09.970> screws<00:03:10.239> so<00:03:10.420> it's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
those nice wide thumb screws so it's

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.150 
those nice wide thumb screws so it's
easier<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:10.959> get<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.110> grip<00:03:11.350> on<00:03:11.470> them<00:03:11.680> then<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
easier to get a grip on them then the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.610 
easier to get a grip on them then the
then<00:03:12.940> the<00:03:13.060> smaller<00:03:13.390> head<00:03:13.660> thumb<00:03:13.900> screws<00:03:14.200> we're

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
then the smaller head thumb screws we're

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.900 
then the smaller head thumb screws we're
going<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.800> take<00:03:14.890> side<00:03:15.130> panels<00:03:15.519> off<00:03:15.640> so<00:03:15.850> the

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
going to take side panels off so the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.300 
going to take side panels off so the
side<00:03:16.120> panels<00:03:16.540> use<00:03:17.050> a<00:03:17.080> pretty<00:03:17.410> standard<00:03:17.950> finish

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
side panels use a pretty standard finish

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.880 
side panels use a pretty standard finish
it's<00:03:18.519> not<00:03:18.730> quite<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.480> super<00:03:20.320> matte<00:03:20.560> finish

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
it's not quite that super matte finish

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.770 
it's not quite that super matte finish
but<00:03:21.040> it's<00:03:21.190> also<00:03:21.340> not<00:03:21.580> glossy<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.570> it's<00:03:22.690> going

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
but it's also not glossy so it's going

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.750 
but it's also not glossy so it's going
to<00:03:22.870> be<00:03:22.959> fairly<00:03:23.350> fingerprint<00:03:24.100> resistant<00:03:24.580> but

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
to be fairly fingerprint resistant but

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.920 
to be fairly fingerprint resistant but
not<00:03:25.030> perfect<00:03:25.540> I<00:03:27.180> mean<00:03:28.180> if<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:28.390> keep<00:03:28.570> your<00:03:28.750> case

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
not perfect I mean if you keep your case

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.540 
not perfect I mean if you keep your case
reasonably<00:03:29.530> clean<00:03:29.769> it's<00:03:29.980> not<00:03:30.130> really<00:03:30.519> a

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
reasonably clean it's not really a

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.790 
reasonably clean it's not really a
concern<00:03:31.000> on<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.660> side<00:03:31.870> you<00:03:32.320> can<00:03:32.470> see<00:03:32.500> we've

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
concern on the side you can see we've

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.310 
concern on the side you can see we've
got<00:03:32.830> a<00:03:33.010> punch<00:03:33.280> out<00:03:33.459> for<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.730> 120<00:03:34.660> millimeter<00:03:35.050> fan

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
got a punch out for a 120 millimeter fan

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.140 
got a punch out for a 120 millimeter fan
so<00:03:35.830> that's<00:03:36.010> going<00:03:36.220> to<00:03:36.280> blow<00:03:36.459> directly<00:03:36.910> over

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
so that's going to blow directly over

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.580 
so that's going to blow directly over
your<00:03:37.269> graphics<00:03:37.690> card<00:03:37.930> so<00:03:37.989> it's<00:03:38.230> all<00:03:38.350> about

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
your graphics card so it's all about

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.380 
your graphics card so it's all about
graphics<00:03:39.040> card<00:03:39.280> cooling<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:40.000> way<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.150> would

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
graphics card cooling the way I would

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.390 
graphics card cooling the way I would
probably<00:03:40.690> set<00:03:40.930> this<00:03:41.140> case<00:03:41.410> up<00:03:41.650> for<00:03:41.890> optimal

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
probably set this case up for optimal

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.729 
probably set this case up for optimal
cooling<00:03:42.580> would<00:03:43.150> be<00:03:43.360> to<00:03:43.570> 120<00:03:44.050> millimeters<00:03:44.530> as

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
cooling would be to 120 millimeters as

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.610 
cooling would be to 120 millimeters as
intakes<00:03:45.550> in<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.850> front<00:03:46.150> and<00:03:46.360> then<00:03:46.989> I<00:03:47.260> would

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
intakes in the front and then I would

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.979 
intakes in the front and then I would
set<00:03:47.920> this<00:03:48.400> one<00:03:48.610> right<00:03:48.790> here<00:03:49.060> up<00:03:49.209> as<00:03:49.360> an<00:03:49.570> exhaust

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
set this one right here up as an exhaust

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.140 
set this one right here up as an exhaust
because<00:03:50.320> most<00:03:50.769> cards<00:03:51.280> these<00:03:51.549> days<00:03:51.610> I<00:03:51.910> mean<00:03:52.030> it

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
because most cards these days I mean it

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.280 
because most cards these days I mean it
depends<00:03:52.480> what<00:03:52.600> you're<00:03:52.720> using<00:03:52.900> but<00:03:53.140> if<00:03:53.230> you

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
depends what you're using but if you

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.750 
depends what you're using but if you
have<00:03:53.440> an<00:03:53.560> Nvidia<00:03:53.890> reference<00:03:54.310> card<00:03:54.549> for

have an Nvidia reference card for

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.610 
have an Nvidia reference card for
example<00:03:55.150> it's<00:03:55.570> going<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:55.780> be<00:03:55.900> drawing<00:03:56.170> air<00:03:56.470> in

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
example it's going to be drawing air in

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.500 
example it's going to be drawing air in
on<00:03:56.739> this<00:03:56.890> side<00:03:57.160> and<00:03:57.370> kicking<00:03:57.970> it<00:03:58.060> out<00:03:58.150> on<00:03:58.330> this

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
on this side and kicking it out on this

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.420 
on this side and kicking it out on this
side<00:03:58.720> so<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:58.959> want<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.680> you<00:03:59.830> want<00:04:00.010> to<00:04:00.040> help<00:04:00.250> it

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
side so you want to you want to help it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.850 
side so you want to you want to help it
rather<00:04:00.700> than<00:04:00.970> work<00:04:01.209> against<00:04:01.870> it<00:04:02.019> so<00:04:02.680> let's

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
rather than work against it so let's

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.500 
rather than work against it so let's
look<00:04:02.920> at<00:04:03.070> the<00:04:03.160> inside<00:04:03.459> of<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.670> case<00:04:03.880> as<00:04:04.120> you

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
look at the inside of the case as you

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.400 
look at the inside of the case as you
can<00:04:04.540> see<00:04:04.840> it's<00:04:05.019> a<00:04:05.110> fairly<00:04:05.650> basic<00:04:07.110> chassis<00:04:08.110> in

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
can see it's a fairly basic chassis in

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.229 
can see it's a fairly basic chassis in
terms<00:04:08.620> of<00:04:08.769> its<00:04:08.890> construction<00:04:09.250> we've<00:04:09.880> got<00:04:10.090> one

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
terms of its construction we've got one

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.440 
terms of its construction we've got one
two<00:04:10.450> three<00:04:10.810> four<00:04:11.110> five<00:04:11.410> six<00:04:12.220> five<00:04:12.579> three<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.329> a

half inch drive bays

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.210 
half inch drive bays
we<00:04:15.160> have<00:04:15.310> our<00:04:15.489> SSD

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
we have our SSD

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.100 
we have our SSD
mount<00:04:16.430> here<00:04:17.000> at<00:04:17.120> the<00:04:17.239> bottom<00:04:17.510> so<00:04:17.660> you<00:04:17.780> can<00:04:17.930> see

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.110 
mount here at the bottom so you can see

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.110 
mount here at the bottom so you can see
they've<00:04:18.320> retrofitted<00:04:18.829> it<00:04:19.459> with<00:04:19.670> that<00:04:19.880> so

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
they've retrofitted it with that so

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.490 
they've retrofitted it with that so
you're<00:04:20.269> just<00:04:20.360> going<00:04:20.600> to<00:04:20.630> screw<00:04:20.930> these<00:04:21.079> in<00:04:21.290> from

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
you're just going to screw these in from

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.290 
you're just going to screw these in from
the<00:04:21.650> bottom<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:22.010> can<00:04:22.190> mount<00:04:22.370> one<00:04:22.550> SSD<00:04:23.060> here

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
the bottom you can mount one SSD here

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.090 
the bottom you can mount one SSD here
and<00:04:23.450> it<00:04:23.840> can<00:04:24.050> still<00:04:24.260> support<00:04:24.500> its<00:04:24.860> full

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
and it can still support its full

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.920 
and it can still support its full
complement<00:04:25.670> of<00:04:25.760> three<00:04:26.390> and<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.540> half<00:04:26.690> inch

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
complement of three and a half inch

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.260 
complement of three and a half inch
drives<00:04:27.230> even<00:04:27.530> if<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:27.920> do<00:04:28.070> that<00:04:28.280> there<00:04:28.790> are<00:04:29.090> the

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
drives even if you do that there are the

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.610 
drives even if you do that there are the
mounts<00:04:29.570> for<00:04:29.720> your<00:04:29.870> five<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.230> a<00:04:30.320> quarter<00:04:30.470> inch

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
mounts for your five and a quarter inch

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.760 
mounts for your five and a quarter inch
so<00:04:30.860> there's<00:04:31.040> no<00:04:31.190> tooless<00:04:32.110> stuff<00:04:33.110> going<00:04:33.470> on<00:04:33.560> in

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
so there's no tooless stuff going on in

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.800 
so there's no tooless stuff going on in
this<00:04:33.860> chassis<00:04:34.370> it's<00:04:34.520> very<00:04:34.700> basic<00:04:34.880> I<00:04:35.330> mean<00:04:35.390> to

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
this chassis it's very basic I mean to

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.060 
this chassis it's very basic I mean to
lists<00:04:36.170> if<00:04:36.290> you're<00:04:36.410> only<00:04:36.500> going<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:36.770> build<00:04:36.890> the

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
lists if you're only going to build the

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.620 
lists if you're only going to build the
system<00:04:37.400> once<00:04:37.610> isn't<00:04:37.940> that<00:04:38.060> big<00:04:38.240> of<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.450> deal

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
system once isn't that big of a deal

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.330 
system once isn't that big of a deal
it's<00:04:39.140> only<00:04:39.350> if<00:04:39.560> you're<00:04:39.710> doing<00:04:39.830> frequent

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
it's only if you're doing frequent

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.440 
it's only if you're doing frequent
modding<00:04:40.640> you're<00:04:40.760> going<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:40.940> want<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.150> consider

modding you're going to want to consider

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.150 
modding you're going to want to consider
maybe<00:04:41.690> getting<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.050> higher<00:04:42.230> end<00:04:42.500> chassis<00:04:42.920> such

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
maybe getting a higher end chassis such

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.610 
maybe getting a higher end chassis such
as<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.580> 900<00:04:44.120> which<00:04:44.270> uses<00:04:44.600> thumb<00:04:44.810> screws<00:04:45.110> to

this case let's have a look so we have

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:18.490 
this case let's have a look so we have
two<00:05:16.550> front<00:05:16.820> USB<00:05:17.270> two<00:05:17.450> ports<00:05:17.870> we<00:05:18.050> have<00:05:18.230> a

00:06:59.899 --> 00:06:59.909 
power supply you can just bundle them

00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:02.240

all<00:06:59.969> up<00:07:00.150> here<00:07:00.360> time<00:07:01.020> down<00:07:01.349> and<00:07:01.710> that<00:07:02.129> would

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
all up here time down and that would

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.830 
all up here time down and that would
probably<00:07:02.460> be<00:07:02.669> the<00:07:02.879> best<00:07:03.090> way<00:07:03.330> to<00:07:03.360> go<00:07:03.719> about

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:03.840 
probably be the best way to go about

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.020 
probably be the best way to go about
that<00:07:04.169> so<00:07:04.680> I<00:07:04.919> think<00:07:05.009> that's<00:07:05.370> pretty<00:07:05.580> much<00:07:05.759> all<00:07:05.969> I

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
that so I think that's pretty much all I

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.760 
that so I think that's pretty much all I
have<00:07:06.300> to<00:07:06.449> say<00:07:06.479> about<00:07:06.780> 300<00:07:07.319> I<00:07:07.349> don't<00:07:07.500> think<00:07:07.680> I

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
have to say about 300 I don't think I

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.080 
have to say about 300 I don't think I
ever<00:07:07.860> showed<00:07:08.099> a<00:07:08.129> view<00:07:08.370> from<00:07:08.550> the<00:07:08.669> back<00:07:08.819> so

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
ever showed a view from the back so

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.059 
ever showed a view from the back so
that's<00:07:09.599> what<00:07:09.870> it<00:07:09.960> looks<00:07:09.990> like<00:07:10.319> if<00:07:10.500> you<00:07:10.530> haven't

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:11.069 
that's what it looks like if you haven't

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:12.890 
that's what it looks like if you haven't
seen<00:07:11.280> one<00:07:11.310> before<00:07:11.639> don't<00:07:12.509> forget<00:07:12.780> to

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:12.900 
seen one before don't forget to

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.510
