is<00:01:28.920> hopefully<00:01:29.729> i<00:01:29.939> don't<00:01:30.060> know<00:01:30.630> but<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.290> know<00:01:31.500> i

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
is hopefully i don't know but you know i

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.560 
is hopefully i don't know but you know i
like<00:01:32.100> i<00:01:32.250> said<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.850> guess<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.270> good<00:01:33.420> as

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
like i said my your guess is as good as

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.010 
like i said my your guess is as good as
mine<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:34.200> i<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.310> completely<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.780> I

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
mine here i I completely it's just I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.390 
mine here i I completely it's just I
don't<00:01:37.079> know

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
don't know

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.010 
don't know
basically<00:01:38.910> I<00:01:38.940> think<00:01:39.240> what<00:01:39.570> they're<00:01:39.720> doing<00:01:39.780> now

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
basically I think what they're doing now

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.860 
basically I think what they're doing now
is<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.650> for<00:01:41.160> a<00:01:41.190> cod<00:01:41.880> elite<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.450> you<00:01:42.540> guys<00:01:42.690> know

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
is for for a cod elite if you guys know

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.780 
is for for a cod elite if you guys know
what<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.530> think<00:01:43.560> it's<00:01:43.890> a<00:01:44.100> where

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
what that is I think it's a where

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.740 
what that is I think it's a where
they're<00:01:44.910> going<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.120> be<00:01:45.210> getting<00:01:45.480> the<00:01:45.570> map

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
they're going to be getting the map

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.570 
they're going to be getting the map
packs<00:01:46.020> now<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.590> don't<00:01:47.010> know<00:01:47.190> if<00:01:47.220> you'll<00:01:47.400> be<00:01:47.550> able

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
packs now I don't know if you'll be able

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.760 
packs now I don't know if you'll be able
to<00:01:47.760> buy<00:01:47.820> them<00:01:48.090> separately<00:01:48.360> but<00:01:49.350> I<00:01:49.410> think<00:01:49.650> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
to buy them separately but I think you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.560 
to buy them separately but I think you
will<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.700> we'll<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:50.940> to<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.240> how<00:01:51.270> it<00:01:51.390> turns

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
will but we'll have to see how it turns

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.450 
will but we'll have to see how it turns
out<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.990> don't<00:01:52.170> think<00:01:52.380> there's<00:01:52.590> any<00:01:52.800> kadhi<00:01:53.130> lead

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
out I don't think there's any kadhi lead

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.790 
out I don't think there's any kadhi lead
for<00:01:53.730> wii<00:01:53.910> yet<00:01:54.230> probably<00:01:55.230> when<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:55.560> wii<00:01:55.680> u

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
for wii yet probably when the wii u

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.290 
for wii yet probably when the wii u
comes<00:01:56.010> out<00:01:56.160> we'll<00:01:56.340> make<00:01:56.520> it<00:01:56.550> if<00:01:56.850> they<00:01:57.060> still

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
comes out we'll make it if they still

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.020 
comes out we'll make it if they still
have<00:01:57.330> cod<00:01:57.630> elite<00:01:57.780> around<00:01:58.200> there<00:01:58.820> but<00:01:59.820> there's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
have cod elite around there but there's

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.020 
have cod elite around there but there's
no<00:02:00.090> cod<00:02:00.390> elite<00:02:00.600> for<00:02:01.110> wii<00:02:01.290> and<00:02:01.650> if<00:02:02.220> that's<00:02:02.730> how

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
no cod elite for wii and if that's how

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.300 
no cod elite for wii and if that's how
you<00:02:03.090> get<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.510> dlc<00:02:03.930> then<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.440> don't<00:02:04.950> think<00:02:05.190> we'll

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
you get the dlc then I don't think we'll

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.580 
you get the dlc then I don't think we'll
be<00:02:05.370> getting<00:02:05.550> map<00:02:06.000> packs<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:07.200> never<00:02:07.380> know

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
be getting map packs but you never know

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.870 
be getting map packs but you never know
there<00:02:07.890> might<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.070> a<00:02:08.220> different<00:02:08.399> way<00:02:08.670> they

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
there might be a different way they

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.490 
there might be a different way they
might<00:02:09.060> actually<00:02:09.360> make<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:09.929> this<00:02:10.050> time<00:02:10.259> and

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
might actually make one this time and

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.040 
might actually make one this time and
you<00:02:10.679> know<00:02:10.890> release<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.580> another<00:02:12.570> possibility

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
you know release it another possibility

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.400 
you know release it another possibility
actually<00:02:13.650> heard<00:02:13.830> around<00:02:14.070> was<00:02:14.520> that<00:02:15.410> modern

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
actually heard around was that modern

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.810 
actually heard around was that modern
warfare<00:02:16.500> 3<00:02:16.709> for<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.100> we<00:02:17.190> won't<00:02:17.400> be<00:02:17.520> coming

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
warfare 3 for that we won't be coming

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.270 
warfare 3 for that we won't be coming
out<00:02:17.940> on<00:02:18.120> november<00:02:18.720> eighth<00:02:18.900> or<00:02:19.280> november

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
out on november eighth or november

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.490 
out on november eighth or november
eighth<00:02:20.400> i<00:02:20.550> think<00:02:20.760> our<00:02:20.910> november<00:02:21.390> 11<00:02:21.720> eighth<00:02:22.260> i

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
eighth i think our november 11 eighth i

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.730 
eighth i think our november 11 eighth i
think<00:02:22.709> yeah<00:02:22.950> um<00:02:23.300> but<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.660> then<00:02:25.530> they'll<00:02:25.709> be

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
think yeah um but and then they'll be

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.560 
think yeah um but and then they'll be
releasing<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.310> map<00:02:26.490> pack<00:02:26.700> for<00:02:26.910> black<00:02:27.090> ops<00:02:27.270> which

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
releasing a map pack for black ops which

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.680 
releasing a map pack for black ops which
is<00:02:27.720> just<00:02:27.870> completely<00:02:28.220> speculation<00:02:29.360> but<00:02:30.360> you

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
is just completely speculation but you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.690 
is just completely speculation but you
know<00:02:30.780> it's<00:02:31.020> it's<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.680> possibility<00:02:32.010> i<00:02:32.310> think

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
know it's it's a possibility i think

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.160 
know it's it's a possibility i think
because<00:02:32.880> you<00:02:33.209> know<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.510> takes<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.810> long<00:02:33.930> time<00:02:33.990> to

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
because you know it takes a long time to

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.690 
because you know it takes a long time to
port<00:02:34.560> a<00:02:34.620> game<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.010> if<00:02:35.100> they<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.400> started

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
port a game and if they just started

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.949 
port a game and if they just started
boarding<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.180> then<00:02:36.360> it<00:02:36.480> might<00:02:36.600> take<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> while

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
boarding it then it might take a while

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.620 
boarding it then it might take a while
so<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:38.400> never<00:02:38.520> know<00:02:38.790> that's<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.180> possibility

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
so you never know that's a possibility

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.510 
so you never know that's a possibility
but<00:02:40.050> i'd<00:02:40.230> highly<00:02:40.470> doubt<00:02:40.770> that<00:02:40.800> we'll<00:02:41.220> see<00:02:41.400> how

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
but i'd highly doubt that we'll see how

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.240 
but i'd highly doubt that we'll see how
it<00:02:41.550> all<00:02:41.730> turns<00:02:41.790> out<00:02:42.180> i<00:02:42.390> believe<00:02:43.380> IGN<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.100> can

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
it all turns out i believe IGN you can

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.800 
it all turns out i believe IGN you can
confirm<00:02:44.580> that<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:45.000> coming<00:02:45.269> out<00:02:45.390> for<00:02:45.570> the<00:02:45.660> 8th

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
confirm that it's coming out for the 8th

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.560 
confirm that it's coming out for the 8th
the<00:02:46.739> same<00:02:46.950> date<00:02:47.190> as<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.340> rest<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.910> console

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
the same date as the rest of the console

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.199 
the same date as the rest of the console
so<00:02:48.840> hopefully<00:02:49.830> that'll<00:02:49.980> remain<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.459> remain

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
so hopefully that'll remain this remain

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.140 
so hopefully that'll remain this remain
the<00:02:51.360> same<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:51.600> we'll<00:02:52.260> see<00:02:52.440> how<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.650> turns<00:02:52.769> out

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
the same but we'll see how it turns out

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.390 
the same but we'll see how it turns out
and<00:02:54.150> a<00:02:54.420> lot<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.570> you<00:02:54.720> guys<00:02:54.780> also<00:02:55.230> moving<00:02:56.130> on<00:02:56.250> to

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
and a lot of you guys also moving on to

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.009 
and a lot of you guys also moving on to
a<00:02:56.430> different<00:02:56.610> subject<00:02:56.820> here's<00:02:57.390> asking<00:02:57.870> about

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
a different subject here's asking about

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.080 
a different subject here's asking about
the<00:02:58.170> maps<00:02:58.410> from<00:02:58.980> what<00:02:59.190> i<00:02:59.220> know<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.640> maps<00:02:59.850> are<00:03:00.030> a

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
the maps from what i know the maps are a

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.020 
the maps from what i know the maps are a
lot<00:03:00.300> smaller<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:00.900> there<00:03:01.860> i<00:03:02.160> guess<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.850> lot

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
lot smaller and there i guess a lot

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.210 
lot smaller and there i guess a lot
better

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
better

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.670 
better
evenly<00:03:04.700> distributed<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.690> don't<00:03:05.870> know<00:03:05.990> like

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
evenly distributed I don't know like

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.920 
evenly distributed I don't know like
there's<00:03:07.400> not<00:03:07.520> many<00:03:07.670> spots<00:03:08.120> to<00:03:08.330> camp<00:03:08.570> from<00:03:08.750> what

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
there's not many spots to camp from what

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.530 
there's not many spots to camp from what
I<00:03:08.960> hear<00:03:09.290> I've<00:03:10.100> seen<00:03:10.460> a<00:03:10.520> lot<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.760> gameplay<00:03:11.180> on

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
I hear I've seen a lot of gameplay on

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.780 
I hear I've seen a lot of gameplay on
youtube<00:03:11.600> but<00:03:12.320> you<00:03:12.800> know<00:03:12.920> it's<00:03:13.130> it's<00:03:13.520> too<00:03:13.760> early

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
youtube but you know it's it's too early

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.550 
youtube but you know it's it's too early
to<00:03:14.060> tell<00:03:14.150> at<00:03:14.360> this<00:03:14.510> point<00:03:14.600> I<00:03:14.930> think<00:03:15.020> the<00:03:15.380> maps

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
to tell at this point I think the maps

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.500 
to tell at this point I think the maps
look<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.070> little<00:03:16.250> bit<00:03:16.460> smaller<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:16.940> that's

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
look a little bit smaller and that's

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.880 
look a little bit smaller and that's
always<00:03:17.810> good<00:03:18.020> you<00:03:18.200> know<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.380> can<00:03:18.590> run<00:03:18.800> around

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
always good you know you can run around

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.590 
always good you know you can run around
more<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.460> find<00:03:19.790> more<00:03:19.970> people<00:03:20.270> and<00:03:20.390> stuff

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
more and find more people and stuff

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.890 
more and find more people and stuff
because<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:21.170> we<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:23.300> know<00:03:23.390> most

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
because on we the the you know most

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.410 
because on we the the you know most
games<00:03:24.170> are<00:03:24.320> already<00:03:24.710> slow<00:03:25.010> already<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:25.730> you

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
games are already slow already so you

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.390 
games are already slow already so you
know<00:03:26.540> it's<00:03:26.960> definitely<00:03:27.230> better<00:03:27.860> if<00:03:28.100> they<00:03:28.250> have

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
know it's definitely better if they have

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.930 
know it's definitely better if they have
a<00:03:28.430> smaller<00:03:29.330> maps<00:03:29.600> there's<00:03:29.990> lots<00:03:30.230> of<00:03:30.440> action

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
a smaller maps there's lots of action

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.760 
a smaller maps there's lots of action
and<00:03:31.940> a<00:03:32.690> lot<00:03:32.840> of<00:03:32.870> you<00:03:32.990> guys<00:03:33.050> also<00:03:33.440> have<00:03:33.590> been

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
and a lot of you guys also have been

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.650 
and a lot of you guys also have been
asking<00:03:34.100> about<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.460> killstreaks<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.240> you

guys<00:03:35.810> can<00:03:36.110> probably<00:03:36.590> infer<00:03:36.890> which

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
guys can probably infer which

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.620 
guys can probably infer which
killstreaks<00:03:37.520> will<00:03:37.700> already<00:03:37.910> be<00:03:38.030> taken<00:03:38.480> out<00:03:38.600> of

the game for the wii version who knows
they<00:03:41.270> might<00:03:41.300> even<00:03:41.600> do<00:03:41.840> something<00:03:42.230> completely

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
they might even do something completely

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.560 
they might even do something completely
different<00:03:43.040> make<00:03:43.520> different<00:03:44.120> killstreaks

opinion<00:04:12.410> on<00:04:12.530> it<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.830> think<00:04:13.489> I<00:04:13.700> actually<00:04:14.180> like

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
opinion on it I think I actually like

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.420 
opinion on it I think I actually like
how<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.720> killstreak<00:04:15.080> stack<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.769> how<00:04:15.920> they<00:04:16.070> you

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
how a killstreak stack and how they you

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.650 
how a killstreak stack and how they you
know<00:04:16.459> how<00:04:16.790> that<00:04:17.000> you<00:04:17.090> don't<00:04:17.269> have<00:04:17.330> to<00:04:17.450> die<00:04:17.630> to

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
know how that you don't have to die to

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.710 
know how that you don't have to die to
reset<00:04:18.320> your<00:04:18.790> to<00:04:19.790> your<00:04:19.910> support<00:04:20.239> streaks<00:04:20.570> or

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
reset your to your support streaks or

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.320 
reset your to your support streaks or
whatever<00:04:20.959> I<00:04:21.490> actually<00:04:22.490> like<00:04:22.850> that<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.270> you

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
whatever I actually like that so you

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.820 
whatever I actually like that so you
know<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.690> can<00:04:23.930> just<00:04:23.960> keep<00:04:24.229> going<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.740> don't

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
know you can just keep going you don't

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:27.520 
know you can just keep going you don't
have<00:04:24.979> to<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.910> know<00:04:26.030> die<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.300> review<00:04:27.169> your<00:04:27.200> kill

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
have to you know die to review your kill

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.780 
have to you know die to review your kill
streaks<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:27.919> stuff<00:04:28.130> like<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.340> so<00:04:28.640> I<00:04:28.669> think

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
streaks and stuff like that so I think

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.060 
streaks and stuff like that so I think
it's<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.150> lot<00:04:29.300> better<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:30.530> date<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:30.800> already

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
it's a lot better the date I already

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.700 
it's a lot better the date I already
talked<00:04:31.310> about<00:04:31.460> this

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
talked about this

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.830 
talked about this
it's<00:04:32.860> I<00:04:33.070> think<00:04:33.460> IGN<00:04:33.910> just<00:04:34.150> confirmed<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.690> it

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
it's I think IGN just confirmed that it

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.170 
it's I think IGN just confirmed that it
will<00:04:34.930> be<00:04:35.050> coming<00:04:35.200> out<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.680> eighth<00:04:35.940> the<00:04:36.940> same

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
will be coming out the eighth the same

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.850 
will be coming out the eighth the same
date<00:04:37.420> as<00:04:37.450> the<00:04:37.630> rest<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.170> console<00:04:38.560> so<00:04:38.740> i'll

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
date as the rest of the console so i'll

back<00:05:09.760> in<00:05:09.790> this<00:05:10.060> game<00:05:10.240> it<00:05:10.450> probably<00:05:10.840> is<00:05:11.080> i<00:05:11.350> think

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
back in this game it probably is i think

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.710 
back in this game it probably is i think
it<00:05:11.740> would<00:05:11.830> definitely<00:05:12.100> be<00:05:12.370> in<00:05:12.640> the<00:05:12.760> game<00:05:12.910> again

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
it would definitely be in the game again

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.120 
it would definitely be in the game again
because<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.200> you<00:05:14.440> know<00:05:14.560> a<00:05:14.590> lot<00:05:15.010> of<00:05:15.040> people

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.950 
because it you know a lot of people
liked<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:15.640> so<00:05:15.910> it's<00:05:16.330> probably<00:05:16.630> going<00:05:16.810> to<00:05:16.870> be

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960

the bottom with 43 so you know maybe
maybe<00:05:59.930> it'll<00:06:00.199> do<00:06:00.319> it<00:06:00.410> right<00:06:00.560> this<00:06:00.710> time<00:06:00.770> where

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160

so<00:06:10.490> we'll<00:06:10.729> see<00:06:10.940> how<00:06:10.970> it<00:06:11.060> turns<00:06:11.210> out<00:06:11.539> maybe

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
so we'll see how it turns out maybe

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.330 
so we'll see how it turns out maybe
there'll<00:06:12.050> be<00:06:12.080> more<00:06:12.380> experience<00:06:12.949> this<00:06:13.099> time

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
there'll be more experience this time

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:16.480 
there'll be more experience this time
around<00:06:13.490> and<00:06:14.740> fixed<00:06:15.740> the<00:06:15.800> hit<00:06:15.919> detection<00:06:16.039> and

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
around and fixed the hit detection and

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.420 
around and fixed the hit detection and
stuff<00:06:16.669> like<00:06:16.849> that<00:06:16.910> but<00:06:17.360> you<00:06:17.569> know<00:06:17.599> if<00:06:17.960> you<00:06:18.199> guys

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
stuff like that but you know if you guys

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.730 
stuff like that but you know if you guys
if<00:06:19.430> you<00:06:19.550> guys<00:06:19.699> think<00:06:19.729> about<00:06:20.030> it<00:06:20.440> will<00:06:21.440> you<00:06:21.560> buy

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
if you guys think about it will you buy

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.430 
if you guys think about it will you buy
another<00:06:22.039> game<00:06:22.280> if<00:06:22.430> it's<00:06:22.580> like<00:06:22.759> this<00:06:22.970> I<00:06:23.630> I<00:06:24.050> know

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
another game if it's like this I I know

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.650 
another game if it's like this I I know
I<00:06:24.590> barely<00:06:24.919> like<00:06:25.280> I<00:06:25.550> had<00:06:25.970> to<00:06:26.060> put<00:06:26.240> up<00:06:26.270> with<00:06:26.389> this

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
I barely like I had to put up with this

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.510 
I barely like I had to put up with this
for<00:06:26.900> modern<00:06:27.530> warfare<00:06:27.650> reflex<00:06:27.889> for<00:06:28.250> a<00:06:28.310> while

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
for modern warfare reflex for a while

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.909 
for modern warfare reflex for a while
and<00:06:28.819> if<00:06:29.330> modern<00:06:29.599> warfare<00:06:29.720> 3<00:06:29.870> has<00:06:30.229> lag<00:06:30.530> shooting

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:30.919 
and if modern warfare 3 has lag shooting

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:32.439 
and if modern warfare 3 has lag shooting
I<00:06:30.979> should<00:06:31.130> be<00:06:31.190> pretty<00:06:31.370> upset<00:06:31.490> about<00:06:31.910> that<00:06:32.210> that

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
I should be pretty upset about that that

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:33.999 
I should be pretty upset about that that
we'd<00:06:32.570> have<00:06:32.599> to<00:06:32.720> put<00:06:32.870> it<00:06:33.139> put<00:06:33.410> up<00:06:33.560> with<00:06:33.800> it<00:06:33.979> for

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:34.009 
we'd have to put it put up with it for

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:37.360 
we'd have to put it put up with it for
another<00:06:34.430> year<00:06:34.820> or<00:06:35.030> so<00:06:35.419> but<00:06:36.380> we'll<00:06:36.500> see<00:06:37.220> how<00:06:37.250> it

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370
