00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Fatima and after that comes to arm 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.910
 the fifth say that the request is armed 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.620
 December 8 as the day of the virgin 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.120
 is the day that is evil I have that 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.920
 custom for my mom I do not usually think 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.240
 we are all together alpinito I do not know 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:22.020
 If here also really in the drawer 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.840
 america all brazil easy it is clear that 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.050
 there's the culture showcase window has in its 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.550
 day as how to put together good 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.820
 regardless of the date that each 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.430
 country will coordinate it depending 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.980
 let's say for example 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.680
 what to put in the pine Fatima 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.040
 look at the breast of feng shui we are fine 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.080
 because let's say using pine because 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.150
 represents strength and hardness 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.390
 we have to be strong and be hard to live 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:53.070
 long represents unity the father the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.340
 micro holy spirit 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.250
 we must have the star because in the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:03.750
 tip of the tree because the star 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.760
 represents light the way we are going to 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.860
 give the guide the direction of but the pine 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.560
 a religious symbol also do not throw 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.130
 well but in any case others of 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.869
 the Feng Shui represents the strength 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.090
 just as the conduit can be left over 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.950
 fold but do not break it 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.930
 difficult or as you said it represents the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.580
 father the son the spirit came out inside 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.640
 of the mix because they are talking the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.970
 mixture of religious symbolism and 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.729
 feng shui and the triangular shape say 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.729
 which represents as clear the father said 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:46.180
 yes but the leader of the sisters had 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.550
 to put the star if the ideal is that 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.890
 people here with the family with the 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.479
 couple with friends who do not harness alone 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:02:00.310
 and within the religious idea 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.650
 the ideal would be for day 8 and 8 apart 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.530
 let's say it's a day that will be commemorated 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.509
 the virgin also the symbol of 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:18.070
 infinite that are always a milestone 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:21.000
 important that the guidance represents 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.000
 of the wise men 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.810
 for her they were guided justly 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.780
 by the star already and this that represents 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.690
 what bombs sent throughout the year 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.700
 by the star there is also someone who is going 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.190
 to give the guide and we also put 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.019
 in the tree it is very important to take 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.360
 collado by the colors that one goes to 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.980
 put on the candles to her we will see 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.410
 if they like to put a key so that 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.860
 open more doors during the year in all 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.430
 in my business and I work in health and 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.430
 I like it more 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:05.000
 so that the big door that brings me 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.069
 much health then the myths 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.160
 represent something it is not clear that the 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.380
 choose by choosing it with the color and 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.069
 chopped you can even see that mine 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.890
 has many without red tits yes and 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:25.460
 because the red ribbon of envy 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.460
 to bring a lot of friendship a lot of union 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.689
 prayer but mainly the hug the 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.609
 Friends hug good friends good 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:40.090
 relationships with family ties 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:43.900
 represent this union with your 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:46.209
 friends in your work with the family the 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.469
 cups has this harmonic symbology 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.469
 how decorates your Christmas tree 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.590
 I do not have anymore I have only as is 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.939
 written this ball in gold and in 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:07.269
 bronze 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:09.879
 I have to when we're going to cut the key 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.879
 we clarified by putting the tree together 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:15.099
 we are requesting and mentalizing everything 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:17.049
 that we want the little bells 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.120
 Campaigns are also very important 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.579
 because just in the bells I 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.070
 I do not come in symbolizes the call of the 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.310
 Jesus child but also protects us 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.460
 during the year with its sound going 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.390
 eliminating envy negative charge of the 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:37.080
 people who feed a bell 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.080
 in your tree 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.830
 I'll tell you important to have the 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.350
 gifts that he gives them is wrapped 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.420
 because it represents the divine embrace yes 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.520
 because they are simple because there is no 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.340
 little bit of commerce but you have 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:59.890
 mainly for children the gift 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:04.020
 the tree of realizations this to put 

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.020
 as gift boxes but empty 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:14.080
 when you discover the tree 18 of 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:16.240
 December and has appealed sometimes people 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.460
 put as a gift box but that 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.220
 they are empty but of ornament because 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.430
 I will be open to the relationship is to give 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:28.330
 not necessarily something material or something 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.310
 expensive but the symbolism of wrapping 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.500
 Although fear was not doing 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.819
 son of a gift is that it is nice to break 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:39.940
 this life paint already then the in it 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:48.250
 it does not matter that it's empty because we 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:49.900
 interest in civil closure and that is fine 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.800
 that's why it always happens at the bottom of the pin 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.800
 very even
