00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.100
 a couple of doctor and said we bring you 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.890
 because we got to live 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.710
 among other people and so we did 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.350
 between the time 2003 schedule and I 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.360
 before a description I will leave you 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.480
 the minutes of your channels so that 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.640
 preserve circumstance subscribe be 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.270
 Well I leave you with the tutor I hope that 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.270
 like it 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.970
 let's start the first thing they have to 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.160
 to do is go to the links that I left in 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.710
 the description and download these two 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.260
 files one is the pack and the other is the 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.210
 program to install the cars 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.129
 can install with another program if 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.680
 they want but I recommend this because 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.170
 it's easier and faster now they run the 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.479
 pack 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.880
 these are the channels of the people 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.670
 they helped me make the pack they give 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.479
 access to continue here read this and you 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.479
 they give to install 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.420
 inside the pack folder have 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.280
 shortcuts to subscribe to 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.429
 the channels den like to the pages 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.140
 of facebook and follow us on twitter xd the 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:36.780
 rest are folders that contain cars 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.330
 If you do not know how to install cars, now I'm going 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.520
 to teach I am going to install a kamaz 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.940
 but it is the same step for all 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.940
 cars 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.510
 run the gm 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.790
 read what it says is uploaded by the 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.460
 Caesar in the description I'm also going 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.290
 to leave the link of your channel now put 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.740
 search and look for your san's folder 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.740
 andreas 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.450
 and they give it to install to me I get this 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.450
 because I already have it 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.880
 now they go to your gta folder 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.180
 and this is the program if you want they can 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.490
 create a shortcut on the desktop 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.390
 not to go looking for it xd 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.390
 and open it 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.080
 and here they write the name of the car that 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.080
 want to replace 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.580
 I recommend that you click right and 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.460
 creative cap in case you want to go back to 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.310
 original car 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.810
 and then you can restore it here now 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.810
 they go to manual mode installer 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.400
 and they open the notebook that comes with 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.590
 the car 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.110
 now they have to paste these lines in 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.650
 its corresponding place within the gm 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:23.049
 this step is not 100% necessary but if 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.030
 they do not go they're going to die xd they 're not going to 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.620
 die but if some cars do not 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.159
 the tires are going to sink in the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.159
 asphalt 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.220
 and now they have to add the files 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.220
 of ff and txt 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.800
 now they give in style 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:20.600
 and they already have the car installed and ready 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.600
 to use it 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.010
 Now I'll explain anything x 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.620
 how will they see the names of the cars they 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.419
 repeat that is not a problem, you alone 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.250
 change read the name it brings for the 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.479
 Some car of the iv gta will be able to 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.479
 install without problems 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.580
 something else in the notebook of each 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.860
 auto have a description of the car and 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.539
 the credits to authors and publishers and 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.580
 they also have the three channels of 

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:58.270
 who participate in the creation of the 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.270
 pack xd 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.670
 I also put a photo so they know 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.530
 which will install how are many 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.720
 I leave you with some captures of 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.820

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.310

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.340
