they Saturday the 22nd of June and

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.759 
they Saturday the 22nd of June and
decided<00:00:17.619> to<00:00:17.680> mount<00:00:17.890> a<00:00:18.249> new<00:00:18.570> airmax<00:00:19.570> to<00:00:20.349> a<00:00:20.380> quad

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:20.769 
decided to mount a new airmax to a quad

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:23.279 
decided to mount a new airmax to a quad
and<00:00:20.980> see<00:00:21.279> how<00:00:21.429> she<00:00:21.490> performs<00:00:22.179> in<00:00:22.269> the<00:00:22.300> quad<00:00:22.599> so

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
and see how she performs in the quad so

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.499 
and see how she performs in the quad so
far<00:00:23.560> four<00:00:23.800> foot<00:00:24.009> launch<00:00:24.220> she's<00:00:24.880> awesome<00:00:25.119> she's

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
far four foot launch she's awesome she's

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.589 
far four foot launch she's awesome she's
quiet<00:00:26.109> starts<00:00:26.980> really<00:00:27.339> easy<00:00:27.609> really<00:00:28.150> smooth

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
quiet starts really easy really smooth

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.589 
quiet starts really easy really smooth
power<00:00:28.900> delivery<00:00:30.119> temperatures<00:00:31.119> are<00:00:31.329> good

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
power delivery temperatures are good

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.540 
power delivery temperatures are good
I've<00:00:32.140> also<00:00:32.320> got<00:00:32.590> a<00:00:32.619> temperature<00:00:33.010> gauge<00:00:33.310> on

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
I've also got a temperature gauge on

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.860 
I've also got a temperature gauge on
this<00:00:33.790> so<00:00:34.030> we'll<00:00:34.180> see<00:00:34.390> what<00:00:34.540> the<00:00:34.660> temperature

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
this so we'll see what the temperature

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.180 
this so we'll see what the temperature
is<00:00:35.310> while<00:00:36.310> it's<00:00:36.490> flying<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:37.900> quad<00:00:38.190> we

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
is while it's flying with the quad we

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.910 
is while it's flying with the quad we
have<00:00:39.400> the<00:00:39.730> size<00:00:40.180> 30<00:00:40.540> pair<00:00:41.020> of<00:00:41.140> toys<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.590> one<00:00:41.830> of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
have the size 30 pair of toys to one of

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.570 
have the size 30 pair of toys to one of
our<00:00:42.010> school<00:00:42.340> gliders<00:00:43.320> we'll<00:00:44.320> see<00:00:44.500> how<00:00:44.680> well<00:00:45.340> it

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
our school gliders we'll see how well it

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.850 
our school gliders we'll see how well it
does<00:00:45.760> with<00:00:46.030> that<00:00:46.060> glider<00:00:46.510> I'm<00:00:46.690> about<00:00:46.900> 165

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
does with that glider I'm about 165

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.150 
does with that glider I'm about 165
pounds<00:00:48.370> plus<00:00:48.910> the<00:00:48.970> quad<00:00:49.360> so<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.440> 30<00:00:50.710> should<00:00:50.950> be

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
pounds plus the quad so the 30 should be

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.390 
pounds plus the quad so the 30 should be
pretty<00:00:51.730> pretty<00:00:52.390> good<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.710> let's<00:00:53.860> go<00:00:54.010> give<00:00:54.220> it<00:00:54.250> a

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
pretty pretty good so let's go give it a

good about 220 pounds or less at a
reasonable<00:03:09.800> altitude<00:03:10.340> let's<00:03:10.580> say<00:03:10.760> 850<00:03:11.510> or

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750

less the purpose of the Air Max is

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.360 
less the purpose of the Air Max is
similar<00:03:14.750> to<00:03:14.959> that<00:03:15.080> of<00:03:15.140> the<00:03:15.290> 313<00:03:16.040> but<00:03:16.220> we've

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
similar to that of the 313 but we've

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.010 
similar to that of the 313 but we've
made<00:03:16.640> some<00:03:16.700> changes<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.450> Air<00:03:17.570> Max<00:03:17.810> is

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
made some changes the Air Max is

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.710 
made some changes the Air Max is
considerably<00:03:18.560> lighter<00:03:18.800> than<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.130> 313<00:03:19.790> starts

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
considerably lighter than the 313 starts

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.350 
considerably lighter than the 313 starts
much<00:03:21.080> easier<00:03:21.470> than<00:03:21.650> a<00:03:21.709> 313<00:03:22.490> and<00:03:22.670> provides

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
much easier than a 313 and provides

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.390 
much easier than a 313 and provides
about<00:03:23.630> the<00:03:23.780> same<00:03:24.020> power<00:03:24.320> but<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.130> great<00:03:25.370> thing

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
about the same power but the great thing

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.820 
about the same power but the great thing
about<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:26.060> is<00:03:26.240> is<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:27.020> can<00:03:27.200> put<00:03:27.380> it<00:03:27.470> on<00:03:27.560> rhino

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
about it is is you can put it on rhino

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.910 
about it is is you can put it on rhino
cage<00:03:28.190> you<00:03:28.640> can<00:03:28.790> put<00:03:28.940> on<00:03:29.030> a<00:03:29.060> quad<00:03:29.590> you<00:03:30.590> can<00:03:30.770> take

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
cage you can put on a quad you can take

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.770

convert from quad to foot launch or foot
launched<00:05:24.679> a<00:05:24.770> quad<00:05:25.009> it's<00:05:25.459> very<00:05:25.669> simple<00:05:26.089> it's

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
launched a quad it's very simple it's

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.480 
launched a quad it's very simple it's
approximately<00:05:26.809> four<00:05:27.110> bolts<00:05:27.499> and<00:05:27.680> plug<00:05:28.309> in
