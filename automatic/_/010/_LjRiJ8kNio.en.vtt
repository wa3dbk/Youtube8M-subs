whenever<00:04:13.209> you're<00:04:13.420> stitching<00:04:13.720> anything

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
whenever you're stitching anything

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.869 
whenever you're stitching anything
that's<00:04:14.349> circular<00:04:14.860> like<00:04:15.040> this<00:04:15.220> you<00:04:15.549> don't<00:04:15.730> want

00:04:15.869 --> 00:04:15.879 
that's circular like this you don't want

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:17.520 
that's circular like this you don't want
to<00:04:15.970> stitch<00:04:16.209> on<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.479> outside<00:04:16.959> okay<00:04:17.320> it's<00:04:17.440> gonna

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
to stitch on the outside okay it's gonna

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.050 
to stitch on the outside okay it's gonna
make<00:04:17.769> it<00:04:17.889> very<00:04:17.919> difficult<00:04:18.579> for<00:04:18.669> you<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.850> stitch

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
make it very difficult for you to stitch

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.460 
make it very difficult for you to stitch
so<00:04:19.239> what<00:04:19.389> you<00:04:19.479> want<00:04:19.630> to<00:04:19.690> do<00:04:19.780> is<00:04:19.900> stitch<00:04:20.109> on<00:04:20.320> the

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
so what you want to do is stitch on the

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.860 
so what you want to do is stitch on the
inside<00:04:20.979> of<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.370> circle<00:04:21.609> so<00:04:22.240> this<00:04:22.419> works<00:04:22.690> for

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
inside of the circle so this works for

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.650 
inside of the circle so this works for
pant<00:04:23.169> legs<00:04:23.500> or<00:04:23.889> wrists<00:04:24.639> from<00:04:24.790> shirts<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.419> same

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
pant legs or wrists from shirts the same

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.330 
pant legs or wrists from shirts the same
idea<00:04:25.990> goes<00:04:26.229> here<00:04:26.530> so<00:04:26.710> I'll<00:04:27.669> start<00:04:28.060> right<00:04:28.210> here

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
idea goes here so I'll start right here

idea goes here so I'll start right here
get<00:04:30.340> this<00:04:30.550> pin<00:04:30.850> out<00:04:30.970> of<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.120> way<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.750> as

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
get this pin out of the way and so as

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.390 
get this pin out of the way and so as
you<00:04:35.290> stitch<00:04:35.620> you're<00:04:35.919> just<00:04:36.070> gonna<00:04:36.160> keep

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
to stitch all the way through perfectly

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.659 
to stitch all the way through perfectly

okay next extent stop pull out my pin
and<00:04:46.419> I'm<00:04:46.539> still<00:04:46.780> going<00:04:46.930> in<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.080> circular<00:04:47.289> motion

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
and I'm still going in a circular motion

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.590 
and I'm still going in a circular motion
but<00:04:48.070> I<00:04:48.100> don't<00:04:48.370> have<00:04:48.430> to<00:04:48.580> fit<00:04:48.820> this<00:04:49.060> opening

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
but I don't have to fit this opening

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.360 
but I don't have to fit this opening
over<00:04:49.870> any<00:04:50.110> part<00:04:50.440> of<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.560> machine<00:04:50.860> okay<00:04:51.220> it's

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
over any part of the machine okay it's

00:04:51.370 --> 00:05:00.450 
over any part of the machine okay it's
still<00:04:51.520> gonna<00:04:51.699> stitch<00:04:51.940> fine<00:04:59.160> if<00:05:00.160> you<00:05:00.310> have

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
still gonna stitch fine if you have

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.629 
still gonna stitch fine if you have
never<00:05:00.639> stitched<00:05:01.180> before<00:05:01.780> with<00:05:02.650> knits<00:05:02.979> it's<00:05:03.550> a

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
never stitched before with knits it's a

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.860 
never stitched before with knits it's a
little<00:05:03.880> tricky<00:05:04.210> because<00:05:04.330> it's<00:05:04.570> stretching

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
little tricky because it's stretching

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.540 
little tricky because it's stretching
but<00:05:05.110> as<00:05:05.229> you<00:05:05.350> can<00:05:05.470> see<00:05:05.620> I'm<00:05:05.740> not<00:05:05.889> tugging<00:05:06.340> at

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:07.750 
the fabric okay you don't want to

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:10.430 
the fabric okay you don't want to
stretch<00:05:07.960> it<00:05:08.139> more
