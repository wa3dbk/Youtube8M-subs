00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
like it just came out of the showroom I

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.660 
like it just came out of the showroom I
think<00:00:57.059> once<00:00:57.329> James<00:00:57.660> found<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.559> cars<00:00:59.520> could

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
think once James found that cars could

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.760 
think once James found that cars could
be<00:00:59.789> cleaned<00:01:00.120> beautifully<00:01:01.050> without<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.379> drop<00:01:01.710> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
be cleaned beautifully without a drop of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.179 
be cleaned beautifully without a drop of
water<00:01:01.920> he<00:01:02.760> realized<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.650> technology

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
water he realized that this technology

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.710 
water he realized that this technology
could<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.460> brought<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> US<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.420> mean<00:01:06.570> there

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
could be brought to the US I mean there

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.719 
could be brought to the US I mean there
are<00:01:06.840> many<00:01:07.200> areas<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.710> growth<00:01:07.890> in<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> US<00:01:08.340> where

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
are many areas of growth in the US where

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.300 
are many areas of growth in the US where
municipal<00:01:09.689> governments<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.320> implementing

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
municipal governments are implementing

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.910 
municipal governments are implementing
regulations<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.270> what<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.320> can<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.710> cannot

do in terms of watching your car at home
so<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.350> interesting<00:01:16.470> instead<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.280> washing

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
so it's interesting instead of washing

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.370 
so it's interesting instead of washing
the<00:01:18.030> dirt<00:01:18.119> away<00:01:18.270> you're<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:18.750> lifting<00:01:19.259> it

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the dirt away you're actually lifting it

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.770 
the dirt away you're actually lifting it
off<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.500> car<00:01:19.890> yeah<00:01:20.729> that's<00:01:21.000> correct<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.540> you

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
off the car yeah that's correct if you

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.390 
off the car yeah that's correct if you
were<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.080> zoom<00:01:22.110> into<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.590> microfiber<00:01:23.100> towels

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
were to zoom into the microfiber towels

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.210 
were to zoom into the microfiber towels
they're<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.240> scoops<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.320> all<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
they're like little scoops so all the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
they're like little scoops so all the
dirt<00:01:26.400> gets<00:01:26.670> trapped<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.450> towels<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.080> away

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
dirt gets trapped in the towels and away

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.289 
dirt gets trapped in the towels and away
from<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.619> surface<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.310> won't<00:01:29.579> scratch<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
from the surface so it won't scratch the

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.090 
from the surface so it won't scratch the
surface<00:01:30.450> at<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.590> once<00:01:31.829> you're<00:01:31.979> done

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
surface at all and then once you're done

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.800 
surface at all and then once you're done
cleaning<00:01:32.430> your<00:01:32.640> car<00:01:32.880> just<00:01:33.299> toss<00:01:33.540> those

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
cleaning your car just toss those

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.420 
cleaning your car just toss those
microfiber<00:01:34.259> towels<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:35.070> washing<00:01:35.250> machine

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
microfiber towels in a washing machine

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.310 
microfiber towels in a washing machine
and<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.509> use<00:01:36.630> them<00:01:36.750> again<00:01:36.990> up<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.290> a

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
and then you can use them again up to a

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.960 
and then you can use them again up to a
hundred<00:01:37.470> times<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:38.250> were<00:01:38.430> impressed<00:01:38.670> by<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
hundred times we were impressed by the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.730 
hundred times we were impressed by the
product<00:01:39.329> line<00:01:39.420> because<00:01:39.689> one<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.200> really<00:01:40.350> works

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
product line because one it really works

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.350 
product line because one it really works
no<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.369> want<00:01:41.610> our<00:01:41.670> cars<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:41.970> look<00:01:42.240> like
