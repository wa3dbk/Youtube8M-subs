personality so Brown striking new looks
yeah<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:25.439> bet<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:27.259> ingenious<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:30.020> stronger

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

than<00:01:31.170> its<00:01:31.340> counterparts

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
than its counterparts

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.630 
than its counterparts
that's<00:01:34.390> beautiful<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:35.320> think<00:01:35.829> it<00:01:36.070> will<00:01:36.219> appeal

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
that's beautiful I think it will appeal

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.110 
that's beautiful I think it will appeal
to<00:01:36.670> both<00:01:36.880> men<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.390> women

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:39.120 
to both men and women

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.450 
to both men and women
I<00:01:39.150> think<00:01:39.870> this<00:01:40.050> up<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.350> potential<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:41.220> being

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
I think this up the potential of being

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.170 
I think this up the potential of being
maybe<00:01:42.330> one<00:01:42.660> of<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.870> most<00:01:43.520> economical<00:01:44.520> cars<00:01:44.850> in

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
maybe one of the most economical cars in

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.820 
maybe one of the most economical cars in
the<00:01:45.300> country<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.960> not<00:01:46.110> really<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> very<00:01:46.650> small

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
the country it's not really a very small

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.240 
the country it's not really a very small
cards<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:47.790> think<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.630> bigger<00:01:49.080> a<00:01:49.500> little<00:01:50.010> bit

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
cards I think it's bigger a little bit

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.820 
cards I think it's bigger a little bit
bigger<00:01:50.460> than<00:01:50.730> the<00:01:50.970> usual<00:01:51.480> subcompact<00:01:52.410> so<00:01:52.800> I

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
bigger than the usual subcompact so I

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.020 
bigger than the usual subcompact so I
think<00:01:52.950> this<00:01:53.220> will<00:01:53.400> appeal<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.850> lot<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
think this will appeal to a lot of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:06.800 
think this will appeal to a lot of
people<00:02:04.100> basically<00:02:05.100> connecting<00:02:06.090> with<00:02:06.510> the
