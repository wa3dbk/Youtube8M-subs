monitoring<00:03:58.970> system<00:03:59.299> is<00:03:59.419> that<00:03:59.599> the<00:04:00.409> days<00:04:00.650> of

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:00.979 
monitoring system is that the days of

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.909 
monitoring system is that the days of
going<00:04:01.430> 3,000<00:04:02.329> miles<00:04:02.510> or<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:03.799> know

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:03.919 
going 3,000 miles or you know

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.890 
going 3,000 miles or you know
thereabouts<00:04:04.609> of<00:04:04.909> getting<00:04:05.150> oil<00:04:05.299> changes<00:04:05.720> those

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
thereabouts of getting oil changes those

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.409 
thereabouts of getting oil changes those
days<00:04:06.079> are<00:04:06.199> over<00:04:06.970> what<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.060> oil<00:04:08.239> life

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:08.419 
days are over what the oil life

00:04:08.419 --> 00:04:09.789 
days are over what the oil life
monitoring<00:04:08.870> system<00:04:09.199> does<00:04:09.349> is<00:04:09.530> it<00:04:09.650> actually

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
monitoring system does is it actually

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.210 
monitoring system does is it actually
measures<00:04:10.159> the<00:04:10.970> thickness<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.870> quality<00:04:12.439> the

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
measures the thickness the quality the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.759 
measures the thickness the quality the
cleanliness<00:04:13.549> of<00:04:14.000> the<00:04:14.060> oil<00:04:14.389> it<00:04:14.900> will<00:04:15.139> tell<00:04:15.590> you

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
cleanliness of the oil it will tell you

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.080 
cleanliness of the oil it will tell you
when<00:04:15.919> you<00:04:16.039> need<00:04:16.070> to<00:04:16.190> change<00:04:16.459> it<00:04:16.669> accordingly

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
when you need to change it accordingly

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.029 
when you need to change it accordingly
so<00:04:17.419> if<00:04:17.539> you're<00:04:17.659> driving<00:04:17.810> all<00:04:18.139> highway<00:04:18.560> chances

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
so if you're driving all highway chances

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.409 
so if you're driving all highway chances
are<00:04:19.159> you're<00:04:19.310> going<00:04:19.430> to<00:04:19.519> be<00:04:19.639> able<00:04:19.729> to<00:04:19.849> go<00:04:20.029> quite

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
are you're going to be able to go quite

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.710 
are you're going to be able to go quite
a<00:04:20.450> ways<00:04:20.590> well

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
a ways well

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
a ways well
having<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.019> change<00:04:22.200> your<00:04:22.320> oil<00:04:22.350> if<00:04:22.650> you're

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
having to change your oil if you're

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.320 
having to change your oil if you're
doing<00:04:22.860> city<00:04:23.130> driving<00:04:23.400> you're<00:04:23.880> probably<00:04:24.150> gonna

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
doing city driving you're probably gonna

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:25.970 
doing city driving you're probably gonna
be<00:04:24.390> closer<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.930> that<00:04:25.050> three<00:04:25.320> to<00:04:25.410> four<00:04:25.620> thousand

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
be closer to that three to four thousand

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.040 
be closer to that three to four thousand
mark<00:04:28.970> Park<00:04:29.970> Assist<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:30.510> we<00:04:30.630> have<00:04:30.750> parking

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
mark Park Assist so we have parking

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.940 
mark Park Assist so we have parking
sensors<00:04:31.650> I<00:04:31.890> put<00:04:32.820> in<00:04:32.910> Reverse<00:04:33.090> as<00:04:33.510> well<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:34.800> can

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
sensors I put in Reverse as well you can

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.490 
sensors I put in Reverse as well you can
hear<00:04:35.160> the<00:04:35.280> parking<00:04:35.640> sensors<00:04:36.200> you've<00:04:37.200> also<00:04:37.320> got

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
hear the parking sensors you've also got

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.280 
hear the parking sensors you've also got
a<00:04:37.530> backup<00:04:37.800> cable<00:04:38.630> and<00:04:39.630> what's<00:04:39.810> really<00:04:40.110> really

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
a backup cable and what's really really

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.470 
a backup cable and what's really really
cool<00:04:40.440> that<00:04:40.590> I<00:04:40.620> think<00:04:40.950> is<00:04:41.220> that<00:04:41.580> you<00:04:42.120> see<00:04:42.330> these

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
cool that I think is that you see these

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.630 
cool that I think is that you see these
indicators<00:04:43.470> right<00:04:43.710> there<00:04:43.890> green<00:04:44.220> yellow<00:04:44.520> and

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
indicators right there green yellow and

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.640 
indicators right there green yellow and
red<00:04:44.820> and<00:04:45.750> then<00:04:45.870> right<00:04:46.080> here<00:04:46.320> on<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.470> bottom

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
red and then right here on the bottom

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.190 
red and then right here on the bottom
you<00:04:46.830> get<00:04:47.010> your<00:04:47.160> bumper<00:04:48.380> as<00:04:49.380> I<00:04:49.590> turn<00:04:49.920> the<00:04:50.130> wheel

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
you get your bumper as I turn the wheel

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:57.140 
you get your bumper as I turn the wheel
those<00:04:52.520> indicators<00:04:53.520> also<00:04:54.000> change<00:04:56.000> you<00:04:57.000> can<00:04:57.120> see

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
those indicators also change you can see

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.630 
those indicators also change you can see
there<00:04:57.480> so<00:04:57.690> what<00:04:58.290> that<00:04:58.560> does<00:04:58.830> is<00:04:58.890> while<00:04:59.460> you're

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
there so what that does is while you're

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.060 
there so what that does is while you're
in<00:04:59.760> Reverse<00:05:00.050> it<00:05:01.050> gives<00:05:01.260> you<00:05:01.410> your<00:05:01.560> directed

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
in Reverse it gives you your directed

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.640 
in Reverse it gives you your directed
path<00:05:02.540> by<00:05:03.540> your<00:05:03.690> current<00:05:04.020> holding<00:05:04.470> on<00:05:04.590> the

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
path by your current holding on the

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.740 
path by your current holding on the
steering<00:05:04.980> wheel<00:05:05.120> so<00:05:06.120> if<00:05:06.180> you're<00:05:06.300> backing<00:05:06.480> up

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
steering wheel so if you're backing up

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.240 
steering wheel so if you're backing up
into<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.960> tight<00:05:07.200> spot<00:05:07.440> you've<00:05:07.620> got<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:07.770> parallel

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
into a tight spot you've got a parallel

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.000 
into a tight spot you've got a parallel
park<00:05:08.660> you<00:05:09.660> know<00:05:09.870> exactly<00:05:10.410> okay<00:05:10.830> if<00:05:10.920> I'm

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
park you know exactly okay if I'm

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.890 
park you know exactly okay if I'm
holding<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:11.850> steering<00:05:12.090> wheel<00:05:12.300> right<00:05:12.480> here

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
holding the steering wheel right here

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.100 
holding the steering wheel right here
did<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:13.800> 180<00:05:14.550> on<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.000> steering<00:05:15.210> wheel<00:05:15.300> I'm

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
did a 180 on the steering wheel I'm

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.820 
did a 180 on the steering wheel I'm
gonna<00:05:16.320> be<00:05:16.440> headed<00:05:16.770> into<00:05:16.919> a<00:05:17.070> certain<00:05:17.430> direction

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.340 

go<00:05:22.830> back<00:05:23.360> you<00:05:24.360> can<00:05:24.510> switch<00:05:24.720> from<00:05:24.750> English<00:05:25.020> to

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:25.350 
go back you can switch from English to

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:27.830 
go back you can switch from English to
metric<00:05:25.470> units<00:05:26.220> if<00:05:26.340> you'd<00:05:26.460> like<00:05:26.640> also<00:05:27.630> gives

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 
metric units if you'd like also gives

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
you a digital tire read I'm not sure we

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.030 
you a digital tire read I'm not sure we
can<00:05:30.150> pick<00:05:30.300> that<00:05:30.419> up<00:05:30.480> on<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:30.750> camera<00:05:31.110> or<00:05:31.200> not<00:05:31.350> so
