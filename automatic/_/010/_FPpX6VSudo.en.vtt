00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.270 
did the whole thing themselves sent me
the<00:00:57.960> file<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:58.530> why<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.739> looks<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.160> little

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
the file that's why it looks a little

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.459 
the file that's why it looks a little
different<00:00:59.520> because<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.149> was<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:00.809> yo<00:01:01.109> shot<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
different because it was like yo shot a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.110 
different because it was like yo shot a
thick<00:01:01.739> but<00:01:01.890> full<00:01:02.129> screen<00:01:02.430> too<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> think<00:01:02.820> like

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
thick but full screen too I think like

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.939 
thick but full screen too I think like
we<00:01:03.210> shot<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.510> white<00:01:03.690> screen<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.559> we<00:01:04.710> had<00:01:04.830> to

we shot in white screen and we had to

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.770 
we shot in white screen and we had to
compress<00:01:05.339> like<00:01:05.580> compress<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.330> know<00:01:06.450> into

compress like compress it you know into

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.660 
compress like compress it you know into
the<00:01:06.930> editing<00:01:07.619> software<00:01:08.130> looks<00:01:08.430> like<00:01:08.549> they

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the editing software looks like they

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.670

going to be standing or anything no so
we<00:02:36.670> had<00:02:36.819> to<00:02:36.940> figure<00:02:37.060> out<00:02:37.180> like<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.660> whole

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
we had to figure out like the whole

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.180 
we had to figure out like the whole
thing<00:02:38.019> with<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> rat<00:02:38.410> rank<00:02:38.680> like<00:02:38.890> we<00:02:39.010> came<00:02:39.160> up

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
thing with the rat rank like we came up

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.270 
thing with the rat rank like we came up
with<00:02:39.459> ourselves<00:02:39.580> and<00:02:40.120> um<00:02:40.840> this<00:02:41.830> video<00:02:42.129> was

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
with ourselves and um this video was

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.280 
with ourselves and um this video was
hard<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.940> mean<00:02:43.180> I<00:02:43.269> actually<00:02:43.660> like<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.140> way<00:02:44.230> this

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
hard I mean I actually like the way this

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.320 
hard I mean I actually like the way this
video<00:02:44.530> turned<00:02:44.739> out<00:02:44.860> it<00:02:44.980> was<00:02:45.130> hard<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.400> do<00:02:46.150> it

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
video turned out it was hard to do it

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.539 
video turned out it was hard to do it
because<00:02:46.510> it<00:02:46.630> took<00:02:46.780> so<00:02:47.019> much<00:02:47.170> work<00:02:47.470> to<00:02:48.130> figure

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
because it took so much work to figure

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.309 
because it took so much work to figure
everything<00:02:48.610> out<00:02:48.970> because<00:02:49.750> like<00:02:49.810> it's<00:02:50.080> one<00:02:50.260> of

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
everything out because like it's one of

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.539 
everything out because like it's one of
the<00:02:50.380> first<00:02:50.500> videos<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.040> we<00:02:51.130> didn't<00:02:51.400> really

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
the first videos that we didn't really

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.309 
the first videos that we didn't really
have<00:02:51.970> anything<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.420> do<00:02:52.540> with<00:02:52.690> the<00:02:52.780> writing<00:02:53.049> or

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
have anything to do with the writing or

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.530 
have anything to do with the writing or
the<00:02:53.410> idea<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.489> we<00:02:54.640> sort<00:02:54.819> of<00:02:54.910> had<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.060> take

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
the idea so we sort of had to take

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.449 
the idea so we sort of had to take
somebody<00:02:56.260> else's<00:02:56.560> stuff<00:02:56.799> and<00:02:57.040> actually<00:02:57.130> make

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
somebody else's stuff and actually make

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.699 
somebody else's stuff and actually make
it<00:02:57.640> down<00:02:57.790> Murph<00:02:58.060> out<00:02:58.390> of<00:02:58.810> somebody<00:02:59.110> else's<00:02:59.440> it

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
it down Murph out of somebody else's it

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.550 
it down Murph out of somebody else's it
wasn't<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.430> difficult<00:03:00.489> it<00:03:01.420> was<00:03:01.599> just<00:03:01.840> the

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
wasn't that difficult it was just the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.960 
wasn't that difficult it was just the
hardest<00:03:03.010> stuff<00:03:03.250> was<00:03:03.400> figuring<00:03:03.700> out<00:03:03.730> where<00:03:03.940> to

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
hardest stuff was figuring out where to

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.240 
hardest stuff was figuring out where to
find<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.420> money<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.079> trying<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:06.010> figure<00:03:06.220> out

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
find the money and trying to figure out

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.009 
find the money and trying to figure out
how<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.400> pull<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.760> off<00:03:06.819> right<00:03:07.180> exactly<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:07.930> I

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
how to pull that off right exactly and I

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.120 
how to pull that off right exactly and I
was<00:03:08.140> like<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.380> mean<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.620> was<00:03:08.739> like<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:08.950> main

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
was like that mean I was like the main

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.650 
was like that mean I was like the main
like<00:03:09.489> those<00:03:09.640> like<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.910> bulk<00:03:10.120> of<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.360> movie

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
like those like the bulk of the movie

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.150

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
basically it was you looking for the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.920 
basically it was you looking for the
money<00:03:12.340> we<00:03:13.000> would<00:03:13.209> have<00:03:13.299> done<00:03:13.329> a<00:03:13.510> little<00:03:13.720> bit<00:03:13.870> of

to<00:03:35.889> actually<00:03:36.160> like<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.090> get<00:03:37.239> out<00:03:37.329> we<00:03:37.660> did

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
to actually like you get out we did

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.050 
to actually like you get out we did
that's<00:03:38.109> because<00:03:38.440> we<00:03:38.530> were<00:03:38.680> so<00:03:38.889> like<00:03:39.670> in<00:03:39.850> such<00:03:40.030> a

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
that's because we were so like in such a

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.849 
that's because we were so like in such a
run<00:03:40.389> over<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.780> job<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.470> we<00:03:41.560> didn't<00:03:41.829> have

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859 
run over that job that we didn't have

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.009 
run over that job that we didn't have
much<00:03:42.190> inspiration<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.880> do<00:03:43.090> stuff<00:03:43.450> that's<00:03:43.630> why

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
much inspiration to do stuff that's why

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.960 
much inspiration to do stuff that's why
there's<00:03:44.200> so<00:03:44.319> many<00:03:44.410> videos<00:03:44.769> lately<00:03:45.010> cuz<00:03:45.819> like

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970
