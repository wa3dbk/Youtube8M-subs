00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
a 45 degree angle you don't want to have

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.760 
a 45 degree angle you don't want to have
too<00:00:48.329> much<00:00:48.510> line<00:00:48.719> out<00:00:48.899> where<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.200> bottom

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
too much line out where the bottom

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.619 
too much line out where the bottom
bouncer<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.130> going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.399> lay<00:00:50.550> down<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.360> make<00:00:51.600> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
bouncer is going to lay down but make it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.020 
bouncer is going to lay down but make it
run<00:00:51.899> at<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.440> angle<00:00:52.980> so<00:00:53.550> that<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> bottom

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
run at this on angle so that the bottom

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.299 
run at this on angle so that the bottom
ticks<00:00:54.719> bottom<00:00:55.140> just<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.500> it's<00:00:55.680> designed<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
ticks bottom just as it's designed and

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.760 
ticks bottom just as it's designed and
then<00:00:56.730> your<00:00:56.879> harness<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.629> run<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.110> few

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
then your harness is going to run a few

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.650 
then your harness is going to run a few
inches<00:00:58.980> above<00:00:59.340> bottom<00:00:59.610> rate<00:01:00.360> where<00:01:00.539> those

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
inches above bottom rate where those

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.209 
inches above bottom rate where those
walleye<00:01:00.960> are<00:01:01.110> sitting<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.800> if<00:01:01.890> you're<00:01:02.039> having

walleye are sitting so if you're having

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.369 
walleye are sitting so if you're having
trouble<00:01:02.399> maintaining<00:01:03.059> bottom<00:01:03.870> at<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.140> angle

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
trouble maintaining bottom at that angle

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.440 
trouble maintaining bottom at that angle
if<00:01:04.589> you're<00:01:04.710> needing<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.309> way<00:01:05.640> out<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> 60

hitting<00:01:09.000> bottom<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.080> either<00:01:10.200> need<00:01:10.470> to

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
hitting bottom then you either need to

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.859 
hitting bottom then you either need to
slow<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.040> boat<00:01:11.190> down<00:01:11.250> or<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.240> need<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.420> get<00:01:12.810> a

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
bottom bouncer is this worm harness and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.780 
bottom bouncer is this worm harness and
this<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.710> essentially<00:01:41.189> as<00:01:41.280> what<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.580> worm

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
this is essentially as what as a worm

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.770 
this is essentially as what as a worm
harness<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.180> he's<00:01:42.270> come<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.600> all<00:01:42.750> different

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
harness so he's come in all different

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.950 
harness so he's come in all different
sizes<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.770> shapes<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.310> looks<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.630> this<00:01:45.780> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
sizes and shapes and looks but this is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.480 
sizes and shapes and looks but this is
basically<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.650> is<00:01:46.770> you've<00:01:47.009> got<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> blade

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
basically what it is you've got a blade

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.149 
basically what it is you've got a blade
with<00:01:48.119> some<00:01:48.329> beads<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.869> typically<00:01:49.619> two<00:01:49.860> hooks

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
with some beads and typically two hooks

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.399 
with some beads and typically two hooks
behind<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.759> he<00:01:51.150> would<00:01:51.270> threaten<00:01:51.479> it--<00:01:52.079> crawler

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
behind it he would threaten it-- crawler

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.039 
behind it he would threaten it-- crawler
or<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.890> worm<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.400> those<00:01:53.610> hooks<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.180> then<00:01:54.780> this

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
or a worm on those hooks and then this

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.080 
or a worm on those hooks and then this
as<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.530> troll<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.310> gonna<00:01:56.460> spin<00:01:56.790> and

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
as you troll this is just gonna spin and

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.969 
as you troll this is just gonna spin and
it's<00:01:57.509> gonna<00:01:57.659> spin<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.110> lift<00:01:58.290> up<00:01:58.470> a<00:01:58.619> little<00:01:58.740> bit

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
it's gonna spin and lift up a little bit

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.530 
it's gonna spin and lift up a little bit
that<00:01:59.159> blades<00:01:59.460> gonna<00:01:59.579> cause<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> little<00:02:00.329> bit<00:02:00.450> of

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
that blades gonna cause a little bit of

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.870 
that blades gonna cause a little bit of
lift<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.079> you're<00:02:01.170> gonna<00:02:01.259> run<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.619> above<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
lift so you're gonna run just above the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.660 
lift so you're gonna run just above the
bouncer<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.899> for<00:02:04.140> rigging<00:02:04.320> options<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.490> want

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
bouncer so for rigging options you want

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.580 
bouncer so for rigging options you want
to<00:02:05.759> either<00:02:05.909> use<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> live<00:02:06.450> night<00:02:06.750> crawler<00:02:07.049> or

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
to either use a live night crawler or

to either use a live night crawler or
there's<00:02:08.009> great<00:02:08.129> artificial<00:02:08.819> options<00:02:09.149> such<00:02:09.359> as

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:09.389 
there's great artificial options such as

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.089 
there's great artificial options such as
the<00:02:09.659> trigger<00:02:10.049> X<00:02:10.319> worm<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.889> that<00:02:11.370> actually<00:02:11.790> has

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:12.099 
the trigger X worm and that actually has

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:13.559 
the trigger X worm and that actually has
been<00:02:12.249> really<00:02:12.700> effective<00:02:12.909> for<00:02:13.269> us<00:02:13.390> especially

been really effective for us especially

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.330 
been really effective for us especially
a<00:02:14.019> little<00:02:14.290> bit<00:02:14.409> later<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:14.769> season<00:02:15.219> when

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
a little bit later in the season when

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.830 
a little bit later in the season when

worm has been very effective in catching

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.949 
worm has been very effective in catching
walleye<00:02:20.829> and<00:02:21.249> keeping<00:02:21.939> those<00:02:22.090> those<00:02:22.749> perch

from stealing that we're on you when
this<00:02:24.939> is<00:02:24.999> best<00:02:25.359> utilized<00:02:25.599> is<00:02:26.109> when<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
this is best utilized is when the

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.110 
this is best utilized is when the
walleye<00:02:26.590> are<00:02:26.859> really<00:02:27.129> hugging<00:02:27.400> bottom

walleye are really hugging bottom

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.119 
walleye are really hugging bottom
so<00:02:28.359> you'll<00:02:28.510> notice<00:02:28.780> arcs<00:02:29.349> on<00:02:29.500> your<00:02:29.620> sonar<00:02:29.980> that

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
so you'll notice arcs on your sonar that

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:31.920 
so you'll notice arcs on your sonar that
are<00:02:30.250> right<00:02:30.400> tight<00:02:30.639> to<00:02:30.790> bottom<00:02:31.120> or<00:02:31.510> you're<00:02:31.750> just

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
are right tight to bottom or you're just

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.330 
are right tight to bottom or you're just
not<00:02:32.049> catching<00:02:32.260> them<00:02:32.530> anywhere<00:02:32.829> else<00:02:33.010> in<00:02:33.250> the
