00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
factors there come into play when you're

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.920 
factors there come into play when you're
going<00:03:53.580> into<00:03:53.820> train<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.180> deadlift<00:03:54.510> in<00:03:54.660> the<00:03:54.720> gym

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.630 
pull that 320 kgs or c 105 pounds
basically<00:04:01.560> what<00:04:01.710> was<00:04:01.860> going<00:04:02.070> on<00:04:02.190> like<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.520> was

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
basically what was going on like it was

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.910 
basically what was going on like it was
a<00:04:02.670> pretty<00:04:03.240> pretty<00:04:03.630> standard<00:04:04.110> gym<00:04:04.290> bar<00:04:04.530> you've

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
a pretty pretty standard gym bar you've

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.330 
a pretty pretty standard gym bar you've
got<00:04:05.130> thicker<00:04:05.540> black<00:04:06.540> rubber<00:04:06.780> plates<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:07.440> so

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
got thicker black rubber plates and so

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.950 
got thicker black rubber plates and so
it<00:04:08.430> gives<00:04:08.550> the<00:04:08.760> bar<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:08.970> lot<00:04:09.270> more<00:04:09.480> work<00:04:09.750> then

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:09.960 
it gives the bar a lot more work then

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.640 
it gives the bar a lot more work then
than<00:04:10.410> usual<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.330> which<00:04:12.330> in<00:04:12.600> tuned<00:04:12.870> for<00:04:13.470> some

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
than usual and which in tuned for some

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.050 
than usual and which in tuned for some
lift<00:04:13.860> has<00:04:13.980> allows<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.430> lift<00:04:14.640> a<00:04:14.730> bit<00:04:14.910> more

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
lift has allows you to lift a bit more

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.360 
lift has allows you to lift a bit more
and<00:04:15.360> in<00:04:15.840> this<00:04:15.960> case<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.590> that<00:04:16.830> did<00:04:17.070> allow<00:04:17.340> me

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
and in this case and that did allow me

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.060 
and in this case and that did allow me
looked<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.790> bit<00:04:17.820> more<00:04:18.120> and<00:04:18.799> basically<00:04:19.799> that's

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
looked a bit more and basically that's

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.030 
looked a bit more and basically that's
why<00:04:20.660> 220<00:04:21.660> cages<00:04:21.989> went<00:04:22.200> out<00:04:22.290> that<00:04:22.440> day<00:04:22.650> whereas

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
why 220 cages went out that day whereas

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.600 
why 220 cages went out that day whereas
if<00:04:23.670> I<00:04:23.880> was<00:04:24.030> on<00:04:24.150> a<00:04:24.210> nice<00:04:24.390> early<00:04:24.570> Cobar<00:04:25.110> with<00:04:25.610> thin
