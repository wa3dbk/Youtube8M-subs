DJ archer and anthony pepe two very

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.990 
DJ archer and anthony pepe two very
determined<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.050> talented<00:01:02.559> players<00:01:02.860> but<00:01:03.790> two

determined and talented players but two

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.969 
determined and talented players but two
very<00:01:04.330> different<00:01:04.720> types<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.470> players<00:01:05.710> their

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
very different types of players their

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.490 
very different types of players their

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
styles are extremely different and they

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.660 
styles are extremely different and they
wanted<00:01:08.740> two<00:01:08.860> different<00:01:08.890> length<00:01:09.250> conditions
