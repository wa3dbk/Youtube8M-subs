00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:16.009
 green or green in assets 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:16.009
 it's too much for me it's like oh my god 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.320
 so like that 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.440
 ah 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.440
 all right 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.610
 ear that is not sitting as a person 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.440
 before, the distance is incredible 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.740
 It is very fast 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:33.220
 down the building 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.020
 it almost seems like a decision point 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.320
 is incredible 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.400
 because I'm lacking in everything but I still 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:05.120
 this reason that you are going to have 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:05.120
 clear last place 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.689
 be part 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.019
 the fifth movement but with humor 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.019
 you know 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.400
 or as simple already then it's fine 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.739
 as well 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.390
 and I was throwing one and another where I've 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.050
 played 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.370
 down here because I'm cool this already 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.430
 it seems easier 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.739
 seen here is worth 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.090
 5th, not you, now I'm playing for 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.569
 down the bridges were points for 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.569
 down before 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.049
 fifty 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.040
 with that you know there were 50,000 levels 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.650
 let's go now 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.480
 because the front plus stars I do not 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.030
 I know for real but that I think the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.730
 career should have more slipstream god 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.750
 almost almost landed and as you know by 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:17.170
 catch 50 points suddenly 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.170
 how do you play it man of theme two more 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.670
 it's worth either good or I do not deserve 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.780
 be last economic being the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.390
 same is not this 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.330
 and the fifth interesting friend topic 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.510

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.480

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.900
 and is that I have dominant if we repeat the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.190
 race after we go there was less one 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.740
 more than first that 's before the last 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.950
 eye if I'm so good that I turn around and 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.950
