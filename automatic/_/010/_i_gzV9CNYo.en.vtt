my first one at the gap which I showed

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.030 
my first one at the gap which I showed
in<00:00:09.120> my<00:00:09.150> previous<00:00:09.420> collective<00:00:10.320> haul<00:00:10.559> they're

just so freeing and simple to top it off
I<00:00:13.259> also<00:00:13.679> discovered<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.370> you<00:00:14.460> can<00:00:14.610> tie<00:00:14.759> up<00:00:14.910> a

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
I also discovered that you can tie up a

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.790 
I also discovered that you can tie up a
maxi<00:00:15.330> skirt<00:00:15.360> or<00:00:15.719> dress<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.590> great

maxi skirt or dress this is great

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.410 
maxi skirt or dress this is great
because<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.070> makes<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.460> versatile<00:00:17.910> also<00:00:18.300> if

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
because it makes it so versatile also if

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.120 
because it makes it so versatile also if
you're<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> short<00:00:18.990> like<00:00:19.170> myself<00:00:19.439> then<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:20.010> helps

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
you're a short like myself then it helps

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.759 
you're a short like myself then it helps
a<00:00:20.400> maxi<00:00:21.090> skirt<00:00:21.119> or<00:00:21.539> maxi<00:00:22.170> dress<00:00:22.410> become<00:00:22.740> a

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
a maxi skirt or maxi dress become a

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.200 
a maxi skirt or maxi dress become a
little<00:00:22.980> bit<00:00:23.160> shorter<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.640> doesn't<00:00:23.850> drag<00:00:24.029> on

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
little bit shorter so it doesn't drag on

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.759 
little bit shorter so it doesn't drag on
the<00:00:24.300> ground<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.900> led<00:00:25.109> me<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.410> search<00:00:25.590> the
