cooling fan circuit which is quite a
high<00:01:55.880> current<00:01:56.180> draw<00:01:56.570> and<00:01:57.010> it<00:01:58.010> nearly<00:01:58.250> caught

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
high current draw and it nearly caught

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.480 
high current draw and it nearly caught
fire<00:01:58.730> as<00:01:58.910> you<00:01:58.970> can<00:01:59.300> see
