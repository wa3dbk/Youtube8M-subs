00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.469
 How are you 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.389
 Jose of the most suitable packaging is 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.240
 Easy to bring your temperature always 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.160
 It is the correct neither hot nor cold 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.289
 it's just perfect and the best is 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.380
 that does not cost is free is milk 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:27.730
 breastfeeding my baby 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:31.749
 because if it is really cool because it creates 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.910
 very special links with you with your 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:36.309
 son not with your baby is the best inheritance 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.589
 because you are protecting it from 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.790
 diseases you are protecting it from 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.890
 allergies 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.290

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.780
 Erika gave birth through a cesarean 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.239
 after delivery, it took approximately one 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.190
 week to produce breast milk for 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.470
 about a week ago I was 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.660
 giving him formula milk trying to 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:00.010
 alternate the mother's breast because it 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:02.320
 obviously I did not have this milk 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.869
 naturally as in a delivery 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.770
 natural because if I felt despair for 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.140
 what 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.090
 formula milk began to provoke 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.079
 many cramps and cried a lot 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.729
 precisely for that reason and then he told me 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.939
 precisely the doctor who to the extent 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:23.149
 that will start to drink breast milk 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.920
 they would reduce cramping the 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.899
 world health organization and 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.729
 various specialists recommend how 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:31.100
 only food during the first six 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.799
 months of life the breast milk between 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.719
 Other benefits highlight that by giving 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.869
 maternal breast contracts the uterus 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:41.720
 bleeding at that time would decrease to 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.390
 Chest ossum physiological stimulus 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.340
 hormone in addition and that will go down 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.590
 I lost 23 kilos what good 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.860
 I was eternally grateful to decrease the 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.709
 possibility of long - term diabetes 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.030
 breast and ovarian and breast cancer 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.750
 maternal 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.520
 besides that the affective relationship with 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.369
 the child becomes really close 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.890
 The real benefit is that the mother can 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.980
 go through that mother's womb 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.230
 wonderful milk antibodies against 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.390
 virus fungal bacteria and parasites 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.910
 when you are going to see a formula 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.530
 with this among the risks so that 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.170
 mothers stop breastfeeding their children 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.060
 are the myths return to work the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.400
 discomfort of riding during the first 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.320
 days the low milk production and the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.200
 lack of support from their companies between 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.739
 others breastfeeding in Mexico 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.590
 is suffering a crisis of several 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.480
 decades to this day one of 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.040
 the most worrying points is that the 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.380
 prayer unity health recommends 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.180
 breastfeeding during the first 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.780
 six months 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.060
 and we are at 22 percent a 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.799
 nationwide level 22 percent 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.750
 of the mothers are fed and arrive at 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:59.150
 6 - month target mothers 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.439
 workers make an effort either 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.900
 for breastfeeding before going and 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.819
 return or even to extract their 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.519
 milk at your workplace for 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.340
 leave your baby's milk and there we have 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.349
 a law that was approved in a proposal 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.219
 of law that was passed in the chamber of 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.730
 deputies 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:19.519
 a year ago promoted by the deputy 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.939
 heladio verver who is the mother 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.519
 worker must receive support from 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:28.909
 one hour of lactation that is entitled 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:31.310
 either before or after your time of 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.680
 entrance enter an hour later or it came out 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.620
 an hour before and something very interesting 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.900
 have a place worth extracting from 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.790
 milk today many moms are quit 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.859
 milk in the bathroom despite 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.000
 adversities there are those who achieve the objective 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:49.230
 as breast milk or continue to 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.620
 6 months or so and there was no 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.330
 back and that gave him formula I 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.940
 they took out the milk, that is, had an hour 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.280
 to get me in the milk so that 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.200
 that it will leave her I do not know who 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.940
 my little one takes care of me but he left her 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.379
 his milk and keep taking or 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.989
 during the first six months that you 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:08.560
 I say this his life was taking the 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.720
 little girls
