okay my name is Charlie technician with

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.610 
okay my name is Charlie technician with
Providence<00:00:06.600> security<00:00:07.200> I've<00:00:07.290> been<00:00:07.439> with<00:00:07.559> the

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
Providence security I've been with the

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.879 
Providence security I've been with the
company<00:00:07.740> for<00:00:07.979> about<00:00:08.160> two<00:00:08.460> years<00:00:09.680> today<00:00:10.680> we're

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
company for about two years today we're

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.510 
company for about two years today we're
going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.099> try<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.429> demonstrate<00:00:11.970> how<00:00:12.360> to

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:13.520 
going to try and demonstrate how to

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.099 
going to try and demonstrate how to
remove<00:00:14.520> a<00:00:14.880> zone<00:00:15.090> from<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.390> system<00:00:15.810> so<00:00:15.840> you<00:00:16.019> can

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
remove a zone from the system so you can

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.029 
remove a zone from the system so you can
arm<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.650> system<00:00:18.380> assuming<00:00:19.380> we<00:00:19.650> want<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.920> have

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
arm the system assuming we want to have

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.370 
arm the system assuming we want to have
a<00:00:20.070> window<00:00:20.430> open<00:00:20.760> on<00:00:20.940> a<00:00:21.030> hot<00:00:21.660> summer<00:00:21.900> day<00:00:22.080> and

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
a window open on a hot summer day and

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.550 
a window open on a hot summer day and
still<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:23.670> alarm<00:00:24.119> system<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.230> what<00:00:25.440> we're

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
still on the alarm system so what we're

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.689 
still on the alarm system so what we're
going<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.710> do<00:00:25.860> is<00:00:26.070> we're<00:00:26.250> going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.430> attempt<00:00:26.640> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
going to do is we're going to attempt to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.630 
going to do is we're going to attempt to
bypass<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.449> zone<00:00:28.100> so<00:00:29.100> the<00:00:29.220> first<00:00:29.430> thing<00:00:29.550> we

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
bypass that zone so the first thing we

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.010 
bypass that zone so the first thing we
need<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.090> find<00:00:30.300> out<00:00:30.420> what<00:00:30.600> the<00:00:30.810> zone

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 
need to do is find out what the zone

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.830 
need to do is find out what the zone
number<00:00:31.770> is<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.309> need<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.460> bypass<00:00:32.910> we<00:00:33.690> do

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
number is that we need to bypass we do

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.950 
number is that we need to bypass we do
that<00:00:33.989> by<00:00:34.199> pressing<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.739> star<00:00:35.010> button<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
that by pressing the star button and the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.579 
that by pressing the star button and the
star<00:00:37.199> button<00:00:37.469> will<00:00:37.620> display<00:00:39.109> the<00:00:40.109> zones<00:00:40.350> which

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
star button will display the zones which

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.799 
star button will display the zones which
are<00:00:40.710> faulted<00:00:41.159> right<00:00:41.309> now<00:00:41.460> we<00:00:41.579> see<00:00:41.879> zone<00:00:42.510> zero

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
are faulted right now we see zone zero

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.860 
are faulted right now we see zone zero
zero<00:00:43.050> nine<00:00:43.109> is<00:00:43.469> faulted<00:00:44.359> so<00:00:45.359> all<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.600> have<00:00:45.749> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
zero nine is faulted so all we have to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.779 
zero nine is faulted so all we have to
do<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.229> order<00:00:46.409> to<00:00:46.469> bypass<00:00:46.859> that<00:00:47.129> zone<00:00:47.429> is<00:00:47.579> type

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
do in order to bypass that zone is type

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.270 
do in order to bypass that zone is type
in<00:00:47.940> our<00:00:47.999> code<00:00:48.239> which<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.960> one<00:00:49.139> two<00:00:49.409> three<00:00:49.829> four

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.459 
in our code which is one two three four
and<00:00:50.519> the<00:00:51.059> number<00:00:51.089> six<00:00:51.659> button<00:00:52.019> which<00:00:52.139> is<00:00:52.170> also

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and the number six button which is also

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.799 
and the number six button which is also
the<00:00:52.649> bypass<00:00:53.069> key<00:00:53.339> and<00:00:53.639> the<00:00:54.149> three<00:00:54.449> digit

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the bypass key and the three digit

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.629 
the bypass key and the three digit
number<00:00:55.109> of<00:00:55.319> the<00:00:55.499> zone<00:00:55.679> we<00:00:55.799> want<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.159> bypass

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:56.639 
number of the zone we want to bypass

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:59.899 
number of the zone we want to bypass
which<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.449> zero<00:00:57.659> zero<00:00:58.049> nine<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:59.159> then<00:00:59.699> we<00:00:59.789> hear

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
which is zero zero nine and then we hear

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.520 
which is zero zero nine and then we hear
a<00:00:59.969> being<00:01:00.389> which<00:01:00.659> tells<00:01:00.929> us<00:01:01.049> we've<00:01:01.229> done<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
a being which tells us we've done the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.399 
a being which tells us we've done the
right<00:01:01.649> thing<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:03.059> also<00:01:03.209> displays<00:01:03.809> bypass

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
right thing and it also displays bypass

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.490 
right thing and it also displays bypass
on<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.159> elements<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.210> bypassed<00:01:06.659> now<00:01:07.440> we

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
on the is elements to be bypassed now we

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.680 
on the is elements to be bypassed now we
have<00:01:07.770> our<00:01:07.950> green<00:01:08.220> light<00:01:08.400> when<00:01:08.970> nobody's

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
have our green light when nobody's

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.660 
have our green light when nobody's
walking<00:01:10.020> in<00:01:10.110> front<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.350> motion<00:01:10.620> detectors<00:01:11.040> and

walking in front of motion detectors and
we<00:01:11.910> can<00:01:12.060> activate<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.870> alarm<00:01:13.020> system<00:01:13.380> okay

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
we can activate the alarm system okay

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:24.140 
we can activate the alarm system okay
and<00:01:15.710> you<00:01:16.710> wait<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:20.510> then<00:01:21.650> we<00:01:22.910> deactivate<00:01:23.910> you

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and you wait and then we deactivate you

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.740 
and you wait and then we deactivate you
are<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:25.740> will<00:01:25.950> clear<00:01:26.250> all<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.640> bypasses<00:01:27.300> and

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
are it will clear all the bypasses and

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.600 
are it will clear all the bypasses and
we<00:01:28.200> can<00:01:28.350> see<00:01:28.530> that<00:01:28.680> again<00:01:28.830> by<00:01:29.100> pressing<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
we can see that again by pressing the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.580 
we can see that again by pressing the
start<00:01:29.910> that<00:01:30.300> we<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.570> our<00:01:30.720> fault<00:01:31.050> back<00:01:31.260> again

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
start that we have our fault back again

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.750 
start that we have our fault back again
and<00:01:31.770> no<00:01:32.160> green<00:01:32.430> light<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.970> alarm<00:01:33.300> on<00:01:34.760> the

and no green light on the alarm on the
touch<00:01:35.970> screen<00:01:36.240> it's<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.480> little<00:01:36.690> bit<00:01:36.810> more

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
touch screen it's a little bit more

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.920 
touch screen it's a little bit more
simple<00:01:37.880> we'll<00:01:38.880> go<00:01:39.030> into<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.300> security<00:01:39.600> tab

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
simple we'll go into the security tab

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.240 
simple we'll go into the security tab
and<00:01:40.260> then<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.430> just<00:01:41.580> display<00:01:41.970> false<00:01:42.390> and

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
and then we can just display false and

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.060 
and then we can just display false and
then<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.400> will<00:01:44.580> show<00:01:44.790> us<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:46.650> backhaul

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
then this will show us that the backhaul

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.359 
then this will show us that the backhaul
door<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.580> this

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
door is this

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.940 
door is this

0:09 fault we wish to bypass that we can

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.350 
0:09 fault we wish to bypass that we can
actually<00:01:52.100> just<00:01:53.500> select<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.770> zone<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.360> then

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
actually just select the zone and then

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.609 
actually just select the zone and then
press<00:01:56.659> bypass<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:58.659> then<00:01:59.659> enter<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.020> code<00:02:00.320> one

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
press bypass and then enter a code one

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.859 
press bypass and then enter a code one
two<00:02:00.920> three<00:02:01.340> four<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.680> will<00:02:03.770> accept<00:02:04.100> it<00:02:04.310> and

two three four and it will accept it and
then<00:02:05.869> we<00:02:06.289> have<00:02:06.440> our<00:02:06.560> green<00:02:06.799> light<00:02:06.979> yet<00:02:07.280> again

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
then we have our green light yet again
