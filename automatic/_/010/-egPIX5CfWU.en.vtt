I thought that this fail was appropriate

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.120 
I thought that this fail was appropriate
for<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.700> level<00:03:19.090> of<00:03:19.239> fear<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.510> had

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
for the level of fear that had

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.520 
for the level of fear that had
