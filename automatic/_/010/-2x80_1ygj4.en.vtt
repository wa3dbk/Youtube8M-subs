00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
if I'm going to predict two things about

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.719 
if I'm going to predict two things about
this<00:01:48.689> game<00:01:49.020> it's<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.770> Fellaini<00:01:50.220> was<00:01:50.520> gonna

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
this game it's that Fellaini was gonna

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.539 
this game it's that Fellaini was gonna
start<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.360> adnan<00:01:52.020> was<00:01:52.560> gonna<00:01:52.770> start<00:01:53.130> as<00:01:53.310> well

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
start and adnan was gonna start as well

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.609 
start and adnan was gonna start as well
now<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.149> reason<00:01:54.329> why<00:01:54.540> i<00:01:54.570> predicted<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.409> was

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
now the reason why i predicted that was

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.499 
now the reason why i predicted that was
thought<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.579> common<00:01:56.850> sense<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.360> well

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
thought it was common sense really well

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.510 
thought it was common sense really well
olympiakos<00:01:58.200> Champions<00:01:58.740> League<00:01:58.890> during<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
olympiakos Champions League during the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.209 
olympiakos Champions League during the
week<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.810> I<00:02:00.869> didn't<00:02:01.140> think<00:02:01.259> at<00:02:01.530> Fellaini<00:02:02.040> was

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
week so I didn't think at Fellaini was

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.069 
week so I didn't think at Fellaini was
gonna<00:02:02.399> start<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.060> being<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.540> he<00:02:03.810> hasn't

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
gonna start in that being that he hasn't

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.690 
gonna start in that being that he hasn't
had<00:02:04.350> many<00:02:04.530> minutes<00:02:04.979> and<00:02:05.159> what<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> good<00:02:05.520> way<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
had many minutes and what a good way to

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.490 
had many minutes and what a good way to
get<00:02:05.969> minutes<00:02:06.270> into<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.600> game<00:02:06.869> so<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.350> thought

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
get minutes into this game so I thought

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.809 
get minutes into this game so I thought
that's<00:02:07.680> why<00:02:07.829> Fellaini<00:02:08.190> would<00:02:08.369> start<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
that's why Fellaini would start and

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.880 
that's why Fellaini would start and
Adnan<00:02:09.450> he's<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.869> always<00:02:10.020> really<00:02:10.289> tricky<00:02:10.709> and

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
Adnan he's just always really tricky and

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.520 
Adnan he's just always really tricky and
again<00:02:11.190> I<00:02:11.370> think<00:02:11.550> Valencia<00:02:12.209> was<00:02:12.420> start<00:02:12.750> again

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
again I think Valencia was start again

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.500 
again I think Valencia was start again
olympiakos<00:02:14.130> that's<00:02:14.370> why<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.550> reckon<00:02:14.970> Moyes

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
olympiakos that's why I reckon Moyes

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.510 
olympiakos that's why I reckon Moyes
wants<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.870> bring<00:02:16.050> in<00:02:16.200> Edna<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.069> way<00:02:17.250> we

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
wants to bring in Edna but the way we

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.730 
wants to bring in Edna but the way we
paid<00:02:17.850> in<00:02:18.060> this<00:02:18.240> game<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.780> think<00:02:19.230> more<00:02:19.410> is<00:02:19.500> got<00:02:19.709> a

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
paid in this game I think more is got a

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.990 
paid in this game I think more is got a
few<00:02:19.950> things<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.220> think<00:02:20.310> about<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:20.940> that

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
few things to think about but that

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.930 
few things to think about but that
olympiakos<00:02:21.690> game<00:02:21.900> maybe<00:02:22.560> Fellaini<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.490> adnan

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
olympiakos game maybe Fellaini and adnan

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.270 
olympiakos game maybe Fellaini and adnan
both<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.750> start<00:02:25.050> against<00:02:25.500> Olympiakos<00:02:26.100> as

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
both can start against Olympiakos as

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.820 
both can start against Olympiakos as
