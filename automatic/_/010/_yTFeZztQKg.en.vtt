been my pride and joy ever since in its
early<00:01:22.930> nineteen<00:01:23.409> eighty<00:01:23.590> one<00:01:23.740> I<00:01:23.950> used<00:01:24.310> to<00:01:24.460> do

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
early nineteen eighty one I used to do

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.279 
early nineteen eighty one I used to do
conchords<00:01:25.420> but<00:01:26.170> now<00:01:26.380> I<00:01:26.830> decided<00:01:27.670> that<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:29.080> a

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
conchords but now I decided that it's a

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.540 
conchords but now I decided that it's a
road-going<00:01:29.530> car<00:01:30.280> used<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:31.030> use<00:01:32.100> not<00:01:33.100> just<00:01:33.130> to

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
road-going car used to use not just to

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.620 
road-going car used to use not just to
polish<00:01:33.910> so<00:01:34.570> I<00:01:35.080> try<00:01:35.680> and<00:01:35.740> keep<00:01:35.979> it<00:01:36.160> tidy<00:01:36.490> but<00:01:37.390> it

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
polish so I try and keep it tidy but it

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:43.590 
polish so I try and keep it tidy but it
is<00:01:37.780> used<00:01:38.640> when<00:01:39.640> I<00:01:39.670> retired<00:01:40.210> I<00:01:40.630> had<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:43.300> front

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
is used when I retired I had the front

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.540 
is used when I retired I had the front
end<00:01:43.869> replaced<00:01:46.170> about<00:01:47.170> 15<00:01:47.649> years<00:01:47.890> ago<00:01:48.009> I<00:01:48.250> had<00:01:48.520> a

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:48.550 
end replaced about 15 years ago I had a

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.160 
end replaced about 15 years ago I had a
crash<00:01:48.880> with<00:01:48.910> another<00:01:49.450> Healy<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.920> they<00:01:51.850> put<00:01:52.090> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
crash with another Healy and they put a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.200 
crash with another Healy and they put a
repro<00:01:53.170> body<00:01:53.500> on<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.860> on<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.399> front<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.970> wings

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
repro body on it on the front the wings

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.690 
repro body on it on the front the wings
the<00:01:55.570> shroud<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:58.060> it<00:01:58.360> was<00:01:58.509> never<00:01:58.780> quite<00:01:59.080> right

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the shroud and it was never quite right

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.609 
the shroud and it was never quite right
so<00:02:02.040> I'd<00:02:03.040> kept<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.520> original<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:04.619> added

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
so I'd kept the original and added

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.880 
so I'd kept the original and added
because<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.490> center<00:02:06.970> section<00:02:07.180> is<00:02:07.540> aluminium

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
because the center section is aluminium

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.340 
because the center section is aluminium
it<00:02:08.890> pulled<00:02:09.519> back<00:02:09.640> into<00:02:10.060> shape<00:02:10.390> and<00:02:10.690> we

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
it pulled back into shape and we

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.900 
it pulled back into shape and we
reshaped<00:02:11.860> it<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:13.480> soon<00:02:14.440> after<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:14.920> retired<00:02:15.519> I

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
reshaped it and soon after I retired I

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.910 
reshaped it and soon after I retired I
was<00:02:16.450> determined<00:02:16.840> that<00:02:17.230> we<00:02:17.410> were<00:02:17.530> going<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.799> put

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
was determined that we were going to put

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.550 
was determined that we were going to put
the<00:02:18.100> original<00:02:19.079> back<00:02:20.079> on<00:02:20.110> which<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.280> did<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:22.560> so

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the original back on which I did so so

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.840 
the original back on which I did so so
this<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.010> back<00:02:24.579> to<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.970> original<00:02:26.489> shroud<00:02:27.489> and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
this is back to the original shroud and

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.380 
this is back to the original shroud and
wings<00:02:28.180> when<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:29.290> was<00:02:29.440> originally<00:02:29.860> made<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
wings when it was originally made the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.030 
wings when it was originally made the
advantage<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.290> owning<00:02:33.150> Healy<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.769> it's<00:02:35.769> good

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
advantage of owning Healy is it's good

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.000 
advantage of owning Healy is it's good
fun<00:02:36.280> be<00:02:37.180> it's<00:02:37.360> got<00:02:37.600> a<00:02:37.630> good<00:02:38.470> bit<00:02:38.620> of<00:02:38.650> power

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
fun be it's got a good bit of power

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.199 
fun be it's got a good bit of power
there<00:02:39.340> so<00:02:39.970> therefore<00:02:40.239> in<00:02:40.630> modern<00:02:40.930> traffic<00:02:42.209> it

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
there so therefore in modern traffic it

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.310 
there so therefore in modern traffic it
will<00:02:43.269> keep<00:02:44.170> cope<00:02:44.920> with<00:02:45.250> a<00:02:45.280> modern<00:02:46.120> traffic<00:02:47.019> in

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
will keep cope with a modern traffic in

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.140 
will keep cope with a modern traffic in
speed<00:02:48.810> whereas<00:02:49.810> some<00:02:50.079> some<00:02:50.950> classics<00:02:51.459> haven't

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
speed whereas some some classics haven't

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.000 
speed whereas some some classics haven't
got<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.359> power<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.900> they<00:02:53.049> you<00:02:53.350> know<00:02:54.060> so<00:02:56.010> it's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
got the power and they you know so it's

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.880 
got the power and they you know so it's
very<00:02:57.310> flexible<00:02:57.670> in<00:02:58.239> traffic<00:02:58.900> it<00:02:59.109> will<00:02:59.440> go<00:02:59.859> down

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
very flexible in traffic it will go down

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.090 
very flexible in traffic it will go down
to<00:03:00.430> slow<00:03:01.269> speed<00:03:01.660> evening<00:03:02.170> top<00:03:02.440> gear<00:03:02.709> and<00:03:02.950> not
