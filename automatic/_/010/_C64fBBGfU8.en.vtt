00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 the brain of a personal computer is 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:08.599
 microprocessor or central processor 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.980
 tsipka central processing unit 

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.950
 the microprocessor performs the calculations and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.139
 data processing and usually is 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.420
 most expensive microcircuit 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.779
 computer in all recordings compatible 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.400
 computers use processors 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.980
 Intel chipset family 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.260
 but not only 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.009
 most intel but also companies ppm 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.600
 cyrix go and learn how to paradise one 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.840
 key loop parameters 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.239
 are speed response speed 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.700
 computer depends a lot on the clock 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.190
 the frequencies that u now have combined 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.039
 modern processors measured in 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.680
 megahertz it is determined by the parameters 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.870
 quartz resonator representing 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.420
 quartz crystal 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.120
 small tin container under 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.219
 exposure to electrical voltage in 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.050
 crystal quartz and oscillations occur 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.690
 electric current with frequency 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.090
 determined by the shape and size of the crystal 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.790
 frequency of this alternating current and 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.979
 called the clock frequency of the microcircuit 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.580
 modern computer work on 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.700
 frequency 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.920
 several billion hertz hertz this one 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.170
 speed oscillations per second 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.630
 measured in megahertz that is 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.659
 billion cycles per second at and less 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.220
 quantum time units for 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.189
 processor as a logical device 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.220
 is the period of the clock frequency or 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.630
 just for every operation 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.759
 spend at least one measure 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.549
 for example data exchange with memory 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.920
 pentium 2 processor performed for three 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.400
 tact plus a few wait cycles 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.159
 cycle 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.409
 this expectation is tact in which nothing 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.970
 does not occur it is only needed for 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.850
 order to processor 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.009
 as if he did not run forward cancellation and 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.479
 high-speed computer nodes 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.950
 the time spent on 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.290
 executing 8086 and 8088 commands in these 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.350
 processors to execute one command 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.050
 about 12 cycles of Pentium series 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.150
 k6 processor architecture pentium 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.910
 their intel compatible processors fifth 

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.460
 generations created vnd and tireks 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.530
 including double conveyors 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.930
 teams and other improvements 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.190
 provided one or two 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.850
 teams in one measure 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.730
 pentium pro pentium 233 celeron and athlon 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.830
 Diron processors of class 6 and also 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.820
 sixth generation other processors 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.500
 created by md et sirix 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.460
 allow to execute at least three commands 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.890
 in one measure 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.080
 different number of ticks needed 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.510
 to execute commands makes it difficult 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.230
 computer performance comparison 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.750
 the main 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.400
 based only on their clock frequency 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.530
 that is, the number of ticks per second 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.140
 why with the same clock 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.110
 frequency 1 processor is faster 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.550
 another reason lies in 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.370
 performance pentium processor 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:03.030
 possessed a higher speed on 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.430
 compared to 486 im so how to perform 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.320
 teams he needed an average of two 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.270
 times less than four hundred cycles 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.750
 eighty sixth in this way 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:15.510
 486 processor clock speed of 133 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.660
 megahertz worked even slower than 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.300
 Pentium with a clock frequency of 75 megahertz 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.459
 This happened because with one and 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.690
 same frequency stump than performed twice 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.090
 more teams than process 486 pentium 2 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.160
 and pentium 3 by about 50 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.770
 percent faster processor pentium 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.750
 working on the same frequency because 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.400
 they can perform much more 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.000
 teams for the same amount 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.000
 cycles
