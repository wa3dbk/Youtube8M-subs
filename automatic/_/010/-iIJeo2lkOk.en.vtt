 hello people today is not a free day 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.840
 but I find that there is no reason 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.279
 to be sad because like me already 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.010
 one has learned in Bavaria around so 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.240

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.170
 which comes out of course I am pleased 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.519
 when we write people that I mean 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.070
 have watched videos and laugh at it 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.109
 I have to try to imagine how 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.580
 that must have looked and if I have 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.869
 so in everyday life and me around then comes 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.550
 somehow the people are always 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 laughter and that are always at the end 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.880
 the same types of to go there there 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.830

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:35.760
 actually that hard laughs so yes 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:37.890
 not even laughing anymore 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.719

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.960
 just stuck in position 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.190

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.800
 third floor and then the frame again 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 house where I of course pull out 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.980

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.660
