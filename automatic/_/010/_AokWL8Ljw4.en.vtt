00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.920
 hello how good we change decoration 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.290
 let's change drawing 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.200
 first we have to put the wall 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.760
 white again we will need so 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.760
 minus two minimum hands 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.910
 and once 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.859
 we have everything well white we can 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.859
 start making the drawing 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.820
 well, the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.680
 drawing 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.900
 I forgot to tell you that you have to 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.690
 put down cartons 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.520
 and protect furniture and plugs 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.210
 with body tape 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.380
 you put if you do not have with the newspaper 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.380
 same cardboard 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.920
 good as you can see it has already been given a hand 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.960
 of white paint but have below the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.420
 so dark colors 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:25.430
 now there are two to three minimum hands 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.860
 well let's start doing 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.100
 the drawing that in this case is going to be a 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.100
 bird 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.000
 first we draw it to then put it 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.000
 in color 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:10.280
 Good girls, I 'm so sorry, 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.930
 have been able to teach you the step by step of 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.900
 what my son has done now in his 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.750
 the blind room but the show 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.780
 this how he caught me working 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.090
 because he has been making clear in his 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.410
 times I was working I could not 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.350
 record it 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.050
 so, but well, nothing is filled 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.610
 painted with spray first marked it 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:37.240
 then the reviewed with marker 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:40.420
 and then spray and spray it goes 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.520
 3 colors used because the white of the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.430
 white wall has only used the 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.469
 blue and red 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.840
 what is a very strong red but in the 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:52.640
 screen looks like orange 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.910
 honestly to me at the beginning I do not 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.739
 I liked it a lot but you see it handsome not 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.510
 true 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.739
 and good as he likes it too 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.810
 so it changes the decoration of the 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.230
 room from time to time 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:10.840
 now the problem is the case that had 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:13.190
 this sheath and the curtain for that 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.830
 so 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:19.980
 what color you wear now founds 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:24.870
 others that you tell me I put it in blue 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.459
 I put it in red red is not that red 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.370
 I think I should retire more 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.049
 blue not because when you put the blue case 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.140
 equal it highlights much more also the 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:36.560
 so I will try to find the 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.730
 Canvas in blue but a blue rather 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.739
 electric no more than clear 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.230
 you do not know if you are leaving me some 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.909
 advice too 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.190
 is that red I do not know to me the red like that 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.599
 I made myself very far back the red myself 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.280
 I think they are for decoration is 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.700
 to put very little amount because the 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.970
 very strong red very passionate and I that 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.970
 this 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.230
 have a lot of red via at least to me 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.060
 and nothing good as your room is your 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.750
 by young boy swimming 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.750
 with his gossip his things and well hopefully 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.060
 it has a little bit of nothing 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.769
 I do not know why because I imagine it 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.650
 I imagined he will only have the same problem 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.780
 and young people because and where the same 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.020
 it will not go away from everything and today it will happen 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.120
 neat and all that 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.430
 and not two girls because we are already over 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.020
 what to tell you to see what he advises me and 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:37.690
 If we put the cover 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.789
 in electric blue or that the electric 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.759
 light blue because I already tell you that the red 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:45.389
 I do not see red more than one point 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.389
 surprise 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.540
 I hope you like us too 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.540
 and nothing we see in the next goodbye
