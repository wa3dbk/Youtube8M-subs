00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.740
 9 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.900
 but 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.779
 and 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.030
 9 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.050
 this machine says a german term 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.780
 we decided to make this take other 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.170
 internal problems that in the design 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.140
 mainly here we have 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.340
 problems in workshop topics and 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.949
 that fill your mouth tell you that we are 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.530
 liceo emblematic industrial technician 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.830
 Country efficient tool workshops 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.839
 efficient deficient machines and also 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.339
 the monetary issue the money they charge 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.470
 to each that is a network of 15 million 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.080
 weights decisions but the big problem 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.740
 that we have here that money that are 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.960
 14 to 15 million that they raise 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.060
 monthly are not reflected in 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.930
 nothing is not reflected in what 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.990
 should be used that are the repair of 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.070
 risk prevention machinery 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.860
 maintain the lyceum because we 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.619
 we are very much working on it now 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.240
 this money nobody knows where they are going 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.560
 they say that if you use it for that but 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.490
 we see that it's not like that because 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.549
 we spent a lot now there 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.549
 how do you see this is the same as always or 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:45.080
 be the year we've been there is nothing 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.880
 so different in that sense and they are 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.259
 filling the mouth saying that if I 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.369
 They are filling their pockets 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.530
 with our money and that's why we 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.270
 We decided to take the high school because 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.670
 we want our money to be 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.179
 flee for our things and really 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.729
 our security they send us to fix 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:07.670
 machinery that are not fit people 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:10.130
 to do it and that this can lead to 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.290
 a serious accident to one of spanair 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.549
 or from us more than anything is why 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.560
 that we as a collection try to 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.030
 make the goats wake up because 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.800
 I 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.420
 there really is a lot of reflection here 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.400
 persecution to the people that if 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.290
 mobilize not be as tomorrow March 28 the 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.790
 mobilization that was called we are going 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.400
 those who go there are always the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.100
 repressions many the persecutions that 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.690
 they make us cachay or that's all for that 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.030
 too much this so that everyone can 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.890
 go freely and without fear that the 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.959
 they repress the next day the next 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.819
 week mind also get what 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.880
 We look for afternoons with students not 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.070
 as a worker already really because that 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.660
 is what they seek they seek only to create a 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.239
 worker a worker who works all his 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.310
 life and say yes yes nothing else the year 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.980
 past they put cameras three times 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.230
 they pulled out they put the channel so that 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.000
 suppress the things that made us a 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.100
 agreement that last year also the 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.860
 members by social networks the cord 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.769
 and not take our photos by networks 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.780
 social networks and they took us to a 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.860
 He was interrogated by everyone and that is 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.019
 you can not do an earl with 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.480
 persecutions the repression that is being 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.330
 living here 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.489
 last year and this year we have tried 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.290
 of waking up to the clearings more than anything 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.299
 because I know that here there is motivated cabro 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.250
 and the only thing that has to be demonstrated to 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.989
 they are not alone and we are 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.540
 analyzed that if we can change the 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.489
 things that the good ones follow as always 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.470
 that these flaws are made public 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.129
 because there are hide all street have 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.290
 visits here and they at least have us 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:46.629
 a whole day preparing all well 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.310
 nice for visitors to believe that 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.430
 this is always true but it is not like that 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.819
 really was a samaria is 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.819
 Changing
