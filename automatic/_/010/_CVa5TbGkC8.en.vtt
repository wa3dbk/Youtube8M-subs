00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.900
 yes 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:10.130
 with the wave in this video I bring you this 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.880
 very intense makeup in shades 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.860
 purple and black I hope you like it 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.289
 as always I start with my first and what 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.359
 I apply in both eyes and it diffused it very 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.630
 well if in this case you do not have first 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.730
 you can skip this step and move on 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.869
 next that is to apply a concealer 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.510
 White 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:33.380
 If you are dark skinned, I suggest you 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.930
 use one in page tone for that 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.360
 this so that the shadows are more noticeable 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.580
 adhere better have greater 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.860
 intensity then apply it on your 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.930
 eyelid mobile and diffuse it very well 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.530
 up a little 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:52.880
 above your fold then you will take 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.940
 a pearly white shadow and we're going to 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.460
 put only about one third of your 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.340
 eyelid then diffuses this tear 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.370
 towards the center since you have 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.660
 blurred very well you're going to take a 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:10.340
 dwelling in the same way can be 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:14.060
 satiny or matte my state a little 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.810
 satin and I'm going to apply where I 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.260
 stay outside I explain where 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.840
 you finished the white line what are you going 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.150
 apply to and the purple out towards 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.700
 there all the external angle you go 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.620
 applying little by little with light blows 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.990
 so that it adheres very well on the 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.080
 white base that we had already put or the 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.940
 you see according to the tone of your test and 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.810
 then you do not fade 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.840
 little by little towards the center if you notice 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:47.510
 I do not hold so much when I go 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.700
 blurring inward with what I 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.890
 I'm going in the brush I'm going 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.290
 sweeping and then you will see the 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.780
 degraded color if you pass you can 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.770
 re-add white and purple according to 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.689
 require it 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.390
 in this we will continue to play a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:06.570
 little with the tones then I'm going to take 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.640
 now a lilac mate and I'm going to blur 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.009
 only in the fold any line 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.379
 marked after doing this 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.010
 I want to start with the black shadow with 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.510
 a thin brush I'm going to mark the ub in 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.360
 the external angle 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.360
 I start very stuck along the 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.840
 eyelashes and then blurred it to the 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:31.079
 play as I have done this I can take 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.690
 several brushes and add little to 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:37.290
 little the black shadow if you tell the 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.170
 first it is very thin then take one 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.370
 in the form of a brush and he was adding 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.340
 little by little the black tone as I wanted 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.450
 more black more intensity I was grabbing 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:55.920
 a brush a little wider or more 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:59.099
 thick again took more black shadow and 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.940
 I was fading slowly as 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:05.060
 has reached the tonality of black 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.430
 At the desired intensity, I'll go back to 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.150
 grab the brush to blur and 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.670
 only clean any marked line 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:16.730
 a good ally for black shadows 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.780
 It's a coffee tone that will help me 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.960
 blur any edge now in 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.220
 under the arch the eyebrow took that tone 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.080
 like rose stick and blew it very well 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.200
 then I took my liquid eyeliner 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.660
 a line very close to the eyelashes if 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.180
 I do it very thick I can cover my 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:40.760
 shadows then try to do it the most 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.320
 stuck to the eyelashes and the tail 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.320
 I made very short 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.650
 clean any stain or any 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.080
 residue that has fallen I put several 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.190
 layers of mascara and I apply my lashes 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:02.710
 fake so you can see the look more 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.080
 right away he took the white corrector what 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:08.770
 I'm going to put on the lower lashes 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:12.130
 as a base then he applied the three 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.010
 shadows in the same way that I put in 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.810
 the top part white first 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.080
 blurred after purple in between and 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.330
 finally the black remembers every time 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.860
 that you apply you have to blur the 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:30.150
 unions of these three shades 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:33.360
 then I took a pencil eyeliner and what 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:37.379
 apply on the water line as not 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.389
 I wanted it to look like the cut 

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:42.389
 between the water line and my eyelashes 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:46.319
 lower with the liquid eyeliner if 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:50.969
 you notice, I was putting it very close to 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:53.039
 my eyelashes to join those 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:55.699
 two delineators both in the line of 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:59.219
 water like the one on the lashes below 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.500
 now if you notice how the two look 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.689
 eyes and I like I do not have very eyes 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.210
 little ones if the eyeliner applied it 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:09.029
 inside I see the smallest eyes 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.979
 and like that tired then it's your 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:14.490
 choice if you want to leave with or without 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:18.569
 eyeliner on the inside in the 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:23.009
 water line after shade in my mis 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:26.310
 eyebrows and finally I put two blushes 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:29.430
 first a peach tone and then one in 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.950
 pink tone both satin 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.410
 to continue giving prominence to the 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.440
 eyes use that lipstick 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:41.370
 pink is a clear one but I do not see myself 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:44.070
 dead just apply it on the lips 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.930
 and that has already been the final result 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.360
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:54.170
 let them use it this weekend 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.170
 and see you in the next video bye
