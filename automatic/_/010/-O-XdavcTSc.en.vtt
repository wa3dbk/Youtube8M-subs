the<00:02:12.340> major<00:02:12.700> league<00:02:12.969> average<00:02:13.329> is<00:02:13.450> 110<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.200> 140

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
the major league average is 110 to 140

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.809 
the major league average is 110 to 140
that's<00:02:15.310> right<00:02:15.700> he's<00:02:15.999> at<00:02:16.180> one<00:02:16.590> 42.9<00:02:17.590> more<00:02:18.549> than

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
that's right he's at one 42.9 more than

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.729 
that's right he's at one 42.9 more than
the<00:02:18.939> major<00:02:19.120> league<00:02:19.329> average<00:02:19.659> and<00:02:19.930> that<00:02:20.409> allows

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
the major league average and that allows

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.890 
the major league average and that allows
him<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.010> release<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.549> ball<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:22.120> far<00:02:22.150> out<00:02:22.689> of

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
him to release the ball so far out of

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.580 
him to release the ball so far out of
front<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:23.829> that<00:02:24.069> ball<00:02:24.370> that's<00:02:24.579> coming<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:25.269> at

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
front that that ball that's coming in at

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.699 
front that that ball that's coming in at
93<00:02:26.590> to<00:02:26.769> 97<00:02:27.249> will<00:02:27.819> look<00:02:28.090> like<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.689> hundred<00:02:29.290> miles

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
93 to 97 will look like a hundred miles

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.099 
93 to 97 will look like a hundred miles
an<00:02:30.099> hour

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
an hour

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:34.589 
an hour
so<00:02:32.109> people<00:02:32.620> want<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.010> know<00:02:33.069> why<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.030> think<00:02:34.269> he

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
so people want to know why I think he

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.819 
so people want to know why I think he
might<00:02:34.750> have<00:02:34.930> some<00:02:35.170> challenges<00:02:35.200> in<00:02:35.680> his

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
might have some challenges in his

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.129 
might have some challenges in his
upcoming<00:02:36.129> year<00:02:36.459> well<00:02:36.939> I<00:02:37.000> think<00:02:37.090> Houston<00:02:38.019> has

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:38.139 
upcoming year well I think Houston has

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.500 
upcoming year well I think Houston has
drafted<00:02:38.409> him<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:38.829> Houston<00:02:39.250> wants<00:02:39.489> to<00:02:39.849> win<00:02:40.150> and

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
drafted him and Houston wants to win and

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.289 
drafted him and Houston wants to win and
get<00:02:40.870> people<00:02:41.200> in<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.499> stands<00:02:41.919> so<00:02:42.549> this<00:02:42.819> kid<00:02:43.150> the

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
get people in the stands so this kid the

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.569 
get people in the stands so this kid the
pressures<00:02:43.810> gonna<00:02:43.989> be<00:02:44.200> on<00:02:44.409> he's<00:02:44.950> going<00:02:45.219> to<00:02:45.430> be

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
pressures gonna be on he's going to be

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.610 
pressures gonna be on he's going to be
expected<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.239> produce<00:02:46.389> right<00:02:47.049> away<00:02:47.319> when<00:02:47.530> he

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
expected to produce right away when he

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.890 
expected to produce right away when he
gets<00:02:47.799> into<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.549> minor<00:02:48.790> leagues<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.329> I<00:02:49.750> would

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
gets into the minor leagues and I would

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.659 
gets into the minor leagues and I would
not<00:02:50.109> be<00:02:50.260> surprised<00:02:50.709> if<00:02:50.980> he<00:02:51.219> comes<00:02:51.489> up

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:51.669 
not be surprised if he comes up

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:53.580 
not be surprised if he comes up
somewhere<00:02:52.120> and<00:02:52.269> this<00:02:52.419> year<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:52.989> has<00:02:53.439> to

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
somewhere and this year and has to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.289 
somewhere and this year and has to
perform<00:02:54.010> on<00:02:54.159> a<00:02:54.250> major<00:02:54.459> league<00:02:54.730> level<00:02:54.939> right

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
perform on a major league level right

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.360 
perform on a major league level right
away<00:02:55.569> I<00:02:55.780> think<00:02:56.560> that<00:02:56.680> would<00:02:56.799> really<00:02:56.889> help<00:02:57.159> them

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
away I think that would really help them

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.759 
away I think that would really help them
is<00:02:57.459> that<00:02:57.639> he<00:02:57.760> we<00:02:57.909> turned<00:02:58.269> to<00:02:58.540> Stanford<00:02:59.049> for<00:02:59.230> his

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
is that he we turned to Stanford for his

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.830 
is that he we turned to Stanford for his
senior<00:03:00.129> year<00:03:00.159> getting<00:03:00.939> more<00:03:01.209> mature<00:03:01.359> on<00:03:01.659> the

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
senior year getting more mature on the

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.659 
senior year getting more mature on the
hill<00:03:02.049> understanding<00:03:02.980> what<00:03:03.099> it<00:03:03.189> takes<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.549> get

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669 
hill understanding what it takes to get

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:06.149 
hill understanding what it takes to get
batters<00:03:04.060> out<00:03:04.299> and<00:03:04.599> really<00:03:05.230> fine-tuning<00:03:05.980> his

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:06.159 
batters out and really fine-tuning his

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:07.949 
batters out and really fine-tuning his
mechanics<00:03:06.760> I<00:03:06.969> think<00:03:07.629> he's<00:03:07.750> gonna<00:03:07.900> be

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
mechanics I think he's gonna be

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.899 
mechanics I think he's gonna be
extremely<00:03:08.409> successful<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:09.370> I<00:03:09.489> look<00:03:09.669> forward
