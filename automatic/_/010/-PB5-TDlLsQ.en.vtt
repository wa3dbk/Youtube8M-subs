books or magazines in these different
rows<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:39.149> could<00:00:39.300> slide<00:00:39.510> through<00:00:39.870> them<00:00:40.079> so

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
rows you could slide through them so

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.160 
rows you could slide through them so
this<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.190> i<00:00:41.820> guess<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.809> screen<00:00:43.050> that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
this is the i guess the the screen that

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.610 
this is the i guess the the screen that
would<00:00:43.320> show<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:44.040> content<00:00:44.539> or<00:00:45.539> for<00:00:46.289> reading

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
would show your content or for reading

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.680 
would show your content or for reading
as<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:47.010> an<00:00:47.129> e-book<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> screen

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
as like an e-book this is the screen

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.139 
as like an e-book this is the screen
that's<00:00:48.960> that's<00:00:49.800> business<00:00:50.250> related<00:00:50.520> we've<00:00:51.000> got

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
that's that's business related we've got

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.240 
that's that's business related we've got
microsoft<00:00:51.449> word<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.050> here<00:00:52.289> powerpoint<00:00:52.890> excel

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
microsoft word in here powerpoint excel

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.660 
microsoft word in here powerpoint excel

individual screen and there you go

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.180 
individual screen and there you go
there's<00:01:30.759> a<00:01:30.850> good<00:01:31.330> example<00:01:31.780> of<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.979> through

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
there's a good example of going through

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
take a look a 7 inch screen 1.3

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.220 
take a look a 7 inch screen 1.3
megapixel<00:02:09.429> has<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.700> front<00:02:09.970> facing<00:02:10.000> camera<00:02:10.600> too

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
megapixel has a front facing camera too

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.780 
megapixel has a front facing camera too
i<00:02:11.260> didn't<00:02:11.740> realize<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.190> that's<00:02:12.370> pretty<00:02:12.610> cool

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
i didn't realize that that's pretty cool

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.830 
i didn't realize that that's pretty cool
and<00:02:14.730> an<00:02:15.730> overall<00:02:16.090> seems<00:02:16.390> like<00:02:16.510> a<00:02:16.569> pretty<00:02:16.690> good

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and an overall seems like a pretty good

devices<00:02:17.200> these<00:02:17.319> are<00:02:17.500> prototypes<00:02:17.680> right<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:19.060> i

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
devices these are prototypes right so i

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.410 
devices these are prototypes right so i
guess<00:02:20.080> i<00:02:20.170> can<00:02:20.290> only<00:02:20.380> get<00:02:20.560> better<00:02:20.590> then<00:02:21.420> but

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
guess i can only get better then but

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.420 
guess i can only get better then but
