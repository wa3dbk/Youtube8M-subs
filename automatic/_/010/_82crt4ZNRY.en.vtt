cooker<00:00:47.510> like<00:00:48.510> I've<00:00:48.660> got<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> white<00:00:49.050> one

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
cooker like I've got a white one

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.880 
cooker like I've got a white one
remember<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:51.539> color<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.899> ordered<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.530> it's

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
remember what color I ordered but it's

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.590 
remember what color I ordered but it's
gotta<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:54.239> quite<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> bit<00:00:54.570> smaller

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
gotta be it it's quite a bit smaller

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.160 
gotta be it it's quite a bit smaller
than<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.469> first<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.840> first<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.140> about

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
than the first one first to know about

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.270 
than the first one first to know about
that<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:59.600> hopefully<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.750> does<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.859> as<00:01:02.010> good<00:01:02.219> a

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
that is hopefully it does just as good a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.609 
that is hopefully it does just as good a
job<00:01:02.870> that's<00:01:03.870> pretty<00:01:04.080> much<00:01:04.170> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
job that's pretty much it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.899 
job that's pretty much it
nothing<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.220> there

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
here that looks like just goes around

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:33.559 
here that looks like just goes around
here<00:01:28.939> make<00:01:29.939> sure<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.210> tighten<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.720> up<00:01:30.869> so<00:01:32.569> it's

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
here make sure you tighten it up so it's

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.980 
here make sure you tighten it up so it's
nice<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.990> tight

to go so I'm making some veggies here so

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.960 
to go so I'm making some veggies here so
let's<00:01:47.540> test<00:01:47.690> this<00:01:47.840> bad<00:01:48.080> boy<00:01:48.140> out

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
let's test this bad boy out

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.450 
let's test this bad boy out
real<00:01:49.970> quick<00:01:50.240> I'm<00:01:51.050> gonna<00:01:51.260> take<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:51.680> up<00:01:51.740> to<00:01:51.890> 185

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
real quick I'm gonna take it up to 185

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.710 
real quick I'm gonna take it up to 185
degrees<00:01:52.940> it's<00:01:53.150> just<00:01:53.300> one<00:01:53.450> of<00:01:53.479> the<00:01:53.570> higher

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
degrees it's just one of the higher

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.510 
degrees it's just one of the higher
temperatures<00:01:54.170> of<00:01:54.320> intensity<00:01:55.390> so<00:01:56.390> let's<00:01:57.520> pop

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
temperatures of intensity so let's pop

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.320 
temperatures of intensity so let's pop
this<00:01:58.790> over<00:01:59.149> here<00:01:59.330> and<00:01:59.509> all<00:01:59.659> okay<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.250> a<00:02:01.670> bucket

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
this over here and all okay so a bucket

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.590 
this over here and all okay so a bucket
of<00:02:02.450> water<00:02:02.890> it's<00:02:03.890> not<00:02:04.100> my<00:02:04.250> usual<00:02:04.280> spot<00:02:04.820> that's

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
of water it's not my usual spot that's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.770 
of water it's not my usual spot that's
okay<00:02:06.700> there's<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.790> little<00:02:08.000> deeper<00:02:08.390> than<00:02:08.569> the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
okay there's a little deeper than the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.229 
okay there's a little deeper than the
first<00:02:09.229> one<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:11.500> definitely<00:02:12.550> goes<00:02:13.550> back<00:02:13.880> a<00:02:13.910> lot

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
first one it definitely goes back a lot

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.530 
first one it definitely goes back a lot
further<00:02:16.090> doesn't<00:02:17.090> look<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.360> be<00:02:17.540> as<00:02:18.130> tall<00:02:19.540> the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
further doesn't look to be as tall the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.259 
further doesn't look to be as tall the
first<00:02:21.170> one<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:21.590> it<00:02:21.890> goes<00:02:22.070> pretty<00:02:22.610> far<00:02:22.850> doubting

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
first one is it goes pretty far doubting

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.110 
first one is it goes pretty far doubting
us<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.570> letter<00:02:23.810> on<00:02:23.989> this<00:02:24.110> particular<00:02:24.680> tub

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
us in the letter on this particular tub

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.720 
us in the letter on this particular tub
it<00:02:26.120> up<00:02:26.209> quite<00:02:26.420> a<00:02:26.450> few<00:02:26.690> inches<00:02:26.870> of<00:02:27.110> water

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
it up quite a few inches of water

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.250 
it up quite a few inches of water
available<00:02:28.730> here<00:02:29.000> so<00:02:29.030> I<00:02:29.660> might<00:02:29.989> wind<00:02:30.170> up

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
available here so I might wind up

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.380 
available here so I might wind up
putting<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.620> little<00:02:30.769> more<00:02:30.950> in<00:02:31.160> I<00:02:31.400> don't<00:02:32.150> know

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
putting a little more in I don't know

but anyway just tighten the back screw
here<00:02:38.680> and<00:02:40.540> plug<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.690> in<00:02:43.660> that's<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.930> tough

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
here and plug it in that's the tough

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.130 
here and plug it in that's the tough
part<00:02:45.170> at<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.680> moment<00:02:46.750> all<00:02:47.750> right<00:02:47.780> we're<00:02:48.019> good

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
part at the moment all right we're good

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.699 
part at the moment all right we're good
to<00:02:48.230> go

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
to go

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.229 
to go
looks<00:02:49.310> like<00:02:49.489> we<00:02:49.610> got<00:02:49.820> a<00:02:50.620> nice<00:02:51.620> LED<00:02:52.160> screen<00:02:52.640> here

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
looks like we got a nice LED screen here

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:00.190 
looks like we got a nice LED screen here
I'm<00:02:54.110> gonna<00:02:54.290> set<00:02:54.500> this<00:02:54.650> bad<00:02:54.860> boy<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:59.200> frigging

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
I'm gonna set this bad boy to frigging

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.900 
I'm gonna set this bad boy to frigging
Fahrenheit<00:03:00.769> let's<00:03:01.220> see<00:03:01.370> how<00:03:01.579> we<00:03:01.640> do<00:03:01.850> that

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.740 

I<00:03:06.040> don't<00:03:07.040> know<00:03:07.100> Bluetooth<00:03:07.700> connectivity<00:03:08.329> I'm

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
I don't know Bluetooth connectivity I'm

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.240 
I don't know Bluetooth connectivity I'm
not<00:03:08.870> sure<00:03:09.019> what<00:03:09.170> that's<00:03:09.320> all<00:03:09.560> about

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:19.830 

I<00:03:15.220> wish<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.370> could<00:03:16.670> just<00:03:17.000> change<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.720> freakin

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
I wish I could just change the freakin

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.780 
I wish I could just change the freakin
Celsius<00:03:20.840> to<00:03:21.350> Fahrenheit<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:22.340> not<00:03:22.489> letting

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
Celsius to Fahrenheit it's not letting

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.210 
Celsius to Fahrenheit it's not letting
me<00:03:22.880> do<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:26.079> there's<00:03:27.079> some<00:03:27.290> button<00:03:27.739> over<00:03:27.950> here<00:03:27.980> I

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
me do it there's some button over here I

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.470 
me do it there's some button over here I
can't<00:03:28.670> see<00:03:28.820> them

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
can't see them

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.869 
can't see them
pushing

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:42.110 

mm-hmm<00:03:36.379> all<00:03:37.379> right<00:03:37.560> well<00:03:37.769> whatever<00:03:40.909> see<00:03:41.909> oh<00:03:41.939> hi

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
mm-hmm all right well whatever see oh hi

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.149 
mm-hmm all right well whatever see oh hi
okay<00:03:42.599> single<00:03:42.959> go<00:03:43.079> almost<00:03:43.379> up<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.530> boiling<00:03:44.010> it

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
okay single go almost up to boiling it

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:47.000 
okay single go almost up to boiling it
should<00:03:44.280> be<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> hundred<00:03:44.579> Celsius<00:03:45.239> so<00:03:46.010> what's

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
should be a hundred Celsius so what's

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.160 
should be a hundred Celsius so what's
gonna<00:03:47.099> guess<00:03:47.340> I'm<00:03:47.909> gonna<00:03:48.060> say<00:03:48.209> 75<00:03:48.689> degrees<00:03:49.049> is

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
gonna guess I'm gonna say 75 degrees is

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.690 
gonna guess I'm gonna say 75 degrees is
what<00:03:49.290> I'm<00:03:49.379> looking<00:03:49.620> for<00:03:49.799> until<00:03:50.040> I<00:03:50.129> do<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.310> proper

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
what I'm looking for until I do a proper

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.880 
what I'm looking for until I do a proper
conversion<00:03:50.879> or<00:03:51.420> figure<00:03:52.379> out<00:03:52.439> how<00:03:52.590> to<00:03:52.680> get<00:03:52.769> this

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
conversion or figure out how to get this

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.170 
conversion or figure out how to get this
thing<00:03:53.010> going<00:03:53.069> but<00:03:53.370> anyway<00:03:53.640> once<00:03:53.879> you're<00:03:54.030> ready

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
thing going but anyway once you're ready

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.619 
thing going but anyway once you're ready
to<00:03:54.269> go<00:03:54.390> you<00:03:54.450> push<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:54.900> button<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:56.450> it<00:03:57.450> looks

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
to go you push this button and it looks

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.020 
to go you push this button and it looks
like<00:03:57.689> we<00:03:57.989> start<00:03:58.349> circulating<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.519> getting

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
like we start circulating and getting

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.839 
like we start circulating and getting
the<00:04:00.120> temperature<00:04:00.269> up<00:04:01.129> so<00:04:02.129> when<00:04:02.519> I<00:04:02.609> figure<00:04:02.819> out

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
the temperature up so when I figure out

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.170 
the temperature up so when I figure out
how<00:04:02.969> to<00:04:03.030> convert<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.450> Fahrenheit<00:04:04.159> I<00:04:05.180> will

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
how to convert it to Fahrenheit I will

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.479 
how to convert it to Fahrenheit I will
come<00:04:07.170> right<00:04:07.200> back<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.829> I'm<00:04:08.069> gonna<00:04:08.220> make<00:04:08.340> some

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
come right back and I'm gonna make some

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.399 
come right back and I'm gonna make some
veggies<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.060> thanks<00:04:09.840> for<00:04:09.930> watching<00:04:10.019> this

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
veggies so thanks for watching this

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.599 
veggies so thanks for watching this
great<00:04:11.129> video<00:04:12.859> okay<00:04:13.859> so<00:04:13.919> I<00:04:14.099> figured<00:04:14.310> out<00:04:14.489> how<00:04:14.579> to

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
great video okay so I figured out how to

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:16.400 
great video okay so I figured out how to
change<00:04:14.879> it<00:04:14.970> from<00:04:15.180> Fahrenheit<00:04:16.109> to<00:04:16.139> Celsius

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
change it from Fahrenheit to Celsius

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.979 
change it from Fahrenheit to Celsius
hold<00:04:17.400> down<00:04:17.639> a<00:04:17.669> little<00:04:18.090> play<00:04:18.959> button<00:04:19.169> here<00:04:20.989> for

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
hold down a little play button here for

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.900 
hold down a little play button here for
a<00:04:22.019> few<00:04:22.229> seconds<00:04:22.740> okay<00:04:22.919> and<00:04:23.310> you'll<00:04:23.460> see<00:04:23.639> see

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
a few seconds okay and you'll see see

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.900 
a few seconds okay and you'll see see
come<00:04:24.150> up<00:04:24.210> if<00:04:24.690> you<00:04:24.840> want<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.380> Celsius<00:04:25.949> pull<00:04:26.789> it

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
come up if you want it Celsius pull it

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.730 
come up if you want it Celsius pull it
down<00:04:27.090> again<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:30.000> want<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.210> Fahrenheit<00:04:30.630> so<00:04:31.410> I'm

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
down again you want a Fahrenheit so I'm

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.710 
down again you want a Fahrenheit so I'm
obviously<00:04:31.860> a<00:04:32.130> little<00:04:32.340> bit<00:04:32.460> off<00:04:32.610> on<00:04:32.639> and<00:04:33.000> 185

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
obviously a little bit off on and 185

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.520 
obviously a little bit off on and 185
degrees<00:04:35.330> so<00:04:36.330> I'm<00:04:37.020> gonna<00:04:37.169> leave<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.409> at<00:04:37.500> that

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
degrees so I'm gonna leave it at that

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.040 
degrees so I'm gonna leave it at that
hit<00:04:38.460> play<00:04:38.699> again<00:04:39.349> actually<00:04:40.349> that<00:04:40.500> stopped<00:04:40.770> it

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
hit play again actually that stopped it

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.490 
hit play again actually that stopped it
play<00:04:43.050> again

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
play again

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.290 
play again
now<00:04:43.860> supposedly<00:04:44.310> you<00:04:44.370> can<00:04:44.430> set<00:04:44.699> a<00:04:44.729> timer<00:04:45.030> if

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
now supposedly you can set a timer if

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.560 
now supposedly you can set a timer if
you<00:04:45.389> hold<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:45.690> button<00:04:45.900> down<00:04:46.199> for<00:04:46.530> I<00:04:46.770> believe

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
you hold that button down for I believe

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.439 
you hold that button down for I believe
10<00:04:48.570> seconds<00:04:49.110> or<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:49.919> I'm<00:04:50.909> not<00:04:51.090> gonna<00:04:51.210> do

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
that I just use a separate oven timer or

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:55.670 
that I just use a separate oven timer or
something<00:04:54.150> wanted<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.720> do<00:04:54.840> that<00:04:55.050> hold<00:04:55.590> that

something wanted to do that hold that
down<00:04:55.919> for<00:04:55.979> a<00:04:56.220> while<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:56.580> you<00:04:56.669> can<00:04:56.699> set<00:04:57.060> it<00:04:57.090> with

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
down for a while and you can set it with

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.189 
down for a while and you can set it with
the<00:04:57.979> blue<00:04:58.979> flippy<00:04:59.460> switch<00:04:59.699> here<00:05:00.000> so<00:05:00.330> anyway<00:05:01.169> I

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
the blue flippy switch here so anyway I

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.450 
the blue flippy switch here so anyway I
just<00:05:01.260> wanted<00:05:01.620> to<00:05:01.710> show<00:05:01.860> you<00:05:01.889> that<00:05:02.010> as<00:05:02.280> well
