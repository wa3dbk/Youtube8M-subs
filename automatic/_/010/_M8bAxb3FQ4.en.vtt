pull out your like your earphones and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.650 
pull out your like your earphones and
stuff<00:03:02.950> like<00:03:03.070> that<00:03:03.130> which<00:03:03.370> is<00:03:03.430> up<00:03:03.670> angle<00:03:04.390> which

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.000 
stuff like that which is up angle which
I<00:03:04.750> guess<00:03:04.930> is<00:03:04.960> a<00:03:05.080> little<00:03:05.260> nice<00:03:05.380> such<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> detail

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
I guess is a little nice such a detail

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.130 
I guess is a little nice such a detail
but<00:03:06.640> if<00:03:06.880> you<00:03:07.000> guys<00:03:07.120> go<00:03:07.330> and<00:03:07.420> plundered<00:03:07.840> they're
