00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
section of at the magazine and I was

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.560 
section of at the magazine and I was
asked<00:00:59.590> to<00:00:59.710> do<00:00:59.859> that<00:01:00.010> three<00:01:00.429> years<00:01:00.640> after<00:01:00.850> he<00:01:01.239> he

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
asked to do that three years after he he

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.240 
asked to do that three years after he he

died in 1997 in other words and it was a

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.560 
died in 1997 in other words and it was a
pretty<00:01:06.520> good<00:01:06.640> article<00:01:06.909> I<00:01:07.030> think<00:01:07.119> it<00:01:07.450> was

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
pretty good article I think it was

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.899 
pretty good article I think it was
pretty<00:01:07.780> well<00:01:07.960> received<00:01:08.500> but<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.130> fairly

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909 
pretty well received but in fairly

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.030 
pretty well received but in fairly
typical<00:01:10.090> fleet-street<00:01:10.689> fashion<00:01:11.470> it<00:01:11.680> was

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
typical fleet-street fashion it was

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.420 
typical fleet-street fashion it was
butchered<00:01:12.490> around<00:01:12.820> quite<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.450> lot<00:01:13.810> for<00:01:14.259> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
butchered around quite a lot for the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.670 
butchered around quite a lot for the
audience<00:01:15.430> that<00:01:15.549> was<00:01:15.759> considered<00:01:16.240> to<00:01:16.270> be

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
audience that was considered to be

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.770 
audience that was considered to be
around<00:01:17.680> at<00:01:17.799> the<00:01:17.829> time<00:01:18.040> what<00:01:18.850> I<00:01:18.880> have<00:01:19.119> here<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.720> a

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
around at the time what I have here is a

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.840 
around at the time what I have here is a
lot<00:01:20.049> of<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.200> raw<00:01:20.350> material<00:01:20.890> that<00:01:21.310> I<00:01:21.340> gathered

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
lot of the raw material that I gathered

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.120 
lot of the raw material that I gathered
in<00:01:22.090> putting<00:01:22.600> that<00:01:22.720> article<00:01:23.049> together<00:01:23.229> and<00:01:23.710> the

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
in putting that article together and the

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.969 
in putting that article together and the
original<00:01:24.930> manuscript<00:01:25.930> of<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.140> article<00:01:26.740> and

original manuscript of the article and

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:28.710 
original manuscript of the article and
so<00:01:27.189> what<00:01:27.400> I<00:01:27.430> thought<00:01:27.790> what<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.270> would<00:01:28.390> like<00:01:28.659> to

you the original manuscript which is the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.030 
you the original manuscript which is the
one<00:01:36.490> that<00:01:36.759> I<00:01:36.970> feel<00:01:37.750> closest<00:01:38.500> to<00:01:38.530> obviously

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
one that I feel closest to obviously

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.340 
one that I feel closest to obviously
because<00:01:39.250> it's<00:01:39.399> mine<00:01:39.640> and<00:01:40.600> not<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.960> one<00:01:41.140> that

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
because it's mine and not the one that

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.170 
because it's mine and not the one that
appeared<00:01:41.829> in<00:01:42.009> the<00:01:42.250> sunday<00:01:42.579> time<00:01:42.790> so<00:01:43.000> it's<00:01:43.119> the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
appeared in the sunday time so it's the

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.670 
appeared in the sunday time so it's the
first<00:01:43.329> time<00:01:43.450> this<00:01:43.659> has<00:01:43.810> ever<00:01:43.840> come<00:01:44.200> out<00:01:44.229> for

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
first time this has ever come out for

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.530 
first time this has ever come out for
what<00:01:44.860> it's<00:01:45.009> worth<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.490> I<00:01:45.909> think<00:01:46.240> there<00:01:46.450> is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
what it's worth and I think there is

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.160 
what it's worth and I think there is
some<00:01:46.840> interesting<00:01:47.520> side<00:01:48.520> aspects<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.450> the

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
some interesting side aspects to the

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.840 
some interesting side aspects to the
cause<00:01:50.380> of<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.680> accident<00:01:50.829> the<00:01:51.189> whole<00:01:51.369> thing<00:01:51.670> is

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
cause of the accident the whole thing is

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.429 
cause of the accident the whole thing is
about<00:01:52.090> the<00:01:52.270> cause<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.719> accident<00:01:52.750> which<00:01:53.259> of

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
about the cause of the accident which of
