start to pump up the break you'll note

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.399 
start to pump up the break you'll note
by<00:01:28.259> using<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.890> Phoenix<00:01:29.310> injector<00:01:30.409> you'll

almost have brake lever feel immediately

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
almost have brake lever feel immediately
due<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.820> fact<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.450> forced<00:01:36.780> the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
due to the fact that you forced the

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.160 
due to the fact that you forced the
fluid<00:01:37.439> from<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> caliper<00:01:38.490> up<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.509> empty<00:01:39.900> line

most<00:01:43.829> all<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.430> air<00:01:44.579> will<00:01:44.759> be<00:01:44.909> gone<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.329> this

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
most all the air will be gone at this

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.859 
most all the air will be gone at this
point<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.079> can<00:01:46.740> pump<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.159> lever<00:01:47.479> until<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.720> have

good lever feel I'll double-check my

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.710 
good lever feel I'll double-check my
reservoir<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.090> make<00:01:54.270> sure<00:01:54.479> there's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
reservoir to make sure there's

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
sufficient amount of fluid in there I'll

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.179 
sufficient amount of fluid in there I'll
put<00:01:59.549> my<00:01:59.700> cap<00:02:00.000> on<00:02:00.240> loosely<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.079> I'll<00:02:01.860> clamp

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
put my cap on loosely and I'll clamp

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.940 
put my cap on loosely and I'll clamp
down<00:02:02.549> on<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.060> front<00:02:03.329> brake<00:02:03.450> lever<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:04.140> this

down on the front brake lever at this

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.859 
down on the front brake lever at this
point<00:02:05.250> I'll<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.640> mark<00:02:05.939> crack<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.570> bleeder

loose<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:09.619> we'll<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.890> double<00:02:11.340> check<00:02:11.640> that

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
loose and we'll just double check that
