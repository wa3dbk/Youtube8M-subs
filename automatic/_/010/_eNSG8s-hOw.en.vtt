00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
difficulty staying back in place I would

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.069 
difficulty staying back in place I would
suggest<00:01:38.610> putting<00:01:38.909> on<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> beanie<00:01:39.600> for<00:01:39.720> maybe

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
suggest putting on a beanie for maybe

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.410 
suggest putting on a beanie for maybe
five<00:01:40.530> minutes<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.159> flattens<00:01:42.119> out<00:01:42.240> your

five minutes and that flattens out your
hair<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.869> only<00:01:42.960> does<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.229> flatten<00:01:43.649> on

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770

hair and not only does that flatten on
your<00:01:43.890> hair<00:01:44.040> actually<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.850> kind<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.090> puts<00:01:45.329> it

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
your hair actually just kind of puts it

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.569 
your hair actually just kind of puts it
in<00:01:45.570> place<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.020> keeps<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.409> there<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.920> that's

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
in place and keeps it there so that's

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.249
