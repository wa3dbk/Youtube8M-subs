designated spot as the Bay of rainbows
and<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.539> saw<00:00:48.719> 3d<00:00:49.320> simulations<00:00:49.860> also

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
and just now we saw 3d simulations also

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.810 
and just now we saw 3d simulations also
showed<00:00:50.610> how<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.420> rover<00:00:52.379> slowly<00:00:53.039> defended

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
showed how the rover slowly defended

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.250 
showed how the rover slowly defended
yourself<00:00:53.910> from<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.449> lander<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
yourself from the lander and to the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.770 
yourself from the lander and to the
untrained<00:00:55.770> eye<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.219> seemed<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.390> entire

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
untrained eye it seemed the entire

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.770 
untrained eye it seemed the entire
process<00:00:58.020> took<00:00:58.440> very<00:00:58.890> long<00:00:59.609> several<00:01:00.120> hours<00:01:00.539> and

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
process took very long several hours and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.160 
process took very long several hours and
that<00:01:01.590> actually<00:01:02.309> seemed<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.270> rover<00:01:03.989> was

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that actually seemed as the rover was

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.320 
that actually seemed as the rover was
taking<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.619> very<00:01:05.100> small<00:01:05.549> step<00:01:05.820> at<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:05.939> time<00:01:06.030> but

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
taking a very small step at a time but

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.450 
taking a very small step at a time but
actually<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.810> lot<00:01:07.320> was<00:01:07.619> happening<00:01:07.650> during<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
actually a lot was happening during that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.149 
actually a lot was happening during that
time<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.939> example<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> rover<00:01:10.290> was<00:01:10.530> making

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
time for example the rover was making

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.340 
time for example the rover was making
calculations<00:01:11.840> communicating<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.110> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
calculations communicating with the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.740 
calculations communicating with the
earth<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.010> also<00:01:14.340> sending<00:01:14.760> back<00:01:15.000> data<00:01:15.030> and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
earth and also sending back data and

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.859 
earth and also sending back data and
then<00:01:16.110> as<00:01:16.320> about<00:01:16.979> roughly<00:01:17.670> 440<00:01:18.360> a.m.<00:01:18.540> this

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
then as about roughly 440 a.m. this

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.640 
then as about roughly 440 a.m. this
morning<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.890> moon<00:01:20.340> rover<00:01:20.850> landed<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.960> ski<00:01:22.470> Bay

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
morning the moon rover landed a ski Bay

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.730 
morning the moon rover landed a ski Bay
of<00:01:22.920> rainbows<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.790> now<00:01:24.150> only<00:01:24.479> screen<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.590> can

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
of rainbows and now only screen you can

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.090 
of rainbows and now only screen you can
still<00:01:26.009> see<00:01:26.280> that<00:01:26.640> it<00:01:27.350> recalls<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.590> historic

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
still see that it recalls the historic

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.840 
still see that it recalls the historic
landing<00:01:29.610> time<00:01:29.909> which<00:01:30.180> is<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.540> 11<00:01:31.320> minutes<00:01:31.439> past

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
landing time which is at 11 minutes past

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.179 
landing time which is at 11 minutes past
21<00:01:32.850> o'clock<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.960> sun<00:01:34.170> by<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.350> 14th<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
21 o'clock on the sun by the 14th and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.270 
21 o'clock on the sun by the 14th and
also<00:01:35.700> you<00:01:36.060> can<00:01:36.240> see<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:37.170> lunar<00:01:37.860> probe

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
also you can see that the lunar probe

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.969 
also you can see that the lunar probe
has<00:01:38.520> also<00:01:38.790> gather<00:01:39.150> been<00:01:39.450> working<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.799> moon

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
has also gather been working on the moon

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.179 
has also gather been working on the moon
for<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.850> little<00:01:42.030> over<00:01:42.299> eight<00:01:42.720> hours<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.860> we

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
for a little over eight hours and we

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.240 
for a little over eight hours and we
know<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.450> china<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.570> actually<00:01:46.100> 37<00:01:47.100> years

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
know that china is actually 37 years

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.510 
know that china is actually 37 years
late<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:48.000> arrive<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.020> moon<00:01:49.310> compared<00:01:50.310> to

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
late to arrive to the moon compared to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.130 
late to arrive to the moon compared to
the<00:01:50.700> former<00:01:51.000> Soviet<00:01:51.299> Union<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.930> United

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the former Soviet Union and the United

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.810 
the former Soviet Union and the United
States<00:01:52.530> but<00:01:52.770> actually<00:01:53.310> there<00:01:53.460> are<00:01:53.549> still

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
States but actually there are still

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.490 
States but actually there are still
quite<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.360> few<00:01:54.450> highlights<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.320> mission

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
quite a few highlights to this mission

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.399 
quite a few highlights to this mission
for<00:01:55.799> example<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.549> is<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.969> combined<00:01:57.659> lunar<00:01:58.200> probe

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
for example it is a combined lunar probe

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.480 
for example it is a combined lunar probe
by<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.740> lander<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.640> a<00:02:00.030> rover<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:01.189> this<00:02:02.189> time

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
by a lander and a rover and this time

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.310 
by a lander and a rover and this time
the<00:02:02.670> lander<00:02:03.030> will<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.360> move<00:02:03.540> any<00:02:03.840> more<00:02:04.049> after

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
the lander will not move any more after

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
a year and the rover three months like I

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.080 
a year and the rover three months like I
mentioned<00:03:22.620> just<00:03:23.070> now<00:03:23.130> but<00:03:23.400> it<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.910> very

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
mentioned just now but it is very

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.570 
mentioned just now but it is very
possible<00:03:24.570> that<00:03:24.870> they<00:03:25.500> will<00:03:25.739> work<00:03:26.010> overtime

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
possible that they will work overtime

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.840 
possible that they will work overtime
given<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.420> their<00:03:28.320> father<00:03:28.590> their<00:03:29.100> their

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
given that their father their their

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.520 
given that their father their their
conditions<00:03:30.300> are<00:03:30.390> still<00:03:30.600> good<00:03:30.870> after<00:03:31.380> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
conditions are still good after the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.410 
conditions are still good after the
initial<00:03:31.739> life<00:03:32.340> expectancy<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.150> that's

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
initial life expectancy and that's

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.900 
initial life expectancy and that's
actually<00:03:33.660> what<00:03:34.020> happened<00:03:34.410> with<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.830> child<00:03:35.130> 1

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
actually what happened with the child 1

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.690 
actually what happened with the child 1
and<00:03:36.209> 2<00:03:36.420> mission<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.050> in<00:03:37.530> fact<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.310> chocolate

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
to come back to the earth but scientists

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.050 
to come back to the earth but scientists
are<00:03:59.310> already<00:04:00.090> working<00:04:00.420> on<00:04:00.810> a<00:04:01.200> channel<00:04:01.890> 5<00:04:02.400> which
