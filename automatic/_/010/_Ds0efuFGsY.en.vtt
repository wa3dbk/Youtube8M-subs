natural<00:05:50.740> lashes<00:05:50.950> into<00:05:51.280> the<00:05:51.460> false<00:05:51.580> lashes<00:05:52.060> so

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
natural lashes into the false lashes so

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:59.060 
natural lashes into the false lashes so
it<00:05:52.630> looks<00:05:52.810> as<00:05:52.960> natural<00:05:53.380> as<00:05:53.440> possible

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:02.670 

wiggle<00:06:00.070> it<00:06:00.510> and<00:06:01.510> the<00:06:01.630> bottom<00:06:01.960> lashes<00:06:02.169> this

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
wiggle it and the bottom lashes this

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.400 
wiggle it and the bottom lashes this
also<00:06:02.919> helps<00:06:04.080> more<00:06:05.080> definition<00:06:06.180> and<00:06:07.410> also

also helps more definition and also

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.409 
also helps more definition and also

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
another trick since the lashes are arms

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.440 
another trick since the lashes are arms

we could always put more liner on top of
the<00:06:13.630> lash<00:06:13.840> then<00:06:14.530> to<00:06:15.040> make<00:06:15.220> sure<00:06:15.250> everything<00:06:15.880> is
