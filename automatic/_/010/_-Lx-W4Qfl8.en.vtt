00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
that lies on the second is where we kind

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.719 
that lies on the second is where we kind
of<00:05:39.870> start<00:05:40.169> to<00:05:40.229> lose<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.409> dr<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:40.919> its<00:05:41.280> losing<00:05:41.610> your

of start to lose a dr to its losing your
core<00:05:41.940> as<00:05:42.060> well<00:05:42.210> and<00:05:42.360> you<00:05:42.419> start<00:05:42.659> to<00:05:42.690> get<00:05:42.810> this

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
core as well and you start to get this

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.040 
core as well and you start to get this
back<00:05:43.139> here<00:05:43.470> we<00:05:44.400> it<00:05:44.669> just<00:05:45.389> pushes<00:05:45.659> your<00:05:45.870> knees

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
back here we it just pushes your knees

back here we it just pushes your knees
forward<00:05:46.320> this<00:05:46.620> is<00:05:46.800> hard<00:05:47.099> right<00:05:47.190> here<00:05:47.430> and

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
forward this is hard right here and

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.710 
forward this is hard right here and
you're<00:05:47.820> probably<00:05:48.000> going<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.240> lose<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:48.510> weight

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
you're probably going to lose the weight

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.790 
you're probably going to lose the weight
that's<00:05:49.050> going<00:05:49.199> to<00:05:49.289> where<00:05:49.440> we're<00:05:49.530> going<00:05:49.650> to<00:05:49.710> get

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
that's going to where we're going to get

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.830 
that's going to where we're going to get
into<00:05:49.949> the<00:05:50.010> ugly<00:05:50.280> stuff<00:05:50.490> then<00:05:50.729> okay<00:05:51.389> and<00:05:51.599> you

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
into the ugly stuff then okay and you

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.969 
into the ugly stuff then okay and you
could<00:05:52.020> get<00:05:52.229> hurt<00:05:52.380> so<00:05:52.530> we<00:05:52.620> don't<00:05:52.740> want<00:05:52.800> to<00:05:52.889> do

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
could get hurt so we don't want to do

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.550 
could get hurt so we don't want to do
that<00:05:53.090> alright<00:05:54.090> the<00:05:54.210> next<00:05:54.360> one<00:05:54.570> is<00:05:54.599> the<00:05:54.870> once<00:05:55.440> we

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
that alright the next one is the once we

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.110 
that alright the next one is the once we
start<00:05:55.800> to<00:05:55.860> go<00:05:56.010> up<00:05:56.039> it's<00:05:56.340> the<00:05:56.490> locking<00:05:56.880> out<00:05:57.000> of

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
start to go up it's the locking out of

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.110 
start to go up it's the locking out of
the<00:05:57.210> arms<00:05:58.370> and<00:05:59.370> it's<00:05:59.490> just<00:05:59.729> go<00:05:59.820> ahead<00:05:59.880> and<00:05:59.970> just

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
the arms and it's just go ahead and just

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:01.490 
the arms and it's just go ahead and just
show<00:06:00.330> them<00:06:00.389> what<00:06:00.599> not<00:06:00.780> locking<00:06:01.020> out<00:06:01.229> there<00:06:01.349> we

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
show them what not locking out there we

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.290 
show them what not locking out there we
go<00:06:01.590> you<00:06:01.979> see<00:06:02.159> here<00:06:02.370> his<00:06:02.520> arms<00:06:02.820> are<00:06:02.880> not<00:06:03.030> locked

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:03.300 
go you see here his arms are not locked

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.629 
go you see here his arms are not locked
out<00:06:03.539> and<00:06:03.780> it<00:06:04.199> really<00:06:04.530> causes<00:06:04.949> it's<00:06:05.430> really

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 
out and it really causes it's really

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:07.850 
out and it really causes it's really
harder<00:06:06.000> to<00:06:06.090> do<00:06:06.240> this<00:06:06.419> and<00:06:06.780> causes<00:06:07.590> a<00:06:07.620> lot<00:06:07.710> more

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
harder to do this and causes a lot more

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.890 
harder to do this and causes a lot more
you<00:06:08.460> know<00:06:08.490> that<00:06:08.849> a<00:06:09.030> lot<00:06:09.240> more<00:06:09.360> pressure<00:06:09.539> on<00:06:09.720> his

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
you know that a lot more pressure on his

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.420 
you know that a lot more pressure on his
arms<00:06:10.110> turn<00:06:10.380> back<00:06:10.500> this<00:06:10.650> one<00:06:10.830> more<00:06:10.979> time<00:06:11.190> and

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
arms turn back this one more time and

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.420 
arms turn back this one more time and
also<00:06:12.330> it<00:06:12.750> also<00:06:12.780> forces<00:06:13.349> the<00:06:13.560> bar<00:06:13.860> over<00:06:14.099> the<00:06:14.250> top

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:14.430 
also it also forces the bar over the top

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.279 
also it also forces the bar over the top
of<00:06:14.580> his<00:06:14.699> head<00:06:14.780> opposing<00:06:15.780> me<00:06:15.840> locked<00:06:16.050> out<00:06:16.169> go

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:16.289 
of his head opposing me locked out go

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:18.200 
of his head opposing me locked out go
and<00:06:16.409> take<00:06:16.500> a<00:06:16.530> break<00:06:16.710> I<00:06:16.949> know<00:06:17.789> it's<00:06:17.909> tough<00:06:18.060> on

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
and take a break I know it's tough on

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.140 
and take a break I know it's tough on
there<00:06:18.360> and<00:06:19.320> then<00:06:19.650> the<00:06:19.770> third<00:06:19.949> piece<00:06:20.310> is<00:06:20.490> that

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
there and then the third piece is that

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.770 
there and then the third piece is that
inactive<00:06:21.690> shoulders<00:06:22.199> and<00:06:22.580> so<00:06:23.580> if<00:06:23.789> you<00:06:23.970> just<00:06:24.599> go

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
inactive shoulders and so if you just go

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.240 
inactive shoulders and so if you just go
ahead<00:06:24.840> and<00:06:24.930> push<00:06:25.110> the<00:06:25.259> bar<00:06:25.409> up<00:06:25.590> if<00:06:26.070> you<00:06:26.220> just

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
ahead and push the bar up if you just

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.100 
ahead and push the bar up if you just
have<00:06:26.550> the<00:06:26.669> bar<00:06:26.880> up<00:06:27.120> and<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.690> shoulders<00:06:27.990> not

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
have the bar up and the shoulders not

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.409 
have the bar up and the shoulders not
active<00:06:28.440> all<00:06:28.620> this<00:06:29.099> weight<00:06:29.400> now<00:06:29.669> is<00:06:29.940> being

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
active all this weight now is being

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:32.810 
active all this weight now is being
pushed<00:06:30.659> back<00:06:30.930> here<00:06:31.229> on<00:06:31.380> the<00:06:31.530> only<00:06:31.889> on<00:06:32.430> the

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:32.820 
pushed back here on the only on the

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.550 
pushed back here on the only on the
shoulder<00:06:33.180> and<00:06:33.389> pulling<00:06:33.720> backwards<00:06:33.960> and<00:06:34.289> also

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
shoulder and pulling backwards and also

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.290 
shoulder and pulling backwards and also
the<00:06:34.860> wrist<00:06:35.130> so<00:06:35.610> now<00:06:35.759> you're<00:06:35.880> trying<00:06:36.120> to<00:06:36.150> hold

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
the wrist so now you're trying to hold

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.550 
the wrist so now you're trying to hold
this<00:06:36.419> all<00:06:36.570> up<00:06:36.690> the<00:06:36.810> arms<00:06:37.080> you<00:06:37.139> start<00:06:37.409> will

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
this all up the arms you start will

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.990 
this all up the arms you start will
probably<00:06:37.889> feel<00:06:38.009> that<00:06:38.159> shaking<00:06:38.370> so<00:06:38.849> go<00:06:38.940> ahead

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
probably feel that shaking so go ahead

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.120 
probably feel that shaking so go ahead
and<00:06:39.090> rely<00:06:39.330> so<00:06:40.139> what<00:06:40.320> we<00:06:40.440> want<00:06:40.620> to<00:06:40.710> really<00:06:40.830> do<00:06:40.979> is
