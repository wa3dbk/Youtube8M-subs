00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello dear girls and cute 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.430
 ladies with you julia lanske expert 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.730
 building relationships with successful 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:13.080
 by men. I make a mistake 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.750
 a woman in the ass would understand who her men 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.840
 often a woman can imagine how 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.090
 as if margarine have recommendations on how 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.210
 how to visualize your future 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.070
 spouse your soulmate from your 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.980
 the men here really need to know how 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.920
 do it right but I honestly can 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.260
 I donâ€™t believe only in the work by these 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.059
 method what happens when we start 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.879
 visualize a man do it not 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.980
 quite so we all tend to some goal 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.739
 organizations therefore signing some 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.690
 portrait you can write mass 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.640
 positive qualities as you know 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.920
 each person is made up of some 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.559
 positive and negative sides 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.629
 again everything is very subjective and therefore 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.789
 these positive and negative some 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.890
 the parties may personally seem to you 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.260
 such here very often when you 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.140
 prescribe a portrait of one of the mistakes and those 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.960
 write what you want in the end 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.700
 not 2 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.900
 very often think of some kind 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.960
 certain type 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.210
 although I was clearly told that here is the rule 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.280
 visualization or is there a representation of your 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.670
 men is a very complex task of the court 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.259
 and external possible and even some type 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.320
 more a few types how many 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.130
 human internal energy 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.649
 behavioral things 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.049
 his striving forward to the speaker yet 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.969
 life hatch i sat down a totality 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.490
 numerous elements which 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.350
 often overlooked most often woman 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.619
 exactly with was to write a portrait 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.229
 even starting with some external 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.299
 parameters and behavioral characteristics 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.770
 and here we fall into a huge trap 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.049
 because really if you 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.850
 will meet a man with green eyes 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.340
 not with brown eyes to in portrait you 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.590
 just miss the same thing 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.289
 behavioral thing is not revealed immediately 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.649
 immediately gave me a friend 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.599

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:07.530
 really steps on thin ice 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.479
 what it is that you miss 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.150
 our man and we are not the most important 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.860
 dressing up the blinders prescribing 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.720

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.019
