00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:30.960
 and now 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:35.790
 as the projects that have a sense 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.960
 I think this project started ago 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.629
 quite a while ago and I would say that 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.260
 rationally not formally a year ago 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:48.290
 when we had the opportunity to 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.000
 find each other within the framework of 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.380
 first Latin American meeting of 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.140
 butoh dance 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.830
 although we had a prior knowledge 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.430
 mutual 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:01.880
 and this millennium of them is where 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 we can really perceive as 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.240
 perceive that we say they are in a 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.210
 search I'm like in the same 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:16.680
 routes with an experience 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:19.230
 a little more of the year but, so to speak 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.470
 I think from this meeting apart 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:25.950
 we had a wonderful experience 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.160
 deep and listen he stayed a while 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.740
 in the equator we did a workshop 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.050
 approached this proposal of dance 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.250
 butoh of the Andes' that somehow 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.350
 because they too were doing their 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.810
 route 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.009
 and from that moment I have come since 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.760
 a few months ago 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.870
 let's say doing it in a way 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:53.180
 strange and mysterious advice on 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.150
 what is an ordering of the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.940
 materials to build a 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.400
 dramaturgy or materials that they do not 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.310
 propose as as the fundamental idea 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.570
 of the work and so it has been working 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.170
 let's say from a distance and it's tuned in 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:17.020
 this last month a work absolutely 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:20.290
 intense intense where we say 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:24.310
 I think that I take the tome the work and 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.970
 we make a team very very 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:31.960
 powerful because in a month there is a 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.850
 intensity of at least about 5 or 6 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.910
 months 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.070
 As Susana Reyes points out all the 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.930
 elements of set design 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.510
 to the locker room 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.760
 going through the lighting music it 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.880
 conjugate in such a way that there is no 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.400
 content fractures everything harmonizes in 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.760
 around the ancestral root of women 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:58.210
 contemporary Latin American also me 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.450
 I feel grateful 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.400
 the fact of being able to also deliver 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.620
 deliver this what has been given to me 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.960
 this legacy that is in my heart in 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.350
 my hands is that is this transfer 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.870
 I 've been doing cosmogony 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:16.930
 Andean to the world looking for a vote that 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.540
 have a root a vote that responds to 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.060
 the aspirations and realities of 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.370
 our Latin American peoples is 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.480
 say a vote that since from the 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.740
 proposal of this wonderful 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.530
 delivery that teachers have given us 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.220
 Japanese we can settle down in 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.220
 an identity 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.560
 Y 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.290
 good 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.210
 mama killa is listening to the echo of the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.030
 origin the beginning of the journey towards 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:07.300
 recovery of lost ancestry 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.300
 it is the return to the threads of memory 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.290
 mama killa it is important that you go to 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.079
 Ecuador that appears in the equator 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.720
 to spread it we are aspiring 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.329
 also then that the second 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.270
 Latin American meeting of bhutto that 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.820
 possibly it will be in Mexico and I hope that 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.820
 good that can be done let's say everything is 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.509
 a decree also but definitely 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:36.900
 I think that this experience we 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:39.810
 unites and takes us takes us say is not 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.570
 a goal mom killa I think it's a 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.750
 great door a birth a work 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.530
 wonderful that we could in challenge to 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.960
 everyone 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.020
 and it takes us takes us really open 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:56.009
 new possibilities I think around 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.870
 of this proposal of this bust give us 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:03.199
 from this mother's keel state 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.199
 healthy we have brought together several creators
