00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
be able to bank on it I think we won't

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.969 
be able to bank on it I think we won't
know<00:06:13.400> that<00:06:13.610> until<00:06:13.880> that<00:06:14.240> fight<00:06:14.870> starts<00:06:15.320> what

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
know that until that fight starts what

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:18.040
