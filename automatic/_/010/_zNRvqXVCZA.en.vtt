know most of the exercises try to keep
it<00:00:32.730> anywhere<00:00:33.000> from<00:00:33.329> 6<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.809> about<00:00:33.960> 8<00:00:34.200> reps<00:00:34.230> at

lie you're only gonna be building

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
lie you're only gonna be building
endurance<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.980> that's<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.550> most<00:00:44.760> guys<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.390> a

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
very easily when they're doing compound

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.080 
very easily when they're doing compound
movements<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:22.080> may<00:01:22.229> work<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.799> let's<00:01:23.100> say<00:01:23.340> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
movements you may work on let's say you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.420 
movements you may work on let's say you
know<00:01:24.180> chest<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.840> shoulders<00:01:25.170> today<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:26.159> as

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
know chest and shoulders today but as

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.530 
know chest and shoulders today but as
you're<00:01:26.610> doing<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.970> you're<00:01:27.119> gonna<00:01:27.270> realize

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
you're doing it you're gonna realize

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.270 
you're doing it you're gonna realize
you're<00:01:27.810> using<00:01:27.990> your<00:01:28.259> core<00:01:28.470> using<00:01:28.950> your

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
you're using your core using your

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.920 
you're using your core using your
triceps<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.270> when<00:01:30.420> you're<00:01:30.540> doing<00:01:30.720> -<00:01:30.810> doing

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
triceps and when you're doing - doing

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.600 
triceps and when you're doing - doing
shoulders<00:01:31.470> you're<00:01:31.799> standing<00:01:32.250> up<00:01:32.369> doing<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
shoulders you're standing up doing the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.550 
shoulders you're standing up doing the
military<00:01:32.970> press<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.509> using<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:33.930> legs<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
military press and using your legs you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
military press and using your legs you
have<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.799> keep<00:01:34.950> your<00:01:35.280> upper<00:01:35.579> back<00:01:35.759> tense<00:01:36.090> so

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
have to keep your upper back tense so

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.760 
have to keep your upper back tense so
there's<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:36.900> many<00:01:36.990> other<00:01:37.200> muscle<00:01:37.590> groups

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
there's so many other muscle groups

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.380 
there's so many other muscle groups
working<00:01:38.040> even<00:01:38.610> though<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.850> may<00:01:39.060> be<00:01:39.119> only

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
working even though you may be only

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.149 
working even though you may be only
working<00:01:39.840> on<00:01:39.990> literally<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.439> know<00:01:40.560> two<00:01:40.799> muscle

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
working on literally you know two muscle

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.039 
working on literally you know two muscle
groups<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.430> day<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.390> that's<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.899> difference

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
groups that day so that's the difference

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
groups that day so that's the difference
with<00:01:43.500> doing<00:01:43.740> compound<00:01:44.159> movements<00:01:44.729> versus

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
with doing compound movements versus

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.080 
with doing compound movements versus
doing<00:01:46.140> isolation<00:01:46.799> where<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.610> stick<00:01:48.060> your

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
doing isolation where you stick your

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.940 
doing isolation where you stick your
body<00:01:48.540> into<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.869> machine<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.799> buying

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
body into a machine and you're buying

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.980 
body into a machine and you're buying
pretty<00:01:50.579> much<00:01:50.729> everything's<00:01:51.180> relaxed<00:01:51.689> besides

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
pretty much everything's relaxed besides

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.240 
pretty much everything's relaxed besides
that<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.320> muscular<00:01:52.710> that's<00:01:52.860> being<00:01:53.040> worked

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that one muscular that's being worked

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.130 
that one muscular that's being worked
it's<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.820> very<00:01:54.030> very<00:01:54.210> big<00:01:54.390> difference<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.960> burn

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it's a very very big difference you burn

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.350 
it's a very very big difference you burn
a<00:01:55.170> lot<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.530> calories<00:01:55.680> with<00:01:56.490> heavy<00:01:56.939> compound

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
a lot more calories with heavy compound

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.840 
a lot more calories with heavy compound
movements<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.829> drives<00:01:59.100> your<00:01:59.250> metabolism

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
movements and it drives your metabolism

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.060 
movements and it drives your metabolism
super<00:02:00.240> high<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.380> probably<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.710> say<00:02:01.890> one

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
super high and that's probably I say one

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.530 
super high and that's probably I say one
of<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.189> biggest<00:02:02.369> differences<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:03.030> know<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.329> see

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
of the biggest differences I know I see

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.300 
of the biggest differences I know I see
between<00:02:03.840> guys<00:02:03.960> who<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.770> results<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.219> guys

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
between guys who get results and guys

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.770 
between guys who get results and guys
are<00:02:05.460> going<00:02:05.670> like<00:02:05.909> yeah<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.210> know<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.390> lot<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.659> guys

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
are going like yeah I know a lot of guys

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.600 
are going like yeah I know a lot of guys
go<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.140> gym<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.500> probably<00:02:07.770> 80%<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
go to the gym and probably 80% of the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.559 
go to the gym and probably 80% of the
workout<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:08.940> isolation

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
workout is isolation

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.449 
workout is isolation
yeah<00:02:09.869> exactly<00:02:10.080> never<00:02:10.649> see<00:02:10.860> any<00:02:11.009> results<00:02:11.340> and

yeah exactly never see any results and

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.790 
yeah exactly never see any results and
that's<00:02:11.580> why

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
that's why

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.980 
that's why
and<00:02:11.950> they<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.000> work<00:02:13.210> like<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.720> hard

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
and they have to work like so hard

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.720 
and they have to work like so hard
