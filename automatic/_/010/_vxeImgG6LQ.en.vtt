one lover so I mean tons of these things
have<00:00:16.049> been<00:00:16.139> built<00:00:16.379> before<00:00:16.500> but<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.190> kind<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
have been built before but I kind of

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.029 
have been built before but I kind of
realized<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.570> could<00:00:18.720> do<00:00:18.920> everything<00:00:19.920> with

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
realized you could do everything with

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.529 
realized you could do everything with
just<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.369> single<00:00:20.580> lever<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> thought<00:00:21.330> I'd<00:00:21.449> be

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
just a single lever so I thought I'd be

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.320 
just a single lever so I thought I'd be
cool<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.810> try<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.990> make<00:00:22.140> one<00:00:23.180> do<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> have

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
cool to try to make one do I have

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.480 
cool to try to make one do I have
nothing<00:00:24.570> get<00:00:25.230> baby<00:00:25.410> calves<00:00:25.680> i<00:00:25.890> think<00:00:26.099> so<00:00:26.250> i

anyways<00:00:28.140> then<00:00:28.619> when<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:28.890> turn<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> low<00:00:29.279> her

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
anyways then when you turn the low her

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.009 
anyways then when you turn the low her
off<00:00:29.580> here's<00:00:29.970> where<00:00:30.119> all<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.240> automatic<00:00:30.840> stuff

off here's where all the automatic stuff

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.799 
off here's where all the automatic stuff
happens<00:00:31.410> water<00:00:32.070> retracts<00:00:32.579> piston<00:00:33.300> pushes<00:00:33.480> out

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
happens water retracts piston pushes out

down again and then OOP and it will
dispense<00:00:49.559> lava<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.100> now<00:00:51.030> down<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.899> can

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
dispense lava and now down here you can

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.410 
dispense lava and now down here you can
just<00:00:52.829> kind<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.579> use<00:00:53.699> we<00:00:53.879> down<00:00:54.000> like<00:00:54.149> halves

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
just kind of use we down like halves

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.029 
just kind of use we down like halves
make<00:00:54.570> them<00:00:54.719> grow<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.050> which<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.770> new

just go ahead and go home boop boop boop
last<00:01:03.660> one<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.049> think<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> last<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.369> you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
last one I think the last one you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.359 
last one I think the last one you
actually<00:01:05.640> have<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:07.040> have<00:01:08.040> grew<00:01:08.280> up

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
actually have to have grew up

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.340 
actually have to have grew up
legitimately<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.630> thing<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> work<00:01:09.960> but

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
legitimately for this thing to work but

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.679 
legitimately for this thing to work but
I<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.610> them<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.939> little<00:01:12.270> pressure<00:01:12.450> plate

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
I have them on a little pressure plate

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:13.940 
I have them on a little pressure plate
there<00:01:12.869> so<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.260> can<00:01:13.439> probably<00:01:13.590> see<00:01:13.710> where<00:01:13.890> I'm

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
there so you can probably see where I'm

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.920 
there so you can probably see where I'm
going<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.390> as<00:01:15.390> soon<00:01:15.570> as<00:01:15.600> this<00:01:15.750> little

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
going with this as soon as this little

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.660 
going with this as soon as this little
guys<00:01:16.110> going<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.439> grow<00:01:16.890> up<00:01:16.920> it's<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.490> going<00:01:17.610> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
guys going to grow up it's just going to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.460 
guys going to grow up it's just going to
detect<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.180> there's<00:01:18.689> no<00:01:18.810> more<00:01:18.990> cows<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
detect that there's no more cows and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.820 
detect that there's no more cows and
take<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.860> lawful<00:01:20.159> way<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.680> literally<00:01:22.680> does

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
take the lawful way so literally does

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.030 
take the lawful way so literally does
everything<00:01:23.130> for<00:01:23.460> you<00:01:24.020> aside<00:01:25.020> from<00:01:25.229> actually

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
everything for you aside from actually

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.999 
everything for you aside from actually
looking<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> single<00:01:26.970> lever<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.770> just<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.860> neat

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
looking the single lever so just a neat

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.859 
looking the single lever so just a neat
little<00:01:29.100> concept<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.700> automation<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.659> just

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
little concept in automation and I just

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.390 
little concept in automation and I just
have<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> little<00:01:31.200> opera<00:01:31.799> mind<00:01:31.979> car<00:01:32.130> thing<00:01:32.280> down

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
have a little opera mind car thing down

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.490 
have a little opera mind car thing down
here<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.729> detect<00:01:33.060> everything<00:01:33.479> looks<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.409> I

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
here to detect everything looks like I

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.859 
here to detect everything looks like I
threw<00:01:34.650> some<00:01:34.710> weed<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.070> but<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.210> not<00:01:36.420> too<00:01:36.750> much

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
threw some weed in but so not too much

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.480 
threw some weed in but so not too much
going<00:01:37.170> on<00:01:37.259> just<00:01:37.500> a<00:01:38.990> little<00:01:39.990> bit<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
going on just a little bit going on a

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.149 
going on just a little bit going on a
dual<00:01:42.000> ajmal<00:01:42.360> stable<00:01:42.750> circuit<00:01:43.140> for<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.710> water

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
dual ajmal stable circuit for the water

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.789 
dual ajmal stable circuit for the water
and<00:01:44.670> then<00:01:44.939> up<00:01:45.119> here<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> stable<00:01:45.990> circuit<00:01:46.500> for

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
and then up here on a stable circuit for

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.609 
and then up here on a stable circuit for
the<00:01:47.009> piston<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> dispense<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the piston here and then to dispense a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.410 
the piston here and then to dispense a
lot<00:01:49.770> by<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.250> then<00:01:50.369> here<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.060> we'll<00:01:51.119> set

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
lot by here and then here so we'll set

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.550 
lot by here and then here so we'll set
up<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.810> for<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> weighted<00:01:52.350> pressure

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
up I have for the weighted pressure

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.600 
up I have for the weighted pressure
plate<00:01:53.750> alright<00:01:54.750> well<00:01:55.020> that's<00:01:55.619> about<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.250> I

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
plate alright well that's about it so I

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.010 
plate alright well that's about it so I
hope<00:01:56.759> you<00:01:56.880> guys<00:01:56.939> found<00:01:57.180> this<00:01:57.329> out<00:01:57.509> no<00:01:57.630> mildly

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
hope you guys found this out no mildly

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.570 
hope you guys found this out no mildly
interesting<00:01:58.500> and

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
interesting and

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.370 
interesting and
it's<00:01:59.970> going<00:02:00.120> to<00:02:00.150> be<00:02:00.300> about<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.690> so<00:02:00.960> thanks<00:02:01.320> for

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
it's going to be about it so thanks for

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.840 
it's going to be about it so thanks for
watching<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.830> I'll<00:02:02.160> see<00:02:02.190> you<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.520> later<00:02:02.580> with
