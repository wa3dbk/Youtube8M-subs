00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:29.770 
realize when I first purchased it so I

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.920 
realize when I first purchased it so I
just<00:00:29.980> want<00:00:30.189> people<00:00:30.340> to<00:00:30.460> be<00:00:30.579> aware<00:00:30.700> is<00:00:31.119> the<00:00:31.329> rail

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
just want people to be aware is the rail

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
mount that comes with the b2 from CBA

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.160 
mount that comes with the b2 from CBA
is<00:00:34.899> for<00:00:35.170> a<00:00:35.200> weaver<00:00:35.649> scope<00:00:36.399> mount<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.960> this

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
is for a weaver scope mount so this

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.210 
is for a weaver scope mount so this
isn't<00:00:38.410> gonna<00:00:38.500> work<00:00:38.590> with<00:00:38.890> like<00:00:39.040> your

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
isn't gonna work with like your

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.100 
isn't gonna work with like your
traditional<00:00:39.730> Picatinny<00:00:40.240> rail<00:00:40.300> mounts<00:00:40.840> here

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
traditional Picatinny rail mounts here

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.470 
traditional Picatinny rail mounts here
your<00:00:41.950> spacings<00:00:42.520> just<00:00:42.760> gonna<00:00:42.910> be<00:00:43.060> a<00:00:43.090> little<00:00:43.360> bit

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
your spacings just gonna be a little bit

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.720 
your spacings just gonna be a little bit
off<00:00:43.690> for<00:00:44.290> your<00:00:44.470> wide<00:00:44.950> one<00:00:45.220> and<00:00:45.400> your<00:00:45.490> narrow

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
off for your wide one and your narrow

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.580 
off for your wide one and your narrow
one<00:00:45.970> right<00:00:46.180> in<00:00:46.300> there<00:00:46.510> so<00:00:47.050> this<00:00:47.200> isn't<00:00:47.410> gonna

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
one right in there so this isn't gonna

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.710 
one right in there so this isn't gonna
work<00:00:47.710> if<00:00:48.160> you<00:00:48.310> have<00:00:48.520> something<00:00:48.970> that<00:00:49.000> mounts

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
work if you have something that mounts

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.720 
work if you have something that mounts
on<00:00:49.840> a<00:00:49.870> traditional<00:00:50.350> rail<00:00:50.590> like<00:00:50.800> this<00:00:51.040> on<00:00:51.550> your

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
on a traditional rail like this on your

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.900 
on a traditional rail like this on your
here<00:00:51.880> 15<00:00:52.420> or<00:00:52.770> sks<00:00:53.770> or<00:00:53.980> whatever<00:00:54.250> other<00:00:54.460> rifle

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
here 15 or sks or whatever other rifle

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.180 
here 15 or sks or whatever other rifle
or<00:00:55.060> you<00:00:55.690> know<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:56.110> 22<00:00:56.620> that<00:00:56.650> you're<00:00:56.890> shooting

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
or you know the 22 that you're shooting

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.100 
or you know the 22 that you're shooting
so<00:00:57.489> if<00:00:57.940> you're<00:00:58.239> using<00:00:58.450> a<00:00:58.660> Picatinny<00:00:59.079> rail

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
so if you're using a Picatinny rail

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.430 
so if you're using a Picatinny rail
which<00:00:59.470> is<00:00:59.590> gonna<00:00:59.710> have<00:00:59.980> two<00:01:00.690> two<00:01:01.690> pins<00:01:02.050> that

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
which is gonna have two two pins that

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.829 
which is gonna have two two pins that
are<00:01:02.680> mounting<00:01:03.130> on<00:01:03.250> here<00:01:03.550> those<00:01:04.059> pins<00:01:04.390> will<00:01:04.629> not

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
are mounting on here those pins will not

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:06.719 
are mounting on here those pins will not
line<00:01:05.170> up<00:01:05.199> with<00:01:05.590> this<00:01:05.710> weaver<00:01:05.979> mount<00:01:06.280> you're

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729 
line up with this weaver mount you're

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.940 
line up with this weaver mount you're
gonna<00:01:06.820> have<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.149> get<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.299> weaver<00:01:07.540> scope<00:01:07.930> base<00:01:08.140> so

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
gonna have to get a weaver scope base so

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.440 
gonna have to get a weaver scope base so
what<00:01:09.070> I<00:01:09.100> did<00:01:09.340> is<00:01:09.460> I<00:01:09.549> just<00:01:09.579> had<00:01:09.939> a<00:01:09.970> I<00:01:10.300> had<00:01:10.330> a

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
what I did is I just had a I had a

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.620 
what I did is I just had a I had a
microdot<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:12.460> I<00:01:12.490> just<00:01:12.729> left<00:01:12.940> a<00:01:13.060> microdot<00:01:13.450> on

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
microdot so I just left a microdot on

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:14.940 
microdot so I just left a microdot on
there<00:01:13.810> because<00:01:13.960> that<00:01:14.229> works<00:01:14.440> with<00:01:14.620> the<00:01:14.710> Weaver

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
there because that works with the Weaver

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.250 
there because that works with the Weaver
mount<00:01:15.130> and<00:01:15.340> it's<00:01:15.430> got<00:01:15.580> one<00:01:15.850> pin<00:01:16.150> that<00:01:17.080> comes

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
mount and it's got one pin that comes

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.530 
mount and it's got one pin that comes
underneath<00:01:17.800> here<00:01:18.100> and<00:01:18.250> then<00:01:18.310> I<00:01:18.880> can<00:01:19.000> flip<00:01:19.390> it

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
underneath here and then I can flip it

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.810 
underneath here and then I can flip it
on<00:01:19.659> and<00:01:20.530> I'm<00:01:20.740> good<00:01:20.920> to<00:01:20.950> go

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
on and I'm good to go

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.030 
on and I'm good to go
but<00:01:22.090> I<00:01:22.120> just<00:01:22.330> wanted<00:01:22.540> to<00:01:22.630> note<00:01:22.870> that<00:01:22.900> that<00:01:23.470> it

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
but I just wanted to note that that it

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.060 
but I just wanted to note that that it
is<00:01:24.220> a<00:01:24.250> weaver<00:01:24.580> scope<00:01:25.000> based<00:01:25.299> only<00:01:25.900> so<00:01:26.620> you<00:01:26.680> knew

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
is a weaver scope based only so you knew

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.410 
is a weaver scope based only so you knew
ahead<00:01:27.190> of<00:01:27.340> time<00:01:27.430> when<00:01:27.729> you're<00:01:27.820> purchasing<00:01:28.299> it

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
ahead of time when you're purchasing it

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.820 
ahead of time when you're purchasing it
and<00:01:28.450> looking<00:01:28.780> for<00:01:28.930> what<00:01:29.020> kind<00:01:29.200> of<00:01:29.229> optics<00:01:29.620> you

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
and looking for what kind of optics you

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.320 
and looking for what kind of optics you
want<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.100> mount<00:01:30.250> make<00:01:30.880> sure<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.120> take<00:01:31.299> that

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
want to mount make sure you take that

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.330 
want to mount make sure you take that
into<00:01:31.600> consideration<00:01:31.770> or<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:33.100> get<00:01:33.310> a

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
into consideration or you get a

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.460 
into consideration or you get a
different<00:01:33.760> mount<00:01:33.970> that<00:01:34.390> can<00:01:34.570> is<00:01:35.080> weaver

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
different mount that can is weaver

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.410 
different mount that can is weaver
compatible<00:01:35.979> on<00:01:36.070> the<00:01:36.130> bottom<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.670> then

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
compatible on the bottom and then

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.899 
compatible on the bottom and then
transfers<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.440> a<00:01:38.470> some<00:01:39.100> kind<00:01:39.190> of<00:01:39.280> riser<00:01:39.549> that's

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 
transfers to a some kind of riser that's

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
a Picatinny riser this one won't work

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.130 
a Picatinny riser this one won't work
