00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.650
 mitosis 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.010
 cell division is necessary alive 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.930
 the body for maturation growth and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.830
 maintaining normal operation 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.830
 tissue 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.110
 during the method phase in the cell 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.180
 It is first formed two daughter nuclei and 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.160
 then cytokinesis occurs 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.669
 during which the cell is divided with 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.890
 the formation of two daughter cells mitosis 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.200
 this is the process of distributing doubled dna 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.200
 cells between two daughter nuclei 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.250
 mitosis proceeds in several stages 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.650
 the first stage is prophase at this stage 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.750
 dna condenses compact cueca 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.230
 appear classic chromosomal 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.449
 structure then comes about metaphase 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.010
 when attach to chromosomes 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.100
 microtubules 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.940
 it is followed by metaphase when chromosomes 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.940
 line up 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.060
 metaphase follows anaphase when 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.060
 chromosomes are separated 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.440
 finally during the body phase of nuclear 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.230
 the shell is restored around two 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.080
 sets of chromosomes 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.180
 this mitosis is completed after mitosis 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.970
 two daughter cells formed in 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.280
 a process called cytokinesis 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.070
 mitosis is only one of the stages 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.320
 called the cell cycle many 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.740
 eukaryotic cells are able to divide 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.830
 every 24 hours most of your life 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.040
 the cell is carried out in interphase 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.870
 interphase is divided into three stages of the same 1c and 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.810
 same 2 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.060
 same 1 or intermediate phase 1 these are phases 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.080
 cell growth which follows first 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.630
 interphases 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.400
 during phase 1, the cell grows 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.710
 almost to its mature size and 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.010
 carries out specific biochemical 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.500
 functions to maintain the body 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:07.170
 next phase with or synthetic is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.910
 important phase since during her dna in 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.370
 nucleus cells replicate 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.090
 then the cell enters the intermediate phase 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.220
 2 or 2 during the same 2 phase cell 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.680
 completes its growth when in the core 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.840
 there is a doubling of dna and in the cytoplasm 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.200
 a pair of cell centers appears or 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.210
 centrosome mitosis begins in typical 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.850
 eukaryotic cell it lasts in 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.610
 average 80 minutes 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.190
 during the first phase of mitosis called 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.980
 prophase we first see chromosomes with 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.340
 classical structure they are formed in 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.680
 dna condensation process at the same time 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.110
 the center of the animal cells itself begin 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.600
 form protein strands called 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:54.300
 microtubules finally the nucleolus 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.060
 the structure in the core disappears 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.740
 further follows about the metaphase which 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.410
 starts with dissolving nuclear 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.900
 shell parallel with this from the center 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.650
 I stretch myself appreciate microtubules 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.630
 spindle forming these threads 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.780
 join protein structure 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.910
 called kinetochore one kinetochore 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.150
 attached to the centromere each of 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.790
 pairs of sister chromatids after that 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.590
 Metaphase occurs during which 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.660
 chromosomes line up by 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.350
 centered cells so sisterly 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.270
 chromatids 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.270
 turn towards opposite 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.430
 poles are now sister cells 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:36.010
 chromatids are ready for separation 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.900
 it occurs during anaphase by 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.480
 microtubule-related shortening 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.760
 kinetochora me 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.530
 besides polis cells diverge 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.299
 further apart which makes it easier 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.299
 sister chromatid separation 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:55.840
 at the end of anaphase sister chromatids 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.840
 move to different ends of the cell 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.840
 telophase completes the process 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.360
 during this time begin to form 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.959
 components of daughter cells and collapses 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.959
 spindle of division 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.370
 new nuclear envelope surrounds 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.840
 chromosomes are at the poles of the cell 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.790
 finally the chromosome unwinds 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.150
 and return to a certain dosed 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:27.320
 able to complete mitosis on 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.810
 the formation of new cells remains 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.360
 following mitosis, the cell undergoes 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.690
 cytokinesis at the beginning across the cell 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.740
 hauling constricted ring 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.380
 divide the cell into two approximately 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.660
 equal parts by this time organelles 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.990
 cells are doubled and distributed 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.980
 between the two parts of the cell this applies 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.890
 to mitochondria 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.930
 complex golgi and granular epr a 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.210
 also chloroplast im plant cells 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.250
 after separation two daughter cells 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:01.960
 goes into interphase phase 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.310
 and begin to grow 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.350
 let's follow this again 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.140
 by process 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.360
 mitosis begins with prophase remember that 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.390
 at this stage dna is condensed into 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.280
 chromosomes during pro metaphase 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.230
 spindle microtubules appear 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.230
 fission and dissolves the nuclear envelope 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:26.629
 during chromosome metaphase 

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:26.629
 line up at the center of the cell 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.889
 vano fotik chromosomes diverge 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.910
 telophase is characterized by the formation of new 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.910
 nuclear shells 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.520
 and on this mitosis ends 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:49.490
 finally enters cytokinesis occurs 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.490
 cell division 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.259
 after which the two daughter cells are ready for 

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:58.219
 growth and fulfillment 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.219
 specialized functions
