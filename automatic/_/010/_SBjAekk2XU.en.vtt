00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 hello I'm java nes nice cake today we're going 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.520
 to make a recipe for witch's fingers 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.230
 to make this recipe 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.119
 we are going to need the following 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.939
 Ingredients 250 grams of butter 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:30.029
 250 grams of sugar 550 grams of 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.180
 flour a spoon of yeast coffee 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:37.219
 an extract coffee spoon 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.219
 vanilla and 2 large eggs 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.989
 Now let's mix all the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.059
 ingredients no matter the order we 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.760
 we are going to put all in the blender and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.399
 we fit well normally I like 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.739
 more put the butter after the 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.979
 sugar and once it is well creamy 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.000
 I add the two eggs and finally the flour 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.190
 with the yeast 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.410
 once we have the mixture what 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.060
 we do is put it in a film in 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.610
 shape of a ball so that it fits 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.910
 hermetic and let it sit on the 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.950
 fridge a couple of hours we take out the dough 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.979
 from the fridge and now what are we going to 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.380
 do is mold it then let's 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:25.720
 open the film the ball 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.380
 we take small pieces of mace 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.690
 we mix it we make a ball with the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.310
 palm of the hands careful not to do it 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.110
 with your finger because if there is no mark left 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.120
 of the finger 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.120
 and then we make a trickle 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.190
 we put them in a tray to go to 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.350
 oven with wax paper 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.050
 and to make the shape of the finger what 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.810
 let's do is make the knuckles for 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.820
 make it more real 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.399
 finally once we have done the 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.950
 knuckles and we've put all the mass in 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:03.009
 the tray we are going to place the pistachios 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.680
 after having left it at 180 degrees 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.739
 10 minutes we take out the witch's fingers 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.599
 from the oven for whoever wants there are children 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.580
 they like it because it's more disgusting 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.890
 we can optionally take a 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.170
 little bit of jam to simulate what is 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.599
 a little blood that they love 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.150
 then we take a little jam 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.650
 of strawberry and what we do with a 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:29.270
 spoon 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:31.890
 we remove the pistachio and we put it here 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.790
 we put the pistachio 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.340
 and it looks like it has blood now we're going to 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.160
 place your fingers in a tray here you 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.240
 I make a suggestion with a glass upside down 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.660
 and this is a round piece of porexpan 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:51.959
 I've done a piece of 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.630
 cardboard and a little bit of wasit tape that 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:59.100
 here it makes lace shape then the 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:02.630
 we put over we put the fingers and it 's 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.270
 an original way to present 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.730
 here you have a very easy idea of 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:11.890
 do and that kids love and 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.890
 to spend a scary halloween
