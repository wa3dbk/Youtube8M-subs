00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.950
 hello and welcome matthias 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.980
 here from the mwc just at huawei and has 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:15.910
 me formula of the new mediabiz de 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.770
 that is, and I think that's 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.180
 quite interesting because really some 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.970
 things bring the extraordinary 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.089
 especially before that is actually without 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.099
 doubt looks like 5000 milliliters 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:30.009
 Acute means the device should too 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:32.740
 really last really long and 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.740
 most beautiful eyes that is possible that is 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:40.360
 Namely you have a full hd display with 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:43.000
 1120 1215 more than display and in here 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.530
 clocks a backpack in front of processor us 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.430
 of course, had to see the ju 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.260
 that's why we do not have one 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.630
 personally always a bit sad 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:59.380
 but think okay and 2 gb ram and straight 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:03.010
 this one also comes here and of course 16 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:05.019
 gb internal memory, there is then also 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.490
 have a version with three and 32 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.340
 gigabyte memory 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.160
 The whole thing has a bit here 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.010
 go around the outside find two inputs 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.770
 1 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.810
 one at the bottom and one then 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.800
 for micro sd cards handle internal 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.750
 expand memory 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.540
 the other is like sim cards the whole 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.130
 understands soon also with lte are with 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.960
 connect to the internet 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:36.580
 and up here we have the heads off 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:38.750
 of course, the stream here goes the 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.260
 Tour guides they feel the young 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.840
 really good and very nice that 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:55.040
 is actually the most important 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:59.060
 nice metal design rear camera the 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:03.490
 with 3 10 megapixels and has here how to 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:08.090
 her from the little ones and up here 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.100
 Megapixel camera and an artful 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.470
 interested in Android phone could me 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.959
 quite imagine that this device 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.850
 can be interesting for those 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.690
 thank you that was the matthias of 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.690
