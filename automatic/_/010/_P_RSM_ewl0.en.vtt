00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
okay on this one I think this doesn't

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.440 
okay on this one I think this doesn't
make<00:05:41.250> any<00:05:41.310> sense<00:05:41.550> basically<00:05:42.060> you're<00:05:42.180> an<00:05:42.270> arrow

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
make any sense basically you're an arrow

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.850 
make any sense basically you're an arrow
you're<00:05:42.750> shooting<00:05:43.050> arrows<00:05:43.320> and<00:05:43.470> monsters

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
you're shooting arrows and monsters

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.260 
you're shooting arrows and monsters
before<00:05:44.100> they<00:05:44.280> get<00:05:44.370> to<00:05:44.460> that<00:05:44.550> black<00:05:44.820> thing<00:05:44.850> over

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:45.270 
before they get to that black thing over

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.240 
before they get to that black thing over
there<00:05:45.570> that<00:05:46.020> looks<00:05:46.260> like<00:05:46.470> that<00:05:46.740> black<00:05:47.220> thing

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
there that looks like that black thing

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.310 
there that looks like that black thing
that's<00:05:47.970> like<00:05:48.090> your<00:05:48.240> home<00:05:48.450> these<00:05:48.990> guys<00:05:49.170> are
