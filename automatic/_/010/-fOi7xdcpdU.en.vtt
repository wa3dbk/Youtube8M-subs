00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
interesting decision points in the

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.839 
interesting decision points in the
gameplay<00:04:14.769> there<00:04:14.980> yeah<00:04:15.310> I<00:04:15.340> really<00:04:15.519> like<00:04:15.730> the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.500 
some of the cues are easier to read
actually<00:05:11.130> I<00:05:11.250> like<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:11.580> bow<00:05:11.730> first<00:05:12.060> person<00:05:12.420> in

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
actually I like the bow first person in

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.790 
actually I like the bow first person in
particular<00:05:12.930> -<00:05:13.110> there's<00:05:13.320> something<00:05:13.590> there's

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
particular - there's something there's

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.320 
particular - there's something there's
something<00:05:13.830> about<00:05:14.130> the<00:05:14.220> aiming<00:05:14.640> that<00:05:14.850> feels

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
something about the aiming that feels

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:16.910 
something about the aiming that feels
very<00:05:15.420> good<00:05:15.600> to<00:05:15.780> me<00:05:16.020> when<00:05:16.170> I<00:05:16.230> when<00:05:16.500> I<00:05:16.530> play<00:05:16.770> that

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
very good to me when I when I play that

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.550 
very good to me when I when I play that
way<00:05:17.100> versus<00:05:17.510> in<00:05:18.510> melee<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:18.840> lot<00:05:19.230> more<00:05:19.380> often<00:05:19.470> I

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
way versus in melee a lot more often I

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.200 
way versus in melee a lot more often I
like<00:05:19.680> to<00:05:19.740> play<00:05:19.920> in<00:05:19.980> third<00:05:20.130> person<00:05:20.340> I<00:05:20.910> think

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
like to play in third person I think

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:22.280 
like to play in third person I think
something<00:05:21.510> worth<00:05:21.630> pointing<00:05:21.870> out<00:05:21.930> to<00:05:22.140> about

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
something worth pointing out to about

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.720 
something worth pointing out to about
the<00:05:22.470> what<00:05:22.740> you're<00:05:22.860> seeing<00:05:23.010> on<00:05:23.100> screen<00:05:23.130> right

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
the what you're seeing on screen right

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.000 
the what you're seeing on screen right
here<00:05:24.030> is<00:05:24.150> that<00:05:24.360> it's<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:24.780> Dragon<00:05:25.080> Knight<00:05:25.110> fire

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
here is that it's the Dragon Knight fire

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.910 
here is that it's the Dragon Knight fire
staff<00:05:26.250> build<00:05:26.490> but<00:05:26.670> he's<00:05:26.850> wearing<00:05:27.060> heavy<00:05:27.210> armor

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
staff build but he's wearing heavy armor

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.440 
staff build but he's wearing heavy armor
so<00:05:28.920> it's<00:05:29.040> kind<00:05:29.190> of<00:05:29.250> an<00:05:29.370> unusual<00:05:29.490> combination

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
so it's kind of an unusual combination

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.730 
so it's kind of an unusual combination
right<00:05:30.630> there<00:05:30.810> isn't<00:05:30.930> really<00:05:31.140> an<00:05:31.320> archetype

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
right there isn't really an archetype

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.160 
right there isn't really an archetype
that<00:05:32.070> that<00:05:32.280> fits<00:05:32.820> with<00:05:33.060> per<00:05:33.300> se<00:05:33.510> it's<00:05:33.840> a<00:05:33.930> little

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
that that fits with per se it's a little

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.520 
that that fits with per se it's a little
mage<00:05:34.350> it's<00:05:34.680> a<00:05:34.710> little<00:05:34.920> battle<00:05:35.220> mage<00:05:35.720> so<00:05:36.720> and

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
mage it's a little battle mage so and

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.200 
mage it's a little battle mage so and
it's<00:05:38.040> just<00:05:38.250> something<00:05:38.520> that<00:05:38.550> people<00:05:38.670> found<00:05:39.090> on

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
it's just something that people found on

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.550 
it's just something that people found on
their<00:05:39.330> own<00:05:39.480> it<00:05:39.690> wasn't<00:05:39.990> necessarily

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
their own it wasn't necessarily

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.150 
their own it wasn't necessarily
something<00:05:40.830> we<00:05:41.540> we<00:05:42.540> built<00:05:42.900> the<00:05:43.080> game<00:05:43.260> around<00:05:43.800> it

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:44.160 
something we we built the game around it

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.470 
something we we built the game around it
was<00:05:44.370> it<00:05:44.610> was<00:05:44.730> a<00:05:44.760> bill<00:05:44.940> that<00:05:44.970> emerged<00:05:45.300> naturally

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
was it was a bill that emerged naturally

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.240 
was it was a bill that emerged naturally
when<00:05:45.870> people<00:05:46.140> sort<00:05:46.350> of<00:05:46.410> found<00:05:46.770> this<00:05:46.860> energy

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
when people sort of found this energy

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.030 
when people sort of found this energy
between<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:48.900> fire<00:05:49.080> staff<00:05:49.320> and<00:05:49.740> some<00:05:49.860> of<00:05:49.890> the

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
between the fire staff and some of the

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.460 
between the fire staff and some of the
Dragon<00:05:50.310> Knight<00:05:50.340> abilities<00:05:50.760> so<00:05:51.570> it's<00:05:52.260> pretty

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
Dragon Knight abilities so it's pretty

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.020 
Dragon Knight abilities so it's pretty
popular<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:52.980> it's<00:05:53.130> also<00:05:53.250> it's<00:05:53.610> also<00:05:53.820> quite

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
popular and it's also it's also quite

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.370 
popular and it's also it's also quite
survivable<00:05:54.390> you<00:05:54.480> can<00:05:54.600> see<00:05:54.720> them<00:05:54.840> both<00:05:54.990> tanking

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
survivable you can see them both tanking

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:56.990 
survivable you can see them both tanking
and<00:05:55.470> and<00:05:55.890> dishing<00:05:56.430> out<00:05:56.490> some<00:05:56.700> pretty<00:05:56.820> solid

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
and and dishing out some pretty solid

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:26.860 
four obstacles online correct yeah I

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:33.180 
four obstacles online correct yeah I

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.190 
think so so that's at the end of all the

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.830 
think so so that's at the end of all the
waves<00:07:33.370> are<00:07:33.729> they<00:07:34.150> all<00:07:34.330> the<00:07:34.479> sort<00:07:34.780> of

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 
waves are they all the sort of

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.540 
waves are they all the sort of
continuous<00:07:35.199> waves<00:07:35.380> there's<00:07:35.770> one<00:07:35.949> giant<00:07:36.220> boss

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:36.550 
continuous waves there's one giant boss

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:37.930 
and then you get the opportunity to

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.379 
and then you get the opportunity to
knock<00:07:38.080> out<00:07:38.260> the<00:07:38.380> thing<00:07:38.560> for<00:07:38.740> good<00:07:39.270> which<00:07:40.270> is
