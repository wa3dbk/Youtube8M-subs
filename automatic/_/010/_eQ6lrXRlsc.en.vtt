00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.859
 for this craft we will need 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.779
 color filters cotton thread and needles 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.600
 mouse tail or tie a ballpoint pen 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.730
 scissors and a folio in the way that 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.109
 you want to make the ornaments the first thing that 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.820
 let's do is dial with the pen 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.820
 the chosen drawing on the felt 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.660
 you can use a pencil too 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.050
 then do not worry because the brand 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.030
 of the pen is going to be in 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.570
 then he does not leave, he is not going to notice 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:52.360
 I was trying to make the most of the fabric 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.360
 although you join them in the drawings 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.380
 and then what you have to do is 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.250
 cut them out 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.570
 this is the same step as in the mobile 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.570
 with cardboards 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.960
 also taking advantage of the fabric 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.570
 because you never know 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.570
 so we are going to need it 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.180
 once we have cut our 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.220
 circles our hearts our 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.940
 stars the chosen drawing I what 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.700
 first thing I do is make the hanger 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.210
 that you can use mouse tail as 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.510
 I use yo or lasso then it was taught how 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.930
 there are also the bow and the colors 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.729
 that you choose me as I had the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.710
 mouse tail of this color I use it 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.370
 this color but you can use the color 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.370
 what do you want 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.190
 and make sure it looks good 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.500
 that is well sewn 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.200
 so that later 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.679
 there will be no problems once we have 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.110
 sewn our hanger let's start 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.200
 to sew I sew like a white thread to 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.760
 that is to make it more beautiful and 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.760
 we started sewing 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.239
 and we are going to leave a bit like that without sewing 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.890
 then it was explained because I'm going to sew 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:30.350
 now 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.959
 and then I explain why we can 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.480
 I said before you had to sew everything but a 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:38.240
 bit because that's where we're going to 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.150
 fill it out and I told you we would need 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.939
 cotton is what I stuffed 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.549
 as they are things that normally do not 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:52.549
 wash nothing happens and I help from the 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.549
 scissors 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.680
 and I'm distributing it well 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.310
 so that it is not caked 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.609
 by the circus for the ornament in this case 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.530
 It's a circle but there are more ornaments 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:19.470
 complicated the stars keep the 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.410
 Tips are more complicated 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.720
 this is quite easy but there are good 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.550
 to distribute it well if you like more 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.920
 stuffed matisse more stuffed and if you 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.090
 they like less fillings or even without 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.250
 fill the shop 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.170
 I like more fillings so I 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.099
 I do like this but I 'm your help 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.099
 your diction 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.760
 and we finished kosor hello guys good 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.980
 throughout the video idea you saw that 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.140
 It is very well facilitated to make motifs 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.530
 I encourage you to make them work. I'm going to 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.690
 teach several different ornaments 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.849
 this for example is a star in 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.060
 white with the thread in red and with the 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.160
 lacito 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.080
 then we also have this heart in 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.180
 red that I already showed you in several photos 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:08.140
 on social networks with the thread on 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.630
 white and red mouse tail 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.750
 and the one we just made is the green 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:17.079
 with the white thread around and the tail 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.829
 of the black mouse but we can do well 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.450
 also hearts 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.240
 circles in red 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.990
 the stars in red with the white thread 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.020
 and the red bow you can make dolls of 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:36.010
 snow christmas drops you can do what 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.960
 that you want is very easy to do and 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.120
 I really encourage you to do it here and 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.520
 me and what would make me very happy that 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.280

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.360

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.360
