00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.450
 our motto is the best you can be 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.490
 Actually, we are the ones we want 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.150
 players their maximum performance level 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.150
 lead up 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.230
 you will not live up to roger federer 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.560
 But the players can do that 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.790
 burn and the really fun at the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.500
 have a job and work hard every day 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.450
 that's exactly what we are here for 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.450
 have and we each go through 5 more 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.179
 on the first day with a detailed 

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:40.149
 analysis 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:41.469
 we look very closely at which 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.229
 weak points which strengthen the 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.449
 have players and above we come with 

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:49.530
 then with a concept like this 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:53.159
 want to change things in one week 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:56.619
 We then sign on to make it clear 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.949
 structured training values ​​were too 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:58.949
 form 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.680
 The most important thing for us is the quality 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.920
 The quality is only given if 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.090
 we have a maximum of two players in the square 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.590
 if there are more players it will be 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.750
 sometime to the bread run 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.149
 At the place will be fun at some point 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.270
 camp we want a high quality 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.729
 Offer 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.210
 to offer the intensity and I can 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.189
 just do it by having enough time 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.340
 me with each player individually others 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.340
 to put 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.420
 another special feature of the training 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.040
 is that we are a fitness coach 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.240
 have the very end of the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.240
 children for the first time 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.399
 initiate agility and so on 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.399
 and so on 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.720
 during the week I think many could 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.720
 children learn a lot there 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.650
 not quite like flying with the pros 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.840
 But the kids want her 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.910
 personal maximum and attach them 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.670
 your maximum efficiency in 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:24.050
 introduce this week that she 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:26.860
 then blissfully happy but extreme 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.860
 tired of falling asleep
