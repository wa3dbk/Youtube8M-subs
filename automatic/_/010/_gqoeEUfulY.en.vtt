00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.980
 a citizen complaint put an end to the 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.139
 mistreatment suffered by an American bear that 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.519
 It was in the hands of a circus in Yucatan 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:16.010
 Look this 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.460
 at first glance it looks like a black bear a 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.860
 normal american bear but that 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.140
 unfortunately he had the misfortune of 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.140
 cross the path of the circus garden 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.939
 being a male was baptized with the 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.010
 artistic name of night dancer 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.770
 function after function of town in town 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.480
 I was dressed as a skirt and forced 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.270
 tortures riding a small bicycle 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.280
 and juggle the life of the bear 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.710
 American passed in a small 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.960
 cage of 2 x 2 meters and it just came out of its 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.810
 enclosure to give function until a 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.780
 day was mutilated I do not know if it was because 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.790
 want to extract it in the fangs I do not know 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.950
 if it was because he did not come back anymore 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.200
 because there are all those versions 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.420
 I only know that it was not justified 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.070
 the mutilation of that body in the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.700
 surgery removed the maxilla 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.020
 lower part of the jaw is spoken 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.770
 that he was a veterinarian who attended 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.829
 only horses 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.350
 so he continued working pulling out the laughter 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.820
 and the applause of an audience that does not know 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.770
 what happens when the lights go out 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.049
 the carp the cruelty with which it was 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.689
 treated this animal really does not have 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.170
 background he was still working with 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.240
 this chained situation was put on a 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.000
 veil so you would not see a 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.429
 lucky citizen complaint put an end 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.069
 to the martyrdom of the animal now renamed 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:40.020
 as invictus the federal attorney's office 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.450
 protection to the environment assured the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.220
 copy of black bear in yucatan and 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.679
 initiated criminal and administrative proceedings 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.360
 against josé luís orosco lara owner 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.170
 of the traveling show called 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.479
 harley circus or circus brothers orozco 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.450
 we continue and we will follow everything 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:01.140
 the procedure because because if 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.140
 we can see what a circus is that is not 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.630
 having an adequate management of those 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.009
 copies and so it is so that's why 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.200
 filed this criminal complaint 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.420
 Invictus was rescued in terrible 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.540
 health conditions with a serious 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.609

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.430

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.720
 empower themselves and perhaps waiting for a 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.180
