 Friends, it took a while but the video is here and with 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.940
 lots of cool stuff and new to you 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.580
 I was very happy that you liked the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.240
 first video that talked about the 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.590
 facial gymnastics and that's why 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.269
 that I'm here doing this second 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.000
 video at your request and I have 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.010
 great news 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.009
 I 'm going up to you guys. 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.719
 basically three new exercises because 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.110
 the first series of a series well 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.690
 complete work practically 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.550
 all the facial muscles on the face but 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.879
 I'll be teaching you guys today. 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.890
 specific exercise for eyes to 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.309
 to welcome the defender the background that people 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.379
 Lousy president and teaching 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.579
 to the lips that with the age people 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.940
 begins to lose collagen in china mouth 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.109
 starts to disappear and we start 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.979
 to feel bad 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.780
 Today I have no makeup to 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.030
 you can really see how is 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.220
 my skin I just put a little 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.470
 pink lipstick mascara light pink not to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.439
 to be thus total disaster 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.689
 but come on the first one of them you go 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.100
 close your eyes will compress with 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.960
 enough strength and will to 20 in 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.670
 At first you will feel difficulty 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.439
 because this muscle is not very 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.259
 worked out but as you go 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.360
 doing is becoming easier on the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.310
 beginning I started doing 10 and now I 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.650
 I'm 20 with peace of mind. 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.759
 the exercise is easy and it is exactly like this 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.759
 you buy well 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:55.200
 o 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and released loosely 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.030
 relaxed 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.570
 Ideally you should do three repetitions 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.840
 20 to measure its muscle vap 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.079
 getting used to the second exercise I call 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.200
 Why do you kiss the mellmo? 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.420
 will exert a resistance on the mouth 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.310
 will cause this muscle to be 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.860
 worked properly 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:30.970
 You give a tight, tight kiss. 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:35.940
 and loose type giving such a subject and 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:38.140
 You also do this exercise 20 times 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.590
 so you can 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:44.560
 working this muscle of the mouth 3a 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.930
 series of 20 repetitions 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.370
 the other exercise is quite simple 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:55.810
 just make a mouthful 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:03:02.230
 oval and as if it were a scare and stay and 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:04.329
 20 seconds there my masks are 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.239
 horrible I can not even see mine 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.430
 own videos but I hope that 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.549
 are being useful there for you 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.750
