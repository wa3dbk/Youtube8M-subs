the<00:02:34.799> white<00:02:35.010> LEDs<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:35.700> colors<00:02:36.390> very<00:02:36.569> nice

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
the white LEDs on colors very nice

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.990 
the white LEDs on colors very nice
lights<00:02:37.830> up<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.160> whole<00:02:38.280> of<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.549> tank<00:02:38.760> there's

lights up the whole of the tank there's
no<00:02:39.150> dark<00:02:39.450> corners<00:02:39.989> so<00:02:40.500> it<00:02:40.530> does<00:02:40.769> reach<00:02:41.010> every

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
no dark corners so it does reach every

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.430 
no dark corners so it does reach every
area<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:42.440> did<00:02:43.440> some<00:02:43.830> power<00:02:44.130> readings<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:45.440> this

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440

light<00:02:46.849> on<00:02:47.849> another<00:02:48.450> tank<00:02:48.750> I<00:02:49.700> held<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:51.329> light

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
light on another tank I held the light

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.930 
light on another tank I held the light
meter<00:02:51.780> directly<00:02:52.500> underneath<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.920> light<00:02:53.190> and

meter directly underneath the light and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.150 
meter directly underneath the light and
I<00:02:54.090> got<00:02:54.560> 687<00:02:55.560> power<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:56.040> held<00:02:56.940> it<00:02:57.120> 12<00:02:57.840> inches

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
I got 687 power I held it 12 inches

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.110 
I got 687 power I held it 12 inches
below<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.310> light<00:02:59.610> and<00:02:59.910> got<00:03:00.680> 285<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.069> then<00:03:03.000> I

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
below the light and got 285 and then I

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.210

part<00:03:09.090> readings<00:03:09.540> are<00:03:10.019> estimate<00:03:11.840> depending<00:03:12.840> on

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
part readings are estimate depending on

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.960 
part readings are estimate depending on

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
where you hold the meter in the tank

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.039 
where you hold the meter in the tank
you're<00:03:15.120> going<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.329> get<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> slightly<00:03:15.870> different

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
you're going to get a slightly different

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.319 
you're going to get a slightly different
reading<00:03:16.709> but<00:03:17.549> this<00:03:17.670> is<00:03:17.819> more<00:03:18.060> than<00:03:18.180> adequate

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
reading but this is more than adequate

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:23.509 
reading but this is more than adequate
to<00:03:18.930> grow<00:03:19.790> plenty<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.880> the<00:03:21.030> medium<00:03:21.569> to<00:03:22.519> advanced

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
to grow plenty of the medium to advanced
