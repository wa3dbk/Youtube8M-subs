00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the body height difference the summit is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.560 
the body height difference the summit is
just<00:00:54.649> massive<00:00:55.699> compared<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:57.030> Stampede

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
just massive compared to the Stampede

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.720 
just massive compared to the Stampede
and<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.649> stampedes<00:00:59.160> about<00:00:59.430> eight<00:00:59.579> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
and the stampedes about eight and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.729 
and the stampedes about eight and
three-quarter<00:01:00.149> inches<00:01:00.390> high<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:01.230> summit<00:01:01.620> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
three-quarter inches high the summit is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.789 
three-quarter inches high the summit is
actually<00:01:02.070> about<00:01:02.250> twelve<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.149> half<00:01:03.799> the

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
actually about twelve and a half the

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.609 
actually about twelve and a half the
tires<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> summit<00:01:05.729> are<00:01:05.820> seven<00:01:06.180> inches<00:01:06.619> the

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
tires on the summit are seven inches the

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.800 
tires on the summit are seven inches the
tires<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> Stampede<00:01:08.939> are<00:01:09.150> barely<00:01:09.630> over

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
tires on the Stampede are barely over

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.270 
tires on the Stampede are barely over
four<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:12.090> width<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.619> Stampede<00:01:14.100> I

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
four and the width on the Stampede I

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.870 
four and the width on the Stampede I
believe<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.640> about<00:01:14.909> 13<00:01:15.390> inches<00:01:16.310> the<00:01:17.310> width<00:01:17.549> on

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
believe is about 13 inches the width on

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.980 
believe is about 13 inches the width on
the<00:01:18.360> summit<00:01:20.000> take<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.030> quick<00:01:21.299> measurement<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
the summit take a quick measurement of

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.410 
the summit take a quick measurement of
that<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.700> think<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.880> about<00:01:24.060> 18<00:01:24.509> inches<00:01:26.420> yeah

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
that I think it's about 18 inches yeah

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.499 
that I think it's about 18 inches yeah
the<00:01:27.600> summit<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:29.579> know<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.150> can<00:01:30.270> see<00:01:30.390> that

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the summit you know if you can see that

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.359 
the summit you know if you can see that
or<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.780> there<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.229> go<00:01:33.110> it's<00:01:34.110> right<00:01:34.470> about<00:01:34.920> 18

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
or not there we go it's right about 18

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.270 
or not there we go it's right about 18
inches<00:01:36.380> huge<00:01:37.380> difference<00:01:37.799> between<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.250> two

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
inches huge difference between the two

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.679 
inches huge difference between the two
vehicles<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.799> they're<00:01:40.799> still<00:01:41.070> both<00:01:41.689> 110

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
vehicles and they're still both 110

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:50.149 
vehicles and they're still both 110
scale<00:01:43.579> now<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.610> will<00:01:44.820> say<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:47.720> the<00:01:49.159> Stampede

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
scale now I will say that the Stampede

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.240 
scale now I will say that the Stampede
is<00:01:50.450> definitely<00:01:51.450> much<00:01:51.570> faster<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:53.820> has<00:01:55.250> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
is definitely much faster it has the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.639 
is definitely much faster it has the
Valente<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:57.619> 3,500<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.710> believe<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.810> motor

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.050 

will<00:02:04.649> pull<00:02:04.860> these<00:02:05.009> pins<00:02:05.250> out<00:02:05.490> sorry<00:02:05.790> about<00:02:05.939> the

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
will pull these pins out sorry about the

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.510 
will pull these pins out sorry about the
camera<00:02:06.299> work<00:02:06.600> here<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:06.960> again<00:02:07.950> just<00:02:08.190> holding

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
camera work here and again just holding

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.450 
camera work here and again just holding
the<00:02:08.700> camera<00:02:08.940> and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
the camera and

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.610 
the camera and
to<00:02:09.550> do<00:02:09.670> this<00:02:09.880> but<00:02:11.430> it's<00:02:12.430> got<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.730> little

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
to do this but it's got the little

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.690 
to do this but it's got the little
brushless<00:02:14.620> deal<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.550> there<00:02:17.490> pretty<00:02:18.490> small<00:02:19.080> you

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
brushless deal in there pretty small you

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.240 
brushless deal in there pretty small you
can<00:02:21.700> see<00:02:21.910> the<00:02:24.150> again<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.360> size<00:02:25.600> here<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
can see the again the size here and the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.000 
can see the again the size here and the
length<00:02:27.490> is<00:02:27.880> even<00:02:28.270> I've<00:02:28.630> got<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.020> Stampede

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
length is even I've got the Stampede

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.930 
length is even I've got the Stampede
pulled<00:02:30.310> up<00:02:30.460> here<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.780> front<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:33.700> the

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
pulled up here to the front of the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.300 
pulled up here to the front of the
summit<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:35.500> look<00:02:35.650> at<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.860> difference<00:02:36.220> of

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
summit but look at the difference of

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.860 
summit but look at the difference of
where<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:36.610> goes<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:37.030> in<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.270> back<00:02:37.450> like<00:02:37.750> the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
where it goes to in the back like the

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.440 
where it goes to in the back like the
tires<00:02:38.140> just<00:02:38.560> way<00:02:39.400> shorter<00:02:42.000> it's<00:02:43.000> a<00:02:43.060> pretty<00:02:43.270> big

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
tires just way shorter it's a pretty big

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.080 
tires just way shorter it's a pretty big
difference<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:43.960> these<00:02:44.110> I<00:02:44.910> didn't<00:02:45.910> want<00:02:46.030> to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
difference in these I didn't want to

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.000 
difference in these I didn't want to
pull<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.510> cover<00:02:46.840> off<00:02:46.960> of<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.350> summit<00:02:47.800> real

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
pull the cover off of the summit real

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.960 
pull the cover off of the summit real
quick<00:02:52.890> pull<00:02:53.890> these<00:02:54.040> clips<00:02:54.370> off<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.700> should<00:02:54.880> have

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
quick pull these clips off I should have

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.210 
quick pull these clips off I should have
had<00:02:55.090> these<00:02:55.240> off<00:02:55.480> but<00:02:55.920> no<00:02:56.920> way<00:02:58.950> alright<00:02:59.950> so<00:03:00.100> the

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
had these off but no way alright so the

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.870 
had these off but no way alright so the
summit<00:03:01.890> has<00:03:02.890> got<00:03:03.100> a<00:03:03.130> massive<00:03:03.490> Titan<00:03:04.590> 775<00:03:05.880> now

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
summit has got a massive Titan 775 now

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.640 
summit has got a massive Titan 775 now
this<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.210> not<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.390> brushless<00:03:07.750> motor<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.620> a

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
this is not a brushless motor this is a

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.160 
this is not a brushless motor this is a
brushed<00:03:08.980> version<00:03:09.460> but<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.570> one<00:03:10.720> does<00:03:10.900> have

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
brushed version but this one does have

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.970 
brushed version but this one does have
the<00:03:11.680> low<00:03:12.100> voltage<00:03:12.690> detection<00:03:13.690> in<00:03:14.050> order<00:03:14.830> to

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
the low voltage detection in order to

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.480 
the low voltage detection in order to
get<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.810> can't<00:03:16.810> read<00:03:16.990> that<00:03:17.020> but<00:03:17.590> in<00:03:18.250> order<00:03:18.430> to

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
get the can't read that but in order to

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.060 
get the can't read that but in order to
get<00:03:18.640> the<00:03:18.850> to<00:03:19.120> use<00:03:19.300> the<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.900> lipo<00:03:20.590> batteries

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
get the to use the the lipo batteries

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.680 
get the to use the the lipo batteries
it's<00:03:21.910> got<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.180> have<00:03:22.270> the<00:03:22.360> low<00:03:22.510> voltage

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
it's got to have the low voltage

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.600 
it's got to have the low voltage
detection<00:03:23.230> or<00:03:23.470> you<00:03:23.560> have<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:23.800> have<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:23.980> low<00:03:24.160> low

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
detection or you have to have a low low

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.280 
detection or you have to have a low low
voltage<00:03:25.030> alarm<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:27.250> this<00:03:27.490> one<00:03:27.840> has<00:03:28.840> the<00:03:29.110> low

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
voltage alarm so this one has the low

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.710 
voltage alarm so this one has the low
voltage<00:03:29.530> detection<00:03:30.520> on<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.090> I<00:03:31.180> can't<00:03:31.480> get<00:03:31.570> that

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
voltage detection on it I can't get that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.480 
voltage detection on it I can't get that
focused<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.290> get<00:03:32.470> enough<00:03:32.710> to<00:03:32.800> actually<00:03:32.980> read

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
focused in get enough to actually read

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.710 
focused in get enough to actually read
it<00:03:33.520> I<00:03:35.430> can't<00:03:36.430> get<00:03:36.520> the<00:03:36.640> reflection<00:03:37.210> off<00:03:37.300> of<00:03:37.600> it

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
it I can't get the reflection off of it

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.170 
it I can't get the reflection off of it
but<00:03:37.900> anyways<00:03:38.440> that's<00:03:38.770> yeah<00:03:39.580> that's<00:03:39.730> what<00:03:40.060> it

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
but anyways that's yeah that's what it

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.540 
but anyways that's yeah that's what it
is<00:03:40.210> so<00:03:40.630> just<00:03:41.470> want<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.710> kind<00:03:41.860> of<00:03:41.890> show<00:03:42.070> that<00:03:42.100> the

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:42.550 
is so just want to kind of show that the

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.590 
is so just want to kind of show that the
motor<00:03:42.790> size<00:03:44.460> here's<00:03:45.460> the<00:03:45.790> motor<00:03:46.030> on<00:03:46.330> the

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
motor size here's the motor on the

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.190 
motor size here's the motor on the
Stampede<00:03:48.600> and<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:50.410> motor<00:03:50.620> on<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:50.950> summit<00:03:52.200> big

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
Stampede and the motor on the summit big

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.600 
Stampede and the motor on the summit big
difference<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.280> course<00:03:54.490> the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
difference and of course the

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.130 
difference and of course the
transmission<00:03:55.210> you've<00:03:55.390> got<00:03:55.570> to<00:03:55.690> have<00:03:55.840> a

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
transmission you've got to have a

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.720 
transmission you've got to have a
difference<00:03:56.830> in<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.070> because<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.340> is<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.460> two

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
difference in it because it is a two

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.300 
difference in it because it is a two
speed<00:03:58.000> transmission<00:03:58.660> so<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.860> has<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.160> have<00:04:00.280> a

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
speed transmission so that has to have a

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.920 
speed transmission so that has to have a
couple<00:04:00.520> gears<00:04:00.730> in<00:04:00.970> there<00:04:01.120> in<00:04:01.510> order<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.750> do

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
couple gears in there in order to do

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.930 
couple gears in there in order to do
that<00:04:02.110> but<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.680> also<00:04:03.040> want<00:04:03.310> to<00:04:03.340> show<00:04:03.490> this<00:04:03.670> real

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
that but I also want to show this real

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.820 
that but I also want to show this real
quick<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:05.560> my<00:04:06.160> videos<00:04:06.550> of<00:04:06.960> the<00:04:07.960> unboxing<00:04:08.740> of

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
quick and my videos of the unboxing of

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.380 
quick and my videos of the unboxing of
this<00:04:09.720> you<00:04:10.720> see<00:04:10.930> the<00:04:11.050> antenna<00:04:11.760> the<00:04:12.760> antenna<00:04:12.790> is

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
this you see the antenna the antenna is

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.170 
this you see the antenna the antenna is
not<00:04:14.340> sticking<00:04:15.340> out<00:04:15.490> at<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.670> top<00:04:15.910> of<00:04:15.940> the

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
not sticking out at the top of the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.900 
not sticking out at the top of the
vehicle<00:04:16.630> like<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.930> used<00:04:17.140> to<00:04:17.260> or<00:04:17.620> like<00:04:17.890> it<00:04:18.070> maybe

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
vehicle like it used to or like it maybe

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.319 
vehicle like it used to or like it maybe
just<00:04:19.270> to<00:04:19.450> some<00:04:20.230> people<00:04:20.500> change<00:04:20.739> theirs

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
just to some people change theirs

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.290 
just to some people change theirs
but<00:04:21.659> I've<00:04:21.750> seen<00:04:21.930> them<00:04:22.079> sticking<00:04:22.379> out<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.650> top

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
but I've seen them sticking out the top

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.809 
but I've seen them sticking out the top
maybe<00:04:24.300> that<00:04:24.509> is<00:04:24.689> the<00:04:24.720> new<00:04:25.050> thing<00:04:25.319> for<00:04:25.759> you<00:04:26.759> know

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
maybe that is the new thing for you know

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.159 
maybe that is the new thing for you know
maybe<00:04:27.000> they've<00:04:27.210> changed<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.629> this<00:04:27.930> year

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
maybe they've changed that this year

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.070 
maybe they've changed that this year
whatever<00:04:28.349> but<00:04:29.569> it<00:04:30.569> definitely<00:04:30.750> does<00:04:31.050> not

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
whatever but it definitely does not

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.339 
whatever but it definitely does not
stick<00:04:31.590> through<00:04:31.889> on<00:04:32.039> mine<00:04:32.780> and<00:04:33.780> I<00:04:33.900> like<00:04:34.110> it<00:04:34.229> much

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
stick through on mine and I like it much

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.200 
stick through on mine and I like it much
better<00:04:34.409> because<00:04:35.009> it<00:04:35.159> gives<00:04:35.189> the<00:04:35.460> body<00:04:35.610> a<00:04:35.819> lot

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
better because it gives the body a lot

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.369 
better because it gives the body a lot
sleeker<00:04:36.569> look<00:04:38.449> as<00:04:39.449> you<00:04:39.599> can<00:04:39.750> see<00:04:39.960> it<00:04:40.199> looks

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
sleeker look as you can see it looks

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:41.779 
sleeker look as you can see it looks
nice<00:04:40.680> without<00:04:40.889> the<00:04:41.129> entertainment<00:04:41.639> stick

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
nice without the entertainment stick

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:48.709 
nice without the entertainment stick
them<00:04:41.939> out<00:04:44.900> also<00:04:45.900> I'm<00:04:46.620> gonna<00:04:46.830> have<00:04:47.479> me<00:04:48.479> give<00:04:48.629> you

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:48.719 
them out also I'm gonna have me give you

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:50.540 
them out also I'm gonna have me give you
one<00:04:48.900> more<00:04:49.050> shot<00:04:49.379> at<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.650> size<00:04:49.860> difference<00:04:49.889> on

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
one more shot at the size difference on

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.490 
one more shot at the size difference on
these<00:04:50.699> things<00:04:51.030> this<00:04:51.900> is<00:04:52.020> something<00:04:52.289> whenever

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
these things this is something whenever

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.080 
these things this is something whenever
I<00:04:52.590> was<00:04:52.740> buying<00:04:52.919> the<00:04:53.159> summit<00:04:53.550> I<00:04:53.669> was<00:04:53.819> trying<00:04:54.060> to

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
I was buying the summit I was trying to

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:55.399 
I was buying the summit I was trying to
figure<00:04:54.300> out<00:04:54.539> because<00:04:54.629> I<00:04:54.840> was<00:04:54.930> like<00:04:55.050> we<00:04:55.199> know<00:04:55.379> I

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
figure out because I was like we know I

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.219 
figure out because I was like we know I
don't<00:04:55.590> want<00:04:55.710> to<00:04:55.770> get<00:04:55.860> a<00:04:55.889> summit<00:04:56.629> if<00:04:57.629> it's<00:04:58.050> not

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
don't want to get a summit if it's not

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.570 
don't want to get a summit if it's not
really<00:04:58.560> that<00:04:58.590> much<00:04:58.740> bigger<00:04:59.159> than<00:04:59.460> the

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
really that much bigger than the

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.010 
really that much bigger than the
Stampede<00:05:01.370> it<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.610> a<00:05:02.639> huge<00:05:03.240> difference<00:05:03.690> between

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
Stampede it is a huge difference between

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.399 
Stampede it is a huge difference between
the<00:05:04.560> two<00:05:04.590> as<00:05:05.490> far<00:05:05.669> as<00:05:05.729> crawling<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:07.020> summit

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
the two as far as crawling the summit

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:09.439 
the two as far as crawling the summit
does<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.620> great<00:05:08.159> job<00:05:08.490> I've<00:05:08.729> taken<00:05:08.969> it<00:05:09.120> all<00:05:09.240> over

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
does a great job I've taken it all over

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.659 
does a great job I've taken it all over
the<00:05:09.569> place<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:10.099> places<00:05:11.099> of<00:05:11.129> Stampede

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
the place and places of Stampede

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.040 
the place and places of Stampede
wouldn't<00:05:11.969> ever<00:05:12.090> think<00:05:12.360> about<00:05:12.419> going<00:05:12.719> course

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
wouldn't ever think about going course

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.230 
wouldn't ever think about going course
it's<00:05:13.259> not<00:05:13.379> supposed<00:05:13.740> to<00:05:13.800> go<00:05:14.009> there<00:05:14.090> it's<00:05:15.090> not

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
it's not supposed to go there it's not

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.730 
it's not supposed to go there it's not
meant<00:05:15.479> to<00:05:15.539> crawl<00:05:15.810> around<00:05:15.960> and<00:05:16.440> do<00:05:16.529> all<00:05:16.710> that

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
summit from the factory is only about 22

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.019 
summit from the factory is only about 22
somewhere<00:05:38.039> in<00:05:38.129> that<00:05:38.190> neighborhood<00:05:38.279> and<00:05:38.909> the

somewhere in that neighborhood and the

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:41.480 
somewhere in that neighborhood and the
high<00:05:39.180> range<00:05:39.509> low<00:05:40.379> range<00:05:40.650> is<00:05:40.919> probably<00:05:41.250> barely

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
high range low range is probably barely

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.749 
high range low range is probably barely
five<00:05:41.849> miles<00:05:42.150> an<00:05:42.330> hour<00:05:42.419> but<00:05:43.409> it<00:05:43.830> does<00:05:44.430> what<00:05:44.639> it

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 
five miles an hour but it does what it

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.279 
five miles an hour but it does what it
needs<00:05:44.969> to<00:05:45.029> do<00:05:45.210> it<00:05:45.419> actually<00:05:45.539> will<00:05:45.990> crawl

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
needs to do it actually will crawl

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:48.559 
needs to do it actually will crawl
really<00:05:46.710> well<00:05:46.919> but<00:05:47.669> then<00:05:47.849> if<00:05:48.000> you're<00:05:48.150> gonna<00:05:48.330> go
