can<00:03:24.659> add<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.019> little<00:03:25.290> bit<00:03:25.470> more<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.709> this<00:03:25.919> review

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
can add a little bit more to this review

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.979 
can add a little bit more to this review
here<00:03:26.489> but<00:03:26.819> they<00:03:26.970> skip<00:03:27.269> through<00:03:27.509> numerous

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
here but they skip through numerous

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.490 
here but they skip through numerous
volumes<00:03:28.709> in<00:03:29.009> each<00:03:29.250> episode<00:03:29.989> glossing<00:03:30.989> over<00:03:30.989> so

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
volumes in each episode glossing over so

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.110 
volumes in each episode glossing over so
much<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.739> the<00:03:31.949> characters<00:03:32.340> thought<00:03:32.579> process

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
much of the characters thought process

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.390 
much of the characters thought process
glossing<00:03:33.959> over<00:03:33.959> parts<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:34.949> ending

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
glossing over parts of the ending

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.699 
glossing over parts of the ending
skipping<00:03:35.909> parts<00:03:36.269> of<00:03:36.419> the<00:03:36.569> ending<00:03:36.930> leaving<00:03:37.560> you

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
skipping parts of the ending leaving you

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.039 
skipping parts of the ending leaving you
with<00:03:38.129> a<00:03:38.159> false<00:03:38.729> understanding<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.689> the<00:03:39.810> store

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
with a false understanding of the store

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.140 
with a false understanding of the store
it's<00:03:40.349> sad<00:03:40.680> because<00:03:40.829> this<00:03:41.370> had<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.609> good<00:03:41.819> story

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
it's sad because this had a good story

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.999 
it's sad because this had a good story
it<00:03:42.449> was<00:03:42.750> pretty<00:03:42.989> down-to-earth<00:03:43.290> it<00:03:43.829> could

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:44.009 
it was pretty down-to-earth it could

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:45.679 
it was pretty down-to-earth it could
have<00:03:44.099> been<00:03:44.189> a<00:03:44.250> good<00:03:44.340> anime<00:03:44.909> could<00:03:45.419> have<00:03:45.509> been<00:03:45.659> a

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
have been a good anime could have been a

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.199 
have been a good anime could have been a
good<00:03:45.780> novel<00:03:46.199> or<00:03:46.590> even<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.370> good<00:03:47.549> movie<00:03:47.970> just

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
good novel or even a good movie just

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.849 
good novel or even a good movie just
because<00:03:48.509> they<00:03:48.659> wouldn't<00:03:48.930> have<00:03:49.109> required<00:03:49.560> that

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
because they wouldn't have required that

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:52.039 
because they wouldn't have required that
much<00:03:50.549> special<00:03:51.060> effects<00:03:51.389> with<00:03:51.629> it<00:03:51.750> it's<00:03:51.870> just

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
much special effects with it it's just

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.679 
much special effects with it it's just
characters<00:03:52.530> talking<00:03:52.799> to<00:03:53.099> each<00:03:53.250> other<00:03:53.430> so<00:03:54.180> it's

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:54.689 
characters talking to each other so it's

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:56.599 
characters talking to each other so it's
sad<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:54.989> see<00:03:55.259> that<00:03:55.439> the<00:03:55.530> anime<00:03:55.889> was<00:03:56.040> handled<00:03:56.430> so

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609 
sad to see that the anime was handled so

00:03:56.609 --> 00:03:58.939 
sad to see that the anime was handled so
poorly<00:03:56.879> the<00:03:57.120> 4<00:03:57.329> episode<00:03:57.689> ova<00:03:58.019> was<00:03:58.319> produced<00:03:58.709> by

00:03:58.939 --> 00:03:58.949 
poorly the 4 episode ova was produced by

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.209 
poorly the 4 episode ova was produced by
madhouse<00:03:59.579> and<00:03:59.909> a<00:04:00.359> group<00:04:00.569> called<00:04:00.900> tac<00:04:01.439> and<00:04:02.069> it's

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:02.219 
madhouse and a group called tac and it's

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:04.399 
madhouse and a group called tac and it's
apparent<00:04:02.669> that<00:04:02.699> they<00:04:02.939> took<00:04:03.120> every<00:04:03.930> shortcut

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409 
apparent that they took every shortcut

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:06.860 
apparent that they took every shortcut
in<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.799> book<00:04:05.189> when<00:04:05.430> animating<00:04:05.879> this<00:04:06.239> yes<00:04:06.689> I

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
in the book when animating this yes I

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.390 
in the book when animating this yes I
know<00:04:06.900> this<00:04:07.259> had<00:04:07.469> a<00:04:07.500> low<00:04:07.709> budget<00:04:07.949> but<00:04:08.310> they

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
know this had a low budget but they

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.159 
know this had a low budget but they
couldn't<00:04:08.669> have<00:04:08.819> even<00:04:08.969> been<00:04:09.239> bothered<00:04:09.659> to

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:10.169 
couldn't have even been bothered to

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:12.199 
couldn't have even been bothered to
animate<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.889> mouth<00:04:11.159> flaps<00:04:11.669> when<00:04:11.909> characters

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
animate the mouth flaps when characters

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.789 
animate the mouth flaps when characters
are<00:04:12.479> speaking<00:04:12.989> at<00:04:13.169> the<00:04:13.349> time<00:04:13.530> they<00:04:13.680> do<00:04:13.769> it

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
are speaking at the time they do it

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.159 
are speaking at the time they do it
sometimes<00:04:14.400> but<00:04:14.699> other<00:04:14.909> times<00:04:15.569> it's<00:04:15.840> just<00:04:16.049> a

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
sometimes but other times it's just a

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.140 
sometimes but other times it's just a
picture<00:04:16.409> of<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.829> character<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.459> you're

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
picture of the character and you're

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.539 
picture of the character and you're
hearing<00:04:18.539> them<00:04:18.840> talk<00:04:18.870> or<00:04:19.500> they'll<00:04:20.070> show<00:04:20.340> the

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
hearing them talk or they'll show the

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.279 
hearing them talk or they'll show the
reaction<00:04:21.359> of<00:04:21.449> the<00:04:21.599> person<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.019> they're

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
reaction of the person that they're

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.379 
reaction of the person that they're
talking<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:22.979> who's<00:04:23.219> just<00:04:23.460> silently<00:04:24.000> listening

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
talking to who's just silently listening

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.300 
talking to who's just silently listening
it's<00:04:25.199> a<00:04:25.349> shortcut<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:26.010> I

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
it's a shortcut that I

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:28.640 
it's a shortcut that I
to<00:04:26.460> see<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:26.970> then<00:04:27.150> we<00:04:27.270> also<00:04:27.450> have<00:04:27.600> so<00:04:28.440> many

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
to see and then we also have so many

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.310 
to see and then we also have so many
cutaways<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.700> this<00:04:29.970> stock<00:04:30.600> footage<00:04:30.900> of<00:04:31.230> a

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
train going by when you're looking at

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.060 
train going by when you're looking at
just<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.600> single<00:04:33.840> screenshot<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.560> a<00:04:34.710> select

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
just a single screenshot of a select

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.860 
just a single screenshot of a select
moment<00:04:35.580> from<00:04:35.700> the<00:04:35.850> series<00:04:36.180> you<00:04:36.330> might<00:04:36.600> think

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
moment from the series you might think

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.300 
moment from the series you might think
that<00:04:36.990> this<00:04:37.200> has<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.440> good<00:04:37.740> art<00:04:37.980> and<00:04:38.190> good

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
that this has a good art and good

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.600 
that this has a good art and good
animation<00:04:38.910> but<00:04:39.180> it<00:04:39.480> doesn't<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:40.860> animation

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
animation but it doesn't the animation

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.760 
animation but it doesn't the animation
is<00:04:41.730> so<00:04:42.030> choppy<00:04:42.570> with<00:04:42.900> us<00:04:43.050> at<00:04:43.230> times<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.680> then

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
is so choppy with us at times and then

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.030 
is so choppy with us at times and then
you<00:04:43.860> have<00:04:44.010> characters<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:44.669> simply<00:04:45.510> become

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
you have characters that simply become

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.170 
you have characters that simply become
disproportionate<00:04:47.040> where<00:04:47.250> you<00:04:47.639> have<00:04:47.790> some<00:04:48.060> of

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
disproportionate where you have some of

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.090 
disproportionate where you have some of
the<00:04:48.270> major<00:04:48.570> characters<00:04:49.110> in<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.560> story<00:04:49.800> with

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
the major characters in the story with

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.280 
the major characters in the story with
this<00:04:50.550> giant<00:04:50.970> head<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.750> looked<00:04:51.960> like<00:04:52.050> they<00:04:52.230> were

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
this giant head it looked like they were

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.290 
this giant head it looked like they were
in<00:04:52.500> chibi<00:04:52.860> form<00:04:52.980> for<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.520> most<00:04:53.820> of<00:04:53.970> the<00:04:54.060> show

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
in chibi form for the most of the show

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.360 
in chibi form for the most of the show
but<00:04:54.870> that<00:04:55.020> was<00:04:55.169> just<00:04:55.200> them<00:04:55.560> trying<00:04:55.830> to<00:04:55.980> make<00:04:56.220> it

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
but that was just them trying to make it

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.460 
but that was just them trying to make it
realistic<00:04:56.760> I<00:04:57.090> can<00:04:57.360> only<00:04:57.450> say<00:04:57.780> three<00:04:58.260> good

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
realistic I can only say three good

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.490 
realistic I can only say three good
things<00:04:58.500> about<00:04:58.919> this<00:04:59.190> ova<00:04:59.580> 1<00:05:00.180> it<00:05:00.510> has<00:05:01.080> good

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
things about this ova 1 it has good

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.260 
things about this ova 1 it has good
backgrounds<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.370> backgrounds<00:05:02.880> look<00:05:03.000> really

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
backgrounds the backgrounds look really

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
goes it really doesn't do anything

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.650 
goes it really doesn't do anything
special<00:06:13.470> the<00:06:14.100> rest<00:06:14.400> of<00:06:14.610> the<00:06:14.789> art<00:06:15.240> here<00:06:15.539> is

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
special the rest of the art here is

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.450 
special the rest of the art here is
pretty<00:06:16.020> much<00:06:16.169> average<00:06:16.710> but<00:06:16.919> it's<00:06:17.100> just<00:06:17.340> a

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
pretty much average but it's just a

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.150 
pretty much average but it's just a
dialogue<00:06:17.910> heavy<00:06:18.150> series<00:06:18.960> so<00:06:19.139> it's<00:06:19.410> not<00:06:19.830> really

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
dialogue heavy series so it's not really

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.219 
dialogue heavy series so it's not really
that<00:06:20.460> important<00:06:21.150> it<00:06:21.270> does<00:06:21.479> everything<00:06:21.870> that

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
that important it does everything that

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.170 
that important it does everything that
it<00:06:22.350> needs<00:06:22.380> to<00:06:22.950> do<00:06:23.100> the<00:06:23.340> only<00:06:23.639> complaint<00:06:23.940> that<00:06:24.030> I

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
it needs to do the only complaint that I

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.450 
it needs to do the only complaint that I
have<00:06:24.389> about<00:06:24.690> lament<00:06:25.080> of<00:06:25.139> the<00:06:25.260> Lamb<00:06:25.470> the<00:06:25.950> manga

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.100 
have about lament of the Lamb the manga
is<00:06:26.610> that<00:06:26.820> there<00:06:27.060> is<00:06:27.180> one<00:06:27.450> character<00:06:27.930> that's

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
is that there is one character that's

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.830 
is that there is one character that's
added<00:06:28.470> in<00:06:28.620> the<00:06:28.800> final<00:06:29.280> volume<00:06:29.970> of<00:06:30.360> the<00:06:30.510> series

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
added in the final volume of the series

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.110 
added in the final volume of the series
that<00:06:30.990> I<00:06:31.139> felt<00:06:31.470> was<00:06:31.680> kind<00:06:32.039> of<00:06:32.160> unnecessary<00:06:32.490> and

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
that I felt was kind of unnecessary and

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.000 
that I felt was kind of unnecessary and
it<00:06:33.450> really<00:06:33.630> threw<00:06:33.840> a<00:06:33.990> wrench<00:06:34.320> in<00:06:34.620> some<00:06:34.860> of<00:06:34.950> the

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
it really threw a wrench in some of the

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:37.070 
it really threw a wrench in some of the
progression<00:06:35.610> there<00:06:35.789> just<00:06:36.060> because<00:06:36.210> I<00:06:36.510> was

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
progression there just because I was

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.170 
progression there just because I was
really<00:06:37.740> trying<00:06:37.919> to<00:06:38.159> get<00:06:38.310> past<00:06:38.610> any<00:06:39.360> scene<00:06:39.810> that

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
really trying to get past any scene that

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.240 
really trying to get past any scene that
she<00:06:40.270> was<00:06:40.449> in<00:06:40.600> jest<00:06:40.840> to<00:06:41.199> learn<00:06:41.440> more<00:06:41.500> about<00:06:41.800> some

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250 
she was in jest to learn more about some

she was in jest to learn more about some
of<00:06:42.280> the<00:06:42.400> big<00:06:42.610> reveals<00:06:43.030> that<00:06:43.240> I<00:06:43.330> knew<00:06:43.600> or<00:06:43.810> coming

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:44.110 
of the big reveals that I knew or coming

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.930 
of the big reveals that I knew or coming
up<00:06:44.229> being<00:06:44.500> vague<00:06:44.800> about<00:06:45.070> the<00:06:45.130> ending<00:06:45.580> I'm<00:06:45.759> not

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
up being vague about the ending I'm not

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:47.310 
up being vague about the ending I'm not
going<00:06:46.120> to<00:06:46.180> spoil<00:06:46.419> it<00:06:46.539> but<00:06:46.660> I<00:06:46.720> was<00:06:46.990> honestly

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:47.320 
going to spoil it but I was honestly

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:49.680 
going to spoil it but I was honestly
disappointed<00:06:47.410> by<00:06:48.220> it<00:06:48.250> in<00:06:48.550> the<00:06:48.880> final<00:06:49.240> volume<00:06:49.419> I

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:49.690 
disappointed by it in the final volume I

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.060 
disappointed by it in the final volume I
expected<00:06:50.229> the<00:06:50.320> ending<00:06:50.440> could've<00:06:50.800> went<00:06:50.949> of

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070 
expected the ending could've went of

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.969 
expected the ending could've went of
about<00:06:51.639> five<00:06:52.000> different<00:06:52.240> ways<00:06:52.630> and<00:06:52.900> the<00:06:53.500> ending

00:06:53.969 --> 00:06:53.979 
about five different ways and the ending

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:56.070 
about five different ways and the ending
was<00:06:54.430> not<00:06:54.820> any<00:06:55.090> of<00:06:55.210> those<00:06:55.300> ways<00:06:55.660> so<00:06:55.840> I<00:06:55.900> was

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 
was not any of those ways so I was

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.980 
was not any of those ways so I was
actually<00:06:56.229> surprised<00:06:56.860> by<00:06:57.100> that<00:06:57.310> and<00:06:57.610> as<00:06:58.180> a<00:06:58.600> fan

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
actually surprised by that and as a fan

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:00.900 
actually surprised by that and as a fan
of<00:06:59.020> the<00:06:59.320> series<00:06:59.530> I<00:06:59.830> wanted<00:07:00.340> to<00:07:00.430> get<00:07:00.580> in<00:07:00.729> there

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
of the series I wanted to get in there

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.670 
of the series I wanted to get in there
and<00:07:00.940> change<00:07:01.449> certain<00:07:01.840> things<00:07:01.960> about<00:07:02.320> it<00:07:02.650> but

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
and change certain things about it but

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.159 
and change certain things about it but

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:05.169 
as a reviewer I appreciated the fact

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.659 
that the story and the characters were
well<00:07:07.780> written<00:07:08.139> enough<00:07:08.560> for<00:07:08.949> the<00:07:09.100> ending<00:07:09.490> to

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:09.669 
well written enough for the ending to

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:11.430 
well written enough for the ending to
actually<00:07:10.270> move<00:07:10.539> me<00:07:10.780> in<00:07:10.870> the<00:07:10.960> way<00:07:11.110> that<00:07:11.139> it<00:07:11.410> did

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:15.789 
despite the fact that I wish I could

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:17.219
