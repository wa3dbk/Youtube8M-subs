00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and I haven't been like that since I

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.529 
and I haven't been like that since I
first<00:00:46.980> started<00:00:47.340> making<00:00:47.610> videos<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:48.239> it's

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
first started making videos and it's

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.240 
first started making videos and it's
really<00:00:48.809> weird<00:00:49.020> because<00:00:49.350> I<00:00:49.890> feel<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
really weird because I feel like a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.779 
really weird because I feel like a
virgin<00:00:50.430> again<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:51.120> making<00:00:51.510> YouTube<00:00:51.809> videos

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
virgin again to making YouTube videos

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:55.610 
virgin again to making YouTube videos
this<00:00:53.789> video<00:00:54.059> actually<00:00:54.329> has<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> script<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.469> keep

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
this video actually has a script to keep

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.040 
this video actually has a script to keep
me<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.829> track<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.309> I'm<00:00:56.430> not<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:57.050> scrambled

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
me on track so I'm not like scrambled

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.580 
me on track so I'm not like scrambled
brain<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.710> ideas<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.399> what<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.640> say<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> stuff

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
brain for ideas on what to say and stuff

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.139 
brain for ideas on what to say and stuff
so<00:01:01.590> that's<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.250> should<00:01:02.430> be<00:01:02.550> nice<00:01:02.699> to<00:01:02.879> keep<00:01:03.030> me

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
so that's that should be nice to keep me

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.740 
so that's that should be nice to keep me
organized<00:01:03.600> i<00:01:03.809> guess<00:01:04.250> up<00:01:05.250> i<00:01:05.670> probably<00:01:06.420> won't<00:01:06.659> be

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
organized i guess up i probably won't be

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.870 
organized i guess up i probably won't be
uploading<00:01:07.140> too<00:01:07.530> much<00:01:07.710> far<00:01:08.040> cry<00:01:08.220> 3<00:01:08.250> since<00:01:08.820> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
uploading too much far cry 3 since the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.000 
uploading too much far cry 3 since the
last<00:01:09.090> video<00:01:09.390> i<00:01:09.420> posted<00:01:09.810> about<00:01:09.990> 403<00:01:10.409> didn't<00:01:10.890> get

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
last video i posted about 403 didn't get

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.969 
last video i posted about 403 didn't get
as<00:01:11.100> much<00:01:11.220> abuses<00:01:11.670> i'd<00:01:11.790> want<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.299> get

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
as much abuses i'd want it to get

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.320 
as much abuses i'd want it to get
probably<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.100> showing<00:01:14.430> off<00:01:14.549> more<00:01:14.850> planetside

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
i got aftermath because i actually

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.890 
i got aftermath because i actually
bought<00:01:23.009> premium<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.820> my<00:01:24.119> pc<00:01:24.450> version<00:01:24.780> of

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
bought premium for my pc version of

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.859 
bought premium for my pc version of
battlefield<00:01:25.320> 3<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:27.060> lot<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> people<00:01:27.659> say

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
battlefield 3 and a lot of people say

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.780 
battlefield 3 and a lot of people say
it's<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.110> ripoff<00:01:28.439> saying<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.400> there's<00:01:29.670> no

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
it's a ripoff saying that there's no

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.980 
it's a ripoff saying that there's no
point<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.180> buying<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:32.130> kind<00:01:32.700> agree<00:01:33.509> kind

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
point in buying it and I kind agree kind

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.770 
point in buying it and I kind agree kind
of<00:01:34.140> disagree<00:01:34.820> like<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.970> guess<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.390> saves<00:01:36.659> you

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
of disagree like I guess it saves you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.569 
of disagree like I guess it saves you
ten<00:01:37.020> bucks<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.950> were<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.310> buy

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
ten bucks then if you were to just buy

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.429 
ten bucks then if you were to just buy
all<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.210> map<00:01:39.360> packs<00:01:39.390> separately<00:01:42.259> but<00:01:43.259> like

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
all the map packs separately but like

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.780 
all the map packs separately but like
not<00:01:43.590> all<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> map<00:01:44.009> packs<00:01:44.040> are<00:01:44.399> great<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.670> this

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
not all the map packs are great in this

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.330 
not all the map packs are great in this
game<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.229> think<00:01:46.409> close<00:01:46.590> quarters<00:01:47.009> was<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
game like I think close quarters was the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.040 
game like I think close quarters was the
worst<00:01:47.549> one

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
worst one

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.830 
worst one
and<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.770> yeah<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.280> think<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:51.060> think<00:01:51.420> buying<00:01:51.630> them

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
and so yeah I think I think buying them

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.330 
and so yeah I think I think buying them
separately<00:01:52.350> would<00:01:52.530> have<00:01:52.620> been<00:01:52.740> smarter<00:01:53.190> but

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
separately would have been smarter but
