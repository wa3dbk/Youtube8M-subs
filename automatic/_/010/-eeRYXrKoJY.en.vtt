00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 I love me all the time so that's the most 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.519
 arrogant but I love me all the time 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.700
 whether in difficult times 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.950
 whether in words - of joy I 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.139
 will stay the same I have not started to 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.220
 criticize my person there may be 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.699
 other things that I would have 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.369
 not done but I can not even 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.710
 2010 and the same leg of 2014 I 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.660
 write it both also coach 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.119
 cultivate all the time patrice evra i 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.980
 notice that I answer that way 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.210
 to speak 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.160
 tulle m all the time it's real name 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.960
 but the problem where as grounded all 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.090
 the problem that at home is not even 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.760
 a problem is that I'm full 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.180
 of admiration that a boy can do 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.980
 such a big career with so little 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.320
 quality left-back 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.719
 it's all day that I 'll see him 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.940
 good in the duels that I would see well 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.059
 closed that I will see him good of the head 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.190
 defensively I 'll see him sprint 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.230
 change change of pace and time in 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.690
 time overwhelmed to bring a plus 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.070
 offensive and not to confuse a winger 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.920
 left means with from time to time the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.950
 concern to come back left is obliged 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.830
 all his teammates and a coach 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.409
 to set up an organization by 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.880
 compared to these small quality and enough 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.840
 big defect what do you want that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.509
 I tell you 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.000
 others that patrice evra world five 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.979
 times in images in a season 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.229
 to score three goals 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.299
 you want me to explain the number of 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.270
 goals scored by patrice evra ça 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.399
 I am interested in needing a solid the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.439
 day that will be solid, I'll tell you bravo 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.600
 I'm not saying in a press conference 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.310
 sincerely that does not interest me and 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.439
 I even tell you why you would like that 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.780
 it's not interested but because he does 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.780
 he was seen he was brown in fact 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.520
 waiting for guys who talk to the 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.079
 third person of this a 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.819
 big if it's funny is low and marc 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.280
 guiboux captain I take you had 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.049
 it's terrifying but how am I going there 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.910
 can save how you will like it who 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.069
 does you how can that go more 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.299
 if you have someone in the editorial 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.430
 rmc who talks like it's not going 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.579
 make you laugh you're going to take it in 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.140
 full load yes but year the ben yes 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.910
 I think he's a little barge patrice 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.459
 rannou the point for a complete barge 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.799
 is to me they happen to be so big 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.290
 party he happened for example when 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.950
 they're coming down besides conference from 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.720
 press 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.639
 if for example say someone it is 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.370
 fun too to tell them tell me 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.829
 patrice do you realize that when 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.900
 she the central rear left side the 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.970
 balloon that is already in front of matuidi 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.920
 I realize that you have trained 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.200
 as much the coach is obliged to 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.810
 put a center back left side and 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.239
 who plays at his post and gets a 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.829
 middle left who is obliged to 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.989
 consolidate tommy your middle 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.030
 all this to allow you to be 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.220
 offensive even from time to time 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.530
 to be offensive to the point of being offside 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.750
 do not you think it would be necessary 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.849
 getting better overall that it would take that 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.200
 you pass a little more solid 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:12.780
 defensively 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.700
 the interest of our team after you 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.440
 themes that you do not like these oaths 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.790
 I do not care what interests me 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.830
 it's good for our team 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.140
 de France it's all now you 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.910
 find members and but who answer 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.569
 not already on the verge of questions because 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.030
 good questions 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.700
 we are we are not asked and well 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.950
 no problem that studio you tell yourself 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.650
 some yes without adding anything 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.299
 the door to the games I spoke I add 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.880
 I have nothing to add 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.810
 and when someone speaks like this in 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.690
 press conference 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.120
 and that people consider it to be 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.680
 a bug press conference 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.890
 great that he said things 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:54.049
 remarkable interesting good I was 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:57.030
 I pray you on the way I stopped 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.450
 I arrived they support its local 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.130
 Sunday 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.329
 we can say it differently in any case 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.579
 something happened in any case 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.709
 it's not the language of wood we're bored 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.120
 not like in 99% of the conferences of 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.590
 press that remains patrician evra with his 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.540
 qualities his faults he likes it 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.650
 hate it's clear and clear i'm 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.150
 not there to defend him I do not care 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.410
 but in any case what is certain is 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.359
 that when we listen to him everything he is not 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.200
 issue a second I hated 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:21.060
 space one thing hate but others 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.830
 for whom I have a lot of admiration for 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.030
 make a huge career that you 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.979
 try to do with so few 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.960
 quality you want me to hate I 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.510
 continue to talk about it and especially you 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.830
 wait at 32 16 and with the hashtag rmc 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.440
 rules on twitter it's 13 in 11 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.240

 alegre still no goal in australia 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.840
 and countries that neutralize each other 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.980
 corner minotaur it's not that easy 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.090
 that for the Netherlands for the moment 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:53.430
 captain he 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:55.990
 he loved he who makes the leg of 2010 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.320
 truly I believe in him removing spa 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.510
 comes will not make him learn lessons from 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.100
 worst nonsense of orbey when he says that and 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.980
 when all this has something like me 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.690
 I'm fine but fared poorly 0 ge it 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:09.370
 not pass and that everyone is not 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.930
 mood is the same opinion and that's it 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.010
 which is good we will discuss together 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.010
