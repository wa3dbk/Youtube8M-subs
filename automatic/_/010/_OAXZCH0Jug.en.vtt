colonise and we look through that but I

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.040 
colonise and we look through that but I
just<00:00:44.550> feel<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.300> want<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.539> bit<00:00:45.660> more<00:00:45.690> blonde

section<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.930> put<00:01:49.140> some<00:01:49.170> shea<00:01:49.560> butter<00:01:49.799> on

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
section and I put some shea butter on

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.130 
section and I put some shea butter on
the<00:01:50.070> end<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> protect<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.930> also

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
the end just to protect it and it also

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
the end just to protect it and it also
makes<00:01:52.380> this<00:01:52.560> sort<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> it's<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.340> type<00:01:53.670> of

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
makes this sort of it's this type of

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.230 
makes this sort of it's this type of
consistency<00:01:54.450> it's<00:01:54.899> quite<00:01:55.170> serious<00:01:55.770> term<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.850> do

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
consistency it's quite serious term I do

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.340 
consistency it's quite serious term I do
listen<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.869> box<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.409> sometimes<00:01:58.680> I<00:01:59.130> will

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
listen to the box and sometimes I will

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.480 
listen to the box and sometimes I will
mix<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.469> how<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.619> box<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:01.950> what<00:02:02.070> sometimes<00:02:02.280> I

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
mix it how the box is what sometimes I

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.830 
mix it how the box is what sometimes I
don't<00:02:02.549> like<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> consistency<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.750> is

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
don't like the consistency that it is

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.480 
don't like the consistency that it is
and<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.170> find<00:02:04.409> it's<00:02:04.619> quite<00:02:04.680> hard<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.100> work<00:02:05.280> with

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
and I find it's quite hard to work with

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.330 
and I find it's quite hard to work with
so<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.759> make<00:02:06.000> mine<00:02:06.270> quite<00:02:06.509> creamy<00:02:06.810> more<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.350> a

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
so I make mine quite creamy more like a

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.620 
so I make mine quite creamy more like a
your<00:02:09.340> Monica<00:02:09.640> cream<00:02:09.820> 1<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.030> could<00:02:10.149> condition

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
your Monica cream 1 I could condition

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.380 
your Monica cream 1 I could condition
their<00:02:10.810> type<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.290> consistency<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.940> can<00:02:13.150> look

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
their type of consistency you can look

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:23.520 
their type of consistency you can look
at<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:16.080> literally<00:02:17.080> paste<00:02:17.560> it<00:02:17.980> on<00:02:22.350> if<00:02:23.350> you

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
to just do the top bit and then I don't

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.230 
to just do the top bit and then I don't
want<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.710> be<00:02:38.830> like<00:02:39.070> a<00:02:39.100> dead<00:02:39.370> straight<00:02:39.730> line<00:02:39.940> so

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
want to be like a dead straight line so

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.800 
want to be like a dead straight line so
I'm<00:02:40.570> gonna<00:02:40.840> be<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:41.770> kind<00:02:41.950> of<00:02:42.690> running<00:02:43.690> the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810

yes there anyway because as well the
bleach<00:02:57.049> would<00:02:57.290> expand<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:58.010> go<00:02:58.189> further<00:02:58.400> down

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840
