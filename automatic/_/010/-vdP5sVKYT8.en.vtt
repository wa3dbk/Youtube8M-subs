which looks quite promising I've been a

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.860 
which looks quite promising I've been a
bit<00:03:32.620> slow<00:03:32.800> talking<00:03:33.430> all<00:03:33.520> this<00:03:33.640> nonsense<00:03:33.840> so<00:03:34.840> I

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
bit slow talking all this nonsense so I

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.450 
bit slow talking all this nonsense so I
should<00:03:35.140> speed<00:03:35.530> up<00:03:35.560> a<00:03:35.770> little<00:03:35.950> bit<00:03:36.130> at<00:03:36.250> some

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:36.460 
should speed up a little bit at some

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.610 
should speed up a little bit at some
point<00:03:36.730> Quincy<00:03:37.300> v<00:03:37.570> he<00:03:37.810> doesn't<00:03:38.110> threaten<00:03:38.320> mate

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
point Quincy v he doesn't threaten mate

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.530 
point Quincy v he doesn't threaten mate
so<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.220> will<00:03:39.460> go<00:03:40.240> Queen<00:03:40.600> takes<00:03:40.810> b6<00:03:42.360> quite<00:03:43.360> like
