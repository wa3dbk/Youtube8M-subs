00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
image this one's for view press five and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.640 
image this one's for view press five and
this<00:01:29.280> one's<00:01:29.690> side<00:01:30.690> wave<00:01:30.900> one<00:01:31.110> person<00:01:31.410> three

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
this one's side wave one person three

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.130 
this one's side wave one person three
and<00:01:31.920> then<00:01:32.070> prescribe<00:01:32.550> this<00:01:32.970> one's<00:01:33.240> one<00:01:33.930> right

and then prescribe this one's one right

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.360 
and then prescribe this one's one right
way<00:01:34.430> right<00:01:35.430> now

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:38.370 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.630 

now<00:01:39.210> this<00:01:39.510> will<00:01:39.750> take<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.050> while<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.800> me<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.430> set

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
now this will take a while for me to set

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.730 
now this will take a while for me to set
up<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.520> I'm<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.610> going<00:01:44.760> to<00:01:44.820> tell<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.900> how<00:01:46.170> it

up so I'm just going to tell you how it

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.680 
up so I'm just going to tell you how it
all<00:01:46.830> works<00:01:47.100> and<00:01:47.460> then<00:01:47.790> I'll<00:01:47.910> speak<00:01:48.240> through<00:01:48.540> it

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
all works and then I'll speak through it

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.780 
all works and then I'll speak through it
and<00:01:49.400> then<00:01:50.450> there<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.010> size<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
and then there we go to the size is the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.480 
and then there we go to the size is the
size<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.180> image<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.690> background<00:01:54.720> you

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
size of image in the background you

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.990 
size of image in the background you
follow<00:01:56.490> these<00:01:56.550> five<00:01:56.760> as<00:01:56.940> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.150> see<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:59.000> X

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
follow these five as you can see and X

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.960 
follow these five as you can see and X
is<00:02:00.420> moving<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.290> image<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.770> x-axis<00:02:02.310> left

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
is moving the image on the x-axis left

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.630 
is moving the image on the x-axis left
and<00:02:03.180> right<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:04.410> Y<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.590> on<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.100> y-axis<00:02:05.250> up

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and right and the Y is on the y-axis up

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.610 
and right and the Y is on the y-axis up
and<00:02:05.790> down<00:02:05.940> so<00:02:06.330> depending<00:02:07.050> on<00:02:07.140> what<00:02:07.290> numbers

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
and down so depending on what numbers

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.639 
and down so depending on what numbers
you<00:02:07.650> have<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:09.390> know<00:02:09.540> it<00:02:09.750> places<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.260> image

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
you have you know it places the image

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.980 
you have you know it places the image
wherever<00:02:11.100> you<00:02:11.160> want<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:12.030> how<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.450> speak<00:02:12.780> for

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
wherever you want so how to speak for

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:54.559 
wherever you want so how to speak for
this<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:14.280> then<00:02:15.090> there<00:02:15.240> we<00:02:15.330> go

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.770 

pull<00:02:55.569> this<00:02:55.720> up<00:02:55.780> here<00:02:56.110> so<00:02:56.440> you<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:57.600> have<00:02:58.600> the
