00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.899 
one of those things I'll say was were
that<00:01:38.009> better<00:01:38.189> because<00:01:38.400> everybody<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.820> guess

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
that better because everybody I guess

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.940 
that better because everybody I guess
then<00:01:39.240> knew<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:40.140> when<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.350> started<00:01:40.619> long<00:01:40.740> job

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
then knew that's when I started long job

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.350 
then knew that's when I started long job
because<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.220> coaches<00:01:41.400> seen<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.790> jump

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
because the coaches seen you jump

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.149 
because the coaches seen you jump
dunking<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.140> ball<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.070> those

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
dunking the ball so I was one of those

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.770
