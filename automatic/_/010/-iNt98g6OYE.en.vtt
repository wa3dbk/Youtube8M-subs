 hi people welcome and nice that you look 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.060
 a new true story 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.800
 today i have a true story 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.840
 for you about love and betrayal and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.410
 powerlessness and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.630
 festivities the story starts then 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.670
 This Thomas just a little Thomas you 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.769
 was about seven years was in the wash 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.260
 Saturday and this was like a Saturday 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.140
 never before was never a Saturday 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.449
 as peaceful as this Saturday I came 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.430
 downstairs and a breakfast was ready 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.469
 with my name on it not literally mine 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.059
 name on it but he was for me while 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.129
 I have this delicious breakfast to you 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.500
 useful laundry my mother came to me 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.649
 and my mother spoke to me she said 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.329
 thomas today is the neighbor's birthday 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.329
 that's where we go birthdays 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.520
 in our street means so much baguette 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.449
 with herb butter if you want a piece 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.690
 cake 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.539
 soft drinks and neighboring boys 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.859
 who were just as wanton as I was 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:04.290
 ie lol ie party 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.939
 week when I was wearing my best outfit 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.350
 pulled and we were about to 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.490
 my mother spoke this one 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.229
 legendary words 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.060
 there were two and never in the 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.420
 human history have two 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:20.070
 words mean so much 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.780
 she said we are going and what i went then 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.400
 However, did not yet know that it is on it 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.040
 something would happen that the 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.790
 going into history books will be okay 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.049
 maybe it 's not the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.460
 in history books but it was 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.810
 very intense what would happen 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.090
 but I tell you more later on we 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.829
 arrived at the party and the were already 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.280
 neighbor boys we went upstairs right away 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.509
 we went to get some mischief 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.909
 I don't know anymore what does not work either 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.829
 maybe the girls are teasing 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.649
 who does not know this after removing this 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.079
 to be referred to as mischief 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.850
 got a bit of a feeling in us though 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.969
 a feeling what you could label 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.189
 like hunger and that means one thing to 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.090
 down to the baguette with 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.610
 herb butter 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.750
 after an epic journey down the stairs to 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.090
 downstairs we arrived in the main room 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.039
 also known as the living room you know 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.310
 I felt that day 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.870
 I lovingly decided to give my dad extra 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.849
 to give love 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.670
 I embrace the best man after I get the 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:25.380
 words had spoken hepa how are you 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.120
 now i hear people laughing and i thought yes 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.180

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.920

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.000
 what you think 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.780

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.750
 already embraces 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.930
 I look at what my eye sees my father 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.030
 not in my arms no he is that three 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.590
 seats later in the beginning I thought 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.220
 what kind of magic is this 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.060
 two fathers since when do I have two 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:56.160
 fathers after which shortly afterwards the realization 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.230
 the person in my arms didn't come 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.079
 my father 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.079
 it was in fact 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.590
 my neighbor it was my audience 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.090
 my neighbor on the cross square I said 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.700

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.299

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.879
 have someone 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:24.719
 given love and that is something never 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:29.090
