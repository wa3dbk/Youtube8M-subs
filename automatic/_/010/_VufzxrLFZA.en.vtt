more efficiently on the computer and

more efficiently on the computer and
this<00:00:22.770> means<00:00:23.070> that<00:00:23.340> I<00:00:23.460> am<00:00:23.580> instantly<00:00:23.910> involved

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
this means that I am instantly involved

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.320 
this means that I am instantly involved
with<00:00:24.840> building<00:00:25.710> compilers<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.820> in

with building compilers and in

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.080 
with building compilers and in
particular<00:00:27.570> how<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> translate<00:00:29.190> programming

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
particular how to translate programming

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.269 
particular how to translate programming
languages<00:00:30.539> into<00:00:31.050> efficient<00:00:31.619> patterns<00:00:32.039> of

held<00:00:36.089> my<00:00:36.269> interests<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.229> I<00:00:37.260> have

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
held my interests and so I have

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.529 
held my interests and so I have
occasionally<00:00:38.190> deviated<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.030> done<00:00:39.300> other

things like I worked in virtual memory
and<00:00:41.940> I've<00:00:42.120> worked<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.809> data<00:00:43.469> compression<00:00:43.920> as

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
and I've worked in data compression as

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.579 
and I've worked in data compression as
little<00:00:44.760> sidelines<00:00:45.299> but<00:00:45.929> I<00:00:46.019> keep<00:00:46.229> coming<00:00:46.409> back

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:46.589 
little sidelines but I keep coming back

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:48.889 
little sidelines but I keep coming back
to<00:00:46.710> compilers<00:00:47.370> well<00:00:47.850> my<00:00:48.059> latest<00:00:48.479> work<00:00:48.659> in

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
to compilers well my latest work in

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.930 
to compilers well my latest work in
compilers<00:00:49.559> has<00:00:49.799> been<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.039> conjunction<00:00:50.639> with<00:00:50.789> a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
compilers has been a conjunction with a

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.549 
compilers has been a conjunction with a
PhD<00:00:51.809> student<00:00:51.839> who<00:00:52.530> recently<00:00:52.739> graduated<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
PhD student who recently graduated and

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.299 
PhD student who recently graduated and
we<00:00:55.559> were<00:00:56.010> focused<00:00:56.549> on<00:00:56.819> how<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.600> could<00:00:58.309> improve

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
we were focused on how you could improve

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.849 
we were focused on how you could improve
the<00:00:59.729> quality<00:00:59.879> of<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:00.690> code<00:01:00.959> if<00:01:01.229> all<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.619> knew

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
the quality of the code if all you knew

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.700 
the quality of the code if all you knew
was<00:01:02.089> which<00:01:03.089> portions<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> code<00:01:04.229> were<00:01:04.470> hot

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
was which portions of the code were hot

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.160 
was which portions of the code were hot
and<00:01:04.980> which<00:01:05.309> portions<00:01:05.760> were<00:01:05.910> cold<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.480> by

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
and which portions were cold and by

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.860 
and which portions were cold and by
heart<00:01:07.500> we<00:01:07.770> mean<00:01:07.980> execute<00:01:08.730> fairly<00:01:09.420> frequently

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
heart we mean execute fairly frequently

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.340 
heart we mean execute fairly frequently
and<00:01:10.230> coldly<00:01:10.680> meaning<00:01:11.100> frequently<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.960> idea

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
and coldly meaning frequently the idea

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.520 
and coldly meaning frequently the idea
is<00:01:13.440> that<00:01:13.620> we<00:01:14.310> try<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.850> move<00:01:15.530> computations

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
is that we try and move computations

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520 
is that we try and move computations
into<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> cold<00:01:17.550> region<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.300> the<00:01:18.420> program<00:01:18.870> so

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
into the cold region of the program so

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.350 
into the cold region of the program so
that<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.860> results<00:01:20.340> can<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.640> used<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.210> hot

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
that the results can be used in the hot

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.630 
that the results can be used in the hot
region<00:01:21.870> of<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.020> program<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.100> reduce<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
region of the program and so reduce the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.700 
region of the program and so reduce the
amount<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:24.030> work<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> has<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.780> be<00:01:24.930> repeated<00:01:25.530> I

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
amount of work that has to be repeated I

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.500 
amount of work that has to be repeated I
am<00:01:26.300> working<00:01:27.300> on<00:01:27.450> optimization<00:01:28.380> of

efficiently on that particular pattern
of<00:02:00.060> execution<00:02:00.780> and<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.680> way<00:02:01.830> in<00:02:01.979> which

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
we can make a language like Java or C

we can make a language like Java or C
sharp<00:02:06.360> execute<00:02:07.050> more<00:02:07.320> efficiently<00:02:07.860> than<00:02:08.429> the

the course and after the students become

the course and after the students become
familiar<00:03:11.250> with<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.640> they're<00:03:12.060> no<00:03:12.180> longer

getting error messages when they try and
assemble<00:03:14.880> their<00:03:15.000> programs<00:03:15.390> we<00:03:15.630> then<00:03:15.840> move

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
assemble their programs we then move

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.229 
assemble their programs we then move
them<00:03:16.200> onto<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.650> real<00:03:16.799> hardware<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.549> at<00:03:18.120> that

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
them onto the real hardware and at that

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.360 
them onto the real hardware and at that
point<00:03:18.570> they<00:03:19.350> are<00:03:19.380> doing<00:03:19.769> some<00:03:20.070> very

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
point they are doing some very

point they are doing some very
interesting<00:03:20.700> projects<00:03:21.390> for<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.540> course<00:03:21.810> I

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
interesting projects for the course I

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.199 
interesting projects for the course I
was<00:03:22.320> very<00:03:22.500> interested<00:03:22.829> in<00:03:23.250> C<00:03:23.519> sharp<00:03:23.549> as<00:03:24.180> a
