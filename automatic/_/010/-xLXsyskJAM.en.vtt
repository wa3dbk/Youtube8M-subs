the<00:04:00.650> gas<00:04:00.860> efficiency<00:04:01.580> for<00:04:02.030> that<00:04:02.230> but<00:04:03.230> even<00:04:03.500> if

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:03.740 
the gas efficiency for that but even if

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.060 
the gas efficiency for that but even if
I<00:04:03.890> had<00:04:04.010> drove<00:04:04.670> this<00:04:04.850> bike<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.510> grandmother

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
I had drove this bike like a grandmother

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.730 
I had drove this bike like a grandmother
it's<00:04:07.070> probably<00:04:07.790> only<00:04:07.940> get<00:04:08.300> 45<00:04:08.570> to<00:04:08.930> 50<00:04:09.260> miles

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
it's probably only get 45 to 50 miles

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.650 
it's probably only get 45 to 50 miles
per<00:04:09.860> gallon<00:04:11.650> where<00:04:12.650> I've<00:04:13.010> heard<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.970> 250s<00:04:14.540> can

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
per gallon where I've heard the 250s can

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.229 
per gallon where I've heard the 250s can
get<00:04:14.780> about<00:04:14.959> 70<00:04:15.530> miles<00:04:15.770> per<00:04:15.980> gallon<00:04:16.160> okay<00:04:17.120> so

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
get about 70 miles per gallon okay so

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.539 
get about 70 miles per gallon okay so
keep<00:04:17.480> that<00:04:17.510> in<00:04:17.630> mind<00:04:17.810> if<00:04:17.959> he<00:04:18.109> if<00:04:18.380> the<00:04:18.950> price<00:04:19.220> of

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
keep that in mind if he if the price of

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.090 
keep that in mind if he if the price of
gas<00:04:20.450> okay<00:04:21.440> it's<00:04:21.620> going<00:04:21.920> to<00:04:21.980> be<00:04:22.070> a

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
gas okay it's going to be a

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.640 
gas okay it's going to be a
consideration<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.600> 250<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.169> definitely<00:04:24.590> the

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
consideration the 250 is definitely the

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.730 
consideration the 250 is definitely the
