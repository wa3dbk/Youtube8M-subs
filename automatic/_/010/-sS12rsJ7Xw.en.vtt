00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.680
 as we all know the schubert and c3 is one 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
 of the most optical assembly molds 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.130
 of interports 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:18.139
 then in this case it is called with 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:18.139
 so not a model of the sena lifecam 10r 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.630
 an intercom divided into two stages into 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.450
 plus the kit and audio then battery 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.869
 separate control unit and audio kit that goes 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:33.809
 mounted in case we choose the point of 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.170
 assembly that presses little in this is 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.540
 the most convincing one make a sign 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.240
 on the plaque that we will carry and that 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.410
 we will cut in advance to the attack of the 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.410
 reflective area 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.530
 let's remove the collar 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.280
 and for correct assembly 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.540
 let 's proceed to an incision 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.800
 inside to be able to pass the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.800
 control unit wiring 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.530
 with a well-trusted cutter 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.720
 we killed the canon where we can 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.720
 pass the wiring 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:08.410
 let's try ok 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.940
 then it will be enough to seal it with a 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:43.830
 goccino of hot glue of black color 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:46.350
 and you will not see that anything knows the communes 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.890
 let's proceed with the assembly of marble 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.890
 popular 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:58.390
 placed adhesive stress on 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:04.920
 earphone we remove the helmet sticker 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:08.370
 it is already set up we let it pass 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.370
 under the buttonholes 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:22.330
 once the adhesive has been removed, they position it in the 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:26.290
 your layout area the same we do 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.290
 for the other earpiece 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.849
 we remove the adhesive and to unite 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.849
 place in its layout 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:46.980
 equal bad first microphone we position 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:54.090
 we remove the adhesive and we go to 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:57.620
 place in this area here with 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.620
 an upward inclination 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:09.250
 so we placed all the 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:12.600
 components except the battery anyway 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.970
 for the battery placed forced 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:19.830
 we remove the arrival and we go to 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.830
 place back here 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.300
 I call it temporarily 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.389
 now let's proceed with the connections 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.210
 rare connections 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:16.640
 connection 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:16.640
 let's place the excess wire 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:26.660
 inside the helmet 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:33.380
 we have a crack this here where 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:37.150
 we can insert all the inside 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.150
 wiring that yields 

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.190
 and very spacious 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.260
 so the work remains much more 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.260
 clean 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.640
 rebranded 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:42.529
 the chinstrap is so willing 

00:06:54.059 --> 00:07:00.860
 insert 

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.860
 the bianchetto is the matter 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:07.699
 we put the buttons back 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.400
 here 

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:24.269
 smh 10r mounted on schubert and c3 a 

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:27.800
 high performance intercom ed 

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:27.800
 has a very low cost 

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:34.669
 greetings from motorcycle the inter com is
