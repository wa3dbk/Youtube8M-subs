Steve and I had in Captain America a lot

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.660 
Steve and I had in Captain America a lot
but<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.780> wanted<00:03:01.140> there<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.530> be<00:03:01.680> consequences<00:03:02.549> to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
but I wanted there to be consequences to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.190 
but I wanted there to be consequences to
them<00:03:02.820> that's<00:03:02.970> why<00:03:03.150> all<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.570> violence<00:03:04.019> in<00:03:04.140> the

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
them that's why all the violence in the

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.670 
them that's why all the violence in the
comic<00:03:04.560> is<00:03:04.769> really<00:03:05.130> brutal<00:03:05.580> and<00:03:06.470> realistic<00:03:07.470> in

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
comic is really brutal and realistic in

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.979 
comic is really brutal and realistic in
its<00:03:07.860> portrayal<00:03:08.160> it's<00:03:09.090> like<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.570> can<00:03:09.780> glorify

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
its portrayal it's like you can glorify

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.350

like<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.920> aspects<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.519> it<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:11.850> I<00:03:12.060> think<00:03:12.120> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
like the aspects of it but I think the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.420 
like the aspects of it but I think the
results<00:03:12.750> of<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:12.959> need<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.260> be<00:03:13.440> shown<00:03:14.190> really

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
results of it need to be shown really

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.160 
results of it need to be shown really
realistically<00:03:15.180> there's<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.750> great<00:03:15.900> scene

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
realistically there's that great scene

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.750 
realistically there's that great scene
where<00:03:16.200> she<00:03:16.530> targets<00:03:16.920> a<00:03:17.010> minister<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.670> then

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
where she targets a minister and then

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.340 
where she targets a minister and then
sees<00:03:18.030> his<00:03:18.150> much<00:03:18.330> more<00:03:18.510> attractive<00:03:18.900> assistant
