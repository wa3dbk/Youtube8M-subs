I think my like lash glue is faulty

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.939 
I think my like lash glue is faulty
because<00:04:23.940> work<00:04:24.810> like<00:04:25.319> they<00:04:25.470> just<00:04:25.680> fell<00:04:25.889> off

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949 
because work like they just fell off

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:29.510 
because work like they just fell off
after<00:04:26.490> i<00:04:26.970> put<00:04:27.509> the<00:04:27.629> lash<00:04:27.810> glue<00:04:28.050> on<00:04:28.319> so<00:04:28.800> what

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
after i put the lash glue on so what

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.980 
after i put the lash glue on so what
instead<00:04:30.060> what<00:04:30.270> we're<00:04:30.389> gonna<00:04:30.479> do<00:04:30.629> is<00:04:30.810> we're

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
instead what we're gonna do is we're

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.480 
instead what we're gonna do is we're
