00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
210 just before the 6:05 we do have a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
look at the 210 210 in 260 out there in

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.650 
look at the 210 210 in 260 out there in
the<00:02:33.490> San<00:02:33.670> Gabriel<00:02:34.060> Valley<00:02:34.090> it<00:02:34.360> looks<00:02:34.510> like

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
the San Gabriel Valley it looks like

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.780 
the San Gabriel Valley it looks like
that<00:02:34.840> 10<00:02:35.080> in<00:02:35.200> that<00:02:35.320> 60<00:02:35.740> both<00:02:36.220> checking<00:02:36.610> in<00:02:36.700> at

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
that 10 in that 60 both checking in at

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.880 
that 10 in that 60 both checking in at
top<00:02:36.970> speeds<00:02:37.330> and<00:02:37.570> accident-free<00:02:38.290> we<00:02:38.800> are

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
top speeds and accident-free we are

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.080 
top speeds and accident-free we are
getting<00:02:39.130> as<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.370> can<00:02:39.490> see<00:02:39.640> some<00:02:39.880> slowing

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
getting as you can see some slowing

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.910 
getting as you can see some slowing
though<00:02:40.270> on<00:02:40.390> that<00:02:40.420> 2/10<00:02:41.050> in<00:02:41.260> some<00:02:41.560> different

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
though on that 2/10 in some different

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.650 
though on that 2/10 in some different
areas<00:02:42.310> so<00:02:42.580> I<00:02:42.760> would<00:02:43.090> avoid<00:02:43.240> it<00:02:43.300> and<00:02:43.450> take<00:02:43.570> the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
areas so I would avoid it and take the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.450 
areas so I would avoid it and take the
