00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.809
 ice creams 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.759
 Let's make a strawberry ice cream with 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.800
 light fruit that has an essence 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:24.599
 have preservatives 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.579
 but the fruit also goes to the base of the 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.089
 our ice cream 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:34.369
 here i have a little opel cup 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.369
 small milk powder 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.820
 You're not going to take everything you've touched. 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.699
 poorly equipped but then I 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.610
 Student who stayed here I have 2 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.649
 cups of sugar have to look good 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.530
 Sweetheart, people, because then you put 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.539
 the other ingredients 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.190
 you can substitute a can of 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.520
 condensed milk 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.500
 Here I have a spoon. 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.269
 I'm making a recipe of 1 liter 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.440
 so I have a wife of him won 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:06.750
 to the neutral alloy to crystallize your 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.610
 is not to see that ice crystals at 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.880
 otherwise it will not let electrics 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.590
 ice lodges that generally people 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.399
 freezes anything she gets that 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.319
 These things here are ice balls . 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.119
 barn is not doing advertising has 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:24.240
 other brands shapes for those who do not know 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.770
 do not know he won 3 I'll do it 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.690
 I'm going to hit this one, I'm going to put this to 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.819
 freeze 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.340
 if I want more creamy more caloric 

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:35.489
 much better, I'll put it here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.800
 also a box of sour cream 

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:40.200
 will get a more expensive ice cream for you 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.179
 resell for you to make but 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.280
 it will get much better 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:46.860
 it is at your discretion the drummer here 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.410
 I will put to freeze after it 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.560
 I already have ice cream, yes, English. 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.159
 cidinho'll come to the second part 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.350
 is to hit the mixer 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.600
 just take a look like that took 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:03.539
 our ice cream says that it is like this 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.819
 even there also he's not too soft 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.979
 I do not even care, it's still like this 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:10.450
 the point you get started hitting up 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.500
 you have very hard to catch me 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.099
 food mixer 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.140
 here I have already separated it would be a 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.700
 teaspoon of me 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.769
 put a little bit more 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.620
 how much milk am I 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.720
 doing what you will do 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.480
 use this beater because if you use 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.780
 another batsman that is going to happen he goes 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.670
 it is repudiated only to beat of you beat with 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.730
 the team that goes through it and 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.319
 force - your beat I'm going to put this 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.390
 here people more or less double 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.280
 a little less volume does not double because 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.890
 As I said, it will become famous. 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.569
 After you've finished everything you have 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.819
 Everything I've beaten is that I come with my 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:51.730
 strawberry not to jest because you want 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.560
 celebrating the whole whole I'm going to put 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.519
 hit our point for you 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.650
 take a look as he gets heavy 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.359
 he almost doubled in volume 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.709
 I did not let double as I told 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.829
 do not get foamy he has to stay 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:07.900
 Creamy ice cream has to be tasty and 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:10.510
 sometimes people want to save money and 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.400
 put them very significant hits a lot 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.950
 that he may enjoy but not stay 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.750
 creamy does not look good because it speaks 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.599
 to hit this one with that batter of 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.220
 life you do not risk losing 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.680
 your entire battery and you will not 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.389
 force your mixer 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.030
 another important thing can not be 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.500
 be much that is bitter in eleven he 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.599
 will mark your ice cream but he will not 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.880
 be very good both neutral and 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:36.760
 and modifying has to be continuous right 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:41.230
 now here folks I'm going to put my strawberry 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.489
 it is cooked without sugar with the claudinha and 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.010
 all 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.889
 now another important detail i 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:50.319
 I cooked my strawberry without sugar. 

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:53.859
 not to look great just before I 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.360
 put my ice cream on let's go like this 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.370
 Freeze 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.450
 What I'm going to do, it's delicious. 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.380
 The people that I 'm going to do first, I'm going 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.230
 try to see if it has the 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.720
 quantity of sugar because it has 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.550
 sugar says it only comes good has sugar 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.240
 that they are much less tense than three 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:16.299
 they are good, they are strong at last the texture of it 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.079
 It's different and what's going to happen 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.850
 happen to miss my ice cream sugar 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.160
 When he freezes, he will lose his 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.270
 his property will be further south only 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.680
 let's say like this 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.290
 So what do I have to do ? 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.970
 I need to, I have to try 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.520
 to see if you have enough sugar in your 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.260
 My ice cream so I will not come running 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.010
 risk is that after freeze 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.930
 like ice cream but I did not memorandum 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.890
 cut it to leave even the pieces 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.919
 Of Strawberry 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.000
 but they go to the bottom such a study is 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.770
 normal 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.360
 in my case here is a trick that I will 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.760
 to teach you are making flakes that 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.400
 You will notice the difference there 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.040
 in the end I'll mix it up from here 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.050
 just to taste some more because 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.440
 sometimes a strawberry did not cover tasty and 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:07.570
 I'm going to put a spoonful of 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:10.419
 strawberry essence soup to give a 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.940
 color and a better taste we finish 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.729
 This is what you experienced here if you had super 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.100
 Enough, sweetheart, when he 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.740
 ngela and you will also get 25 there you go 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.390
 power is as it says so put to 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.280
 freeze the strawberry ice cream it already 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.140
 ready to make ice cream every time 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.840
 same thing thing you're going to do 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.310
 change the taste change the fruit but it's good 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.440
 happening because sometimes people do not 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.060
 You're not used to watching my channel. 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:37.030
 It's the first time she comes and speaks for herself. 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.650
 or taking the tram on foot, then 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.300
 It's best to explain the 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.879
 Commissioner who is accompanying 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.940
 ask will you know the new base is 

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.979
 I can study the fruit I want. 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.650
 I hope you enjoyed whit 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.669
 all the videos that I have but 1 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.860

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.509
 the help was to submit or have to 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.120
