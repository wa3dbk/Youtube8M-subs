00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
we also made new Lakes for the machine

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.609 
we also made new Lakes for the machine
the<00:01:17.140> originals<00:01:17.590> were<00:01:18.119> all<00:01:19.259> two<00:01:20.259> different

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
the originals were all two different

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.920 
the originals were all two different
machine<00:01:20.950> legs<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.729> that<00:01:22.450> was<00:01:22.570> not<00:01:22.720> going<00:01:22.869> to

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
machine legs and that was not going to

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.340 
machine legs and that was not going to
cut<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:24.570> all<00:01:25.570> so<00:01:25.810> if<00:01:25.899> you<00:01:25.990> remember<00:01:26.320> our

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.759 
five balls for this game okay with me a
little<00:02:43.690> bit<00:02:43.810> there<00:02:44.049> is<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.349> tilt<00:02:44.650> mechanism

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
little bit there is a tilt mechanism

00:02:44.769 --> 00:03:00.090 
little bit there is a tilt mechanism
here<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:45.519> can't<00:02:45.790> go<00:02:45.910> too<00:02:46.120> crazy<00:02:58.709> as<00:02:59.709> I<00:02:59.920> said

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
here so you can't go too crazy as I said

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.370 
here so you can't go too crazy as I said
before<00:03:00.280> when<00:03:00.730> we<00:03:00.850> were<00:03:00.900> restoring<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:02.109> actual

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
before when we were restoring the actual

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.759 
before when we were restoring the actual
mechanism<00:03:03.310> in<00:03:03.400> here<00:03:03.519> it's<00:03:03.609> a<00:03:03.670> really<00:03:03.880> neat

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
mechanism in here it's a really neat

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.460 
mechanism in here it's a really neat
system<00:03:05.769> that<00:03:06.070> there's<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.340> light<00:03:06.579> bulb<00:03:06.880> that

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
system that there's a light bulb that

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.030 
system that there's a light bulb that
actually<00:03:09.390> shine<00:03:10.390> through<00:03:10.660> a<00:03:10.720> disk<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.470> upside

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
actually shine through a disk and upside

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.059 
actually shine through a disk and upside
down<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:13.569> it<00:03:13.989> puts<00:03:14.230> it<00:03:14.380> right<00:03:14.410> side<00:03:14.769> up<00:03:14.890> on<00:03:15.010> the

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
down and it puts it right side up on the

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:24.690 
down and it puts it right side up on the
front<00:03:15.400> here<00:03:15.609> and<00:03:22.920> this<00:03:23.920> is<00:03:24.069> me<00:03:24.220> playing<00:03:24.489> the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700
