00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
oven fan assisted and convection so if

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.689 
oven fan assisted and convection so if
you're<00:00:21.110> using<00:00:21.380> a<00:00:21.530> fan<00:00:21.740> assisted<00:00:22.039> oven<00:00:22.519> in

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
you're using a fan assisted oven in

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.179 
you're using a fan assisted oven in
convection<00:00:23.240> mode<00:00:23.480> or<00:00:23.960> if<00:00:24.470> your<00:00:24.710> oven<00:00:25.009> doesn't

lower element combine to give the oven
its<00:00:37.670> heat<00:00:37.910> so<00:00:38.719> if<00:00:38.809> your<00:00:38.960> grill<00:00:39.320> is<00:00:39.649> functioning

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
its heat so if your grill is functioning

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.190 
its heat so if your grill is functioning
correctly<00:00:40.329> but<00:00:41.329> you<00:00:41.360> can't<00:00:41.629> get<00:00:41.809> the<00:00:41.899> desired

work on appliance always make sure it's

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.400 
work on appliance always make sure it's
disconnected<00:00:52.190> from<00:00:52.489> the<00:00:52.640> mains<00:00:52.989> to<00:00:53.989> access

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
disconnected from the mains to access

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.840 
disconnected from the mains to access
the<00:00:54.559> lower<00:00:54.770> oven<00:00:55.070> element<00:00:55.280> and<00:00:55.579> to<00:00:55.640> have<00:00:55.820> a

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
the lower oven element and to have a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.020 
the lower oven element and to have a
look<00:00:56.030> at<00:00:56.149> both<00:00:56.270> elements<00:00:57.460> we<00:00:58.460> need<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.760> replace

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
look at both elements we need to replace

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.930 
look at both elements we need to replace
this<00:00:59.269> back<00:00:59.510> panel<00:01:02.949> by<00:01:03.949> unscrewing<00:01:04.220> these

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
this back panel by unscrewing these

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.109 
this back panel by unscrewing these
screws

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.539 

so<00:01:11.119> once<00:01:11.360> unscrewed<00:01:12.110> put<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.890> back<00:01:13.070> panel<00:01:13.520> to

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
so once unscrewed put the back panel to

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.359 
so once unscrewed put the back panel to
the<00:01:13.790> side<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.439> here<00:01:15.439> we<00:01:15.530> can<00:01:15.680> see<00:01:15.830> all<00:01:16.040> the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
the side and here we can see all the

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.880 
the side and here we can see all the
electrical<00:01:16.759> connections<00:01:17.530> now<00:01:18.530> it's<00:01:18.680> a<00:01:18.710> good

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
electrical connections now it's a good

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.130 
electrical connections now it's a good
idea<00:01:18.950> before<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.700> start<00:01:20.000> any<00:01:20.240> work<00:01:20.720> on<00:01:20.990> the

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
idea before you start any work on the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.289 
idea before you start any work on the
electricals<00:01:21.619> to<00:01:22.220> take<00:01:22.369> a<00:01:22.400> picture<00:01:22.700> of<00:01:22.880> all<00:01:23.150> the

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
electricals to take a picture of all the

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.109 
electricals to take a picture of all the
wiring<00:01:23.540> just<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.049> be<00:01:24.170> sure<00:01:24.200> you<00:01:24.380> know<00:01:25.000> where<00:01:26.000> it

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
wiring just to be sure you know where it

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.469 
wiring just to be sure you know where it
all<00:01:26.210> goes<00:01:29.470> and<00:01:30.470> here<00:01:30.799> we<00:01:30.890> can<00:01:31.009> see<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.909> thermal

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
all goes and here we can see the thermal

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.929 
all goes and here we can see the thermal
cutout<00:01:33.040> these<00:01:34.040> are<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.220> connections<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.850> the
