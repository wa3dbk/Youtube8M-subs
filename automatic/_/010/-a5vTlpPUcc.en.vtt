00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.420
 do not 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.100
 hello how welcome are you to the recipe book 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.119
 of the widget this time we're going to 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.119
 prepare some enfrijoladas 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.380
 to start with the days as well as 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.410
 I did it with his goals is a caldillo 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.559
 baseball that we have to do and it seems 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.559
 bean caldillo let's liquefy 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.559
 Beans 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.879
 we are going to put a tomato 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.879
 Lets put 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:53.470
 two teaspoons of cream and let's 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:58.060
 add the same broth of the beans 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:01.050
 from the pot for you if you do not have van 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.050
 to have to know him 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.180
 and that 's all because the assumptions are 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.180
 beans from the pot when they were made 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.740
 and had put them jump then what 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.740
 only thing that we are going to do is liquefy it 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.260
 we do not have to leave there for a little while 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.260
 you calculate how much 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.100
 for this to be able to cook this caliber 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:38.100
 I have here in a little pan oil 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.100
 and we are going to empty our preparation 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.780
 to leave it here that boils 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.300
 I was forgetting something 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.409
 we are going to add you here so you have a 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:01.670
 little 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.220
 Spicy touch we are going to add you 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.070
 a little bottle sauce from which 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.300
 you have at home no matter what 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.190
 be of some brand 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.150
 according to what you like the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.680
 spicy is the amount that they put 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.590
 let's leave it here to boil and 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.500
 right now we come back in a moment 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.230
 after we have returned we are already beginning 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.489
 to divide our bean mix with 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.970
 tomato cream alcaldito of the same 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.340
 bean 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.980
 in the hot sauce that had 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.510
 commented we mix with the sauce my 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.069
 people are going to grab a little more color 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.700
 more orange more throwing reddish 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.110
 and here this is ready and nothing else is 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.940
 certify taste certify salt 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.410
 as I was telling you how your beans are 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.880
 suppose they already put salt when 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.490
 they got them when they made their 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.270
 beans from the pot are almost almost going to be 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.850
 well without putting dough and you what 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.110
 check according to how you like it 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.720
 meanwhile since I have a frying pan 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.190
 heating oil because I have to 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.810
 refer the tortillas to be able to 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.810
 make them enfrijoladas 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.720
 because this is very simple is similar 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.530
 to the enchiladas we have to pass the 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.180
 tortilla over hot oil for 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.230
 that softened a bit 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.230
 and take it out 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.379
 and so on consecutively to the pair you can 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.550
 have the tortillas that they will need 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.720
 to prepare scares 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.720
 they look like beans 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.770
 I'm going to prepare everyone for you 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.260
 see how they are basically done and already 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:55.070
 if you can prepare 34 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.070
 can eat 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.510
 the second one came out 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.730
 Well now it has already come out in our 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.220
 Two tortillas is ready too 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:08.500
 our mix of beans we pay for it 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:11.110
 we leave there to rest a moment 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.060
 while I'm going to go assembling the enchiladas 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.610
 with its filling the enchiladas las 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:18.690
 enfrijoladas with its filling and in the end 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.269
 we bathe them with this creampie 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.040
 Well now let's prepare them 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.050
 enfrijoladas we had said that we were going to 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.000
 to make two dogs we were made very little 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.640
 and better let's do three 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.010
 let's start our tortillas as 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.760
 you saw we had already fried them and 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:39.350
 I'm going to fill them with cheese 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.570
 Which cheese do you prefer? 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.600
 and that you have at home or that 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:47.560
 you consider you can get no 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.780
 matter that it is of any type 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.410
 you can also fill us in can be 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:56.670
 shredded chicken can be from some 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.680
 stew they have can be chorizo 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.720
 you can also elaborate on those 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:04.610
 stuffed well, they're ready and 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.610
 now we have left 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:08.699
 bathe them with our preparation 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:17.449
 abundant to make it look 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.050
 to the delicious in the bean 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:25.389
 scrambled mixed with a cream of 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.389
 tomato spicy sauce 

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:36.149
 and now to decorate our 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.840
 enfrijoladas you have to put a little 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:40.830
 of cheese and I will fail 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.880
 what's that 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:46.560
 it's the same cheese that I put inside 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.670
 it can be anyway if you 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.460
 they had another no matter 

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.500
 in fact it can be even better than this 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.260
 cheese 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.570
 with that enough and good too 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.070
 I'm going to put creams that I put in a 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.260
 kind of edu is already a bag of 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.120
 normal plastic 3 teaspoons of cream 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.010

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.020

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:21.700
 a few lines ago let's draw here 

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.700
 a kind of cat 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:30.919
 and finally I'm going to put a 

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:33.830
 little bit of salt if it 's spicy 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:36.800
