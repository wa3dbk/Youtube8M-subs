00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:01:04.899

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
so as you can see we had a pretty good

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.990 
so as you can see we had a pretty good
day<00:03:56.599> out<00:03:56.840> on<00:03:56.989> the<00:03:57.019> ice<00:03:57.230> I<00:03:57.680> had<00:03:58.099> about<00:03:58.220> 15<00:03:58.760> fish

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
day out on the ice I had about 15 fish

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.460 
day out on the ice I had about 15 fish
that<00:03:59.209> I<00:03:59.239> kept<00:03:59.540> I<00:03:59.720> got<00:03:59.930> a<00:03:59.959> whole<00:04:00.140> bunch<00:04:00.379> more

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
that I kept I got a whole bunch more

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.940 
that I kept I got a whole bunch more
smaller<00:04:01.069> ones<00:04:01.370> that<00:04:01.610> are<00:04:01.730> released<00:04:02.769> the<00:04:03.769> ice

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
smaller ones that are released the ice

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.550 
smaller ones that are released the ice
was<00:04:04.849> between<00:04:05.239> three<00:04:05.569> and<00:04:05.599> five<00:04:05.870> inches<00:04:06.319> which

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
was between three and five inches which

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.580 
was between three and five inches which
is<00:04:06.590> safe<00:04:06.920> enough<00:04:07.160> to<00:04:07.220> be<00:04:07.459> on<00:04:07.599> you<00:04:08.599> know<00:04:08.720> every

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
is safe enough to be on you know every

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.440 
is safe enough to be on you know every
night<00:04:09.769> it's<00:04:09.980> real<00:04:10.340> cold<00:04:10.580> and<00:04:10.910> during<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.299> day

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
night it's real cold and during the day

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.479 
night it's real cold and during the day
some<00:04:11.720> of<00:04:11.810> the<00:04:11.900> days<00:04:12.049> are<00:04:12.290> over<00:04:12.410> 30<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:13.160> lately

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
some of the days are over 30 to lately

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.820 
some of the days are over 30 to lately
but<00:04:13.970> I<00:04:14.239> would<00:04:14.870> say<00:04:15.019> that<00:04:15.200> the<00:04:15.349> ice<00:04:15.470> is<00:04:15.680> getting

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
but I would say that the ice is getting

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.500 
but I would say that the ice is getting
thicker<00:04:16.190> right<00:04:16.519> now<00:04:16.699> before<00:04:17.090> it's<00:04:17.209> getting

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
thicker right now before it's getting

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.120 
thicker right now before it's getting
thinner<00:04:17.750> even<00:04:18.109> with<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.440> days<00:04:18.650> being<00:04:19.010> a

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
thinner even with the days being a

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.250 
thinner even with the days being a
little<00:04:19.609> warmer<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.180> nights<00:04:20.359> are<00:04:20.540> have<00:04:21.049> been

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
little warmer the nights are have been

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.110 
little warmer the nights are have been
real<00:04:21.470> cold<00:04:21.680> so<00:04:21.889> I<00:04:21.919> think<00:04:22.040> they're<00:04:22.490> pretty<00:04:22.880> much

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
real cold so I think they're pretty much

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.960 
real cold so I think they're pretty much
offsetting<00:04:23.830> at<00:04:24.830> least<00:04:25.100> offsetting<00:04:25.729> you<00:04:25.820> know

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
offsetting at least offsetting you know

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.730 
offsetting at least offsetting you know
stay<00:04:26.240> in<00:04:26.389> the<00:04:26.540> same<00:04:26.750> so<00:04:27.020> it's<00:04:27.200> safe<00:04:27.410> to<00:04:27.590> be<00:04:27.710> out

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
stay in the same so it's safe to be out

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.580 
stay in the same so it's safe to be out
there<00:04:27.889> ice<00:04:28.310> fishing<00:04:28.850> just<00:04:29.210> know<00:04:29.930> your<00:04:30.169> area

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
there ice fishing just know your area

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.980 
there ice fishing just know your area

ice fishing but
well<00:05:40.270> I<00:05:40.300> should<00:05:40.599> say<00:05:40.629> shorter<00:05:41.199> than<00:05:41.379> last<00:05:41.560> year

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
well I should say shorter than last year

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.469 
well I should say shorter than last year
last<00:05:42.069> year<00:05:42.219> was<00:05:42.520> a<00:05:42.550> little<00:05:42.879> bit<00:05:43.030> drawn<00:05:43.240> out<00:05:43.449> I

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 
last year was a little bit drawn out I

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.240 
last year was a little bit drawn out I
was<00:05:43.719> pretty<00:05:43.960> ready<00:05:44.229> for<00:05:44.500> warm<00:05:44.830> weather<00:05:45.069> and

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
was pretty ready for warm weather and

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.860 
was pretty ready for warm weather and
opened<00:05:45.699> a<00:05:45.729> lot<00:05:45.849> of<00:05:45.969> fishing<00:05:46.360> but<00:05:46.539> it<00:05:46.659> just

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
opened a lot of fishing but it just

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.740 
opened a lot of fishing but it just
wasn't<00:05:47.800> quite<00:05:48.189> letting<00:05:48.580> up<00:05:48.729> you<00:05:48.939> know<00:05:49.090> who<00:05:49.629> he

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
wasn't quite letting up you know who he

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:52.260 
wasn't quite letting up you know who he
had<00:05:49.870> ice<00:05:50.020> for<00:05:50.319> a<00:05:50.349> long<00:05:50.620> time<00:05:50.979> and<00:05:51.030> the<00:05:52.030> water

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
had ice for a long time and the water

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.209 
had ice for a long time and the water
took<00:05:52.509> a<00:05:52.569> long<00:05:52.840> time<00:05:52.870> to<00:05:53.110> warm<00:05:53.469> up<00:05:53.620> so<00:05:53.860> hopefully

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:54.219 
took a long time to warm up so hopefully

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.029 
took a long time to warm up so hopefully
this<00:05:54.370> year<00:05:54.580> is<00:05:54.669> a<00:05:54.699> little<00:05:55.030> different<00:05:55.449> but<00:05:56.349> I'm
