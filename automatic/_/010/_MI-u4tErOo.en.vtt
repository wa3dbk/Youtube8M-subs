00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
so anyway obviously as you guys saw

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.619 
so anyway obviously as you guys saw
March<00:03:12.799> 31st<00:03:13.129> it's<00:03:13.579> actually<00:03:14.000> less<00:03:14.299> than<00:03:14.329> two

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
March 31st it's actually less than two

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.720

weeks<00:03:14.780> away<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.440> is<00:03:15.620> in<00:03:15.829> thirteen<00:03:16.250> days<00:03:16.489> from

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
weeks away it is in thirteen days from

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.849 
weeks away it is in thirteen days from
now<00:03:16.909> so<00:03:17.359> you<00:03:17.450> can<00:03:17.569> expect<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.200> have<00:03:18.409> a<00:03:18.650> live

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
now so you can expect to have a live

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.229 
now so you can expect to have a live
stream<00:03:18.890> all<00:03:19.340> day<00:03:19.489> for<00:03:19.670> that<00:03:19.760> going<00:03:20.030> for<00:03:20.180> the

for<00:03:26.569> a<00:03:26.630> while<00:03:26.900> I<00:03:27.169> didn't<00:03:27.709> really<00:03:27.859> see<00:03:28.069> anything

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
for a while I didn't really see anything

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:29.860 
for a while I didn't really see anything
that<00:03:28.639> stood<00:03:28.819> out<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:29.120> me<00:03:29.150> too<00:03:29.389> much<00:03:29.540> there's

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
that stood out to me too much there's

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.000 
that stood out to me too much there's
one<00:03:30.019> thing<00:03:30.109> that's<00:03:30.290> usually<00:03:30.680> I<00:03:30.709> should<00:03:30.859> point

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
one thing that's usually I should point

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.589 
one thing that's usually I should point
out<00:03:31.160> is<00:03:31.400> in<00:03:31.760> the<00:03:31.849> bottom<00:03:32.180> right<00:03:32.209> hand<00:03:32.419> corner

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599

burger<00:03:34.160> truck<00:03:34.310> that<00:03:34.489> looks<00:03:34.609> like<00:03:34.669> it's<00:03:34.819> turned

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
burger truck that looks like it's turned

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
over and on fire there's a little cave

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.369 
over and on fire there's a little cave
of<00:03:38.120> some<00:03:38.299> sort<00:03:38.510> goes<00:03:38.720> down<00:03:38.930> into<00:03:39.049> the<00:03:39.139> ground

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
of some sort goes down into the ground

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:40.539 
of some sort goes down into the ground
I'm<00:03:39.470> not<00:03:39.590> sure<00:03:39.709> if<00:03:39.769> that's<00:03:39.889> gonna<00:03:39.980> be<00:03:40.099> a<00:03:40.160> tunnel

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
I'm not sure if that's gonna be a tunnel

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.129 
I'm not sure if that's gonna be a tunnel
or<00:03:40.760> you<00:03:41.060> can<00:03:41.209> go<00:03:41.329> down<00:03:41.450> there<00:03:41.660> and<00:03:41.720> maybe<00:03:41.989> the

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
or you can go down there and maybe the

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.629 
or you can go down there and maybe the
zombies<00:03:42.410> will<00:03:42.530> just<00:03:42.680> spawn<00:03:42.859> they're<00:03:43.069> not

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
zombies will just spawn they're not

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:44.949 
zombies will just spawn they're not
really<00:03:43.819> sure<00:03:44.000> that's<00:03:44.180> gonna<00:03:44.359> be<00:03:44.450> important<00:03:44.900> or

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
really sure that's gonna be important or

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:45.819 
really sure that's gonna be important or
not<00:03:45.049> that's<00:03:45.260> the<00:03:45.349> only<00:03:45.470> thing<00:03:45.560> that's<00:03:45.709> really

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
not that's the only thing that's really

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.530 
not that's the only thing that's really
standing<00:03:46.280> out<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.430> me<00:03:46.549> at<00:03:46.699> this<00:03:46.760> point<00:03:46.849> there's

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
standing out to me at this point there's

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.610 
standing out to me at this point there's
some<00:03:47.690> mountains<00:03:47.959> in<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.079> background<00:03:48.290> you

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
some mountains in the background you

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.569 
some mountains in the background you
gotta<00:03:48.739> see<00:03:48.919> them<00:03:49.040> though<00:03:49.099> there's<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.370> water

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
gotta see them though there's a water

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.189 
gotta see them though there's a water
tower<00:03:49.760> on<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:49.940> right<00:03:50.090> side<00:03:50.359> there<00:03:50.599> but<00:03:50.780> it<00:03:51.109> is

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:51.199 
tower on the right side there but it is

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.659 
tower on the right side there but it is
a<00:03:51.230> little<00:03:51.349> bit<00:03:51.620> we're<00:03:51.739> that<00:03:51.859> close<00:03:52.040> to<00:03:52.280> atlas

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:52.669 
a little bit we're that close to atlas

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:54.309 
a little bit we're that close to atlas
so<00:03:53.449> I<00:03:53.480> don't<00:03:53.690> know<00:03:53.810> if<00:03:53.930> we're<00:03:54.019> gonna<00:03:54.109> be<00:03:54.260> able

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
so I don't know if we're gonna be able

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.080 
so I don't know if we're gonna be able
to<00:03:54.410> actually<00:03:54.709> go<00:03:54.889> back<00:03:54.919> from<00:03:55.370> atlas<00:03:55.760> I'm<00:03:55.910> just

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
to actually go back from atlas I'm just

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.330 
to actually go back from atlas I'm just
one<00:03:56.209> I<00:03:56.239> was<00:03:56.449> thinking<00:03:56.480> maybe<00:03:57.099> since<00:03:58.099> this<00:03:58.250> is

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
one I was thinking maybe since this is

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.439 
one I was thinking maybe since this is
right<00:03:58.489> in<00:03:58.549> the<00:03:58.609> outskirts<00:03:58.879> about<00:03:59.180> let's<00:03:59.329> maybe

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
right in the outskirts about let's maybe

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.150 
right in the outskirts about let's maybe
we<00:03:59.569> can<00:03:59.690> go<00:03:59.810> from<00:03:59.930> them<00:04:00.079> outlet<00:04:00.530> atlas

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
we can go from them outlet atlas

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.699 
we can go from them outlet atlas
building<00:04:01.549> into<00:04:02.299> Burger<00:04:02.690> town<00:04:02.870> and<00:04:03.230> the<00:04:03.500> maps

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
building into Burger town and the maps

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.259 
building into Burger town and the maps
will<00:04:03.889> connect<00:04:04.160> of<00:04:04.310> some<00:04:04.489> sort<00:04:04.699> but<00:04:05.150> I'm

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
will connect of some sort but I'm

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:06.610 
will connect of some sort but I'm
thinking<00:04:05.540> that's<00:04:05.629> not<00:04:05.840> gonna<00:04:05.959> happen<00:04:06.139> but<00:04:06.470> we

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
thinking that's not gonna happen but we

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.900 
thinking that's not gonna happen but we
don't<00:04:06.799> know<00:04:06.919> this<00:04:07.129> is<00:04:07.250> only<00:04:07.370> one<00:04:07.519> picture<00:04:07.730> it's

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
don't know this is only one picture it's

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.460 
don't know this is only one picture it's
gonna<00:04:08.000> be<00:04:08.150> hard<00:04:08.329> to<00:04:08.389> tell<00:04:08.569> leave<00:04:09.019> me<00:04:09.169> a<00:04:09.199> comment

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
gonna be hard to tell leave me a comment

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.080 
gonna be hard to tell leave me a comment
if<00:04:09.650> you<00:04:09.739> guys<00:04:09.829> think<00:04:10.069> that's<00:04:10.129> a<00:04:10.400> reasonable<00:04:10.879> or

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
if you guys think that's a reasonable or

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.300 
if you guys think that's a reasonable or
possibility<00:04:11.810> at<00:04:11.989> all<00:04:12.169> just<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.099> thought<00:04:13.280> I

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
possibility at all just the thought I

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:14.979 
possibility at all just the thought I
had<00:04:13.579> I'm<00:04:13.730> not<00:04:13.849> sure<00:04:14.090> just<00:04:14.510> because<00:04:14.750> it's<00:04:14.870> so

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
had I'm not sure just because it's so

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.589 
had I'm not sure just because it's so
close<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.560> the<00:04:15.769> other<00:04:15.889> map<00:04:16.359> that<00:04:17.359> maybe

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:17.599 
close to the the other map that maybe

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:19.360 
close to the the other map that maybe
the<00:04:17.840> storyline<00:04:18.260> will<00:04:18.440> allow<00:04:18.709> us<00:04:18.919> to<00:04:19.039> go<00:04:19.190> from

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
the storyline will allow us to go from

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.490 
the storyline will allow us to go from
map<00:04:19.519> to<00:04:19.699> map<00:04:19.849> I<00:04:20.120> don't<00:04:20.750> know<00:04:20.930> how<00:04:21.139> realistic

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
map to map I don't know how realistic

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.110 
map to map I don't know how realistic
that's<00:04:21.859> gonna<00:04:22.010> be<00:04:22.310> though<00:04:22.520> because<00:04:22.729> it'd<00:04:23.000> be

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
that's gonna be though because it'd be

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.580 
that's gonna be though because it'd be
one<00:04:23.360> massive<00:04:23.599> map<00:04:23.960> by<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.110> time<00:04:24.380> they're<00:04:24.560> done

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
one massive map by the time they're done

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.010 
one massive map by the time they're done
although<00:04:25.370> in<00:04:25.849> previous<00:04:26.180> games<00:04:26.630> creep

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
although in previous games creep

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.839 
although in previous games creep
previews<00:04:27.349> called<00:04:27.530> Duty's<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.010> maps<00:04:28.400> jumped

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
previews called Duty's the maps jumped

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.230 
previews called Duty's the maps jumped
all<00:04:29.030> around<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.419> world<00:04:29.630> so<00:04:29.810> what

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
all around the world so what

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.790 
all around the world so what
like<00:04:30.389> you<00:04:30.479> can<00:04:30.630> just<00:04:30.660> travel<00:04:31.349> from<00:04:31.470> one<00:04:31.530> of<00:04:31.740> the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
like you can just travel from one of the

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.920 
like you can just travel from one of the
other<00:04:31.919> easily<00:04:32.210> so<00:04:33.210> we'll<00:04:33.360> see<00:04:33.539> what<00:04:33.720> the<00:04:33.750> deal

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
other easily so we'll see what the deal

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.300 
other easily so we'll see what the deal
is<00:04:34.080> with<00:04:34.169> that<00:04:34.229> but<00:04:34.560> as<00:04:34.650> you<00:04:34.680> can<00:04:34.860> see<00:04:35.009> here<00:04:35.220> in

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
is with that but as you can see here in

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.689 
is with that but as you can see here in
the<00:04:35.400> picture<00:04:35.690> there<00:04:36.690> is<00:04:37.280> there's<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.340> little

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
the picture there is there's a little

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.550 
the picture there is there's a little
red<00:04:39.090> thing<00:04:39.389> in<00:04:39.599> the<00:04:39.720> in<00:04:39.960> the<00:04:40.050> middle<00:04:40.349> here<00:04:40.530> I

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
red thing in the in the middle here I

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.050 
red thing in the in the middle here I
don't<00:04:40.710> know<00:04:40.979> what<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.310> got<00:04:41.580> three<00:04:41.880> little

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
don't know what it is got three little

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.760 
don't know what it is got three little
red<00:04:42.270> ticks<00:04:42.569> on<00:04:42.750> it<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:42.990> looks<00:04:43.020> like<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:43.500> could

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
red ticks on it it looks like it could

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.950 
red ticks on it it looks like it could
be<00:04:43.800> something<00:04:44.360> different<00:04:45.360> maybe<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.599> trap<00:04:45.900> of

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
be something different maybe a trap of

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.749 
be something different maybe a trap of
some<00:04:46.289> sort<00:04:46.590> they<00:04:46.919> did<00:04:47.099> say<00:04:47.190> there's<00:04:47.370> new<00:04:47.460> traps

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 
some sort they did say there's new traps

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:49.219 
some sort they did say there's new traps
so<00:04:47.940> I'm<00:04:48.000> not<00:04:48.210> sure<00:04:48.360> that's<00:04:48.479> gonna<00:04:48.599> be<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:49.080> new

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:49.229 
so I'm not sure that's gonna be a new

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:50.600 
so I'm not sure that's gonna be a new
trap<00:04:49.470> some<00:04:49.710> sort<00:04:49.919> maybe<00:04:50.099> it<00:04:50.190> just<00:04:50.220> gonna<00:04:50.400> be

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
trap some sort maybe it just gonna be

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.670 
trap some sort maybe it just gonna be
like<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.360> tire<00:04:51.630> or<00:04:51.870> something<00:04:51.900> that<00:04:52.319> I<00:04:52.349> can't

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
like a tire or something that I can't

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.050 
like a tire or something that I can't
really<00:04:52.800> make<00:04:52.979> out<00:04:53.220> perfectly<00:04:53.610> right<00:04:53.789> now<00:04:53.910> and

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
really make out perfectly right now and

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.640 
really make out perfectly right now and
it's<00:04:54.150> just<00:04:54.210> part<00:04:54.870> of<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:54.990> map<00:04:55.169> it's<00:04:55.349> nothing

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
it's just part of the map it's nothing

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.110 
it's just part of the map it's nothing
