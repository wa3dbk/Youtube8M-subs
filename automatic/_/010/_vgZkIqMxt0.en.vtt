California<00:06:39.520> in<00:06:40.360> the<00:06:40.719> works<00:06:41.050> right<00:06:41.199> now<00:06:41.349> and

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
California in the works right now and

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.189 
California in the works right now and
it's<00:06:42.159> much<00:06:42.490> larger<00:06:42.789> map<00:06:43.300> down<00:06:43.569> colorado<00:06:44.050> i

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 
it's much larger map down colorado i

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:47.670 
it's much larger map down colorado i
think<00:06:44.500> it's<00:06:44.650> about<00:06:45.599> almost<00:06:46.599> two<00:06:46.840> times<00:06:47.169> bigger

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 
think it's about almost two times bigger

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.339 
think it's about almost two times bigger
than<00:06:47.710> colorado<00:06:48.389> so<00:06:49.389> that's<00:06:49.599> pretty<00:06:49.870> big<00:06:50.110> map

00:06:50.339 --> 00:06:50.349 
than colorado so that's pretty big map

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:55.829 
than colorado so that's pretty big map
and<00:06:52.169> that's<00:06:53.169> a<00:06:53.349> lot<00:06:53.500> of<00:06:53.529> work<00:06:53.909> so<00:06:54.909> i<00:06:55.270> wouldn't

00:06:55.829 --> 00:06:55.839 
and that's a lot of work so i wouldn't

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:59.519 
and that's a lot of work so i wouldn't
expect<00:06:55.960> it<00:06:56.469> to<00:06:56.650> be<00:06:56.800> out<00:06:56.830> before<00:06:58.529> something

00:06:59.519 --> 00:06:59.529 
expect it to be out before something

00:06:59.529 --> 00:07:03.420 
expect it to be out before something
