00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
but yeah we watch the tape we probably

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.020 
but yeah we watch the tape we probably
did<00:01:47.630> not<00:01:47.810> block<00:01:48.020> very<00:01:48.290> well<00:01:48.560> still<00:01:49.430> we<00:01:49.610> had<00:01:49.730> we

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
did not block very well still we had we

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.450 
did not block very well still we had we
have<00:01:50.150> some<00:01:50.330> chances<00:01:50.810> here<00:01:51.380> at<00:01:51.620> mayor<00:01:51.830> to

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
have some chances here at mayor to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.850 
have some chances here at mayor to
really<00:01:53.060> get<00:01:53.180> in<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.330> game<00:01:53.570> especially<00:01:54.440> if

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
really get in the game especially if
