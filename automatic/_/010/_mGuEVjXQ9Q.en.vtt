00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
rolling process so that we can lift up

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.079 
rolling process so that we can lift up
our<00:00:12.300> sheet<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.929> fun<00:00:13.860> done<00:00:14.130> after<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.730> haven't

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
rolled so make a piece like this and

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.450 
rolled so make a piece like this and
we're<00:00:21.119> going<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.630> roll<00:00:22.320> it<00:00:22.380> sort<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.100> wide<00:00:23.430> and

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
we're going to roll it sort of wide and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.150 
we're going to roll it sort of wide and
flat<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:25.430> want<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:27.260> roll<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.289> until<00:00:28.980> it's

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
flat and you want to roll it until it's

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.939 
flat and you want to roll it until it's
about<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.820> quarter<00:00:30.420> inch<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.779> an<00:00:31.109> eighth<00:00:31.529> inch

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
about a quarter inch to an eighth inch

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.030 
about a quarter inch to an eighth inch
and<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.600> will<00:00:33.690> be<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:34.050> wider<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.800> top

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
and it will be a little wider on the top

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:43.340 
and it will be a little wider on the top
and<00:00:35.340> thinner<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.739> bottom<00:00:42.140> this<00:00:43.140> is

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
and thinner on the bottom this is

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.680 
and thinner on the bottom this is
probably<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.890> most<00:00:44.789> difficult<00:00:45.030> part<00:00:45.600> about

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
probably the most difficult part about

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.080 
probably the most difficult part about
making<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.410> cake<00:00:46.710> but<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> fun<00:00:47.730> down<00:00:47.910> is

making the cake but the fun down is
actually<00:00:48.600> very<00:00:48.649> forgiving<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:50.000> stretches<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
actually very forgiving it stretches and

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:59.689 
actually very forgiving it stretches and
it<00:00:51.660> molds<00:00:57.770> keep<00:00:58.770> going<00:00:59.129> now<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.340> want<00:00:59.609> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
it molds keep going now you want to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.290 
it molds keep going now you want to
check<00:01:00.829> once<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> while<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.340> make<00:01:02.789> sure<00:01:03.090> that

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
check once in a while to make sure that

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.450 
check once in a while to make sure that
it<00:01:03.449> is<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.660> sticking<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.470> board<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:04.949> you

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
it is not sticking to the board and you

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.660 
it is not sticking to the board and you
can<00:01:05.780> it's<00:01:06.780> stuck<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> little<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.950> can

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
can it's stuck a little here you can

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.789 
can it's stuck a little here you can
slide<00:01:09.350> more<00:01:10.350> confectioner<00:01:11.100> sugar<00:01:11.130> underneath

and then continue your roll you're going

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.320 
and then continue your roll you're going
to<00:01:19.140> need<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> roll<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.890> out<00:01:20.009> long<00:01:20.430> enough<00:01:20.670> to

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
to need to roll it out long enough to

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.920 
to need to roll it out long enough to
cover<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:22.619> wide<00:01:22.830> enough<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.220> cover<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.939> skirt
