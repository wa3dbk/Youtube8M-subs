I grew the quiff out for a little while

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.070 
I grew the quiff out for a little while
until<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.120> winch<00:03:32.270> I<00:03:32.450> could<00:03:32.630> tie<00:03:32.780> it<00:03:32.840> into<00:03:32.960> a

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
until the winch I could tie it into a

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.300 
until the winch I could tie it into a
top<00:03:33.260> knot<00:03:33.410> and<00:03:33.500> then<00:03:33.560> from<00:03:33.770> the<00:03:33.890> top<00:03:34.100> knot<00:03:34.280> I

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.370 
you can see and all of this length just
comes<00:04:40.080> from<00:04:40.470> the<00:04:41.070> top<00:04:41.340> you<00:04:42.300> see<00:04:42.330> but<00:04:43.050> if<00:04:43.140> my

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
comes from the top you see but if my

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.010 
comes from the top you see but if my
hair<00:04:43.620> was<00:04:43.650> really<00:04:44.190> thin<00:04:44.460> if<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:44.850> put<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.210> down<00:04:45.450> it

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
hair was really thin if I put it down it

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.930 
hair was really thin if I put it down it
would<00:04:46.200> just<00:04:46.440> go<00:04:46.620> flat<00:04:47.070> and<00:04:47.400> it<00:04:47.520> and<00:04:47.730> it<00:04:47.820> won't

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
would just go flat and it and it won't

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.060 
would just go flat and it and it won't
look<00:04:48.270> like<00:04:48.330> there's<00:04:48.810> anything<00:04:49.050> to<00:04:49.320> it<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.920> if

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
look like there's anything to it so if

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:51.530 
look like there's anything to it so if
you<00:04:50.250> have<00:04:50.280> thick<00:04:50.670> hair<00:04:50.700> maybe<00:04:51.060> consider

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
you have thick hair maybe consider

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.570 
you have thick hair maybe consider
shaving<00:04:52.140> the<00:04:52.230> sides<00:04:52.260> because<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.070> then<00:04:53.460> it's

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
shaving the sides because and then it's

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.580 
shaving the sides because and then it's
gonna<00:04:53.730> be<00:04:53.910> easier<00:04:54.360> to<00:04:54.540> style<00:04:54.810> during<00:04:55.290> like<00:04:55.560> the

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
gonna be easier to style during like the

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.010 
gonna be easier to style during like the
growing<00:04:56.010> phase<00:04:56.330> but<00:04:57.330> if<00:04:57.420> your<00:04:57.540> hair<00:04:57.690> is<00:04:57.780> quite

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
growing phase but if your hair is quite

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.780 
growing phase but if your hair is quite
thin<00:04:58.350> then<00:04:58.890> I<00:04:58.980> would<00:04:59.130> recommend<00:04:59.610> probably

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
thin then I would recommend probably

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:02.030 
thin then I would recommend probably
growing<00:05:00.330> out<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.690> sides<00:05:00.930> as<00:05:01.140> well<00:05:01.170> but<00:05:01.920> if<00:05:02.010> you

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
growing out the sides as well but if you

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.370 
growing out the sides as well but if you
really<00:05:02.460> want<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.730> fool<00:05:02.940> a<00:05:03.180> full<00:05:03.540> growth<00:05:03.930> grow

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
really want to fool a full growth grow

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.110 
really want to fool a full growth grow
