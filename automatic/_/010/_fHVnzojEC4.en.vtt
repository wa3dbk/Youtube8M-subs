00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.230 
that are attached this with your inside
they're<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.590> reason<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
they're the reason and that this is the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.539 
they're the reason and that this is the
concept<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.170> want<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.619> get<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
concept that I want you to get the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.539 
concept that I want you to get the
reason<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.509> we<00:02:00.750> don't<00:02:01.049> want<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.829> larynx<00:02:02.340> to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
reason that we don't want the larynx to

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.749 
reason that we don't want the larynx to
move<00:02:02.790> around<00:02:03.030> too<00:02:03.750> much<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.290> because<00:02:04.950> when<00:02:05.729> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
move around too much is because when it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.110 
move around too much is because when it
does<00:02:06.240> move

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.120 
does move

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.160 
does move
around<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.870> stops<00:02:08.530> your<00:02:09.010> air<00:02:09.340> air<00:02:10.270> is<00:02:10.660> what<00:02:10.990> we

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
around it stops your air air is what we

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.570 
around it stops your air air is what we
need<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.950> be<00:02:12.520> able<00:02:12.790> to<00:02:13.240> sing<00:02:13.540> now<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.470> don't<00:02:15.160> want

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
need to be able to sing now I don't want

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.830 
need to be able to sing now I don't want
you<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.760> have<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.970> think<00:02:16.120> about<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.510> needs<00:02:16.690> to

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
you to have to think about it needs to

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.050 
you to have to think about it needs to
be<00:02:16.990> lured<00:02:17.350> or<00:02:17.920> any<00:02:18.160> of<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.490> it<00:02:18.670> don't<00:02:18.880> want

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
be lured or any of that it don't want

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.540 
be lured or any of that it don't want
you<00:02:19.240> moving<00:02:19.540> things<00:02:20.140> around<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:21.190> try<00:02:21.490> to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
you moving things around to try to

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.120 
you moving things around to try to
accomplish<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.630> I<00:02:22.870> just<00:02:23.350> need<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.830> get

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
accomplish that I just need you to get

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.550 
accomplish that I just need you to get
in<00:02:24.340> touch<00:02:24.700> with<00:02:24.730> where<00:02:25.270> it<00:02:25.420> is<00:02:25.600> so<00:02:26.110> if<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.320> put

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
in touch with where it is so if you put

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.030 
in touch with where it is so if you put
your<00:02:26.590> thumb<00:02:27.100> underneath<00:02:28.090> your<00:02:28.810> jaw<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.440> and

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
and swallow you feel those muscles come

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.090 
and swallow you feel those muscles come
down<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.400> they<00:02:34.000> will<00:02:34.450> move<00:02:35.080> your<00:02:35.620> merits

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
down and they will move your merits

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.200 
down and they will move your merits
again<00:02:37.060> this<00:02:37.720> is<00:02:38.050> why<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.680> lot<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.250> my<00:02:39.460> techniques

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
again this is why a lot of my techniques

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.230 
again this is why a lot of my techniques
are<00:02:40.510> working<00:02:40.990> on<00:02:41.170> getting<00:02:41.860> those<00:02:42.280> swallowing

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 
are working on getting those swallowing

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.440 
are working on getting those swallowing
muscles<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:44.440> relax<00:02:44.830> so<00:02:45.370> now<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:46.180> thing<00:02:46.420> that

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
muscles to relax so now the thing that

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.330 
muscles to relax so now the thing that
you're<00:02:46.750> always<00:02:46.780> trying<00:02:47.500> to<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:48.010> I<00:02:48.070> think

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
you're always trying to do and I think

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.640 
you're always trying to do and I think
in<00:02:48.550> the<00:02:48.730> beginning<00:02:49.240> some<00:02:49.900> people<00:02:50.320> are<00:02:50.440> trying

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
in the beginning some people are trying

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.640 
in the beginning some people are trying
a<00:02:51.010> little<00:02:51.190> bit<00:02:51.340> too<00:02:51.520> hard<00:02:52.090> you<00:02:52.720> start<00:02:53.050> to<00:02:53.260> push

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
a little bit too hard you start to push

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.730 
a little bit too hard you start to push
and<00:02:54.010> so<00:02:54.670> you're<00:02:55.150> kind<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.480> working<00:02:55.740> against

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
and so you're kind of working against

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.460 
and so you're kind of working against
yourself<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.310> I'm<00:02:57.460> going<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.730> use<00:02:58.270> a<00:02:58.600> lip<00:02:59.110> trill

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
yourself so I'm going to use a lip trill

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.190 
yourself so I'm going to use a lip trill
which<00:02:59.770> so<00:03:00.370> many<00:03:00.580> coaches<00:03:01.000> use<00:03:01.540> you've<00:03:01.810> seen

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
which so many coaches use you've seen

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.100 
which so many coaches use you've seen
this<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:02.830> much<00:03:03.160> but<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.970> like<00:03:04.300> for<00:03:04.630> you<00:03:04.720> to<00:03:04.870> gain

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
this so much but I like for you to gain

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.520 
this so much but I like for you to gain
the<00:03:05.410> concept<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.430> when<00:03:07.120> you're<00:03:07.360> using<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:08.290> lip

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
the concept of when you're using the lip

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.380 
the concept of when you're using the lip
trill<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.250> only<00:03:09.640> thing<00:03:09.850> you're<00:03:10.000> trying<00:03:10.180> to

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
through your entire range from the

up there I like using that word allowing
because<00:04:07.800> then<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.099> won't<00:04:08.310> have<00:04:08.400> the<00:04:08.700> tendency

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
because then you won't have the tendency

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.720 
because then you won't have the tendency
start<00:04:09.599> to<00:04:09.750> push<00:04:09.989> whenever<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:10.950> start<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.550> feel

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
start to push whenever you start to feel

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.059 
start to push whenever you start to feel
tired<00:04:11.760> or<00:04:12.540> you're<00:04:12.989> getting<00:04:13.260> hoarse<00:04:13.650> or

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
tired or you're getting hoarse or

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.550 
tired or you're getting hoarse or
whatever<00:04:14.849> it<00:04:15.000> might<00:04:15.180> be<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:16.079> are<00:04:16.200> pushing

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
whatever it might be you are pushing

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.860 
whatever it might be you are pushing
somewhere<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:17.850> lit<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.299> it's<00:04:18.450> so<00:04:18.600> in<00:04:18.750> the

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
somewhere so lit and it's so in the

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.170 
somewhere so lit and it's so in the
beginning<00:04:19.019> again<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:19.979> think<00:04:20.190> people<00:04:20.609> try<00:04:20.820> to<00:04:20.850> go

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
beginning again I think people try to go

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.850 
beginning again I think people try to go
for<00:04:21.630> getting<00:04:21.900> those<00:04:22.049> really<00:04:22.380> really<00:04:22.650> high

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
for getting those really really high

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.580 
for getting those really really high
notes<00:04:23.160> right<00:04:23.430> away<00:04:23.729> your<00:04:24.270> body<00:04:24.600> may<00:04:25.139> not<00:04:25.169> be

notes right away your body may not be

notes right away your body may not be
ready<00:04:26.130> for<00:04:26.430> that<00:04:26.639> right<00:04:27.360> away<00:04:27.720> you<00:04:28.169> want<00:04:28.560> to

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
ready for that right away you want to

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
ready for that right away you want to
let<00:04:29.070> this<00:04:29.370> grow<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.510> develop<00:04:31.139> so<00:04:31.860> again<00:04:32.280> all

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
let this grow and develop so again all

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.750 
let this grow and develop so again all
of<00:04:32.850> doing<00:04:33.630> it<00:04:33.780> when<00:04:34.020> you're<00:04:34.200> doing<00:04:34.590> this<00:04:34.800> think

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
of doing it when you're doing this think

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.480 
of doing it when you're doing this think
this<00:04:36.060> it'll<00:04:36.300> help<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.840> so<00:04:37.139> much<00:04:37.410> going<00:04:37.979> into

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
this it'll help you so much going into

this it'll help you so much going into
the<00:04:38.700> higher<00:04:39.090> notes<00:04:39.450> I'm<00:04:39.750> not<00:04:40.139> pushing<00:04:40.380> up

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
the higher notes I'm not pushing up

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.300 
the higher notes I'm not pushing up
there<00:04:40.950> I<00:04:41.160> am<00:04:41.550> merely<00:04:42.350> thinking<00:04:43.350> that<00:04:43.979> I'm

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
there I am merely thinking that I'm

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
there I am merely thinking that I'm
allowing<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:46.050> vocal<00:04:46.680> chords<00:04:47.070> to<00:04:47.340> get<00:04:47.639> smaller

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
allowing the vocal chords to get smaller

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.659 
allowing the vocal chords to get smaller
okay<00:04:48.960> so<00:04:49.440> now<00:04:49.710> I'm<00:04:49.800> gonna<00:04:49.919> do<00:04:50.190> it<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.460> see<00:04:50.580> if

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
okay so now I'm gonna do it and see if

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.640 
okay so now I'm gonna do it and see if
you<00:04:50.760> can<00:04:50.880> kind<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.210> get<00:04:51.450> that<00:04:51.630> sense<00:04:51.900> of<00:04:52.470> what

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
you can kind of get that sense of what

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.040 
you can kind of get that sense of what
I'm<00:04:52.770> doing<00:04:53.100> and<00:04:53.280> that<00:04:53.729> I'm<00:04:53.940> allowing<00:04:54.360> that<00:04:54.810> to

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
I'm doing and that I'm allowing that to

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:22.450 
I'm doing and that I'm allowing that to
happen

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.999 

and<00:05:23.460> yet<00:05:23.699> I<00:05:24.060> hope<00:05:24.659> you<00:05:24.810> saw<00:05:25.110> that<00:05:25.500> there<00:05:25.680> wasn't

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
and yet I hope you saw that there wasn't

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.890 
and yet I hope you saw that there wasn't
a<00:05:26.220> lot<00:05:26.370> of<00:05:26.400> movement<00:05:26.669> going<00:05:27.180> on<00:05:27.419> in<00:05:27.599> my<00:05:27.720> body

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
a lot of movement going on in my body

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.050 
a lot of movement going on in my body
now<00:05:28.319> in<00:05:28.349> the<00:05:28.590> beginning<00:05:28.740> and<00:05:29.490> maybe<00:05:29.759> I<00:05:29.849> won't

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
now in the beginning and maybe I won't

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.779 
now in the beginning and maybe I won't
get<00:05:30.270> all<00:05:30.419> the<00:05:30.659> higher<00:05:30.870> notes<00:05:31.169> right<00:05:31.710> away<00:05:32.069> but

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:32.789 
get all the higher notes right away but

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.070 
get all the higher notes right away but
you're<00:05:33.030> trying<00:05:33.509> to<00:05:33.750> develop<00:05:34.710> a<00:05:35.280> new<00:05:36.090> technique

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
you're trying to develop a new technique

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.490 
you're trying to develop a new technique
a<00:05:37.439> new<00:05:37.710> habit<00:05:38.370> in<00:05:38.610> your<00:05:38.759> body<00:05:38.969> which<00:05:39.419> is<00:05:39.840> not

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
a new habit in your body which is not

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.219 
a new habit in your body which is not
pushing<00:05:41.129> so<00:05:41.909> I<00:05:41.939> hope<00:05:42.210> that<00:05:42.270> clarifies<00:05:42.810> things

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
pushing so I hope that clarifies things

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.779
