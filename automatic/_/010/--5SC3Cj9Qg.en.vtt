cool thing is now it's now safer when
blog<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.130> I'd<00:01:38.220> imagine<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:38.909> you're

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
blog so I'd imagine that when you're

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.719 
blog so I'd imagine that when you're
doing<00:01:39.360> that<00:01:39.509> say<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.650> opponent<00:01:41.130> blocks<00:01:41.430> it

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
doing that say the opponent blocks it

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.149 
doing that say the opponent blocks it
instead<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.630> carrying<00:01:42.930> out<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.380> whole<00:01:43.649> rest

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
instead of carrying out the whole rest

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.950 
instead of carrying out the whole rest
of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.399> animation<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.390> simply<00:01:45.600> just

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
of the animation you just simply just

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.560 
of the animation you just simply just
stop<00:01:46.229> so<00:01:46.560> makes<00:01:47.369> Joker<00:01:47.729> quicker<00:01:48.060> along<00:01:48.420> with

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
stop so makes Joker quicker along with

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.330 
stop so makes Joker quicker along with
that<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> enhanced<00:01:49.290> meter<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.710> me<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.189> burn

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
that the enhanced meter for me to burn

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.880 
that the enhanced meter for me to burn
version<00:01:50.729> freeze<00:01:51.240> Joker<00:01:51.630> faster<00:01:52.049> I'm<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.799> I

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
version freeze Joker faster I'm like I

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.499 
version freeze Joker faster I'm like I
said<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:53.520> at<00:01:53.729> all<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.000> gonna<00:01:54.119> make<00:01:54.299> that

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
said all at all it's gonna make that

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.870 
said all at all it's gonna make that
whole<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.619> know<00:01:55.710> his<00:01:55.829> crowbar<00:01:56.219> special<00:01:56.670> move

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
whole you know his crowbar special move

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.240 
whole you know his crowbar special move
a<00:01:57.210> lot<00:01:57.869> quicker<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.500> if<00:01:58.680> you<00:01:58.799> go<00:01:58.920> forward

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
a lot quicker so if you go forward

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.730 
a lot quicker so if you go forward
despite<00:01:59.700> you<00:02:00.030> know<00:02:00.180> him<00:02:00.780> may<00:02:01.229> be<00:02:01.290> missing<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.070 
believe he shoots out acid and what it
does<00:02:35.640> does<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.210> opponent<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:36.690> you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:36.870> go<00:02:36.960> on

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
does does the opponent so you can go on

there pull off a combo they can't blanc
and<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.510> cool<00:02:39.660> thing<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.110> like<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.380> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and the cool thing is is like to the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.990 
and the cool thing is is like to the
crowbar<00:02:40.800> i<00:02:40.830> mean<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:41.130> you<00:02:41.190> do<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.520> and<00:02:41.790> we

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
crowbar i mean if you do that and we

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.400 
crowbar i mean if you do that and we
were<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.150> block<00:02:42.390> it<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.690> animation<00:02:43.170> yet<00:02:43.320> the

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
were to block it the animation yet the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.600 
were to block it the animation yet the
way<00:02:43.470> for<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.650> whole<00:02:43.770> animation<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.340> if<00:02:44.460> this

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
way for the whole animation so if this

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.180 
way for the whole animation so if this
it's<00:02:44.850> like<00:02:45.030> um<00:02:45.510> hey<00:02:46.170> he<00:02:46.410> gets<00:02:46.560> blocked<00:02:46.800> but<00:02:47.100> it

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
it's like um hey he gets blocked but it

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.800 
it's like um hey he gets blocked but it
doesn't<00:02:47.400> matter<00:02:47.490> because<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:47.970> i'm<00:02:48.660> not

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
doesn't matter because it's i'm not

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.910 
doesn't matter because it's i'm not
having<00:02:48.990> to<00:02:49.140> perform<00:02:49.260> a<00:02:49.440> five<00:02:49.590> second

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
having to perform a five second

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.890 
having to perform a five second
animation<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.460> gets<00:02:50.970> cut<00:02:51.180> down<00:02:51.210> prolly<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.780> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
animation it gets cut down prolly to the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.990 
animation it gets cut down prolly to the
half<00:02:52.050> you<00:02:52.590> know<00:02:52.680> 2.5<00:02:53.250> seconds<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.760> pretty

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
half you know 2.5 seconds is pretty

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.580 
half you know 2.5 seconds is pretty
 cool<00:02:54.450> all<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:55.020> all<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.320> making

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
jokers upgrades seem that they really

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.890 
jokers upgrades seem that they really
just<00:03:10.739> them<00:03:11.160> I<00:03:11.430> didn't<00:03:12.239> think<00:03:12.270> he<00:03:12.570> needed<00:03:12.720> that

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
just them I didn't think he needed that

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.240 
just them I didn't think he needed that
much<00:03:13.050> of<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.230> boost<00:03:13.410> but<00:03:13.770> to<00:03:13.860> see<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.130> they're

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
much of a boost but to see that they're

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.550 
much of a boost but to see that they're
making<00:03:14.340> characters<00:03:14.760> not<00:03:15.090> even<00:03:15.330> faster<00:03:15.930> they

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
making characters not even faster they

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.960 
making characters not even faster they
want<00:03:16.739> gameplay<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.190> be<00:03:17.310> faster<00:03:17.670> in<00:03:17.730> certain

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
want gameplay to be faster in certain

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.630
