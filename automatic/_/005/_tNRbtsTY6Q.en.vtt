00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.840
 m 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.099
 hi to all his stores 5.15 in photo 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.980
 you today for a new video 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.630
 you stay at 5 online for a guide 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.070
 which will allow to have a dozen 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.329
 torno in five minutes 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.739
 so after the 1.13 patch so I use 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.790
 a barrel but it also works with 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.309
 other cars 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.309
 so I also advise with the adores 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.149
 so for governed glee who you will have 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.420
 have two garages so a garage with 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.129
 10 places so I have the garage of 400 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.760
 miles and the next one so it costs 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.320
 270 thousand times you have it both 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.149
 garages you will take a car 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.679
 so who is doing with the guide for 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.769
 have thirteen vehicles in his garage 

00:00:56.679 --> 00:01:01.649
 so it is replaced with the bmx and so 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.030
 then you go out outside 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.950
 so with the car that replaced with 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.729
 the bmx 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.380
 once you are outside the 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:11.590
 garage you will go to 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.090
 second garage so you have so 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.220
 not that it is necessary that your second garage 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.590
 is full ie it is no longer 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.850
 of place 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.200
 once you've arrived so 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.470
 in front of the garage you will go to 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.970
 inside so with your prono 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.780
 so here is related to the image of the full rh 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.610
 which is displayed and you are at 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.369
 inside you will replace with 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.530
 a car of your choice there is 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.890
 also to go out have very quickly your 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.890
 garage 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.580
 and convoy congestion of the garage but 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.280
 still a turning point that will be 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.450
 right in front of you you will take and 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.620
 to go back to our garage 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.229
 you there you will replace another one 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.490
 times with a car of your choice and 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.640
 where I was seen I already have two 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.750
 internal to donations that has been duplicated 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.080
 so after all it takes 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.030
 dyeed many times so you 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.670
 duplicate a user in 30 seconds 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.590
 so every time so that you go out 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.200
 just so outside the garage and 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.580
 then two men back to school so 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.730
 it's a bit logical that it takes 30 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.730
 seconds 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.640
 so that's the end of these videos 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.250
 so do not hesitate liked the video and 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.750
 buying rock camp so on this Thursday at 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.320
 the next for a next video 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.320
 go jo
