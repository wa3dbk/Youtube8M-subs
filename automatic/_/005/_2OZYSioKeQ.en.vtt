00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:21.270
 knitting the front loop of the back wall 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:26.390
 loops with this right hand specialists we 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:31.200
 keep exactly the same as holding a couple 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:38.600
 the working thread is lowered on the index 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:44.239
 finger and hold three fingers of thread 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:48.450
 then we take the first loop 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.980
 we transfer it to the right knitting needle and the second 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:57.680
 knit loop for this right 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:01.260
 knitting a needle into a loop from right to left 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.630
 so that she was under 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.160
 left knitting needle then right and right 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:14.270
 grab with the index finger 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.270
 thread and pull the loop 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.830
 then the middle finger of the right hand 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:27.090
 I move forward and remove the loop with 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:31.610
 left knitting needles and so knit all the waist 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.619
 we put the loops right to left inside 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.970
 loops right knitting needle so she 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:43.850
 it was at the bottom of the left knitting 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:47.729
 grab the thread and thread the loop 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:51.560
 then move the middle finger right 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:58.009
 hands and a loop with from the left 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:00.890
 knitting needles this way of knitting the front loop 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:05.880
 used only if 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:10.590
 the rear wall of the loop is to the right 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:14.209
 and the feather bed the wall of the loop is to the left and 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:19.190
 only in this case we succeed 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.190
 correct facial loop 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.500
 there is another opportunity to tie 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.030
 front loop behind the back wall of the loop 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.430
 the difference is that we will 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.400
 grab the thread with the index finger 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.959
 not right to left as in the previous one 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.900
 way and vice versa 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:48.709
 from left to right and the loop that we have 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.769
 it will turn out to be sent to another 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.310
 side however she will too 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.739
 right and I do not really advise 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.489
 use this way because he 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.079
 me 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:07.120
 convenient communication 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:10.069
