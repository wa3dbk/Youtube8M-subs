00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.730
 good 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.090
 or 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.030
 good to all we are back in 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.450
 minecraft and let's see another tutorial on 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.450
 how much to pay for this game 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:23.630
 and this is the tutorial we are going to do today 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.160
 consists of the best arch and the best and 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.730
 the best sword you can get 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.120
 in creative because in his rival is 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.070
 totally impossible are the two best 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.070
 there is nothing better in minecraft that is 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.960
 all this script to sword none can 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.450
 remove more damage none can do anything 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.040
 more that is good is simply the 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.360
 fire not that it is a choice but 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.640
 We are talking in terms of damage 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.360
 normal and current is worth then you are 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.460
 ready to see the commands 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.640
 the maximum level and pretend how to have is 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.600
 32,667 according to what I had read for 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.360
 the for the list of minecraft and tests 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.870
 same mine had seen that the level 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.480
 maximum in 22 thousand 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.010
 73 but good 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.010
 so we're going to copy this number 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.430
 let's put here 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.950
 because I made a mistake exposing the 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.460
 number then I'll check better if an error 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.409
 I'm sorry if in all this tour 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.880
 but good not to have that this is the arc 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:32.010
 stronger than we are going to do 32 thousand 767 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.760
 there is no arc more powerful than this 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.520
 I mean 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.250
 clinging to cow for a shot 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.130
 nailed souls now also cares what 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.050
 we burst we expose one here 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.700
 because it is a little bit far 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.920
 let's put a we there so you can see 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.090
 what will the twitter 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.090
 It's going to be three visits 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.799
 and let's put a we there 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.350
 here here 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.220
 and so 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.830
 may be expected in the command 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.319
 Lets put 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.780
 one blow we load widder 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.700
 only one push 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.260
 and dragon alan in case you want to see it 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.230
 are two 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.230
 in fact we are very well paid 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:38.310
 for simon in dirt dragon 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:43.239
 the uppercase of the dragon 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.540
 relative relative of a relative that we 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.540
 He gave 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.270
 the drama moment here 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.330
 Where has gone 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.560
 I do not go hit good I'll be seeing 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.319
 they have dragon are also a single 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.030
 hit is 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.580
 It is written in the following 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.500
 You see that a single blow will not seek to sell 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.220
 good dragon let's contribute here 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.220
 remember the glass 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.849
 seeing this arch what you can have 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.670
 all your departure or there is nothing 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.860
 more still 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.040
 I am creative games maps and things 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.720
 so you can put it perfectly and already 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.240
 finally let's see the sword more 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.020
 flat of the game 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:39.650
 and the master sword of play 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:44.080
 hit 32 thousand 763 67 and sharpness 32,666 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:47.870
 seeing that the damage is 40 thousand 60 and 40 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:50.950
 1965 to 75 damage winning as it comes 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.930
 I should but this sword puts 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.549
 much 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.560
 and let's check it of course 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.560
 than before with an under dragon 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.580
 but you are seeing that he does not put so much 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:09.680
 like the bow no matter what it takes to 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.680
 you're like a little thing I do 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.889
 of the things or the blows and the sword 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:22.639
 it removes very little comparison 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.639
 the root system 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:30.110
 good perfect 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.060
 and finally we were ambushed by widder 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.010
 but I'm seeing that compared to 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.830
 the bow or the sword 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.170
 has much to envy to an arch 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:42.230
 but many put a we there so that 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:46.090
 let's see how much damage do nothing 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.090
 you can not put an object because 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.370
 we look good 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.180
 jett why 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:02.240
 you can not put the link in the east 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:09.479
 well, we can not put a we there 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.479
 I have to do it by hand again 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.930
 and that is very strange but good 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.740
 nothing happens we put it in the form 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.210
 traditional 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:27.940
 and find out why it does not work 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:27.940
 well here are the 34 sousan and the little house 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.900
 how to see continuously with the rotten ones 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.290
 now we let the pressure finish 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.290
 solid 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:44.080
 and it 's a blow to load the widder 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.449
 You see the difference between the 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.580
 leader and the dragon clearly to a 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:50.409
 amount still did not look bestial in the 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.900
 dragon an effort does not take away anything from 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:54.030
 life almost 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.220
 here is the narcopoder magician 5 turn on 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.250
 special dragon and the weather is charging 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:01.139
 at a stroke the sword is watching the 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.479
 levels of each or either you are 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:04.410
 knowing how the blows work 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:06.660
 stick and others 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:08.630
 this the most I could have there is no 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.460
 I just want this 

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.950
 that is as much as there is nothing to 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.530
 zero 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.550
 so I'm going to leave the commands what 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.820
 I'll leave it in the excretion box 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.710
 surely you can copy it 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.670
 but here they are in case you want to copy 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:24.240
 those here 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.200
 and here everything is worth 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:29.120
 a lady cheto so 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.940
