00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.240
 new video today I show you how you 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.250
 something here or something here 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.820
 or maybe something like that here 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.789
 first of all you need one 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.859
 long until this is a short one now 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.949
 I 've already cut it pretty much 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.960
 just you just take these pants and 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.570
 cut it off as per eye so me 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.519
 I always do that I'll watch it here 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.439
 how long is that about then wrinkled 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.880
 these and then zack zack zack once 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.980
 cut that is pretty easy that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.430
 creates you are can you also put 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.110
 and then with a kajal pen other 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.270
 two bar as on the trousers along 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.219
 pull or cut a thanks that 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.800
 they do so now and what about these 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.640
 interface here this one knew here 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.530
 hinzubekommen beautiful 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.180
 it looks quite different here 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.680
 Do we want to have that happen ? 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.520
 we do what you take one 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.520
 Tweezers and here do not know how that good 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.850
 You can see these threads here 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.260
 pull her out 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.790
 it takes something it does not work within 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.110
 from a few minutes 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.490
 Eventually, the performance gets in it 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.920
 hereby the cameras now a bit 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.930
 difficult to show how hangs me 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.450
 In the middle of the face this camera every 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.020
 case pulls here on these threads and 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.979
 if they have done that for a while 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.170
 then you eventually take that 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.909
 sometime like this so you can see her 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.500
 still the difference these threads here 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.439
 they look different than they are here 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.150
 a lot of bubbly fluffy that 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.409
 happens automatically when you have the pants 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:49.560
 so everything was easy okay but how come 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.909
 I now here from how do I do this 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.210
 used optics in here 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.710
 yes my very first tried at that time 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.229
 I just taken emery paper and 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.479
 I said my round so fast 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.340
 about that works absolutely 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.110
 I can not tell you you can do it 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.670
 refine with the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.429
 emery paper but you get then 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.230
 certainly not with such optics 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.959
 you get that look 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:21.800
 turn around here on the basis of these trousers 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:28.090
 take scissors and cut one 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.090
 make it a little bigger, yes 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.300
 so of course you can do a lot 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.930
 make bigger cuts is yours 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.910
 leave 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.180
 and then you pull these again 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.709
 threads are out then at some point 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.390
 threads 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:44.080
 it always makes you keep on doing it 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.080
 Keep going 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.220
 Of course, that's only the case here 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.290
 very small stalls I now here 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.540
 you can work very big 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.580
 cracks make cuts and then quite 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.980
 great to draw from it so that it is in 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.120
 the final result then looks after every 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.989
 Of course you can do that as well 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.090
 make much smaller 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.819
 You can still do that on the back 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.230
 Could also do a bit with this 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.209
 the sandpaper a bit so 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.620
 keep it up then it's just a bit 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.660
 open that works with these 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.489
 bags quite well if you have the effect 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.810
 you do not want to be easy then 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.630
 just sand that you have to with the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.480
 make tweezers ok now remains 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.160
 a question open how do I do this 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.840
 how do i do this besides i like this one 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.810
 Look really like that reminds me 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.700
 somehow see you say girls 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.950
 tanned everything is how it works 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.569
 Do you make this lying in there that is 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.560
 Not that complicated I have now 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:44.150
 here a black and by this 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.980
 pants I'll show you this now her 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.450
 Order these stitches on her 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:52.579
 be on the internet or you can buy it in the internet 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:54.140
 we have such well you can 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.940
 shut up so understand your man 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.329
 Only one can poke and then you work 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.130
 the um 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:05.180
 I'll do that now I'll do it 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:08.299
 just as pure then we come such 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.540
 four beeps out then 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:16.700
 simply quite easy with somehow one 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:18.789
 knife or something folded down and then 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.160
 have you already attached the rent? 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:26.060
 show you how it looks and then 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:28.130
 inside so the pieks but nothing 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.590
 this is as if you laying off well 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.340
 is that everything smooth and then it can in 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.150
 look like this 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.979
 Now I'll give you a few more 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.380
 inspirations like your pants because 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:43.039
 so can the class guest the 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.210
 50 only in the light wash the 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:44.840
 already a bit older this already 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.400
 cracked 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.470
 I can not stand that I have 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.680
 now brought a new one here again 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:54.440
 a 501 as you could see that 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.639
 it depends so they should 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.360
 Pay attention if you really have that 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.180
 the classic retro local always that 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.250
 501 and mostly in the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.919
 I just wash here 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.860
 No one is rolling optics after one 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.780
 Hosenbein here is also a possibility 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.490
 that no lewis now needs other but 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.789
 I wanted to have them because of this 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.740
 light blue at the front and jeans blue 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:22.090
 and behind is the light blue as its called 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.440
 you carry the mega cool effect so have 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.910
 I just wear a long pair of pants again 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.090
 cut it off a bit this time 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.070
 it was already freaking out 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.660
 here we have one with such patches 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.770
 on it so that were here in this case 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.229
 of course you can of course 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.419
 own record and thereby 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.150
 sits just really really really casually 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.780
 cool and relaxed out too cool 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:47.289
 this is the one I am now from leaf 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.180
 black gray yes you can do well 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.070
 pretty cool out on festivals that is 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.710
 Definitely a looker that I am 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.860
 one more time they want either the 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:57.220
 is again the 501 here I like it 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.139
 very 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.759
 I'll probably work on it 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:02.020
 Maybe I'll do it 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.330
 these cracks row i'll be on everyone 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.220
 If you have more questions, please do it 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.710
 and here we have them just like me 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:12.810
 already said typical usa american girl 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.010
 meet a typical jeans blue destroyed 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.020
 In any case, I like this very much 

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.490
 here for the people who are there 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.669
 a bit simpler that is now 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.979
 also a little bit dark blue 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:26.970
 not so much the cross here 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:30.070
 a little bit is kept simple 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:31.960
 yes that is with my life jeans and 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.849
 I wanted my other jean shorts 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.380
 Show how I do this until the 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.120
