 welcome back to national today les 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.330
 let's teach the different ways 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.309
 they are groups that to eliminate 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.360
 Applications in our Huawei phone 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.519

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.230
 before we invite you here to subscribe to 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.760

 Your subscription charges is completely 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.720
 free and that truth for being aware 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.000
 of all the videos and give the questions 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.470
 comments or suggestions 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.289
 then to remove applications not 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.510
 is the cell phone there are several methods the most 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.480
 easy is basically being here in the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.090
 home screen catch the lec tips 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 for over to the immediate icon that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.370
 immediately a little pot comes out here 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.160
 trash we go to him and here we get a 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.899
 option that asks us if we want 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.879
 we want to uninstall the application 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.200
 here we will accept it to install it 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.210
 or cancel if we do not want 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.370
 It is the first way to install 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.860
 applications on our phone and the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.940
 another way is by entering suddenly here 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.160
 to the play store 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.500
 being in the play store we are going to give us 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.400
 click here the three dashes 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.280
 we look for my applications and being in 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.350
 my installed applications we look for 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.240
 soon the one that does not interest us much 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.090
 let's see what the applications are 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.890
 that I have installed here I can search 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.890
 again in that I showed you right now 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.930
 it's called show apps show 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.630
 percentages the battery and here also I 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.880
 the option to uninstall or open 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.190
 then over here we can also say 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.280
 install the applications we are going to 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.930
 get out of this and another way is 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.220
 installing the application is obviously 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.470
 through the options of 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.140
 phone settings and we're 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.080
 here by configuration we go to the option 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.159
 which says applications being in 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.090
 application we look for the downloaded ones 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.149
 we look for the ones that we have downloaded 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.940
 we enter this and here says the option 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.380
 uninstall then undo third 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.960
 way that we can uninstall 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.930
 applications of our mobile phone and 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.560
 huawei 6 10 basically that was all for

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.400
 that you know that I have not mentioned 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.140
 I do that who is not like a 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.420
 application because you're going to have to 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.160
