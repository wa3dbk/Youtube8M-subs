00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
off in the back of the seat here so we

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.430 
off in the back of the seat here so we
can<00:00:45.360> get<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.510> tool<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.110> and<00:00:46.230> get<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.350> apart

alright<00:00:49.440> we<00:00:49.800> go

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:33.440 

you

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:02:13.420 

you

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.309 

all<00:02:14.430> right<00:02:14.670> we<00:02:15.330> don't<00:02:15.540> have<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.750> choice<00:02:15.959> here

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
all right we don't have a choice here

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.930 
all right we don't have a choice here
because<00:02:17.099> when<00:02:17.310> they<00:02:17.430> put<00:02:17.640> them<00:02:17.730> up<00:02:17.819> together

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
because when they put them up together

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.199 
because when they put them up together
risley<00:02:18.630> there<00:02:19.110> was<00:02:19.230> about<00:02:19.440> probably<00:02:19.970> 38<00:02:20.970> so

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
risley there was about probably 38 so

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.760 
risley there was about probably 38 so
the<00:02:21.360> bolt<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.780> stuck<00:02:22.020> passing<00:02:22.440> nut<00:02:22.590> and<00:02:22.739> I

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
the bolt that stuck passing nut and I

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.380 
the bolt that stuck passing nut and I
just<00:02:22.980> took<00:02:23.099> a<00:02:23.160> pair<00:02:23.430> of<00:02:23.459> pliers<00:02:23.610> and<00:02:24.090> broke<00:02:24.270> it

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
just took a pair of pliers and broke it

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.080 
just took a pair of pliers and broke it
off<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.950> buggers<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.130> end<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.640> threads

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
off so buggers the end of the threads

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.520 
off so buggers the end of the threads
where<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.480> can't<00:02:27.690> just<00:02:27.870> undo<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.349> duck

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
where you can't just undo the duck

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.470 
where you can't just undo the duck
there's<00:02:29.340> no<00:02:29.489> way<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.700> hold<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.060> front<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
there's no way to hold the front of the

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.509 
there's no way to hold the front of the
nut<00:02:30.660> because<00:02:31.230> it's<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.560> smooth<00:02:31.800> top<00:02:32.099> so<00:02:32.310> don't

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:32.519 
nut because it's a smooth top so don't

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.100 
nut because it's a smooth top so don't
catch<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:32.940> in<00:02:33.180> close<00:02:33.390> when<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:33.630> sit<00:02:33.900> in<00:02:34.050> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
catch it in close when you sit in the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.309 
catch it in close when you sit in the
seat<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:35.420> that's<00:02:36.420> what<00:02:36.540> we're<00:02:36.660> going<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:36.959> store
