may be important for the team to have at

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.380 
may be important for the team to have at

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.710 
least two additional games in in
February<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.799> team<00:01:34.979> as<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.490> have<00:01:35.850> quite

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
February to the team as you have quite

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.319 
February to the team as you have quite
some<00:01:37.680> young<00:01:37.890> players<00:01:38.100> an<00:01:38.610> experienced<00:01:39.119> place

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
some young players an experienced place

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.929 
some young players an experienced place
on<00:01:39.540> European<00:01:40.439> level<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:41.310> them<00:01:41.430> it's<00:01:41.610> always<00:01:41.909> a

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
on European level for them it's always a

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.389 
on European level for them it's always a
good<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.689> good<00:01:42.780> thing<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:43.799> I<00:01:43.829> think<00:01:44.159> that

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
good a good thing and so I think that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.840 
good a good thing and so I think that
should<00:01:44.640> be<00:01:44.700> an<00:01:44.909> additional<00:01:45.829> in<00:01:46.829> target<00:01:47.280> once

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
should be an additional in target once

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.670 
should be an additional in target once
again<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.450> came<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.350> she<00:01:49.470> kept<00:01:49.649> making

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
again I came with if she kept making

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.170 
again I came with if she kept making
under<00:01:50.250> pressure<00:01:50.520> how<00:01:50.700> do<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.880> think<00:01:51.030> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
under pressure how do you think the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.630 
under pressure how do you think the
players<00:01:51.360> will<00:01:51.570> come<00:01:51.780> tomorrow<00:01:52.280> pressure<00:01:53.280> is

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
players will come tomorrow pressure is

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.940 
players will come tomorrow pressure is
part<00:01:54.360> of<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.720> job<00:01:54.930> for<00:01:55.500> me<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.770> not<00:01:55.920> a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
part of the job for me it's not a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.840 
part of the job for me it's not a
special<00:01:56.490> item<00:01:57.290> the<00:01:58.290> pressure<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.890> how<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.219> you
