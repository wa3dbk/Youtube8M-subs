that now the ghost strokes that I
embellish<00:01:15.799> to<00:01:15.979> our<00:01:16.210> left<00:01:17.210> hand<00:01:17.630> on<00:01:17.899> the<00:01:17.960> E<00:01:18.289> and

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
of one and once again this will be on a

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:23.080 
of one and once again this will be on a
transcription<00:01:21.799> at<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.039> end<00:01:22.189> so<00:01:22.820> in<00:01:23.000> the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
transcription at the end so in the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.630 
transcription at the end so in the
beginning<00:01:23.240> it's<00:01:24.549> 10<00:01:26.320> 2<00:01:27.320> is<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.590> accent<00:01:28.490> and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
beginning it's 10 2 is the accent and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.209 
beginning it's 10 2 is the accent and
then<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.270> 2<00:01:29.780> is<00:01:29.929> a<00:01:29.960> ghost<00:01:30.229> note<00:01:30.590> so<00:01:31.009> now<00:01:31.159> we

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
then the of 2 is a ghost note so now we

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:40.230 
then the of 2 is a ghost note so now we
have<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:36.829> e<00:01:36.859> end<00:01:37.369> of<00:01:37.759> 3<00:01:38.329> is<00:01:38.570> a<00:01:38.600> ghost<00:01:38.960> stroke

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
have the e end of 3 is a ghost stroke

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:47.800 
have the e end of 3 is a ghost stroke
and<00:01:41.320> so<00:01:42.320> now<00:01:42.499> that<00:01:42.740> put<00:01:42.979> together<00:01:43.310> sounds<00:01:43.820> like

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.039 

and<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.650> for<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.490> accent<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.540> up<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
and on for it's the accent and and up is

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:06.020 
and on for it's the accent and and up is
the<00:01:52.290> ghost<00:01:52.500> stroke<00:02:04.250> when<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> went<00:02:05.549> to<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.789> ride

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
the ghost stroke when I went to the ride

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.380 
the ghost stroke when I went to the ride
I<00:02:06.509> put<00:02:07.500> kind<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.890> like<00:02:08.039> a<00:02:08.069> swing<00:02:08.610> bounce<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.360> it

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
I put kind of like a swing bounce to it

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.350 
I put kind of like a swing bounce to it
and<00:02:09.630> just<00:02:09.690> bounce<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.560> 16<00:02:11.039> notes<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.060> get

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
and just bounce the 16 notes so you get

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:28.759 
and just bounce the 16 notes so you get
this<00:02:12.569> field<00:02:13.010> 12<00:02:26.989> so<00:02:27.989> let's<00:02:28.200> go<00:02:28.350> back<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:28.590> the

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
this field 12 so let's go back to the

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.199 
this field 12 so let's go back to the
performance<00:02:29.340> video<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.819> then<00:02:29.910> we'll<00:02:30.030> check

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
performance video and then we'll check

00:02:30.209 --> 00:03:12.490 
performance video and then we'll check
out<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.390> transcription

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.559 

okay<00:03:13.500> so<00:03:13.560> there's<00:03:13.950> a<00:03:14.040> simple<00:03:14.610> way<00:03:14.640> of<00:03:14.819> taking<00:03:15.360> a
