all<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.980> Chinese<00:00:38.550> scooter<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.030> one<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
all of this so Chinese scooter is one of

all of this so Chinese scooter is one of
the<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.870> biggest<00:00:40.230> problems<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:41.100> their<00:00:41.399> hoses

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
the the biggest problems is their hoses

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970 
the the biggest problems is their hoses
they<00:00:42.540> dry<00:00:42.809> rot<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.230> crack<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.770> then<00:00:43.860> I'll

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
they dry rot and crack and then I'll

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.000 
they dry rot and crack and then I'll
leave<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> stranded<00:00:45.739> hoses<00:00:46.739> are<00:00:46.860> very

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
is a vacuum line a helix vacuum line

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.840 
is a vacuum line a helix vacuum line
this<00:00:55.050> view<00:00:55.320> does<00:00:55.559> vacuum<00:00:55.920> line<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.219> great<00:00:56.579> they

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
this view does vacuum line is great they

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.750 
this view does vacuum line is great they
will<00:00:56.969> never<00:00:57.149> dry<00:00:57.449> rot<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:58.440> won't<00:00:58.620> crack<00:00:58.949> you

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.160 
will never dry rot they won't crack you
don't<00:00:59.940> even<00:01:00.059> need<00:01:00.180> hose<00:01:00.420> clamps<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:00.899> put<00:01:01.079> it

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
don't even need hose clamps you put it

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.650 
don't even need hose clamps you put it
on<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:02.250> cannot<00:01:02.579> pull<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.969> off<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.329> great

on and you cannot pull it off the great

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.960 
on and you cannot pull it off the great
line<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.470> use<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.769> up<00:01:05.010> every<00:01:05.250> day<00:01:05.549> it's

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
line we use this up every day it's

really good stuff same with the fuel
line<00:01:08.670> really<00:01:09.570> good<00:01:09.750> exit<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
line really good exit just like the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.950 
line really good exit just like the
vacuum<00:01:11.520> line<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.060> it's<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.510> made<00:01:12.750> for

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
vacuum line but it's this is made for

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.880 
vacuum line but it's this is made for
fuel<00:01:13.340> this<00:01:14.340> comes<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.700> kit<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.090> well<00:01:15.890> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
fuel this comes in the kit as well and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.630 
fuel this comes in the kit as well and
then<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> get<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.430> quality<00:01:18.350> fuel<00:01:19.350> filter<00:01:19.710> which

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
then you get a quality fuel filter which

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640 
then you get a quality fuel filter which
normally<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.990> Chinese<00:01:22.320> ones<00:01:22.530> they

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
normally we on the Chinese ones they

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.550 
normally we on the Chinese ones they
crack<00:01:23.009> they<00:01:23.580> dry<00:01:23.820> rot<00:01:24.030> just<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:25.320> like<00:01:25.380> I

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
crack they dry rot just like just like I

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.289 
crack they dry rot just like just like I
was<00:01:25.680> saying<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.979> hoses<00:01:26.280> it'll<00:01:26.880> crack<00:01:27.090> right

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
was saying the hoses it'll crack right

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
filter you also get a NGK spark plug

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.420 
filter you also get a NGK spark plug
this<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.909> really<00:01:36.270> good<00:01:36.450> spark<00:01:36.750> plug<00:01:37.430> top

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
this is a really good spark plug top

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.569 
this is a really good spark plug top
line<00:01:38.759> get<00:01:39.329> rid<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:40.040> blowing<00:01:41.040> spark<00:01:41.400> plug

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
line get rid of that blowing spark plug

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.109 
line get rid of that blowing spark plug
that's<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.909> there<00:01:42.920> also<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.189> chinese<00:01:44.759> scooters

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
that's in there also to chinese scooters

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.840 
that's in there also to chinese scooters
have<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> problem<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.259> their<00:01:46.520> valve<00:01:47.520> stems

cracking it's in very important that you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.550 
cracking it's in very important that you
upgrade<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.000> valve<00:01:51.270> stems<00:01:51.570> if<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.350> don't

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
upgrade the valve stems if you don't

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.990 
upgrade the valve stems if you don't
upgrade<00:01:52.770> them<00:01:53.040> you'll<00:01:53.220> need<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.520> lube<00:01:53.820> them

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
upgrade them you'll need to lube them

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.910 
upgrade them you'll need to lube them
with<00:01:54.750> grease<00:01:55.049> put<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.320> little<00:01:55.470> bit<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.740> grease

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
with grease put a little bit of grease

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.969 
with grease put a little bit of grease
on<00:01:56.100> them<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:57.570> prevent<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:59.270> also<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.619> is<00:02:01.619> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
on them to prevent that also to is the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.410 
on them to prevent that also to is the
magnetic<00:02:02.850> drain<00:02:03.030> plug<00:02:03.299> kit<00:02:03.649> there<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.770> no

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
magnetic drain plug kit there is no

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.249 
magnetic drain plug kit there is no
magnet<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.570> end<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.780> your<00:02:06.899> drain<00:02:07.110> plug

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
magnet on the end of your drain plug

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.889 
magnet on the end of your drain plug
right<00:02:07.500> now<00:02:07.649> which<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:07.950> problem<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:09.270> whenever

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
right now which is a problem so whenever

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.589 
right now which is a problem so whenever
you<00:02:10.050> change<00:02:10.289> your<00:02:10.470> oil<00:02:10.700> put<00:02:11.700> these<00:02:11.879> in<00:02:12.150> very

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
you change your oil put these in very
