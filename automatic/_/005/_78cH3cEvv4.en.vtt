00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.870
 welcome to with ay 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.170
 here I bring you another video guys and this 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.030
 Once I bring you a short review about the 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.830
 inferior world you already know that in this 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.600
 new update have changed then a 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.580
 couple of things have added some things 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.260
 and I wanted to teach you a bit 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.900
 see everything is where you can find the 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.550
 things and all that is worth as you see guys 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.980
 because the new things that there are that are 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.970
 the fortresses and the new enemies 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.560
 practically the new enemies then 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.359
 the first cousins ​​of the slides that 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.670
 are the magma cubes here you see them 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.560
 we break them and that's a little more 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.329
 crazy thrown in the washing when 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.489
 we break up they become smaller the same as 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.620
 the is lines and they release some balls 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.360
 they are called magma cream that are 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.489
 exactly that the nasty little balls 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.949
 Exactly the same is true but of the 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.579
 lower world are red and have lava 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.230
 good the strengths guys we are 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.750
 almost forced to come to them if 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.280
 we want to make any kind of potion 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.260
 jackie to make the potions 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.839
 we need 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.879
 these little plants you see here guys 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:05.500
 which are the warts of the lower world 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.479
 we need to do any 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.799
 kind of potion so we'll have to 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.960
 come and to make the table 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.330
 elaboration of potions we have to 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.770
 kill at least one blake the play is the 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.780
 final translation guys at the end they 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.280
 flame are called flames directly and 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.140
 the bars are called flame bar 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.640
 so to make that table 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.789
 elaboration of potions we need the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.840
 flame bar and good those warts 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.369
 of the lower world that we will have to 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.439
 catch and cultivate and to us as 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.600
 we want but you have to come for 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.179
 them to the strengths the balls that 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.039
 they release us the magma cubes the truth 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.200
 which are very useful especially to come 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.119
 here are the magma creams that we 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.039
 they serve to make potions that give us 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.380
 resistance to fire is to say that when 

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.909
 fire we do not over do us nothing 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.560
 which is very useful to face 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.259
 the flames or the blazers that I tell you 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.360
 so once we have access to the 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.970
 potions making table I would say 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.409
 never come to the lower world 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.450
 these strengths but a position of 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.530
 fire resistance I like it I'll 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.450
 teach 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.729
 why part or what does the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.289
 area where the plays out the flames 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.760
 these we have to kill for 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.039
 get 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.929
 those little golden tubes 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.370
 just around here guys in some 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.170
 of the corridors as you see around here and 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.480
 here I have left a chest in which 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.549
 they even give me some pants 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.769
 delighted that that always always 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.659
 thanks in addition to a music disc and 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.239
 some things more and a little more 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.159
 ahead as you will be seeing there is a 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.510
 zone of reappearance of enemies in the 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.159
 lower world guys all the enemies 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.409
 they go anywhere except the plays 

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.180
 the play only comes out in these areas that 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:34.530
 they only come out in the fortresses so 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.139
 we will have to find the strengths 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.639
 I already tell you that the strengths are not so 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:41.939
 easy to find it has cost me 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:45.480
 quite find some and good to kill 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:47.159
 to the flames to the plays does not seem 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.480
 very complicated but just like you see in 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.459
 these areas 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.560
 they come out very many I would recommend to attract 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.239
 torches and block the area 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.310
 reappearance so that they do not come out more in 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.169
 As long as one comes out, it is always worthwhile 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.209
 we kill at least the majority of times 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:02.010
 I have killed them they have given me the bar 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.439
 call that we need for the table 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.689
 of making potions so no 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.239
 there is no problem with killing one or two 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:10.799
 would be worth it in case we want to have several 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.419
 emotional elaboration tables and now 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.770
 it is but good it would be much more 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:16.830
 easy 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.780
 with the fire resistance potion and 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.480
 that laws attack with flares like 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.710
 you see here and good with a position 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.350
 of resistance to fire the truth is that 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.940
 It would be super easy to face them 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.730
 so once we get one of these 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.370
 Flame bars return and get more 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.590
 it would be a lot easier it's worth that yes 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.940
 guys before finishing with this review 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.860
 that you have already seen a little bit that I have 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.140
 taught more or less what there is 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.810
 I would recommend guys now that they work 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.390
 in the pool the sender paul and 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.740
 they work to teleport us 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.780
 I would recommend that if you are going to come to 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.840
 explore these strengths in 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.640
 survival bring in the insurance 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.920
 because because they save us a lot 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.490
 transportation work around the world 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.290
 you already know that there are areas that are 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.790
 incredibly difficult to pass in the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.350
 lower world to the best there is no ground 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.330
 there's an incredible jump or there's 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.010
 many distances with the in the pp 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.990
 as you see around here we move 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.760
 much easier so if you have 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.070
 that explore strengths guys always 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.260
 come with me that I know five or six in the 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.520
 power at least it's worth so good 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:19.350
 guys, I hope this video has 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.180
 liked that you have seen a little bit everything 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.560
 and I leave the things 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.330
 a little clearer just leave 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.830
 online that helps too much for more 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.169
 videos and nothing I hope that soon we 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.350
 let's see in new videos a salutary and 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.080
 see you later 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.320
 If you want, you can make me a great 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.320
 favor 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.630
 a like and a favorite is for me is what 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:44.300
 best 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:48.830
 you will not regret this is your channel 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:54.030
 and this is with life and these with live 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:56.750
 the days with life and these gain line 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.750
 all right
