this<00:00:03.720> is<00:00:03.870> a<00:00:03.899> class-2<00:00:04.529> amalgam<00:00:04.980> restoration

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
this is a class-2 amalgam restoration

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.270 
this is a class-2 amalgam restoration
after<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.029> matrix<00:00:06.450> has<00:00:06.600> been<00:00:06.660> placed<00:00:10.280> so

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
after the matrix has been placed so

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.240 
after the matrix has been placed so
first<00:00:11.519> here<00:00:11.759> you<00:00:11.910> see<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.389> first<00:00:12.599> increment

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
first here you see the first increment

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.620 
first here you see the first increment

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.859 
placed into both gingival boxes proximal
boxes<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.730> little<00:00:20.939> bit<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.119> amalgam<00:00:21.630> is

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
boxes just a little bit of amalgam is

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.140 
boxes just a little bit of amalgam is
all<00:00:22.140> you<00:00:22.289> need<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.830> want<00:00:23.100> about<00:00:23.640> 8<00:00:23.789> to<00:00:23.970> 10

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
all you need and you want about 8 to 10

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.540 
all you need and you want about 8 to 10
pounds<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.720> pressure<00:00:25.279> against<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.340> ad

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
pounds of pressure against the ad

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.080 
pounds of pressure against the ad
gingival<00:00:27.180> floor<00:00:27.480> first<00:00:27.949> and<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.730> see<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
gingival floor first and you can see the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.380 
gingival floor first and you can see the
condenser<00:00:30.630> Anglin<00:00:31.349> into<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.980> line<00:00:32.910> angles

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
condenser Anglin into the line angles

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.880 
condenser Anglin into the line angles
and<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.690> gingival<00:00:34.110> floor<00:00:34.380> and<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.559> retentive

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
and the gingival floor and the retentive

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.369 
and the gingival floor and the retentive
point<00:00:35.820> angles<00:00:37.489> retentive<00:00:38.489> grooves<00:00:39.170> so<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
point angles retentive grooves so the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.690 
point angles retentive grooves so the
smaller<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> increment<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> better<00:00:41.460> because

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
smaller the increment the better because

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.130 
smaller the increment the better because
you<00:00:41.760> can<00:00:41.940> see<00:00:42.149> better<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.600> then<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:42.960> can

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
you can see better and then you can

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.069 
you can see better and then you can
follow<00:00:43.410> with<00:00:43.649> subsequent<00:00:44.280> increments

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
follow with subsequent increments

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:47.690 
follow with subsequent increments
smaller<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.230> better<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.739> small<00:00:47.100> condenser

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
smaller the better and small condenser

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.100 
smaller the better and small condenser
so<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:48.030> can<00:00:48.180> take<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.390> lot<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.629> pressure

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
so you can take a lot of pressure

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.420 
so you can take a lot of pressure
straight<00:00:50.010> down<00:00:50.280> gingerly<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:52.430> adapting

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
straight down gingerly and then adapting

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.279 
straight down gingerly and then adapting
the<00:00:53.520> condenser<00:00:54.059> against<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> matrix<00:00:54.870> pan<00:00:55.110> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
the condenser against the matrix pan and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.210 
the condenser against the matrix pan and
into<00:00:55.379> entry<00:00:55.860> ten<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.219> point<00:00:56.520> angles

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.700 

and<00:01:01.340> then<00:01:01.940> with<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.510> next<00:01:02.810> couple<00:01:03.140> increments

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
and then with the next couple increments

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.310 
and then with the next couple increments
you<00:01:03.920> can<00:01:04.070> see<00:01:04.280> that<00:01:04.519> more<00:01:05.269> amalgam<00:01:05.810> more<00:01:06.050> mass

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
you can see that more amalgam more mass

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.469 
you can see that more amalgam more mass
as<00:01:06.650> being<00:01:06.970> dispersed<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.210> then<00:01:08.330> the

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
as being dispersed and then the

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.040 
as being dispersed and then the
condenser<00:01:08.990> gets<00:01:09.140> a<00:01:09.200> little<00:01:09.410> larger<00:01:09.860> to

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
condenser gets a little larger to

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
condenser gets a little larger to
continue<00:01:12.050> along<00:01:12.290> with<00:01:12.350> belize's<00:01:13.220> yes<00:01:13.430> 29<00:01:13.880> mo<00:01:14.180> D

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
continue along with belize's yes 29 mo D

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.370 
continue along with belize's yes 29 mo D
so<00:01:16.070> you<00:01:16.100> can<00:01:16.340> continue<00:01:16.729> condensing<00:01:17.630> along<00:01:17.960> the

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380 
so you can continue condensing along the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.200 
so you can continue condensing along the
line<00:01:18.590> angles<00:01:19.010> and<00:01:19.160> point<00:01:19.369> angles<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.060> you're

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
line angles and point angles and you're

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.660 
line angles and point angles and you're
just<00:01:20.420> trying<00:01:20.810> to<00:01:21.050> make<00:01:21.770> the<00:01:21.950> amalgam<00:01:22.840> all<00:01:24.670> gel

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
just trying to make the amalgam all gel

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:26.910 
just trying to make the amalgam all gel
together<00:01:26.030> if<00:01:26.240> you<00:01:26.420> will

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
together if you will

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.440 
together if you will
largest<00:01:27.920> condenser<00:01:28.550> here<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.090> you<00:01:29.150> can<00:01:29.300> see

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
largest condenser here and you can see

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.999 
largest condenser here and you can see
that<00:01:29.540> this<00:01:29.690> is<00:01:29.869> just<00:01:30.050> adapting<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.650> final

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
that this is just adapting the final

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.100 
that this is just adapting the final

would<00:02:07.640> be<00:02:07.849> and<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.240> push<00:02:08.479> down<00:02:08.780> now<00:02:09.590> here<00:02:09.800> it's

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
would be and to push down now here it's

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.230 
would be and to push down now here it's
actually<00:02:10.220> being<00:02:10.340> used<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.729> little<00:02:10.880> bit<00:02:10.970> too

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
actually being used a little bit too

actually being used a little bit too
much<00:02:11.420> back<00:02:11.690> and<00:02:11.720> forth<00:02:12.130> ideally<00:02:13.130> it<00:02:13.250> will<00:02:13.340> be

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
much back and forth ideally it will be

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.210 
much back and forth ideally it will be
used<00:02:13.819> once<00:02:14.240> pushed<00:02:14.780> down<00:02:15.110> with<00:02:15.950> enough

the<00:02:18.560> design<00:02:19.130> of<00:02:19.250> this<00:02:19.340> instrument<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.970> that

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
the design of this instrument is that

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.850 
the design of this instrument is that
you<00:02:20.209> push<00:02:20.450> in<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.810> consistency<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.530> amalgam

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
you push in the consistency the amalgam

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.430 
you push in the consistency the amalgam
is<00:02:22.010> such<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.849> you<00:02:22.970> would<00:02:23.090> push<00:02:23.450> and<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:24.349> would

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
is such that you would push and it would

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.020 
is such that you would push and it would
really<00:02:24.650> give<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.040> inclined<00:02:25.430> planes<00:02:25.790> in

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
really give you the inclined planes in

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.730 
really give you the inclined planes in
anatomy<00:02:26.569> that<00:02:26.900> you<00:02:27.020> need<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.440> then<00:02:27.530> from<00:02:27.709> here

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
anatomy that you need and then from here

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.220 
anatomy that you need and then from here
it's<00:02:28.069> just<00:02:28.280> clean<00:02:28.550> up<00:02:28.580> this<00:02:29.480> is<00:02:29.660> a<00:02:29.690> critical

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
it's just clean up this is a critical

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.809 
it's just clean up this is a critical
part<00:02:30.410> of<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.650> amalgam<00:02:31.069> here<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.640> make<00:02:31.790> sure

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
part of the amalgam here to make sure

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.970 
part of the amalgam here to make sure
that<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.270> don't<00:02:32.540> do<00:02:32.780> this<00:02:32.959> too<00:02:33.260> forcefully

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
that you don't do this too forcefully

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.580 
that you don't do this too forcefully
probably<00:02:34.849> when<00:02:34.970> you're<00:02:35.120> new<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:35.810> better<00:02:35.989> idea

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
probably when you're new the better idea

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.490 
probably when you're new the better idea
would<00:02:36.800> be<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:37.250> take<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.819> from<00:02:38.360> matrix<00:02:38.810> pan<00:02:39.290> from

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
would be to take it from matrix pan from

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.860 
would be to take it from matrix pan from
tooth<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.220> midline<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.750> know

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
tooth to the midline of the you know

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.150 
tooth to the midline of the you know
marginal<00:02:42.349> Ridge<00:02:42.470> and<00:02:42.709> then<00:02:42.800> from<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.130> other

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
marginal Ridge and then from the other

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.300 
marginal Ridge and then from the other
side<00:02:43.520> just<00:02:43.550> so<00:02:43.910> you<00:02:44.000> don't<00:02:44.739> risk<00:02:45.739> ditching

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
side just so you don't risk ditching

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.460 
side just so you don't risk ditching
that<00:02:46.340> margin<00:02:46.910> that's<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:47.239> big<00:02:47.720> mistake<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.170> a

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
that margin that's a big mistake that a

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.860 
that margin that's a big mistake that a
lot<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.709> new<00:02:48.950> students<00:02:49.430> do<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:50.390> then<00:02:50.540> the<00:02:50.599> next

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
lot of new students do and then the next

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.970 
lot of new students do and then the next
time<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.170> swipe<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.590> you're<00:02:51.800> kind<00:02:51.950> of

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
time you swipe this you're kind of

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.920 
time you swipe this you're kind of
angling<00:02:52.459> at<00:02:52.610> about<00:02:52.790> 30<00:02:53.060> degrees<00:02:53.239> toward<00:02:53.840> the

angling at about 30 degrees toward the
occlusal<00:02:54.380> surface<00:02:54.830> that<00:02:55.010> you<00:02:55.160> can<00:02:55.370> get<00:02:55.489> some

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
occlusal surface that you can get some

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.220 
occlusal surface that you can get some
rounding<00:02:57.620> of<00:02:57.739> your<00:02:57.860> marginal<00:02:58.310> Ridge<00:02:59.080> and<00:03:00.080> of

rounding of your marginal Ridge and of

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.479 
rounding of your marginal Ridge and of
course<00:03:00.500> you're<00:03:00.650> suctioning<00:03:01.099> to<00:03:01.190> get<00:03:01.310> rid<00:03:01.430> of

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
course you're suctioning to get rid of

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:09.380 
course you're suctioning to get rid of
any<00:03:01.670> excess<00:03:02.800> amalgam<00:03:03.800> so<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.040> can<00:03:04.310> see<00:03:05.090> better

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.310 

then<00:03:10.390> depending<00:03:10.540> on<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.960> set<00:03:11.140> of<00:03:11.230> your

then depending on the set of your

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.740 
then depending on the set of your
amalgams<00:03:11.710> some<00:03:11.920> people<00:03:12.190> do<00:03:12.370> some<00:03:12.750> bulk

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
amalgams some people do some bulk

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.390 
amalgams some people do some bulk
carving<00:03:14.290> here<00:03:14.590> or<00:03:14.800> remove<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.220> band

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
carving here or remove the band

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.800 
carving here or remove the band
depending<00:03:15.880> on<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.060> consistency<00:03:16.390> of<00:03:16.720> the

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
depending on the consistency of the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.340 
depending on the consistency of the
amalgam<00:03:17.290> but<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.220> definitely<00:03:18.430> want<00:03:18.730> to<00:03:19.350> don't

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
amalgam but you definitely want to don't

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.720 
amalgam but you definitely want to don't
worry<00:03:20.440> about<00:03:20.620> Anatomy<00:03:21.100> at<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:21.340> point<00:03:21.610> the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
worry about Anatomy at this point the

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.940 
worry about Anatomy at this point the
most<00:03:21.850> important<00:03:22.360> part<00:03:22.660> is<00:03:23.200> taking<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.740> band

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
most important part is taking the band

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.350 
most important part is taking the band
off<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.550> getting<00:03:24.820> to<00:03:24.940> the<00:03:25.030> interproximal

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
off and getting to the interproximal

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.380 
off and getting to the interproximal
surface<00:03:26.110> with<00:03:26.350> a<00:03:26.850> scalar<00:03:27.850> or<00:03:28.770> an<00:03:29.770> explorer<00:03:30.390> so

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
surface with a scalar or an explorer so

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:32.730 
surface with a scalar or an explorer so
you<00:03:31.450> can<00:03:31.570> hear<00:03:31.780> it<00:03:31.870> see<00:03:32.080> a<00:03:32.110> disc<00:03:32.410> with<00:03:32.590> this

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
you can hear it see a disc with this

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.320 
you can hear it see a disc with this
probably<00:03:33.070> isn't<00:03:33.220> ready<00:03:33.550> to<00:03:33.640> be<00:03:33.760> removed<00:03:33.970> yet

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
probably isn't ready to be removed yet

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.880 
probably isn't ready to be removed yet
so<00:03:34.420> we<00:03:34.480> can<00:03:34.600> do<00:03:34.690> some<00:03:34.900> bulk<00:03:35.140> carving<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.740> we

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
so we can do some bulk carving that we

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.400 
so we can do some bulk carving that we
can<00:03:36.130> ensure<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.360> cave<00:03:37.540> of<00:03:37.720> surface<00:03:38.080> has<00:03:38.260> no

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
can ensure the cave of surface has no

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:46.080 
can ensure the cave of surface has no
flesh<00:03:42.330> not<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:44.459> Vladimir's<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.580> place<00:03:45.850> because

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
flesh not a Vladimir's a place because

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.000 
flesh not a Vladimir's a place because
we<00:03:46.330> place<00:03:46.570> already<00:03:46.810> of<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:46.990> 21b<00:03:47.440> so<00:03:47.860> we're

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
we place already of the 21b so we're

00:03:48.010 --> 00:04:02.900 
we place already of the 21b so we're
just<00:03:48.040> really<00:03:48.550> getting<00:03:49.300> rid<00:03:49.390> of<00:03:49.510> any<00:03:49.630> excess

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.900 

and<00:04:03.390> then<00:04:04.230> just<00:04:04.530> like<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.710> matrix<00:04:05.010> went<00:04:05.430> on<00:04:05.580> it

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
and then just like the matrix went on it

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.730 
and then just like the matrix went on it
comes<00:04:06.210> off<00:04:06.420> and<00:04:06.630> reversed<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.230> wages<00:04:07.560> come

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
comes off and reversed the wages come

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.530 
comes off and reversed the wages come
out<00:04:07.920> first

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.140 

not<00:04:12.540> easily<00:04:12.750> here<00:04:13.400> but<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.490> wedges<00:04:14.790> come<00:04:14.970> out

first<00:04:17.300> the<00:04:18.300> matrix<00:04:18.720> band<00:04:18.959> is<00:04:19.200> released<00:04:19.530> from

first the matrix band is released from

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.620 
first the matrix band is released from
the<00:04:19.860> retainer<00:04:20.280> and<00:04:23.060> I<00:04:24.060> usually<00:04:24.360> hold<00:04:24.570> my

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
the retainer and I usually hold my

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.100 
the retainer and I usually hold my
finger<00:04:25.050> over<00:04:25.400> the<00:04:26.400> whole<00:04:26.580> band<00:04:26.820> and<00:04:27.390> some

finger over the whole band and some

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.920 
finger over the whole band and some
people<00:04:28.380> like<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.590> just<00:04:29.100> for<00:04:29.970> psychological

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
people like to just for psychological

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.510 
people like to just for psychological
safety<00:04:31.110> reasons<00:04:31.680> I<00:04:31.770> guess<00:04:31.830> like<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.370> put<00:04:32.490> a

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
safety reasons I guess like to put a

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.190 
safety reasons I guess like to put a
condenser<00:04:33.090> on<00:04:33.210> the<00:04:33.360> marginal<00:04:33.750> Ridge<00:04:33.900> that

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
condenser on the marginal Ridge that

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.870 
condenser on the marginal Ridge that
they're<00:04:34.460> pulling<00:04:35.460> the<00:04:35.670> band<00:04:35.820> off<00:04:37.700> if<00:04:38.700> it's

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
they're pulling the band off if it's

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.980 
they're pulling the band off if it's
going<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.120> break<00:04:39.240> it's<00:04:39.420> going<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:39.660> break<00:04:39.780> the

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
going to break it's going to break the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.210 
going to break it's going to break the
condensers<00:04:40.470> not<00:04:40.590> going<00:04:40.710> to<00:04:40.770> really<00:04:40.890> help<00:04:41.100> you

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
condensers not going to really help you

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.650 
condensers not going to really help you
there<00:04:41.370> but<00:04:41.550> I<00:04:41.760> think<00:04:42.030> some<00:04:42.180> people<00:04:42.390> just<00:04:42.480> feel

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
there but I think some people just feel

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.930 
there but I think some people just feel
safer<00:04:42.870> and<00:04:43.430> depending<00:04:44.430> on<00:04:44.490> how<00:04:44.640> much<00:04:44.760> you

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
safer and depending on how much you

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.400 
safer and depending on how much you
cleaned<00:04:45.210> up<00:04:45.390> here<00:04:45.720> is<00:04:45.870> what<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.080> have<00:04:46.200> to<00:04:46.290> do

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
cleaned up here is what you have to do

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.260 
cleaned up here is what you have to do
but<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.680> first<00:04:46.890> place<00:04:47.160> to<00:04:47.340> go<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.460> not<00:04:47.940> the

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
but the first place to go is not the

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.420 
but the first place to go is not the
occlusal<00:04:48.750> Anatomy<00:04:48.780> which<00:04:49.320> ye<00:04:49.860> rolled<00:04:50.070> into

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
occlusal Anatomy which ye rolled into

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.630 
occlusal Anatomy which ye rolled into
making<00:04:51.180> look<00:04:51.390> pretty<00:04:51.630> but<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.900> interproximal

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
making look pretty but the interproximal

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.460 
making look pretty but the interproximal
areas<00:04:53.640> to<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.180> genital<00:04:54.570> areas<00:04:54.870> first<00:04:55.110> to<00:04:55.290> see

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470

areas to the genital areas first to see
that<00:04:55.620> there's<00:04:55.800> no<00:04:55.950> overhang<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:57.060> you<00:04:57.300> can<00:04:57.420> see

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
that there's no overhang and you can see

that there's no overhang and you can see
that<00:04:57.690> you<00:04:57.750> can<00:04:57.900> use<00:04:58.020> an<00:04:58.140> amalgam<00:04:58.530> and<00:04:58.950> explore

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
that you can use an amalgam and explore

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.830 
that you can use an amalgam and explore
if<00:04:59.610> it's<00:04:59.730> soft<00:04:59.970> enough<00:05:00.120> to<00:05:00.450> just<00:05:00.600> sort<00:05:00.750> of
