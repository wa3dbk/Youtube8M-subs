so let's look around for some the legs I
don't<00:04:24.090> seem<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.750> have<00:04:24.900> any<00:04:25.080> regular<00:04:25.590> white

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
don't seem to have any regular white

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.190 
don't seem to have any regular white
ones<00:04:26.100> just<00:04:26.460> these<00:04:26.640> ones<00:04:27.050> available<00:04:28.050> at<00:04:28.110> the

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
ones just these ones available at the

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.530 
ones just these ones available at the
moment<00:04:29.600> so<00:04:30.600> let's<00:04:30.810> just<00:04:31.020> do<00:04:31.260> on<00:04:31.530> these<00:04:31.920> legs

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540 
moment so let's just do on these legs

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.300 
moment so let's just do on these legs
okay<00:04:33.540> let's<00:04:33.720> put<00:04:33.960> those<00:04:34.140> on<00:04:34.890> there<00:04:35.420> so<00:04:37.310> let's

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
okay let's put those on there so let's

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.330 
okay let's put those on there so let's
zoom<00:04:38.490> in<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:39.060> little<00:04:39.800> okay<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:40.830> we<00:04:41.100> got<00:04:41.220> our

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
zoom in a little okay so we got our

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.380 
zoom in a little okay so we got our
figure<00:04:41.670> here<00:04:42.980> start<00:04:43.980> assembling<00:04:44.460> it<00:04:44.700> let's<00:04:45.210> go

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
figure here start assembling it let's go

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.450 
figure here start assembling it let's go
put<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.780> backpack<00:04:46.020> on<00:04:46.470> so<00:04:46.680> we'll<00:04:46.800> take<00:04:47.100> these

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
put the backpack on so we'll take these

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.980 
put the backpack on so we'll take these
parts<00:04:48.030> off<00:04:48.410> slip<00:04:49.410> that<00:04:49.590> backpack<00:04:49.890> round<00:04:50.990> put

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
parts off slip that backpack round put

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.250 
parts off slip that backpack round put
the<00:04:52.230> head<00:04:52.410> back<00:04:52.440> on<00:04:52.890> and<00:04:53.660> dipper<00:04:54.660> comes<00:04:54.870> on<00:04:55.050> in

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
the head back on and dipper comes on in

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.740 
the head back on and dipper comes on in
allow<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:55.770> if<00:04:56.160> you<00:04:56.460> didn't<00:04:56.760> know<00:04:56.850> your<00:04:57.390> arm<00:04:57.600> so

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
allow you if you didn't know your arm so

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.350 
allow you if you didn't know your arm so
much<00:04:57.930> just<00:04:58.350> barely<00:04:58.680> fits<00:04:59.100> on<00:04:59.340> with<00:05:00.180> the

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
much just barely fits on with the

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.060 
much just barely fits on with the
backpack<00:05:00.870> so<00:05:01.400> that's<00:05:02.400> nice<00:05:03.080> but<00:05:04.080> actually<00:05:04.860> let

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
backpack so that's nice but actually let

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.700 
backpack so that's nice but actually let
me<00:05:05.190> do<00:05:05.730> a<00:05:05.760> little<00:05:05.940> quick<00:05:06.300> comparison<00:05:07.020> here<00:05:07.230> if

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
me do a little quick comparison here if

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.910 
me do a little quick comparison here if
it<00:05:08.190> actually<00:05:08.730> does<00:05:11.000> run<00:05:12.000> in<00:05:12.150> or<00:05:12.360> bump<00:05:12.720> I<00:05:13.110> think

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:13.920 
it actually does run in or bump I think

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.190 
it actually does run in or bump I think
it<00:05:14.040> might<00:05:14.370> just<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.700> tad<00:05:15.000> but<00:05:15.270> that<00:05:15.840> doesn't

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
it might just a tad but that doesn't

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.240 
it might just a tad but that doesn't
really<00:05:16.350> matter<00:05:16.620> so<00:05:18.530> so<00:05:19.530> we<00:05:19.650> got<00:05:19.800> our<00:05:19.920> figure

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
really matter so so we got our figure

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.810 
really matter so so we got our figure
here<00:05:20.520> so<00:05:20.730> far<00:05:21.260> so<00:05:22.260> now<00:05:22.440> let's<00:05:22.670> assemble<00:05:23.670> the

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 
here so far so now let's assemble the

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.860 
here so far so now let's assemble the
weapon<00:05:24.030> so<00:05:24.510> let's<00:05:24.750> take<00:05:24.930> our<00:05:25.050> mg42<00:05:25.680> on

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
weapon so let's take our mg42 on

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:31.310 
weapon so let's take our mg42 on
magazines<00:05:27.870> always<00:05:28.320> go<00:05:28.590> on<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:30.110> normally<00:05:31.110> they

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
magazines always go on the normally they

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.480 
magazines always go on the normally they
go<00:05:31.470> on<00:05:31.620> the<00:05:31.800> left<00:05:32.780> because<00:05:33.780> most<00:05:34.200> guns<00:05:34.500> are<00:05:34.740> for

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
go on the left because most guns are for

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.200 
go on the left because most guns are for
right-handed<00:05:36.240> people<00:05:36.710> so<00:05:37.710> the<00:05:38.190> magazine<00:05:39.180> goes

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
right-handed people so the magazine goes

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.090 
right-handed people so the magazine goes
on<00:05:39.570> the<00:05:39.660> left<00:05:39.840> just<00:05:40.320> put<00:05:40.560> our<00:05:40.680> bipod<00:05:41.250> on<00:05:43.100> put

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
on the left just put our bipod on put

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.610 
on the left just put our bipod on put
that<00:05:44.310> on<00:05:44.520> so<00:05:45.420> there<00:05:45.690> we<00:05:46.050> have<00:05:46.230> it

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
that on so there we have it

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.710 
that on so there we have it
we<00:05:46.860> have<00:05:47.040> our<00:05:47.250> own<00:05:47.430> custom<00:05:48.120> German<00:05:48.930> in

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
we have our own custom German in

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.680 
we have our own custom German in
snow<00:05:50.110> uniform<00:05:50.650> so<00:05:51.310> this<00:05:51.670> is<00:05:51.850> a<00:05:52.120> really<00:05:52.570> easy

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
snow uniform so this is a really easy

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.590 
snow uniform so this is a really easy
technique<00:05:53.380> just<00:05:53.650> to<00:05:53.800> kind<00:05:54.520> of<00:05:54.610> sit<00:05:55.030> down<00:05:55.240> go

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 
technique just to kind of sit down go

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.500 
technique just to kind of sit down go
through<00:05:55.870> your<00:05:56.050> parts<00:05:56.620> just<00:05:56.920> kind<00:05:57.130> of<00:05:57.220> do<00:05:58.120> trial

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:58.510 
through your parts just kind of do trial

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:59.940 
through your parts just kind of do trial
and<00:05:58.750> error<00:05:58.930> just<00:05:59.110> see<00:05:59.470> what<00:05:59.620> you<00:05:59.710> like<00:05:59.890> and

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
and error just see what you like and

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.890 
and error just see what you like and
just<00:06:00.520> figure<00:06:00.850> out<00:06:00.910> what<00:06:01.060> you<00:06:01.120> like<00:06:01.210> and<00:06:01.720> I

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900

think this turned out pretty good so on
you<00:06:04.270> might<00:06:04.450> even<00:06:04.600> see<00:06:04.870> this<00:06:04.990> in<00:06:05.050> a<00:06:05.200> mock<00:06:05.440> so

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
you might even see this in a mock so
